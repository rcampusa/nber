                                         ABSTRACT

In this paper, we review the most prominent provision of the federal income tax code that targets
low-income tax filers, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), as well as the structurally similar
Child Tax Credit (CTC). We frame the paper around what we see as the programs’ goals:
distributional, promoting work, and limiting administrative and compliance costs. We review
what is known about program impacts and distributional consequences under current law,
drawing on simulations from the Tax Policy Center. We conclude that the EITC is quite
successful in meeting its three goals. In contrast, most of the benefits of the CTC go to higher
income households. In addition to analyzing current law, we assess possible reforms that would
reach groups – for the EITC, those without children; for the CTC, those with very low earnings –
who are largely missed under current policy.

I.      INTRODUCTION


        The tax code focuses on high-income families because that is where the money is. The

bottom 40% of tax filing units – those with incomes below $39,370 – earned just 14% of pre-tax

income in 2013 (Tax Policy Center 2013). Under any even slightly progressive tax schedule this

group would contribute very little revenue.

        But the tax code is used to pursue purposes and objectives other than revenue collection.

Today, the two most prominent provisions of the federal income tax code that target low-income

tax filers, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the less prominent but similar Child Tax

Credit (CTC), are explicitly redistributive, designed to transfer money to families rather than tax

it away from them.

        The EITC is a tax credit available to lower-income families with positive earned income.

Importantly, it is refundable: Many recipients’ incomes are too low to generate substantial tax

obligations, so with the EITC their liabilities are negative and they receive refund checks from

the Internal Revenue Service. In 2013, 87 percent of the total tax expenditure of the EITC took

the form of tax refunds (Internal Review Service 2015a).

        Since its introduction in 1975, the EITC has grown to become a central element of the

U.S. social safety net (Bitler, Hoynes and Kuka 2016). In 2013, the EITC reached 28.8 million

tax filers at a total cost of $68 billion. Almost 20 percent of all tax filers and 44 percent of filers

with children receive the credit. The maximum credit in 2015 is $6,242 for families with three

children, $5,548 for those with two children, $3,359 for those with one child, and $503 for those

without children – this can be as much as 45% of a family’s pre-tax income. Overall, the average

credit amount for families with children is a substantial $3,063 (Internal Review Service 2015a).

The program dwarfs traditional cash welfare (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or



                                                   1
TANF), which reached only 1.6 million families in 2013, an almost 70 percent decline since

1994.

        The CTC is more recent, introduced in 1997. It is structurally similar to the EITC, but

more universal in design and less targeted on lower-income families. In 2015, it is available to

families with incomes as high as $150,000 for married couples ($115,000 for singles), with the

maximum credit available at incomes as high as $110,000 for married couples ($75,000 for

singles). The CTC is not inflation adjusted, so these parameters are generally fixed in nominal

terms from one year to the next; the nominal maximum credit has been unchanged at $1,000 per

child since 2003. Although this is much smaller than the maximum EITC, the CTC’s broader

reach across the income distribution means that total expenditures are comparable ($56 billion

for the CTC vs. $68 billion for the EITC in 2013).

        The CTC, unlike the EITC, is not fully refundable. This has limited its value to low-

income families. But in 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act greatly expanded

the refundability of the CTC, making the schedule similar to the EITC’s. This expansion was

originally a temporary one, but has recently been made permanent.

        In this paper, we review the roles of the EITC and CTC, what is known about their

impacts and distributional consequences, and the possibilities for reform. We begin in Section II

by discussing the goals of the programs and in Section III we review their structure and history.

Section IV discusses the economics of in-work tax credits like the EITC and CTC. Section V

evaluates what we know about how the programs affect these objectives. In Section VI we

discuss possible reforms that might help further the program goals set out in Section II. In

Section VII we conclude.

II.    FRAMING: WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THESE TAX PROVISIONS?


       The EITC and CTC are best seen not as taxes but as transfer programs that happen to be

administered through the tax code. As we see it, they have three primary goals. First, all means-

tested transfer programs are designed in part to achieve distributional objectives. In the case of

the EITC, these are to transfer funds to low- and moderate-income families, and particularly to

those with children. The CTC’s distributional aims are less clear, given its high phase-out point –

the target is clearly the broad middle class rather than just the lowest-income families. It may be

better thought of as a “universal child benefit,” aimed at horizontal equity between families with

and without children. Differing schedules by family type are a long-standing feature of the U.S.

tax system, and distinguishing by the number of children may make sense if, for example, the

marginal utility of consumption declines more slowly the larger is the family.2

       The two other main goals are what distinguish the EITC and CTC from other transfer

programs. Each aims to encourage work (though as we discuss below this is not true for all

families) and to limit the high administrative costs associated with other transfer programs that

require very labor-intensive eligibility screening.

       The EITC is quite successful at all three goals. Almost three-quarters its benefits go to

families with annual incomes below $25,000, roughly the 24th percentile of the income

distribution (Internal Review Service 2015a; DeNavas et al. 2015), and EITC payments lift

millions of families out of poverty each year. The evidence indicates that the program has

substantially raised the labor force participation rates of single mothers, by perhaps five to eight




2
  The dependent exemption would seem to be able to accomplish this, without need for the CTC. Like the
CTC, the dependent exemption phases out as income rises. The primary differences between the two are
that the CTC is (partially) refundable and that it distinguishes between children and other dependents.


                                                  3
percentage points (though there is also evidence of smaller negative effects on married women’s

participation and on the intensive margin). Finally, the tax system has many administrative

advantages over a welfare bureaucracy, and has proved to be an efficient means of distributing

the EITC. As we discuss below, however, there are nontrivial rates of noncompliance with the

EITC, particularly on dimensions that are not well tracked by existing third party reporting).3

        The CTC is much less studied. It performs much less well at transferring income to the

neediest families, and is likely less effective at encouraging work as well. But like the EITC it is

quite inexpensive to administer, and its redistribution to the middle and upper middle parts of the

income distribution is apparently also valued by policymakers.

        Nevertheless, although these provisions generally do a good job of meeting their

objectives, neither is perfect. In Section IV we discuss some options for reforming the programs

that might be considered.



III.    CURRENT POLICIES AND RECENT REFORMS


        To be eligible for the EITC, a taxpayer – or tax filing unit – must have earned income

during the tax year.4 The value of the credit is determined by a benefit schedule with three

regions, known as the “phase-in,” “flat” (or “plateau”), and “phase-out.” In the phase-in region,

the credit increases by a share of each additional dollar earned. Once the credit reaches its


3
  There are also drawbacks to tax-based administration, however. Two are that tax refunds are generally
paid only once a year and relatively easily captured by for-profit firms via fees for tax preparation or high
interest rates on tax refund anticipation loans. The now-defunct Advance EITC program allowed for more
gradual payment, but take-up was extremely low (even in experiments designed to target information and
default effects; see IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury 1999; Jones 2010; U.S. Government
Accountability Office 2007). Recent reforms have dramatically reduced the prevalence of tax refund
anticipation loans
4
  Earned income is the sum of wages, tips, salary, union strike benefits, some disability payments, and net
self-employment earnings (IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury 2013).


                                                     4
maximum value, the taxpayer is in the second, “flat” region, where additional earnings do not

affect the credit value. In the final region, the credit declines with each additional dollar of

earnings (or, adjusted gross income, or AGI, if that is higher) until it is zero.

        The exact parameters of the schedule vary by filing status and by the number of

qualifying children, but the basic shape is the same. Figure 1 displays the schedule in 2015 as a

function of earned income for single taxpayers with no, one, two, and three or more children.

The Figure makes clear that the credit for families with children is much different than that for

childless families, and we start with the former. The phase-in or subsidy rate is substantial at 34

(or 40 or 45) percent for those with one (or two or three) children, while the phase-out rate is

much lower, at 15.98 (21.06) percent for those with one (two or more) children. Maximum

benefits range from $3,359 for families with one child to $6,242 for those with three or more.

Single taxpayers with incomes above $39,131 (with one child), $44,454 (with two children), or

$47,747 (with three or more children) are ineligible for the credit.5 The credit for families

without children is much less generous, with phase-in rate of 7.65, a maximum credit of $503

and a maximum allowable income of $14,820.

        Importantly, the EITC is refundable: if the credit exceeds a taxpayer’s tax liability, he or

she receives the difference as a refund. Typically, families with earnings below $20,000-$25,000

will owe very little income tax, so the bulk of the EITC will arrive as a refund even when

withholding is zero.6




5
  Unmarried taxpayers with dependents are termed head of household filers. In this paper, we typically
refer to this group as “single filers with children” or “single parents with children.”
6
  For example, a single parent with two children enters the first bracket (with a 10 percent marginal tax
rate) at gross earnings of $22,000.


                                                   5
        As elsewhere in the tax code, there are many complexities and special cases, not all

illustrated in Figure 1. Married couples, for example, have slightly different schedules – with

longer “plateau” segments and higher phase-out points – than do single filers with the same

number of children (as illustrated by the dotted lines in the figure). Defining qualifying children

is also difficult, and qualification for the EITC differs from that for the dependent exemption.7

Finally, the schedule is slightly more complex for families with unearned income. When

earnings place the family in the plateau or phase-out ranges and adjusted gross income (including

unearned income) exceeds earned income, the credit is based on the latter.

        The current EITC schedule reflects substantial growth over time. Figure 2 shows how the

maximum credit has evolved for families of different sizes. After the program’s introduction in

1975, inflation gradually eroded the real maximum benefit. The 1987 expansion of the EITC,

passed as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, increased the generosity of the credit and indexed

the credit schedule to inflation. The most prominent change was the 1993 expansion, enacted as

one of President Bill Clinton’s signature initiatives – it introduced a credit for families without

children for the first time, and greatly increased the credit for families with two or more children.

Elsewhere in the figure, one can see smaller expansions in the early 1990s, as well as the

introduction of a separate three-child schedule in 2009. This last change was part of the 2009

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and was originally set to expire at the end of

2010, but has since been extended through 2017. Table 1 shows the specific credit parameters for

selected years.




7
  A qualifying child for the EITC is younger than 19 (or younger than 24 and a full time student), lives
with the taxpayer for more than half the year, has a valid social security number, and is not claimed as a
dependent by another taxpayer (IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury 2013). In some circumstances,
a grandchild can qualify.


                                                    6
        The Child Tax Credit (CTC) has a similar form to the EITC, with a phase-in, flat and

phase-out structure and a schedule that differs somewhat across family types.8 However, the

structure of the two programs is otherwise different. The CTC depends only on adjusted gross

income (AGI), not on earnings. The phase-in and phase-out rates are 15% and 5%, much smaller

in magnitude than the EITC. The maximum credit is $1,000 per qualifying child and unlike the

EITC the credit is fixed nominally and does not change each year with prices. Importantly, the

CTC schedule has an extremely large flat (plateau) range. For two-child tax units, it ranges from

$13,333 to $75,000 if single and to $110,000 if married. As a consequence, families with quite

high incomes can receive positive CTCs. For example, married couples with three children (who

face the most generous schedules) are ineligible for the EITC if their earnings exceed $53,267,

but can receive the CTC with incomes as high as $170,000. Table 2 shows specific CTC

parameters for different family types.

        Another major difference is that the CTC, unlike the EITC, is not fully refundable. The

refundable portion of the CTC is known as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and is

limited to 15% of earned income above a fixed threshold. This threshold was $11,500 (in

nominal dollars) in 2007, preventing most low income families from receiving meaningful

CTCs. But in 2009, ARRA reduced the threshold to $3,000 (again nominal). This allowed more

taxpayers to claim the Additional Child Tax Credit and increased the amount of refundable

credits, making the low-income portion of the schedule more similar to the EITC. Like the three-

child EITC provision of ARRA, the reduced CTC threshold was originally set to expire at the

end of 2010, but it was made permanent in late 2015.


8
 The relevant family type distinctions differ somewhat from the EITC: Only children 16 and under (at the
end of the tax year) qualify for the CTC, and it is available to married taxpayers who file separately (who
cannot receive the EITC).


                                                    7
        Figure 3 augments the EITC schedule for single (head-of-household) taxpayers with two

children, as illustrated in Figure 1, with additional areas representing the portions of the CTC

that are used to offset other taxes and refunded under the 2014 schedule.9 The figure also shows

(in an area labeled as “forfeited”) the portion of the credit that is forgone by very low income

families for whom the refundability limit is binding. This makes clear that the refundable portion

of the CTC serves in large part to expand the EITC, serving approximately the same income

range but increasing the benefit. By contrast, the portion of the CTC that offsets other tax

liabilities rises much higher in the income distribution, not even beginning to phase out until

income is double or more of the maximum value under the EITC.

        Figure 4 shows tax expenditures on the EITC and CTC over time, in real 2014 dollars

and including both tax refunds and foregone tax revenues. The EITC expanded from about $5

billion per year in the 1980s to nearly $50 billion in the mid-1990s, and has grown gradually

since then. EITC expenditures were just shy of $70 billion in 2013. The CTC was introduced in

1997, but has grown extremely rapidly since then – since 2003, its total cost has been

comparable to the EITC.

        An often-voiced concern about means-tested transfer programs is that they can create

high effective marginal tax rates (MTRs) as they phase out, and that the constellation of

overlapping programs can create an extremely complex budget constraint. Figure 5, taken from

Steuerle and Quakenbush (2015), shows the combined value of the EITC, the CTC, and other

tax- and universally-available benefit provisions affecting low-income families (the Child and

Dependent Care tax credit; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP; Medicaid;



9
  The calculations are for a family with no unearned income or itemized deductions that does not receive
the Child and Dependent Care Credit.


                                                   8
the Children’s Health Insurance Program, CHIP; and health insurance premium assistance under

the Affordable Care Act).10 We assume here that families participate in all of the available

programs, where in fact there is substantial non-participation in each. The tax provisions are at

the bottom, with transfers and health programs above them. Three things are of note here. First,

the cash value of Medicaid and SNAP benefits (formerly known as food stamps) is much larger

than that of the EITC for a family with income below $25,000 (though families may not value

health insurance at its full cost). Second, despite this, the overall trapezoid shape created by the

EITC schedule, with negative marginal tax rates (i.e., a positive slope in Figure 5) at low

incomes and positive marginal tax rates (a negative slope) at higher levels, shows through

despite all of the other programs that are layered on top of it. Third, the EITC serves a population

that is also targeted by other means-tested transfers, where the CTC serves a much higher-

income population that is unlikely to be receiving other transfers.

        Figure 6 provides another look at the interaction among programs. Here, we plot the net

effective marginal tax rate (EMTR), again assuming 100 percent take-up of the tax and transfer

programs. In the figure, the solid line shows the EMTR for all tax and benefit programs, the

dashed line shows the EMTR generated by federal income taxes (EITC, CTC, and the ordinary

income tax) and the dotted line shows the EMTR for the EITC and CTC alone. (This figure is

also taken from Steuerle and Quakenbush (2015) but we modify it by adding the third series.)

Again, we see that other programs shift the marginal tax rate schedule around, but that the basic




10
  The figure shows the programs in Colorado. It would be qualitatively similar in other states, but
Medicaid differs across states both in its value and in its reach into the income distribution (for states that
did not take up the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion).


                                                      9
pattern of negative, zero, then positive MTRs created by the EITC and CTC carries through to

the overall schedule.11

       The U.S. EITC has parallels in programs in place in many other developed countries

(OECD 2011). One that is often discussed is the United Kingdom’s Working Families Tax

Credit (WFTC; see, e.g., Blundell and Hoynes 2004). Like the EITC, it is available only to those

who work. A key design difference is that the WFTC does not have a phase-in negative marginal

tax rate; rather, it is available only to those who meet minimum weekly hours requirements.

       Enumerating the universe of EITC-like programs (often referred to as “In-Work Tax

Credits”) in other countries is difficult, as similar tax structures can appear quite different

depending on how the different portions are labeled. (Consider, for example, the “program”

consisting of the combination of payroll taxes, the EITC, and the TANF and food stamps benefit

phase-outs.) There is a great deal of heterogeneity in implementation (see Nichols and Rothstein

2015; OECD 2011), in part reflecting different weights placed on the three goals we outline

above. The OECD (2011) classifies programs into those that are more targeted (this group

includes the U.S., UK, France) and those that are more universal with low or no phase-out (this

group includes Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands). The U.S. program stands out as more

generous and as having one of the largest phase-in rates.




11
  The figure shows average MTRs over $5,000 income ranges, to smooth over spikes in MTRs when
taxes and benefits change discretely. This smoothing obscures the zero MTR in the plateau region of the
combined EITC and CTC schedule – the $15,000 to $20,000 range includes a portion of the phase-out
range as well.

IV.    THE ECONOMICS OF IN-WORK TAX CREDITS


       We discuss labor supply incentives under the EITC; those created by the CTC are

generally similar, though we discuss a few relevant differences below.

       The EITC generates labor supply incentives on the intensive and extensive margins that

differ depending on marital status.12 Among single parents, who represent 60 percent of EITC

filers and 74 percent of total EITC tax expenditures, the EITC increases the returns to entering

employment for those outside of the labor force, leading to an increase in labor supply on the

extensive margin. The phase-in marginal tax rates are large in magnitude, currently -34 percent

for those with one child, -40 percent for those with two children and -45 percent for those with

three or more children. This leads to sizable increases in the first-hour net-of-tax wage (though a

small portion of this is offset by other taxes, most notably payroll taxes, and by phase-outs in

other transfer program schedules), and thus to large incentives to enter work. Even for those

whose potential earnings are beyond the phase-in, the EITC increases the net-of-tax wage for

entering work so long as potential earnings are below the end of the phase-out range. Figure 7

illustrates the canonical budget constraint and income-leisure tradeoff under the EITC.

       The effects of the EITC on the intensive margin, for those already in the labor market, are

less unambiguously work-promoting. In the phase-in region, the EITC increases the net-of-tax

wage; the effect on the intensive margin is ambiguous due to a positive substitution effect and a

negative income effect. On the other hand, in the phase-out region, both substitution and income

effects create a consistent incentive to reduce labor supply, while in the flat region the

substitution effect is zero but the pure income effect also is predicted to reduce labor supply.


12
  This discussion draws from our prior work including Eissa and Hoynes (2006a), Hoynes and Patel
(2015) and Nichols and Rothstein (2015).


                                                 11
       Because the EITC is based on family income, the credit leads to a somewhat different set

of incentives for married taxpayers. Overall, as with singles, we would expect higher rates of

“family” employment (participation by at least one family member) for married couples, as a

result of the credit being tied to work. But individual participation incentives can be more

complex, particularly for secondary earners. Consider a sequential labor supply decision, where

one spouse chooses his/her labor supply (non-strategically) before the other. The primary earner

faces the same labor supply incentives as does a single filer, discussed above. However, suppose

the primary earner earns enough to take the family into the phase-out range on his/her own. In

this case the second mover can only reduce the family’s credit by working, and the EITC thus

reduces net returns to labor market participation. Importantly, though, the effective positive tax

rate here is smaller in magnitude than the negative rate faced by single parents: It can never be

bigger than the EITC phase-out rate (currently maxing out at 21.06 percent), and will often be

much smaller.

       As this makes clear, there are two unambiguous pro-work incentives in the EITC: Single

parents and married couples (jointly) are encouraged to work rather than to remain out of the

labor force. This is perhaps not surprising, as it is exactly this intended response that motivated

the design of the program. But for other groups (secondary earners) and at other margins (hours

of work rather than annual participation) the incentives can work in the opposite direction,

discouraging rather than encouraging work.

       The broad EITC structure can be seen as an efficient way to redistribute income and

encourage work. Saez (2002) shows that the optimal income tax schedule can take an EITC-like

form when labor supply is more elastic at the extensive than at the intensive margin. However,

Saez’s model, like most other optimal tax models, abstracts from the United States’ family-based




                                                 12
tax system. It is difficult to understand the positive tax rate that secondary earners face on the

first dollar of earnings as anything other than a necessary consequence of implementing the

EITC within such a system.13 (Other countries typically tax at the individual level.)

       The self-employed face additional incentives not captured by the above discussion. These

mostly relate to reporting – where wage and salary earnings are reported to the IRS by the

employer (on the Form W-2 earnings report), self-employed workers report their own earnings

with limited third party verification, and may be able to change the amount of earnings reported

without changing their actual labor supply. Additionally, many self-employed workers make

accounting decisions about how to allocate business income between earnings and profits, and

may have some latitude about the costs they deduct from business earnings. Those in the phase-

out range of the EITC schedule, and even some with earnings above the end of that range, can

face an incentive to hide or reclassify some earnings in order to maximize their credit (this would

also reduce federal income taxes).

       By contrast, those in the phase-in range face incentives to raise their reported earnings.

This is because the EITC phase-in rate is higher, in absolute value, than the additional payroll

(and ordinary income) taxes that would need to be paid on additional reported earnings. Similar

incentives apply to those choosing between formal and informal (i.e., under the table) work – the

EITC raises the return to being paid formally, though it can also incentivize shifting a portion of

compensation under the table for those in the phase-out range. Most IRS enforcement efforts are

  Berlin (2007) and Kearney and Turner (2013) propose reforms that would move toward an individual-
based system.

focused on identifying under-reporting, and a taxpayer who over-reported her self-employment

income in order to increase her EITC may be hard to detect.14

       Labor supply predictions under the CTC are similar, but more muted given the smaller

credit amount. The general shapes of the two credits are similar, each with phase-in, flat, and

phase-out regions. However, the “flat” portion of the CTC is very large and the phase-out rate is

low, only 5 percent, and comes in at relatively high income levels—among families with two

children the phase-out region starts at $110,000 for married couples and $75,000 for single

parents and ends at $150,000 and $115,000, respectively.

       The incentive to participate in the labor market under both the EITC and the CTC is

based on the (negative) average tax rate at potential earnings. The CTC never creates an average

tax rate smaller than -13.04% (this is for three-child families), and for most potential workers it

is larger than this. (The combined ATR of the two programs in combination can be much more

negative, but this is driven by the EITC.) Thus, while the CTC shares the EITC’s pro-

participation incentive, the CTC’s contribution is likely to be small. The secondary earner and

intensive margin incentives are less important as well, given the long reach of the program.

       The EITC and CTC also create incentives surrounding other decisions that would affect

the tax credit, most notably marriage and fertility. These are not explicit goals of the programs,

and indeed the incentivized behavior is often counter to what we might hope to promote, but are

inherent in a credit administered through the family-based tax system and tied to the presence

and number of children. In particular, the EITC creates incentives for low-income one-earner

couples to legally marry, while for low-income two-earner couples the incentive is to avoid


14
  Consider, for example, a self-employed individual in the phase-in range who chooses not to claim a
business expense deduction to which she would otherwise be entitled, as doing so would reduce her net
earnings and thus her EITC. It is not clear that this would be preventable even if detected.


                                                 14
marriage or separate. The substitution effects are fairly clear here, but there may also be income

effects at work, possibly in the opposite direction: Increased financial resources due to the EITC

and CTC may free some women from the pressure to enter into unpromising marriages. On net

then, the EITC and CTC, like ordinary income taxes, create marriage penalties for some and

marriages bonuses for others. Additionally, because the credits increase with the number of

children, they may incentivize additional births.

       Given the distributional goal of the credits, it is useful to consider their expected effects

on the distribution of income. We distinguish two types of effects: the direct and indirect effects

of the programs on net disposable income. The direct effect is simply the EITC or CTC payment,

which of course raises after-tax and transfer income. The indirect effect comes from any induced

change in pre-tax earnings and other family income. For those induced to enter the labor market,

increases in earnings increase family income (a positive indirect effect), but this may be partly

offset by reductions in other income sources, such as cash welfare and SNAP. For those already

in the work force, the indirect effect is likely to be negative, but for plausible elasticities much

smaller than the positive direct effect.

       There is another indirect effect as well, not yet discussed. Specifically, the EITC may

affect pre-tax wages. Since the negative effective tax rate encourages increased labor force

participation, standard tax incidence models suggest that the credit will be shared between the

buyers and sellers of labor (Rothstein 2008, 2010; Leigh 2010). This occurs through a reduced

pre-tax wage, allowing employers of EITC recipients to capture a portion of the money spent on

the EITC (and, as a side effect, creating a transfer from non-EITC workers competing in the

same labor markets as the recipients to their employers). This fact was not prominent in early




                                                  15
discussions of the EITC but concerns about incidence have become more prominent as the EITC

has expanded in the presence of relatively low minimum wages.

       It is useful to relate back to the credit schedule to consider where in the income

distribution we expect to see these direct and indirect gains. Figure 8 provides some of this

information by illustrating the 2015 EITC in income/poverty space for six groups defined by

marital status and number of children. In each figure, the x-axis is pre-tax earnings (or AGI) and

the y-axis is after tax income (earnings plus the EITC), expressed as a percent of the poverty

threshold. Consider a single parent with two children working full time at the federal minimum

wage (this group is in Figure 8e). Pre-tax earnings would be $15,080, or about 75% of the

poverty line. But this family would be in the plateau region of the EITC, with a credit of $5,548

that would bring post-EITC income to 103% of the poverty line. Seen somewhat differently, a

family with earnings as low as $14,542 -- placing it just above the top of the EITC phase-in

region – would be at 72% of the FPL without the EITC but would be lifted to the poverty line by

the EITC. Figure 8f shows that a married couple family with two children with earnings of

$18,702 (in the flat region) would be at 77 percent of the FPL without the EITC but would be

lifted out of poverty by the EITC. By contrast, the credit for the childless (panels a and b) is

sufficiently ungenerous that all recipients remain in poverty even when their credits are counted

as income.



V.     WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW WELL THE PROGRAMS ACCOMPLISH

THEIR OBJECTIVES?


       We organize our assessment of the available evidence around the three goals that we

discussed above: distributional, encouragement of work, and limiting of noncompliance and



                                                 16
administrative costs. We begin in Section V.A by presenting empirical estimates of the

distributional effects, neglecting behavioral adjustments. We then review the empirical literatures

measuring behavioral effects on labor supply (and other outcomes) in Section V.B and

noncompliance in Section V.C. There is much more direct evidence regarding the EITC, which

has a much higher public profile, than about the CTC, so our discussion focuses on the former. In

the final subsection, V.D, we present the available evidence on what is missed by the static

perspective – on the distributional impacts of the programs once indirect effects operating

through labor supply and other changes that influence pre-tax income are included.


V.A.    Static distributional effects

        Median family income in 2014 was $53,657, the 20th percentile was $21,432, and the 40th

percentile was $41,186 (DeNavas-Walt and Proctor 2015). Comparing these figures to Figure 8

shows that a large fraction of families have incomes that are both (a) not too far from the poverty

line and (b) in the range where the EITC can have a substantial effect. This suggests that the

EITC has the potential to have important effects on after-tax poverty and income distributions,

even before considering any indirect effects operating through labor supply channels.

        We rely on two sources in assessing the static distributional effects of the EITC and CTC.

The first is the Census Bureau’s calculations for the new Supplemental Poverty Measure

(SPM).15 The SPM resource measure includes taxes and both cash and non-cash benefits,

allowing for a simple static calculation as to the anti-poverty effects of the EITC and CTC

covering the whole population of tax filers and non-filers alike. In 2014, the SPM poverty rate



15
  Official poverty is based on pre-tax cash income. Thus, the direct (or static) impact of the EITC on
official poverty is zero by construction. The SPM is designed, in part, to capture the effects of tax and
other policies on poverty that are missed by the official poverty measure.


                                                   17
was 15.3 percent, but the Census Bureau calculates that it would have been 18.4 percent without

the EITC and CTC (Short 2015). The effect on child poverty is even larger: The SPM poverty

rate for those under 18 years of age was 16.7 percent, but would have been 23.8 percent without

the refundable tax credits. Based on these numbers, the EITC and CTC can be credited with

lifting 9.8 million people, including 5.2 million children, out of poverty. The effects on total

poverty are far larger than those of any other single program except Social Security, and the

effects on child poverty are the largest without exception.

        Of course to gain these benefits, a family has to take-up EITC benefits (file taxes and

request the EITC). In the past decades, take-up rates for families with children have been steady

at 80% or more (Scholz 1994; Plueger 2009) fairly high compared to other programs serving low

income families (Currie 2006). The expansions to childless taxpayers, who have lower take-up

rates, has led to a decline in the overall take-up rate estimated to be 75% in 2005 (Plueger 2009).

        The second approach limits attention to tax filers, as represented in the Statistics of

Income Public Use File distributed by the IRS. We begin by illustrating the potential reach of

the two programs. Figures 9 and 10 show the pre-tax income distribution of tax filers in 2009

(the most recent year available), inflated to 2014 dollars and presented by marital status (married,

single) and number of children (zero, 1, 2, 3 or more).16 Figure 9 is for single filers and Figure 10

is for married. The income tabulations include all tax filers, not just EITC or CTC recipients.17

Overlaid on each figure are the EITC and CTC schedules. Several observations can be drawn

from these figures. First, they illustrate the variation in the generosity of the schedule across the


16
   In this and future figures, tax filers are divided by the number of children claimed as exemptions. This
generally corresponds to the number of qualifying children for the EITC and CTC, though there are
exceptions.
17
   We limit the sample in each case to those returns with earned income between $1 and $200,000 and
indicate in figure notes the share of total filers for that demographic group that are excluded from the
histogram (those filers with earned income that is <=0 or >$200,000).


                                                    18
eight groups. The credits are substantially larger for families with children than for those without

children and the credits are larger for families with larger children. Second, they show that the

potential reach of the EITC, particularly among single parents, is very high. Only 30% of singles

with one child and 18% of singles with two children have earnings higher than the top of the

phase-out range (compared to 75% and 76% for married families with one and two children,

respectively). Third, they show that the CTC extends to very high income levels, and the

majority of both single and married parents qualify for substantial benefits.

          Next, we move from the potential reach to the actual use of the programs – not all

families are eligible, and while take-up rates are high they are not complete. We use the Tax

Policy Center’s (TPC) microsimulation model, applied to the same Statistics of Income file, to

measure the distribution of EITC and CTC benefits under current law. We discuss these current

law findings in the next paragraphs. In a later section, we use the same approach to examine the

distributional impacts of alternative policies.18

          To illustrate the benefits of current law EITC and CTC, we use the TPC simulations to

zero each out in turn. By comparing the resulting estimates to those obtained using the actual

policies, we can estimate the distribution of the benefits from each. By design, the TPC

simulations assume that pre-tax income and earnings, as well as all other characteristics (e.g.,

number of children) are unaffected by counterfactual tax rules, so only capture the static effects

of the current policies. We discuss the implications for the full dynamics effects below.

          Figure 11 summarizes the EITC and CTC in terms of their distribution across family

types (as well as also showing the distribution of total tax filers across these groups). Over 60%

of EITC benefits go to head-of-household filers (i.e., to single parents), but this group receives


18
     We thank Elaine Maag and the TPC tax model team for providing us with these simulations.


                                                    19
only 40% of CTC benefits. This is due to the CTC’s high income limits, which allow over half of

the benefits to flow to married couples (many dual-earners); this group gets less than one-quarter

of EITC benefits. Not surprisingly, childless single and married filers get few benefits under

either policy.19

        Figure 12a plots the distribution of EITC and CTC benefits across the income

distribution, pooling tax filers of all different family types. The x-axis shows bins of 2015 filing-

unit income. There are three sets of bars: The first plots the share of total tax units in each

income group; the second the share of total EITC benefits that accrue to each income group; and

the third the share of total CTC benefits received by each income group. As context for these

shares, note that the total cost of the EITC in 2015 is estimated by the TPC model at $69 billion,

while the CTC is $55 billion.20 The line graph illustrates the share of total income accounted for

by each income group – not surprisingly, the highest income categories account for a much

larger share of income than of filing units or of program benefits.

        The EITC series in Figure 12a shows the distributional goal of the program is well met –

nearly 60% of the benefits go to filers with income below $30,000. The CTC is less successful in

this regard – only one-fifth of benefits go to families with incomes below $30,000. At the other

end of the spectrum, 57% of CTC benefits but only 11% of EITC benefits go to filers with

incomes over $50,000; over 20% of CTC benefits go to families with incomes above $100,000

        The remaining panels in Figure 12 show the distribution across both family type and

income, distinguishing among married couples with children (Figure 12b), married couples




19
   Both CTC and EITC bars are non-zero for the “single” and “joint no children” groups. There are some
circumstances in which a filer can receive the EITC or CTC while not claiming child exemptions.
20
   The CTC series here includes both credits that are used to offset income tax liabilities and credits issued
as refunds, but not those that are forfeited because they exceed the refundability limit.


                                                     20
without children (Figure 12d), single filers with children (Figure 12c) and single filers without

children (Figure 12e). For each subgroup, we display the relevant series (tax units, pre-tax

income, EITC benefits, CTC benefits) as shares of the total (all filers) amount. Comparing the

EITC bars to the tax unit bars in these figures, it is clear that much of the variation in EITC

benefits across married- and single-parent families, as seen in Figure 11, is a reflection of income

distributions within each group. There are roughly 15% more married-with-children returns as

head-of-household returns, but the latter are 3.7 times as likely to have incomes below $40,000.

CTC payments are much less sensitive to income, so are more concentrated in married-couple

families.

       One limit to the redistributive power of the EITC is not reflected in Figure 12: Most of

the benefits are distributed as tax refunds in the spring. If families are credit constrained – as

many EITC recipients likely are – then an annual lump-sum payment has a smaller effect on the

household’s welfare than would one that is more evenly distributed, and thus the EITC is a less

effective redistribution policy than it appears based on annual income distributions. The Advance

EITC program allowed recipients to receive their credits throughout the year, but take-up was

extremely low (under 1%) and the IRS eventually cancelled the program. Its failure does not

seem to be due to lack of information or even default effects: Experiments that inform recipients

about the program and to overcome default behavior had only minor impacts on take-up (IRS

1999; Jones 2010). This could indicate that recipients prefer their EITC payments as lump-sums,

perhaps seeing the program as a form of forced saving (see the discussion in Nichols and

Rothstein 2015). But the preferences of EITC recipients in this regard are not well understood.




                                                  21
V.B.   Behavioral Effects

       A significant body of research examines the behavioral effects of the EITC, much of it

exploiting significant expansions in the tax acts of 1986, 1990, 1993, and 2009. There have even

been several comprehensive reviews of the literature (e.g., see Hotz and Scholz 2003; Eissa and

Hoynes 2006a; Nichols and Rothstein 2015). Rather than recapitulate those reviews, here we

provide only a brief summary of the main findings in the literature.

       The main focus of the empirical literature regarding the EITC, particularly in the early

years, was to quantify and explore the main pro-work aspect of the program: the incentive it

creates for single parents to participate in the labor force. In practice, this meant analyses of

employment decisions (at the extensive margin) of low educated single mothers. Most studies

take a quasi-experimental approach leveraging the variation across tax year and family size in the

federal credit, essentially using women with no children or women with just a single child as

controls. (A smaller set of papers uses variation in state EITCs, which add on to the federal

credit.) The 1993 expansion provides a particularly attractive policy reform because it represents

the largest expansion of the credit in its history (see Figures 2 and 4) and the expansion for

women with two or more children was much larger than the expansion for women with one child

(thus allowing for a comparison among single women with children, comparing those with two

or more children to those with one child).

       Across all of the different types of comparisons, the evidence nearly universally points to

a significant positive effect of the EITC on the labor force participation (or employment) of

single women with children. For example, Eissa and Liebman (1996) find labor force

participation increased by 2.8 percentage points for single women with children, relative to

single women without children after the EITC expansion of 1986. Over a longer period, Meyer




                                                  22
and Rosenbaum (2001) find that the EITC raised labor force participation by 7.2 percentage

points for single women with children relative to those without children between 1984 and 1996.

Hoynes and Patel (2015) find that the 1993 expansion increased employment by 6.1 percentage

points, with larger effects for women with two or more children. Using the approach in Chetty,

Guren, Manoli and Weber (2013), the extensive margin elasticities for these studies range from

0.30 to 0.45 (Hoynes and Patel 2015).21

        The changes in employment, particularly for the 1993 expansion, are evident in the basic

unconditional trends. This is illustrated in Figure 13 (based on Nichols and Rothstein 2015,

Figure 8b) where we use the March Current Population Survey and plot the percent of single

women (those with zero, one or two or more children) working at all during the year for each

year from 1976 to 2013. The figure illustrates that for the two decades before 1993, the annual

employment rate for unmarried women with children was substantially below that for single

women without children. By 2000, the gap narrowed substantially, with an especially dramatic

increase for single women with two or more children (who experienced a larger EITC

expansion). Since then, employment rates show a decline for all groups, likely reflecting adverse

macroeconomic conditions.

        Figure 14, taken from Figure 7 in Hoynes and Patel (2015), illustrates the quasi-

experimental estimates of the EITC from the 1993 expansion controlling for other

contemporaneous effects such as welfare reform and the strong labor market (Blank 2001). The

figure plots event time coefficients and 95 percent confidence intervals for single women with




21
   These elasticities are with respect to the net of tax wage, taking account of other taxes. It is more
common in the EITC literature to report elasticities with respect to gross earnings plus the EITC (or,
equivalently, with respect to the EITC average tax rate). These are higher, in the 0.7-1.0 range. See Chetty
et al. (2013), Appendix B.


                                                    23
two more children and with one child, both compared to single women without children. The

omitted year is 1993 (the year prior to the policy expansion). The graph also displays the change

in the real average maximum credit across the groups (dashed line, right axis) to give some

guidance as to how the EITC is changing over time and across groups. The figure shows that

differential labor supply increases after 1993 closely follow the pattern of EITC expansions—

women with children increase their employment relative to women without children, with larger

effects for women with two or more children.22

       This graph makes quite clear that the EITC has a large positive effect on single mothers’

labor force participation. This conclusion is consistent across studies: Estimated extensive

margin effects are quite robust across different time periods (including studies identified from

pre-1993 expansions) and using different identification approaches (including more structural

approaches or using state EITC expansions). There are fewer studies of married couples, but the

available evidence shows that the EITC leads to small reductions in the employment of married

women, consistent with the predictions above, and there is little evidence of any effects on men

(Eissa and Hoynes, 2004, 2006b).

       A second question concerns the EITC’s effect on the intensive margin. Estimates based

on quasi-experimental approaches like that illustrated in Figure 14 show little sign of meaningful

effects (Hotz and Scholz 2003; Nichols and Rothstein 2015). However, standard difference-in-

differences research designs are not ideally suited to this question due to the confounding effects

of composition – the large extensive margin effects mean that the composition of the working

population is different between the pre- and post-EITC period.



22
 It also shows that in the years prior to the expansion employment was trending similarly across the
groups, validating the use of women without children as controls.


                                                 24
       In the past decade, the EITC literature has re-focused on the intensive margin using other

methods. Saez (2010), which looks for “bunching” in the income distribution around the kinks in

the EITC schedule, was one of the first in this vein. Like other bunching studies that have

followed, Saez found little sign that families in the phase-out range reduce their labor supply to

maximize their credits, but did find evidence that workers in the phase-in range adjust to increase

their credits (Saez 2010; see also Chetty, Friedman, and Saez 2013; Chetty and Saez 2013;

Mortenson and Whitten 2015). Most of this effect derives from self-employed workers, who

generally self-report their earnings without independent verification on the part of the IRS. It is

thus difficult to determine whether it is a real behavioral effect or a change in reporting. Chetty,

Friedman and Saez (2013) use earnings distributions of families in the year after the birth of a

child to look for intensive margin responses. They find that the intensive margin elasticity is

small on average, around 0.14, though they argue that this is attenuated due to a lack of

information about the incentives that families face.

       There are a handful of studies that examine the effect of the EITC on marriage (e.g.,

Ellwood 2000; Rosenbaum 2000; Herbst 2011; Michelmore 2014). The empirical evidence is

largely inconclusive, though it generally points to small effects. There is less evidence on the

effects of the EITC on fertility (Baughman and Dickert-Conlin 2009) but again the results

suggest small effects. Finally, though somewhat outside the scope of this paper, there is a recent

and growing literature that uses the increase in after-tax income generated by the EITC to

examine impacts on downstream outcomes. The credit has been found to lead to increases in

infant health (Baker 2008; Baughman 2012; Hoynes, Miller, and Simon 2015; Strully et al.

2010), maternal health (Evans and Garthwaite 2014), children’s cognitive outcomes (Dahl and

Lochner 2012; Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2011) and educational attainment (Michelmore




                                                 25
2013; Manoli and Turner 2014). These are generally interpreted as income effects, though it is

possible that a portion of each effect is directly related to increased maternal employment.

        In sum, the evidence on behavioral effects shows that the EITC leads to substantial

increases in employment for single mothers, concentrated among less-skilled women and among

those with more than one child. There is also evidence of small reductions in employment for

secondary earners in married couples, but little evidence of any induced changes in male labor

supply. Though there is less evidence on the intensive margin of labor supply, the available

evidence suggest at most small responses. There is little evidence that the EITC has much of an

effect on marriage or fertility.


V.C.    Compliance

        Over-claiming of the EITC has been a persistent concern with the program. The most

recent IRS study (Internal Revenue Service 2014a), based on audited 2006-2008 returns, found

an overclaiming rate between 28.5% and 39.1% of all EITC dollars claimed (the range derives

from assumptions about taxpayers who did not participate in the audit).23 There are two primary

sources of noncompliance—misclaiming of qualifying children and income misreporting.

        Qualifying child violations occur in 30% of returns with over-claims, but represent over

half of over-claimed dollars. The EITC’s qualifying child rules are complex, and – despite recent

changes aimed at harmonization – differ from those for child exemptions. IRS Publication 596

lists a multitude of examples in which many economists would have trouble identifying who was

eligible to claim the credit, and many situations in which multiple filers could claim different


23
  The IRS is able to disallow some overclaims, so the overpayment rate is lower – around 24% in recent
years. Moreover, the rates of overclaiming may be overstated in the administrative data, as filers who
request reconsideration of credit denials succeed in overturning nearly half of IRS rulings (National
Taxpayer Advocate 2004).


                                                 26
credits with choices over who claims qualifying children.24 The optimal choice is often hard to

determine. Greenstein and Wancheck (2011) conclude that “EITC overpayments most

commonly result from misunderstanding of how to apply the EITC's intricate rules regarding

who may claim a child, especially in changing family situations involving separated, divorced, or

three-generation families.” Although definitions have been changed to better align with those

used elsewhere in the tax code and the IRS has increased its efforts to verify children’s identity

(by, e.g., requiring reporting of the child’s social security number on the tax form), misreporting

of qualifying children remains high.

        The other major category of over-claiming, income misreporting, is more common but

results in smaller overpayments, on average. About two-thirds of returns with overclaims

misreport income. Incorrect reporting of self-employment income is the primary source of

income misreporting (in part reflecting the lack of second party verification that is available for

wage and salary income).

        Another source of evidence related to reporting or noncompliance comes from the

“bunching” studies discussed above. In the original Saez study (Saez 2010), since replicated by

others (e.g. Chetty et al. 2013), there is substantial evidence of bunching at the end of the phase-

in region, at the first EITC kink. Chetty and Saez (2013) found something similar as the result of

an information treatment at H&R Block: The provision of information about the tax schedule led

families to move toward the first kink point. There is no sign of bunching at the second kink




24
  Residency test failures are the most common in the over-claiming audits, suggesting that many non-
custodial parents claim a child who should have been claimable only by the custodial parent. Enforcement
is challenging for the IRS, as many components of the qualifying child definition are not readily
observed.


                                                  27
point (between the plateau and the phase-out range), nor of a hollowing out of the density at the

third (at the end of the phase-out range), though the standard model would predict all three.

        As Saez points out, the total marginal tax rate, combining the EITC and other taxes (e.g.,

payroll taxes), is generally negative in the phase-in range, implying that a filer with earnings

below the first kink point would come out ahead by reporting to the IRS higher earnings than

he/she actually had. Saez (2010) and others find that the bunching at the first kink point is

entirely driven by the self-employed, who likely have a fair amount of latitude over how much

income to report. Thus, Saez suggests that the bunching he observes likely reflects decisions to

report casual earnings (from, e.g., babysitting) that would not have been reported to the IRS in

the absence of the EITC, though it is also possible that some of it reflects a true intensive margin

response or reporting income that was not actually received in order to maximize the value of the

EITC.


V.D.    Dynamic distributional effects

        The above evidence suggests that the labor supply impacts of the EITC are large,

particularly on the participation decisions of single parents, and may have important implications

for the distributional impacts of the policy. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that quantifies

the distributional effects of the EITC taking account of the full behavioral responses.

        A handful of studies estimate the effect of the EITC on income or poverty (Bollinger,

Gonzalez, and Ziliak 2009; Grogger 2003; Gunderson and Ziliak 2004; Hoynes and Patel 2015).

This literature shows that the direct (EITC payment) and indirect (through earnings net of

changes in other income) channels combine to lead to large effects of EITC on income. For

example, Hoynes and Patel (2015) use difference-in-difference (DD) and parameterized DD

models to estimate the effects of the EITC on the distribution of after tax and transfer income


                                                  28
relative to poverty among single mothers with less than a college education. They find that the

1993 expansion led to a 7.9 percentage point increase in the share of families with children with

after tax and transfer income above poverty. They estimate similar models for the propensity to

have after tax and transfer income above various income to poverty thresholds. Figure 15 (taken

from Figure 11 in Hoynes and Patel 2015) provides their core results. They find that the EITC

has little effect on the very lowest income groups (below 75% of poverty), likely reflecting low

labor market attachment of families in this range. Between 75% and 150% of the poverty line,

the effects of the EITC are large and statistically significant; they then fall to zero by 250%

poverty.

       Hoynes and Patel then use these results to compare the static distributional effects of the

EITC (direct effect only) to the dynamic distributional effects (direct and indirect effects). They

find that for their sample of single mothers with children ignoring the indirect effects of the

EITC (increased earnings net of changes in other income) leads to significant underestimates of

the distributional effects. For example, they find that the total effect of the EITC removes 2.4

million children from poverty compared to 1.2 million when considering only the direct effect.

       Another dimension of dynamic effects has to do with tax incidence, the effect of the

EITC on pre-tax wages. As we discussed above, the standard incidence model predicts that the

EITC should, to some degree, reduce pre-tax wages. These effects would be felt by EITC-

eligible and non-eligible workers (who mix in the workplace) alike. Such general equilibrium

effects are difficult to estimate using credible research designs, especially given the widespread

use of the variation by tax year and number of children (e.g. OBRA 93), as wage effects would

be common to all family types in the same year. Leigh (2010) exploits the introduction of state

level EITCs in a DD framework, essentially relying on the assumption that employers do little




                                                 29
substitution of workers across states. He finds that a 10% increase in the EITC leads to a 5%

(2%) reduction in pre-tax wages for high school dropouts (high school graduates) and no effect

on the wages of college graduates. Rothstein (2010; see also Rothstein 2008) takes a simulation

approach by relying on previous estimates of demand and supply elasticities to calibrate a

calculation of the distributional effects of the EITC. He finds that $1 in EITC payments leads to

$0.09 worth of increased labor supply but a $0.27 decline in worker pre-tax incomes—the

difference, $0.36, is transferred to employers through reduced pre-tax wages. As a consequence,

after-tax income rises by only $0.73.

       Although none of the evidence is airtight, it appears that employers of low-wage labor

capture a meaningful share of the credit through reduced wages and that this comes to some

extent at the expense of low-skill workers who are not eligible for the credit (due, e.g., to not

having children). The implied effects are large enough to have quantitatively important

implications for the EITC’s distributional impacts – a crude calculation based on Rothstein’s

(2010) results suggests that static calculations could overstate the transfer to recipients by as

much as one-third, and that dynamic calculations like Hoynes and Patel’s (2015) overstate it by

as much as one-half (based on the ratio of Rothstein’s (2010) wage-constant effect on after-tax

income, $1.09, to the net effect inclusive of wage responses, $0.73). But this remains an under-

studied topic, and the effective confidence intervals around these estimates are large.



VI.    POTENTIAL REFORMS


       The above evidence indicates that the EITC is doing a good job of meeting its objectives:

It successfully targets low-income working families, bringing many of them out of poverty; it

has meaningful positive effects on labor force participation, with small or zero negative effects



                                                 30
on the intensive margin and for secondary earners; and, while there is evidence of substantial

overclaiming, the dollar amounts are not that large, and errors seem to relate in large part to

qualifying child definitions. The CTC, while less studied, is clearly less effective on at least the

distributive and labor supply dimensions.

        But although the EITC is doing well on all three margins, it would be possible to

improve. The concern most commonly voiced about the EITC is that it largely fails to reach

childless workers (including non-custodial parents). For the CTC, an important concern is that it

misses too many low-income families, certainly before but even after the 2009 expansion to its

refundability (West, Boteach, and Vallas, 2015).

        To illustrate the possibilities for reform, we consider potential changes aimed at

addressing these concerns. First, we examine expansions of the childless EITC, both President

Obama’s proposal to double this credit and a more ambitious expansion designed to bring the

childless EITC to rough parity (in family-need-adjusted terms) with that available to families

with children. Second, we assess the impact of the recent reduction of the earnings threshold for

refundability of the CTC, and consider reducing it further.


VI.A.    The childless EITC

        Because historically the EITC was seen (at least by some) as an alternative to cash

welfare for families with children, it was initially unavailable to childless adults and remains

comparatively limited for them. But views of the purpose of the EITC have evolved and it is now

seen, at least in part, as a way of compensating for the erosion of real wages paid to low-income

workers. This does not provide much rationale for excluding childless workers, and so there is

increasing interest in expanding this portion of the credit. In 2015, President Obama proposed a

substantial expansion – roughly doubling the generosity of the childless credit, as well as


                                                 31
extending the plateau and phase-out ranges to higher income levels. But even this proposal, if

enacted, would leave the childless credit much smaller than that available to families with

children.

       We compare three versions of the childless EITC: Current law, the Obama

Administration proposal, and with a more aggressive proposal of our own invention. The latter is

designed to set the maximum credit for a single childless adult to the same level as for a single

adult with one child, after adjusting for the different needs of one- and two-person families using

a standard equivalence scale. We keep the phase-in range the same as in current law, and solve

for the needed phase-in rate; this turns out to be nearly identical (33.8% vs. 34%) to that for one-

child families under current law. We set the plateau for single adults to have a width of $5,000,

very similar to its width under Obama’s proposal and to the plateau for multiple-child families

under current law. Following the schedule for families with children, we extend the plateau range

by $5,500 for married couples. We set the phase-out rate to match the current one-child schedule

(15.98%).

       Figure 16 illustrates the schedules under the three alternatives, with the one-child single

schedule shown as well for comparison. Either of the alternatives to current policy would better

serve the purpose of redistributing more money to low-income families, and would do more to

encourage labor force participation, than does the current schedule. They would likely reduce

over-claiming: although childless individuals and couples would face the same incentives as do

those with children to over-report self-employment income, the great incentive that families

currently face to mis-claim qualifying children would be much reduced and, in many cases,

nearly eliminated. The expanded credit would also lead to changes in incentives for marriage.

Couples without children would face similar incentives as those we discussed above for couples




                                                 32
with children (marriage penalties for two earners and marriage subsidies for one earners), and

marriage penalties for two earner couples with children would increase. The existing research,

however, suggests these changes in marriage penalties (and subsidies) will not translate to

meaningful changes in marriage.

       We use the Urban-Brookings TPC Microsimulation model to quantify the cost of these

changes. Table 3 shows the results: The Obama proposal would increase the number of

recipients of the childless credit by over 60%, reaching higher into the income distribution, and

more than double the average credit. The more generous, equivalence-scaled expansion would

raise the number of recipients by 127% and nearly quintuple the average credit. Clearly, each of

these represents a dramatic expansion of the program: The Obama expansion would transfer an

additional $4.6 billion to low-income childless families, more than tripling the cost of the

childless EITC, while the more generous expansion would transfer an additional $18.3 billion

(each on top of the $68.5 billion cost of the EITC under current law).25 To reiterate, this is a

static simulation and there is no response of labor supply modelled here, either on the extensive

(we would expect more filers) or intensive margin. Such responses would increase the cost of

each alternative, though likely not dramatically.

       Of course, the above schedules are not the only option for expanding the EITC for

taxpayers without children. One alternative that has received some attention is an expansion of

eligibility for non-custodial parents, conditioned on the payment of child support and designed to

create incentives to do so (Primus 2006). New York and Washington DC have implemented non-

custodial parent credits, and a regression discontinuity evaluation of the New York program



25
  The Obama administration estimates the cost of the Obama proposal to be $60 billion over ten years
(Executive Office of the President and U.S. Treasury Department 2014).

shows positive effects on both employment and child support payment (Nichols, Sorenson, and

Lippold 2012).


VI.B. CTC refundability threshold

        Prior to 2009, the lowest income filers were effectively ineligible for the CTC, as they

had no income tax liability and CTC refunds were limited to 15% of earnings in excess of

$11,500 (in 2007). The refundability threshold was reduced to $3,000 in 2009, a provision that

was made permanent in late 2015. We use the TPC microsimulation model to illustrate the

importance of this expansion in the credit. The first set of bars in Figure 17 show the distribution

of the additional $10.4 billion in 2015 CTC payments that resulted from the 2009 reduction of

the threshold, large relative to the total cost of $56 billion.26 (Once again, this is a static analysis

that does not account for changes in labor supply behavior.) As shown in Figure 17, nearly all –

over 70% -- of the additional benefits flow to families with incomes below $30,000. This shows

that the increase in the CTC’s refundability dramatically changed the program, making it much

more progressive.

        One might be interested in further increasing the progressivity of the CTC, which remains

much more regressive than the EITC. The second series in Figure 17 explores a further

expansion of CTC refundability, obtained by reducing the threshold all the way to zero (from

$3,000). This would make the CTC structure nearly identical to the EITC’s (albeit with a much

longer plateau region). Using the TPC simulation, we find that this policy (proposed by West,




26
  This simulation, along with the others, is for tax year 2015. We set the threshold for refundability under
the pre-2007 policy at $13,850 (2015 dollars), adjusted for inflation from the 2001 threshold of $10,000
(nominal).


                                                    34
Boteach, and Vallas 2015) would cost $2.2 billion (a 4% increase over current law), and again

nearly all benefits would flow to the lowest-income families.27


VI.C. Other reforms: Labor supply, compliance and timing

       Neither of the above proposals are designed primarily to improve the EITC’s labor

supply impacts, though here too there are reasons to be dissatisfied with the status quo. As

discussed above, the EITC has large positive effects on labor force participation among single

parents, with little if any negative effect on hours of work of those who would work in any case.

But for married couples the labor supply impacts are not so positive: Eissa and Hoynes (2004)

document a negative effect on the labor supply of married women, many of whom are secondary

earners and who therefore would qualify for a larger EITC if they did not work than if they did.

       Unfortunately, there are few good options for avoiding this problem. It is merely an

example of the marriage penalties that are inherent in any progressive, family-based tax system,

and like other marriage penalties is quite difficult to avoid. Berlin (2007) proposes making the

EITC depend on individual rather than family earnings. Holt and Maag (2009) propose replacing

the EITC and CTC with a worker credit, based on individual earnings, and a child credit based

on family earnings. This would eliminate the second worker penalty, but would represent an

enormous change in the U.S. tax system and would cost tens of billions of dollars. A more

incremental proposal comes from Kearney and Turner (2013), who would create a secondary

earner deduction that would reduce the second worker penalty and effectively extend the EITC

schedule for two-earner families.




27
  Maag (2015) explores the implications of changes in the CTC refundability threshold, as well as other
potential changes to the program, in more detail.


                                                  35
         In terms of compliance, the major issues concern over-claiming of qualifying children

and mis-reporting of self-employment income. The first would be addressed by the expansion of

the childless credit. The second is more difficult. California, which introduced its own EITC in

2015, disallows self-employment income from EITC calculations. TPC’s model indicates that

the total effect of adopting a similar rule at the Federal level would be to reduce EITC

expenditures by $11 billion. As this is far in excess of any plausible estimate of the amount of

overpayment due to income misreporting, it is clear that the primary effect would be to deny the

credit to many of the intended recipients. It might be better to tighten up enforcement around

self-employment income, while recognizing that not all misreporting can be prevented.

         Another way to improve the performance of the EITC vis-à-vis our three objectives is to

increase the take-up rate. The estimated 75% take-up rate, while high relative to other parts of

the social safety net, still leaves room for improvement. We know that take-up is lower among

those eligible for smaller credits, notably childless taxpayers and those with very low earning

levels (Plueger 2009). A challenge with increasing take-up for this group is that it

disproportionately includes those not filing a tax return (and often not legally required to).

Recent evidence based on experimental designs and IRS partnerships shows that informational

mailers can lead to significant increases in take-up (Bhargava and Manoli 2015; Guyton et al.

2016).

         A final type of change to consider would be one aimed at distributing EITC and CTC

payments more gradually rather than as annual lump sums, as this is a persistent limitation of the

EITC as an anti-poverty program. Unfortunately, the wake of the failure of the Advance EITC

program, we are not aware of good proposals to do so. Much more needs to be understood about




                                                 36
the role that EITC payments play in their recipients’ lives (see, e.g., Halpern-Meekin et al. 2015)

in order to inform welfare-improving changes of this type.



VII.   CONCLUSION


       In this paper, we examine the state of tax policy for families with children. We focus on

the two most important provisions, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. We

discuss these two programs within the lens of the three presumed goals of the programs:

distributional, encouragement of work, and limiting of administrative costs and noncompliance.

To discuss these three goals, we use tax data and quantify the static distributional features of the

programs. We also summarize the existing research to assess how the programs meet the other

two goals.

       We conclude that the EITC well meets all three of these goals. The policy provides

substantial increases to income for low to moderate income families. A large body of research

shows that the first-order behavioral effect of the policy is to increase employment among single

mothers with children. Married couples also benefit from the program, though the policy does

induce modest reductions in secondary earner employment. Administrative costs are low,

particularly compared to the public assistance alternatives to the EITC. Compliance remains an

issue, with complicated rules for claiming children and incentives to overreport self-employment

income (though it is not clear that noncompliance is any worse than for other redistribution

programs). The CTC looks much less favorable within this lens. The credit is not targeted, with a

large share of the expenditures extending way above median income groups. However, the 2009

expansion of the credit, making the CTC refundable at low earnings levels, is highly targeted and

effectively represents an expansion of the EITC.



                                                 37
       We also discuss and simulate proposals to reform the EITC that would improve one or

more of the three program goals. Expansions of the childless EITC would be quite progressive,

but also expensive. Limitation of the use of self-employment income to qualify for the EITC

would reduce the program’s cost, but would also exclude a group that is likely as deserving as

traditional employees. Finally, the recent reduction of the refundability threshold for the CTC

dramatically improved the program’s redistributive value. A further reduction all the way to zero

would be less costly, with equally progressive distributional impacts.

Notes: Figures reflect a head-of-household filer with two children who qualify under dependent exemption, EITC,
and CTC rules but have zero Child and Dependent Care Tax credit eligibility. The “CTC Forfeited” area reflects the
family’s CTC eligibility that cannot be received due to the limit on the portion of the CTC that is refundable.

Figure 5. Tax and transfer benefits for universally available programs, by income (single
adults with 2 children, 2015)




Notes: Estimated value of tax and transfer beneﬁts for a single parent with two children living in Colorado.
Calculations assume that both children qualify for dependent exemptions, the EITC, the CTC, and the Child and
Dependent Care Tax Credit. Premium assistance credit excludes the value of penalties paid by employers on the
beneficiaries' behalf and the value of additional cost-sharing subsidies. Health coverage and quality of services
provided varies by source: Medicaid and CHIP beneﬁts are more comprehensive and have less cost-sharing than
those in the exchange. Medicaid and CHIP also pay providers for services at lower rates than private insurers.
Source: Based on data from Steuerle and Quakenbush (2015).

Notes: Average effective marginal tax rates facing a single parent with two children living in Colorado. See notes to
Figure 5. The effective marginal tax rate is averaged over $5,000 income bins and is calculated using changes in net
income after taxes and transfers given changes in total compensation (including employer share of payroll taxes).

Notes: Solid vertical lines indicate the locations of EITC kink points; see Table 1 for exact values. Dashed vertical
lines indicate the pre-tax income at which a family reaches the poverty line, with and without the EITC. In panel a,
these are at pre-tax earnings of $11,770 without EITC or $11,518 with EITC; in panel b, they are at $15,930 and
$15,565, respectively.
