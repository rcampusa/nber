1.      Introduction


        In   policy discussions, it is often suggested that increased tariffs will

improve a country's current account.                 To the economic theorist, it is not

irmnediately       obvious    a distortionary tax change should affect the
                             how

incentives     to save and invest —— whose difference comprises a current account
imbalance.         Here we take    a look at one aspect of the effect of tariffs              on

saving    in a neoclassical     model.
        This paper analyzes the effects of             tariffs   on saving   in a small    open
economy using the uncertain lifetimes version of the overlapping generations
model, developed by Yaari 1965) and Blanchard (1984,1985), Several authors1
have used          to examine the role of public sector bodget deficits
               this model

because it fails to display Ricardian debt-neutrality, so that the
intertemporal pattern of net             lump—sum     transfers to individuals has real
effects.      We                      effects of a permanent tariff change,
                   examine the intertemporal
abstracting from other aspects of fiscal policy. The distribution of the
incidence of the tariff across dIfferent factors, and the method of
distribution of the tariff revenue, have important consequences for aggregate

per capita saving and, therefore,              the current account,        The intersectoral

and intergenerational effects of the tariff have intertemporal impacts for the

same    reason that debt-neutrality           fails;      however   we   constrain the public sector
bodget   to be in belance continuously,2
        After laying out the model in section 2                 we   proceed by examining    first a
special case of the model in which the import good is not produced
domestically  Tariff revenue is a,ssused to be redistributed luap—sus to
living       individuals.     We find that under this distribution scheme, the change

in the        tariff   has    consequenoes       for       aggregate      saving,   The    tariff   is

essentially an equal tax on both physical wealth and non-tangible wealth,

while the lump—sum redistribution is a subsidy only to non-tangible wealth.

When the incidence of the tariff                an        subsidy scheme is not neutral across

generations,       total expenditure in this economy                   is affected because of the

imperfect       claim of currently living individuals on                   income from   non-tangible
assets in the future,
        next take up models in which the import good is produced. Here, a
        We

change in the tariff has additional effects on expenditure through its power
to change the faotoral distribution of income.
        It is       to note that these effects are different than those that
                 important
appear in other models of the current account in which no new generations are
born. In fact, both of these effects are present even when the tariff would
have    no effect on saving in a model with a single generation.)3                        As we will

show,    the fact that       new   generations are born with an imperfect bequest motive

2      Our    analysis of the distributional impact of taxes bears some resemblance
 to   that of Chamley and Wright         )   1987).

       This general    feature of the uncertain lifeepans model has also been noted
 by Buiter (1986b).

means that even a small tariff will alter               saving. These effects occur even      in
the   absence of any first-order distortion, or presence               of a pure   substitution

effect "4

       In section         4,   we consider an alternative scheme for redistribution of

tariff revenue.            If the economy has positive holdings of tangible assets

 forei       currency bonds and land), the revenue is redistributed as               a   subsidy

to tangible assets.             If
                         there are net negative holdings of tangible assets,
the revenue is redistributed as a subsidy to net tangible debt. We show that

for any given level of the tariff, the government has a choice of how to
redistribute revenue.                If they
                                         to subsidize steady-state tangible
                                               choose
assets, the steady-state tangible asset position will be positive. If they
choose to have a negative subsidy rate to steady-state tangible assets -—

hence, a positive subsidy to steady-state tangible debt -— the economy will
have a negative position in tangible assets in steady state.         Thus, by

cnoosing how to set the subsidy rate for any given tariff rate, the government

can determine the net position in tangible assets in steady state for the

economy.     We    then   show how changes     in the   tariff rate affect saving.
       Section     5 concludes.




       See   for    example      Razin   and   Svensson   (1983), Edwards      (1987) and the

endogenous discount rate model           in our earlier paper,     Engel and   Kletzer (1986).

There are first-order effects in Razin and Svensson because the consumers'

price indices are allowed to change from period               to   period,   We rule this out

in   our model. Edwards also introduces            non—traded goods.

        study a small country that takes as given the world interest rate, r
        We

and the world price of good 2 in terms of good 1, which we set equal to one.
Both goods are traded and consumed. We consider the effects of increasing a
tariff on good 2.
        Goods   are   produced      using    standard      neoclassical    production   processes.

There are at least two factors of production, so factor returns and output
levels are determined exactly. All factor supplies are constant (there are no
intermediate goods, and all non—labor factors can be considered to be types of
land) and are normalized to one. With unchanging factor supplies and relative
price of coimnodities, factor returns and output levels are constant over time.
A    permanent change     in the tariff        may       lead to a once and for all shift in
factor prices and production levels. The production side of the economy can
be left in this general form for the dynamic analysis, although we will

compare the effect of a permanent tariff change for three special cases: only
the export good is produced; both goofs are produced in the Heckscher-Ohlin
model; and, both goods       are produced in the specific-factors model.
        Household     consumption behavior is derived using the uncertain lifetimes
version of the        overlapping generations model, developed by Yaari                 (1965)   and

Blanchard       (1984,1985),        We adopt a continuous-time version in which each

individual       faces    a   constant       (age    and     time   independent)    instantaneous
probability of death,         ii,   less   than unity, and there      is   no bequest motive.     At

each    instant, a new cohort of size l+n is born, where                      n is the constant

proportionate rate of population growth.                    The dynamics of per-capita saving

are identical for all values of tm+n                 that   exceed zero    (see Buiter (t986c)).



                                                     4
Weil (1985) shows      that an overlapping      generations model   results -hen        is zero
and n    is   positive.     In a    model   with    infinitely-lived dynastic   families in
which each individual possesses         a perfect bequest motive,       if there is birth of
new    dynasties, then the model        will lead to the      same saving dynamics       as in
Well,    because currently living families do not care about the consumption of

future dynasties.         We use Blanchard's version in which a is positive and n

equals    zero,   because labor force growth is unessential to our           examination of
the savings effects of tariff changes. Therefore, the population                is constant
with    size equal   to one.
       Because consumers have uncertain lifetimes, their effective subjective
discount rate is ö+ir, where b is the positive pure rate of time preference.
     All forms of physical wealth are perfect substitutes, so that they earn
the same rate of return, r, as an internationally traded bond. We assume that
consumers have access to            a perfect annuities market, Each consumer can
contract with an insurance          company to receive an additional rate of return a

on tangible assets while she         lives.    In exchange, the company receives her net

sealth if she dies.         Conversely, if a consumer has negative        net holdings of
tangible assets, then she agrees to            pay a premium C    per unit of debt on the
condition that the insurance company           assumes   her debt upon death.
       Two   types of wealth are assumed        not   transferable to the insurer for an
annuity.      The consumer' a human wealth (the discounted value           of labor income)
has no   value upon   death,   so   that the   company is   unwilling   to pay anything    for

the   privilege of owning this asset after             the person's death.      Also,    since

tariff revenue is distributed only to living persons, the individual has no

claim to tariff revenue after death to transfer to the insurer.                 We refer to

the sum of these two types of wealth as non—tangible assets.

        In the Yaari-Blanchard model, an individual born at time i will maximize

the expectation of the discounted stream of felicity of current consumption.

The objective function for an individual born at time                      i   is given by:

p is the domestic (cum tariff) price of good                  2.     The details of the derivation

of individual and aggregate consumption dynamics are given in the Appendix.

We make the assumptions that the felicity function, u)c1,c2), is homothetic

and displays constant relative risk aversion to allow linear aggregation of

individuals' consumption plans.

         important feature of the Yaari-Blanchard model is that the pure
        An

subjective rate of discount need not equal the world rate of interest to
assure convergence of aggregate per capital wealth and cons.nption to steady
state values under individual intertemporal optimization. Because individuals
face a positive probability of death at each instant, aggregate per capita
wealth can converge to a finite level when r exceeds 5, even though each
individual plans      to   accumulate unbounded wealth over an                 infinite horizon (and

                    the effects of increasing the tariff permanently at some
       Here we examine
time.   We are perticularly interested in the response of saving and the

current account. At the moment the tariff is imposed, the country's claims on
foreiers,        cannot junp. So, from equation (13), the effect of an

increase         in tariffs       on saving and        the   current account, starting from a

       In the case         in   which   the   import good     (good 2) is       not produced,      the   wage

rate, u,      the value of land, a, are unaffected by changes in the tariff,

Output of good 2, y2, is zero, and output of good 1 will not respond to tariff

Hence,      from (14),      (15)    and (16) it follows that an increase                 in   tariffs will

improve the current account              (increase saving)         when   the   personal      discount rate
is   less than       the    world    interest rate,         but   will worsen the current account

(lower   saving)         when the discount rate exceeds the world interest rate,

then the      effect of a tariff increase             on the current account is more positive

relative      to a starting position of current account balance, and vice—versa for
a current account initially in surplus.

         will   change when the tariff rises because the discounted value of tariff

revenuewill increase. This value depends on the expected amount of change in
expenditure currently and in the future. The appendix demonstrates that
starting from steady state

So,       dI/da    >   0.        Expenditure measured           in domestic   goods   prices necessarily
increases        as the tariff rises.

     In the complete                specialization                 medel, a tariff         increase leads         to an
increase       in spending             in       terms    of domestic          prices.          The tariff        revenue

generates         future        income          in     terms       of domestic          prices)   and,     therefore,

increases the value of non-tangible wealth.                                 If the increase in spending falls

short of the           increase in current                    tariff revenue         (ö    <   r), saving and the

current account increase, but if                        the    increase in spending exceeds the increase

in current revenue (5              >   r),      saving and the current account decline.

     In       models in which no new families                            are born and          there   is a perfect

bequest motive, if              there were no distortions in the                        economy (such as existing
tariffs) a        small increase in                  tariffs        would have no          effect on expenditure
(except possibly through a                      pure substitution effect                 which is ruled out here




                                                               13
by our    ass'snptions    on preferences)9 It is important                     to   note that in this

model   even when the     initial tariff         is zero, a      small      increase   in tariffs has   a
first   order   effect on expenditure.
        Consider for a     moment     for redistributing tariff revenue that
                                       a    scheme

makes the imposition of a tariff neutral.          Since tariff revenue is

proportional to expenditure measured in terms of the domestic good, I, a
subsidy to expenditure clearly would neutralize the effect of the tariff. In
this    case we know

                                                          +   Nt).
But,    then using    equation   (8),      we would have

                                                                +

Tariff revenue       would be given by

Notice    that in    this case   the    is effectively a proportional tax on total

        See Engel and Kletzer (1986)           for a demonstration of this in a              model   with
a representative consuser who has an infinite horizon and an endogenous rate
of time preference. Razin and Svensson (1983) discuss a pure substitution
effect     that is    ruled out by asslsnption in              this   model.     Because   the   felicity
function    is identical in all periods, and prices are constant, the exact price

index does not change over time in our set-up.

revenue is rebated as a proportional subsidy to total wealth. 10
     In contrast, under the lump—sum redistribution to living persons
considered in this section, the tariff is still a proportional tax on total
wealth;

                                                  aEi(w   +
                                           Rt                 Nt),
but    the revenue is returned purely as a subsidy to non-tangible wealth.                          The

tariff changes consumption because                 the redistribution        scheme    has   first-order
effects     on   expenditure.

        (hen there    is a               in the tariff, total wealth is taxed
                             permanent increase
at a greater rate both now and in the future. The tax on tangible wealth is a
fully-capitalized loss to living individuals (because of the perfect annuities
market (, The losses from the tax on future non—tangible wealth are only

partially capitalized by living individuals,                    A    neutral redistribution      scheme
would be         to return the revenue in an equal                      subsidy     to tangible     and

non-tangible wealth.          Any other scheme has consequences for total expenditure
measured atworld prices. For example, the lump-sum redistribution considered
in this section takes revenue from taxes on tangible and non-tangible wealth
and   redistributes    it    purely   as   a    subsidy to non-tangible assets.           In section 4

we    consider another non-neutral scheme in which the revenue                        is redistributed

    as a subsidy to tangible assets
         In this section, both forms of wealth are being taxed by the tariff but
    the revenue is all coming back as a lump—siso transfer. In the future, that
    revenue (which will be generated                  tax on physical assets and
                                                partially by    a

    partially by a tax on non-tangible assets) will be redistributed to all
    individuals who are alive at that time -- some of whom are not yet born.
    Thus, living individuals are not fully compensated for the burden of the tax
    they    bear.    The only neutral scheme     )                                    )   would give

    as a lump—sum      redistribution    to individuals living at any time      only      that   share
    of the revenue collected that is effectively a tax on non-tangible wealth.

    With lump—sum      redistribution of    revenues, the burden of the tax Is not spread

    across generations in the caine way           as    the redistribution of the revenue —-

    which   causes    the pattern of saving to change across generations.




    b.      Both Goods Produced


            In addition    to the effect on saving generated by redistri.ition of tariff
    revenue,      there   is an effect on total expenditure caused by changes in the
    factor    composition of income.        In a model where both        the ecport       and import

    good    are     produced   domestically,    and    there   are   at least   two       factors   of

—   production,       the change      in the domestic     relative price     of the goods has

    implications      for   snding levels.       In particular, if the tariff adjusts               the
            Eaton    (1987) considers     a similar model,      but   one   in which       there    are

    monopoly      fioms   that have   a claim on tariff revenue (yet another non—neutral

    redistribution scheme).

aggregate            saving may be altered.
          effect is separate from any impact the tariff iray have on saving by
           This
decreasing the total value of output at world prices from the distortionary

effects of non-lump--sum taxes, To make this point most forcefully, we will
first          consider a small             tariff starting            from   a point of free trade, so that
distortions               are second-order small.                Thus,     this effect is not present in those
models with no               new families and perfect bequest                     motives.
           It is useful         to    note from equation (3) above that                   the   value of land,
                                                                                                                  at'
can be expressed as


                                                            +         — (u —

The value of land equals the value of output at world prices less the                                     value    of

the       output of         labor   arid    the value of the tariff distortion of output.

          Also,          note that non-tangible            wealth can be        expressed as
                                                      (p—1)y2                      —  +      —t

          From equation (4),                expenditure      at domestic prices,                is proportional to

the       sum       of   tangible and non—tangible wealth.                      Examination of equations         (17)
and       (18)       reveal    how a change           in    tariffs will affect

section we saw  the effects of a permanent tariff increase on the sum of the
discounted values of future alS . But here there is an additional effect that
comes from changes               in   (.)   -                For example,          if the tariff raises the      wage

in wages on wealth and spending is negative, because the social discount rate

that values       the flow of inoome from tangible assets, r,                   is less than the

correspendin.ginterest rate for non—tangible assets, r+r, The future changes
in the product of land are fully capitalized into the current value of land

(because of the perfect annuities market), but future changes in wage inoome
are not (because in the future the laber force will consist only pertly of
thcse living now, and partly of some who are not currently alive). Unlike
models     where agents have infinite lives, a change in the source of factor

income has implications for the total value of wealth.

       A   simple expression can be derived              for the change in
                                                                                   I    when tariffs

increase, starting from initially free trade,                Note, first, in this case

The    first      this expression is identical to the one discussed at length
               term in
in the previous section, and the second term correspends to the effect
explained in the preceding paragraph. (Note that there is no change in y1 +

y2 if we start at free trade and have an infinitesimal increase in the tariff
rate.) The change in expenditure at world prices,         which in this case

equals the negative of the change in saving and the current account, is given
by:


                tht/dp   z   [)t-r)O'/U)r+fl)Y - [oA/r)r+nfldw/dp y2).         —

production structure.             In a Heckscher-Ohlin set-up,         in   which both goods   are
produced with intersectorally mobile land and labor, the rate will rise if the
protected sector is labor-intensive and fall if that sector is land-intensive.
The value of land will rise if the protected sector is land-intensive, and

conversely       if
               the protected sector is labor-intensive. The size of these
effects also depends upon the exact production function. Thus, taking into
account the effects of tariffs on factor prices makes the response of saving
to tariffs       ambiguous.
       [n a specific-factors          model   in which labor          is free to   move between

sectors, but other factors cannot, the increase in the tariff will raise the
wage in terms of the export good. The value of land in the export sector will

decline, and the value of land in the import sector will rise. Again, the
total effect of the tariff on saving is           ambiguous.
      The    general expression for the change in saving starting from a position
in whih a        tariff was   already   in place is given   by:

4.         Alternate Redistribution Scheme



           In the previous section, all tariff revenue was redistributed as lump—sum

transfers to the currently alive.                 This scheme has the effect of increasing

the value of non-tangible wealth (for the                   usual' case in which a rises with

the tariff rate),               An interesting alternative is the redistribution of tariff

revenue in the form of a subsidy to tangible assets.                        In this section, we

consider the remittance of all current tariff revenue through a linear subsidy

to holdings of tangible wealth.                 This scheme is identical to a reduction of

the tax             on non-wage income (interest and rents) financed by the tariff

increase in a model with a more complex fiscal policy in place.

           To isolate     the effect of the change in the redistribution plan,           we   assume

that       the      country is completely specialized in preduction of the exportable.

The    tariff revenue is redistributed in proportion              to each living individual's
tangible wealth, so that the aggregate transfer                       is       where          is   the

proportionate           rate.    The   effective market return   on   these assets becomes r + r
+
     •lt   >   0.
           Total tariff     revenue is given by
                                                aIr,
                                                     where a is as previously defined.

The telanced btdget requirement implies that

at all times. While              a   is a constant for a fixed tariff rate,     /3   will vary with

I and w,            Therefore, the model is now non—linear.

           In   the Blanchard. model, net holdings of tangible assets,                  can assome



                                                     20
negative values.           This can happen         if total        fo eign indebtedness exceeds the
total      value of     land. In order to          satisfy        eqution       (19), clearly       must be

negative in these cases, since           a                   are always pesitive.          Hence,    <   0

     <0,    and        >           >0.
        The dynamics of aggregate tangible wealth and consumption expenditure

valued in world prices are given by (see Appendix):

Using      (19) and recalling that
                                         z,        1—'' equation                (20) becomes


(22)


       Equations       (21) and L22)     are a dynamic                 system in two variables.          The

appendIx demonstrates the conditions under which this system is saddle stable.

An equation for the accumulation of foreign bonds near steady state is given

by

                                          b        X(bf
                                                             —   b).

As discussed at the beginning of section                          3,    the change in saving        and the

current     account        in response to a tariff increase,                starting from steady state,
has the     same   sign as the      change    in   L,    the long run           position   in international

bonds.

       Setting     z       0 and w = 0, steady-state             tangible wealth      is given by:




                                                        21
                                     -wa                     (r+0-6)/a
(23)

The stability conditions imply (1r—)r+B )/a)                                 >   0, so w      >   0        r+'3—S > 0   and

0       r+0—5   <   0.   From the discussion above, this implies S                                >    0      r+S—6 >0   and   S

    0      r+/3-d < 0.        More will be said about this presently

         Because    only the expert goad             is produced,                the tariff will not change the
value of land, which implies                d/dp         a    db/dp.        From (23) we have

                    db           w           )6+n)r               +     )r+13-t)2/a

This result is entirely plausible -— an increase in the subsidy to tangible

wealth increases the steady-state holdings of that type of wealth in the                                                   fon
of      foreign bonds.          We   need    to investigate                   how      13   ohsnges when         the     tariff
increases to understand the effects of                                tariffs        on     the current account.               in
those cases in which an inorease in p causes S to rise, saving and the current
account will rise, and when an increase in p leads to a decrease in 0, saving
and     the current account decline.
         Solving for relation (19) in steady                          state yields a quadratic relationship
between     a and 13:

(25)                                    ant     a    '3Nr         +13   —   6)/a),
where,

                                 &   a (r   +   IT   +   13   —    (r   + S      —   6)/al.
This implies that the constraint                     (19)         does not detennine S                     uniquely     for any

tariff rate.         For any given a, there are two choices for                                   73   that   satisfy (19).

         This is perhaps easi          at    to understand in the case in which there is no

tariff.      Clearly     (3    = 0 satisfies the government bodget constraint.                                     But it is



                                                               22
also true that                3   a   S —       r will ensure         a   balance       budget in steady-state. Soch
a choice will lead steady—state wealth to                                           be zero, so total subsidies will
also be zero.

r +    I   — S is positive                  ,    then   the derivative is positive if                         3   is    positive and

conversely.

       Figure           1    shows the relation between a and 3 when r                                   >       S.     This country

would      have    positive steady-state holdings of tangible assets in                                               the absence of

any subsidy to wealth or debt,                              When a is zero (p a             1),     3    is either zero or is

negative (a S -                   r).    For positive values of a, there is always a positive 3

that satisfies the gov'rnrnent                          budget constraint               )tne top half of the graph).

If this        3   is       chosen, then loarIy r 4                        —   5     is greater than zero, and steady

state w is positive.                      But        t is   also true for all positive values of                            a   there

is a negative value of 3                         <   5 -r which satisfies equation                       (19).         In this case,

r +    3   -   5   (    0,    and steady-state foreii debt exceeds the value of land (a is

negative).                  Here the tariff revenue is rebated as a subsidy to negative

holdings of tangible wealth.

       Figure 2 takes up the case in which                                          in the absence of subsidies                   the

country would be long-run debtors in tangible wealth -—                                              that         is,   the case in

which 5 > r.                 If a 15 zero, 7 is either zero or                              -   r    )    0.          Again, for any

positive       alue of a                there is a positive value of 3 'hat satisfies the balanced

budget requirement.                      In this case I >                  —   r,   whion   npiies that r + 1— S >                 0,
and        is positive.                 It is also the case that there is a negative value of 3

         The    government can always choose                            a value of     3   to ensure that long-run
foreign debt              is      less than the value of land (w > 0) if it so chooses and
vice—versa           if       i   wants     0). it can do so by altering the rape of return on

country's           international debt                       position, since in the aggregate the value of

land     holdings         cannot be altered.)                       Perhaps the surprising thing is that it           can

always       choose such              a    subsidy rate and            keep the   budget balanced       irrespective of
the relatIon of                   5   to   r.
         Lsing       equations              (24)         and (26) we can see how the current account must

change       as     tariffs increase                         Not   surprisingly,   when T       is   positive, so      is

positive, an increase in the                                 tariff    will    increase    the subsidy to tangible
wealth         and        therefore             iucrease           current    saving   ir.d    the    current   account,

Likewise,           when              is negative, so                   is   negative, as the tariff rises the

subsidy to tangible debt goes up, and present saving                                          and   the current   account

subsidy rate does not Jump discretely.

        In medels with only one generation of conanmers, tariffs influence saving

through changes in weaith caused by the tariff distortion.                        That channel of
influence is present           in our overlapping generations medel with uncertain

lifespans.13

       However      we emphasize other channels which are special in mudels in which

new     families     are     born.        The   tariff     can   change   total   wealth    through

rediatributing income between tangible and non-tangible assets.                      This happens

in    the   first   place   when   tariff   revenue   is   redistributed lmip—stsn and takes on

the   characteristics        of labor      income.    It also occurs because tariffs change

factor      prices, which in turn alter the distribution of wealth between land and
human   wealth.
       We also      ewplore a mechanism by which            the proceeds from tariffs can be

rebated       way to affect the incentives to hold tangible assets. We show
             in a
that government has some scope to significantly affect the net holdings of
international bonds while still maintaining budget balance.
     The analysis in this paper is purely positive.     Conclusions about the
welfare effects of the tariffs are not drawn, and would in general depend upon




13
    In the absence of distortions tariffs can change saving through the
substitution effect discussed in Razin and Svensson (1983). The effect is
non—zero when price ind              s   change over time.       That   is ruled out here   by   the
assumptions     of identical felicity functions over time and constant prices.

       First, we will show in this case A                              >   r   >   0.   Suppose A            <   0.    Then the

henoe a contradiction, so A                    >   0.

       Since A        >    0, it follows immediately                   from comparing the                a       0 root (which

equals r —          A),    that r — A < & < 0, so A > r.

          Equation     (17)   for    non-tangible          wealth         follows        directly     from   the

          The   expression for dlt/dp when p                   1        initially can be derived             from

If   u were unchanged and           y2   0,   as in section 3a,                 the derivative would          be

exactly the one in that section.              That is, we would have for the case of a                         0
