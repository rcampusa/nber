This paper makes two methodological contributions. First, it proposes a framework to decompose
total production activities at the country, sector, or country-sector level, to different types,
depending on whether they are for pure domestic demand, traditional international trade, simple
GVC activities, and complex GVC activities. Second, it proposes a pair of GVC participation
indices that improves upon the measures in the existing literature. We apply this decomposition
framework to a Global Input-Output Database (WIOD) that cover 44 countries and 56 industries
from 2000 to2014 to uncover evolving compositions of different production activities. We also
show that complex GVC activities co-move with global GDP growth more strongly than other
types of production activities.

1. Introduction

    This paper aims to provide a methodology to decompose production activities at the
country, sector, or country-sector level to different types depending on whether they are
for domestic demand without involving trade, “traditional” trade (without involving trade
in intermediate goods), simple global value chain (GVC) activities, or complex GVC
activities. It also aims to propose a new pair of GVC participation indices that have better
properties than the existing measures in the literature.
    As GVC intermediate inputs that cross national borders, the first major issue to be
resolved in GVC measurement is missing information on a division between final and
intermediate usages in customs trade statistics. Since traded products are classified by
customs product codes (such as the 10-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HS) in the US),
and owing to heterogeneity even within 10-digit HS product groups, properly identifying
their final usage is not an easy task. Furthermore, supply-chain trade or cross-border
production-sharing measures in the literature, such as “vertical specialization” (VS)
proposed by Hummels et al. (2001) or “import to produce” (I2P) and “import to export”
(I2E) proposed by Baldwin and Lopez (2013), are recursive concepts with pervasive
double counting.
    To overcome these difficulties, “factor content” or “value-added” trade, has emerged
as the primary measures of cross-border production-sharing activities. As production
factors such as land, labor, or capital are already measured, they are relatively easy to
classify. Therefore, we can classify production activities based on factor content
embodied in various products according to a uniform standard, which makes analytical
work tractable.

    In this paper, we propose a production activity decomposition framework that is
consistent with the System of National Accounts standard (SNA), classifying these
embedded factor content into GVC and non-GVC activities based on whether they cross
national borders for production or not. Value-added creation is only classified as GVC
activities when embodied factor content crosses national border for production purposes.
Domestic input-output coefficient matrix and import input-output coefficient matrix in an



                                              2
inter-country input-output (ICIO) table are used to distinguish between domestic and
foreign factor content in various production activities.
    We propose two ways to decompose production activities into different types,
corresponding to a producer’s perspective (based on forward industrial linkages) and a
user’s perspective (based on backward industrial linkages). Following these
decomposition formulas, we propose a pair of GVC participation indices that we show
have more desirable properties than the existing measures in the literature.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes how GVC and
Non-GVC activities are classified in our accounting framework and defines the new GVC
participation indices. Section 3 applies the framework and indices to a newly updated
global input-output database that covers 44 countries and 56 industries from 2000 to 2014
(Timmer, et al., 2016), and illustrates the advantages of our methods relative to the ones
in the literature. Section 4 documents evolving composition patterns of different types of
production activities and their co-movement with global output growth. Finally, Section 5
concludes.



2. Indexes for Participation in Global Value Chain Participations

2.1 Accounting basics of production activity
     Without loss generality, let us consider a world economy with G countries and N
sectors. Its economic structure is represented by the following Inter-Country Input-
Output (ICIO) model in Table 1:




                                              3

where Zsr is an N×N matrix of intermediate input flows that are produced in country s and
used in country r; Ysr is an N×1 vector giving final products produced in country s and
consumed in country r; Xs is also an N×1 vector giving gross outputs in country s; and
VAs denotes a 1×N vector of direct value added in country s. In this ICIO model, the input
coefficient matrix can be defined as                  , where       denotes a diagonal matrix with
the output vector X in its diagonal. The value added coefficient vector can be defined as
               . Gross outputs X can be split into intermediate and final products,
 . Rearranging terms, we can reach the classical Leontief (1936) equation,                       ,
where                    is the well-known (global) Leontief inverse matrix.
     The gross output production and use balance, or the row balance condition of the
ICIO table in Table 1 can be written as:
                                                                                          (1)


     Where                                       is a GN×GN diagonal block matrix of


domestic input coefficient,          is a GN×GN off-diagonal block matrix of imported input
coefficient,                   ,                                            is a GN×1 vector of
final goods and services production,                                         is a GN×1 vector of
final goods and service production for domestic consumption,                           is a GN×1


                                                 4
vector of final products exports,                                                      is a GN×1
vector of gross exports, denotes transpose operation.
     Rearranging equation (1) yields


                                                                                         (2)
where                    is defined as local Leontief inverse, a GN by GN diagonal block
matrix. Pre-multiplying with the GN by GN diagonal matrix               of direct value-added
coefficients, replacing X as BY, and further converting the 3 final goods and service
production vectors       ,    and    into GN by GN diagonal matrix ,             and    , we can
obtain the decomposition of value added and final products production simultaneously as
follows:


                                                                                          (3)
    Each element in the          matrix represents the value added from a source country-
sector directly or indirectly used in the production of final goods and services in a
particular country/sector. The element of row (s, i) and column (r, j) in the matrix,
           , is the total value added (direct and indirect) of sector i in country s embodied in
the final products produced by sector j of country r. Looking at the matrix along a row
yields the distribution of value added created from one country-sector that is absorbed by
final goods production in all country-sectors. Looking at the matrix along a column yields
the contribution of value added from all source country-sectors pairs that is embodied in
final goods and services produced by a particular country/sector.
    The         matrix can be decomposed into four GN by GN matrixes, each representing
domestic value-added generated or foreign value-added used by the industry in its
production of final products to satisfy different segments of the global market. Equation
(3) identifies, for each country-sector, three types of production activities:
     (1) Value added that is domestically produced and consumed (                 ). This value
added does not involve cross border trade. An example is haircut.
    (2) Value-added that is embodied in final product exports (              ). This embodied
domestic factor content crosses national borders for consumption only. It is similar to

                                                5
“traditional” trade such as “French wine in exchange for England cloth”, in the term
proposed by Borin and Mancini (2015) 1.
     (3) Value-added that is embodied in exports/imports of intermediate goods and
services (            ). Because it is used in production activities outside the source country,
it is part of the cross-country production sharing activities. Based on whether the value
added crosses borders once or more than once, this term can be further split into two
categories2:
     3a. Simple cross country production sharing activities (                      ). Domestic or/and
foreign value-added cross national border for production only once. Value-added
embodied in intermediate exports/imports that is used by a direct importing country to
produce products that are absorbed in the country. There are no indirect exports via third
countries or re-exports/re-imports of the source countries’ factor contents. An example is
Chinese value-added embodied in its steel exports to the US which is then used in US
house construction.
     3b. Complex cross country production sharing activities (                                           .
Domestic or/and foreign value-added embodied in intermediate exports/imports that is
used by partner country to produce exports (intermediate or final) for other countries. In
this case, the factor contents cross border at least twice. One example is the salaries of
Apple’s US designers that are embodied in the iPhones that are exported from China to
the US that are ultimately bought by American consumers; Another example is Japanese
value-added embodied in electronic chips installed in China-made toys that are export to
the United States3.
     To obtain some more intuition from Equation (3), especially what activities
constitute the complex GVCs, let us look at an example of a two-country (home country s
1
  In Ricard’s time, exports were 100% domestically produced value added, whereas today, many final
product exports from a country, foreign value added is always embodied and domestically produced value
added is only a part of the exports. However, using decomposition method based on input-output statistics,
we are still able to compute the portion of “traditional trade analytically.
2
  It is important to note that the inter-country input-output table does not separate country j’s domestic
value added produced by foreign owned firms located in country j from country j’s value added produced
by locally owned firms. This means that the decomposition is residence based rather than ownership based.
In particular, valued added generated by foreign owned firms in country j is not considered as part of GVC
activities if it does not involve cross border trade.
3
  Term 3b can be further divided into returned domestic value added and foreign value added based on
their final destinations of absorption. A detailed mathematical derivation and their relation with the
measures in the existing literature are provided in Appendix A.

and foreign country r) world with N tradable sectors. In this case, Equation (3) can be
rewritten in block matrix notations as follows:

            The economic meaning of the first three terms can be clearly observed from the
block matrixes in Equation (4): They all only involve local Leontief inverse L. The first
two terms involve only country s or country r’s own local inverse, implying that the
production activities measured by the two terms are all local activities.                                                        The third term
contains both countries local inverse as well as the direct import input coefficient matrix,
implying cross-country production sharing activities between the home and foreign
countries. Asr or Ars represent the direct link in one production stage.
            The last term is more complex, as it includes a global Leontief inverse B,
representing infinite iterations of direct input coefficient matrix A.                                                         It can be further
decomposed into two sub-terms: The diagonal elements are domestic value-added that
are exported first but eventually returned home; while the off-diagonal elements are re-
exported foreign value-added.

2.2 Decomposition value added and final goods production
       Summing up equation (3) along the row direction, we can decompose value-added
generated from each industry/country pair (GDP by industry) in terms of where it goes.

                                                                                                                                        (5)


       Summing up equation (3) along the column direction, we can decompose country-
sector final goods production in terms of where the value added comes from.

                                                                                                                                        (6) 4

            The first terms in both equations (5) and (6) represent value-added produced at
home and absorbed by domestic final demand without involving international trade; we

4
    A detailed mathematical derivation of equation (5) and (6) and their relations are provided in Appendix B.
                                                                            7
label them as V_D and Y_D respectively. The second terms in Equation (5) are domestic
value-added embodied in final product exports, and are labeled as V_RT and Y_RT,
respectively. Both of them are domestic production activities, but V_D and V_RT from
Equation (5) are the sum of value added from a country-sector used in all downstream
sectors; Y_D and Y_RT from equation (6) are the value added in a country sector that
sums up the value added from all upstream sectors. In general, VD and V_RT are
different from Y_D and Y_RT except at the country aggregate level.
       The third terms (3a) in the two equations are measures of simple GVC activities.
         from equation (5) is domestic value-added embodied in a country-sector’s
intermediate exports that is used by the direct importing country to produce its domestic
products that is consumed in that country, while            from equation (6) is foreign
value added in a country sector that is imported directly from partner countries and used
for domestically consumed products. Both cross borders for production only once and are
therefore referred to “simple GVC activities.”
       The fourth terms (3b) in the two equations involve value added that cross borders
more than once and are referred as complex GVC activities.             from equation (5)
is domestic factor content from a country-sector that is embodied in its intermediate
exports and used by a direct importing country to produce exports (intermediate or final)
for other countries;         from equation (6) is either returned domestic value-added or
foreign value added embodied in intermediate imports used by the home country to
produce its final products for either domestic use or exports. Because of indirect trade
through third countries,           and           are not the same except at their global
aggregates.
       The sum of the last three terms in equation (5) equals domestic value-added in
gross exports via forward linkages (DVA_F) as proposed by Koopman, Wang and Wei
(2014). The sum of the last two terms in Equation (6) minus returned domestic value
added equals foreign value added in the exporting country’s final goods production as
defined by Los, Timmer and Vries (2015).
       The downstream decomposition of GDP by industry based on forward linkages
can be illustrated as Figure 1a; and the upstream decomposition of final goods production
based on backward linkages can be depicted as Figure 1b.

2.3 Global Value-Chain participation indexes
   A firm can participate in international production sharing in four ways:
   (1) Exporting its domestic value-added in intermediate exports used by a direct
importing country to produce for domestic consumption;
   (2) Exporting its domestic value-added in intermediate exports used by a direct
importing country to produce products for a third country;
   (3) Using other countries’ value-added to produce its gross exports;
   (4) Using other countries’ value-added to produce for domestic use.
   In the existing literature, the VS and VS1 measures (expressed as percent of gross
exports), as proposed by Hummels et al., 2001, takes into account the middle two
channels.
   There are three areas the new indexes can improve upon. First, by excluding the first
and the last channels, the conventional measures potentially omit a large portion of
international production sharing activities.
   Second, by using gross exports as the denominator, the shares in the conventional
VS1 measures might be very high for sectors with very little direct exports (e.g., Mining
and Service). In such cases, the existing measure may overestimate GVC participation for
such country-sectors.
   Third, the conventional measures cannot distinguish between participation in simple
and complex GVC activities.
     Following the two decomposition formulas in Equations (5) and (6), we can fully
identify all the four possible ways a country-sector can participant in the global
production network and construct indexes that help us to measure the extent to which
production factors employed in a particular country-sector are involved in the global
production process. Accordingly, we define a pair of GVC participation indices at a
country-sector level.
     The first one describes the domestic value added generated from a country-sector’s
GVC activities through downstream firms as share of that country-sector’s total value
added, and can be expressed as follows:
                                                                                 (7)


                                               10
        The denominator on the right-hand-side of equation (7) is the total value-added
generated in production from that country-sector pair, and the numerator is the total
domestic value added of that country sector that is embodied in its intermediate exports to
the world. This measure differs from the conventional VS1 measure (as percent of gross
exports) in two ways: (a) it is based on value added rather than gross exports; (b) it is a
production concept rather than trade.

        A second participation index measures the percentage of a country-sector’s total
production of final goods and services that represent the value added that is involved in
GVC activities through upstream firms, and can be written as follows:

                                                                                    (8)

       This measure differs from the conventional VS measure (as percent of gross exports)
in two ways: (a) it is based on a net concept while VS is based on a gross concept; (b) it
is a production concept instead of trade. It includes not only foreign value-added
embodied in intermediate imports, reflecting the degree of foreign production factors’
participation in the home country-sector’s production of final products, but also domestic
factor content that has returned home through international trade to satisfy domestic final
demand.
       For the world as a whole, the sums of its numerator over all countries and sectors in
(7) and (8) equal to each other.5
       In summary, this pair of GVC participation indices provides a complete picture of a
country’s participation in GVCs based on whether the production factor content crosses
national borders for production. They take into account both forward and backward
industrial linkages. The former measures domestic value added generated from GVCs
production and trade activities as a share of total sector value added (GDP)., whereas the
latter measures the percentage of a country’s final goods production contributed by both
domestic and foreign factors that involve cross country production sharing activities. The
relative values of the two indices indicate a country-sector’s position in the global
production network. For instance, a higher degree of forward participation than backward

                                                    11
participation implies that the country/sector is more actively engaged in upstream
production activities in GVCs.



3. Numerical Results

    In this section, we apply the two GVC participation measures to the WIOD data
(2016 version, see Timmer et al., 2016, for an explanation of the database), which covers
44 countries and 56 industries over the time period from 2000 to 2014. The indexes can
be computed at both the most aggregated “world” level and a more disaggregated
“bilateral-sector” level. We will report a series of examples at various levels of
disaggregation.

3.1 Traditional indexes
    The share of VS and VS1 in gross exports, as proposed by Hummels et al. (2001),
are used to measure the extent of GVC participation by Koopman et al. (2010). Taking
the top 3 countries in terms of GDP (United Statas, China and Japan) and a typical
energy-exporting country (Russia) as examples, the VS and VS1 ratios shown in Figure 2
can provide us with useful information of GVC participation from at least two aspects: (1)
Generally speaking, the degree of participation for most countries increase over the time
period 2001 to 2011; (2) The upward trend of Vertical Specification has been temporarily
interrupted by the global financial crisis (2009), and slowed down or reversed after the
year 2012.

3.2 The new GVC Participation indexes
    The forward linkage based participation index as address the question of “What
percentage of production factors employed in a country-sector pair has been involved in
cross country production sharing activities?” The backward linkage based participation
index can be understood as answering the question of “What percentage of final products
produced by a country-sector that comes from GVC activities?”

(1) Country level
     We continue with the examples of the United States, China, Japan and Russia.
Figure 3 plots both participation indexes from 2000-2014.

    Figure 3 Forward/Backward Participation Indexes, 2000 to 2014




    While there are similarities between the new and the conventional indices, there are
also clear differences between the two. For instance, while the new index shows that
Russian’s participation based on forward linkages has been on the decline, the
conventional VS1 measure might give the opposite impression. As another example,
China shows a higher degree of forward participation than the United States and Japan
according to the new measure, but the conventional VS1 measure would give the
opposite result. One reason is a much higher ratio of gross exports to GDP for China than
for the other two countries. The traditional measure, by using gross exports as the
denominator, under-estimates China’s GVC participation relative to the US and Japan.
    We can visualize the forward and backward GVC participation indexes jointly in a
scatterplot as shown in Figure 4. The two red dotted lines indicate the world’s average
forward and backward participation ratios. Since most countries fall along the 45-degree
line, we conclude that countries that have a high degree of forward participation also
tends to have a high degree of backward participation. Major resource exporters such as
Norway, Russia and Australia, deviate from the 45-degree line from the above: since
natural resources are in the most upstream sectors, these economies tend to have much
higher degree of forward participation than backward participation.

(2) Sectoral level
     The intensity of GVC participation varies by sector. Table 2a and 2b reports both
GVC participation indexes by four sector groups (Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing
and services) and their changes over 15 years. In 2014, mining simultaneously has the
highest forward participation ratio and second lowest backward participation ratio (48.1%
and 11.3%, respectively), which is consistent with its upstream position in global
production network. Manufacturing has the highest backward linkage based participation
ratio (24.6%) and second highest forward linkage based index (24.1%); this suggests that
manufacturing both produces and uses intermediate manufacturing products.

     The service sector has the lowest participation ratios for both the forward and
backward linkages, but its participation ratio has grown relatively fast.

    Across the sectors, we can also plot the forward participation ratios against the
backward participation ratios. Figure 5 shows such a plot for 2014. Generally speaking,
most service sectors (represented by the green dots) tend to in the lower left corner,
meaning that they have low participation in GVC activities by either measure. Mining
(the purple dot) is in the upper left corner, indicating a high degree of forward
participation but a low degree of backward participation. In comparison, many
manufacturing sectors (red dots) tend to be in the upper right portion of the graph,
reflecting their active participation in GVCs both as producers and buyers of intermediate
goods.

              Figure 5 GVC participation Indexes, Sectoral Level, 2014




(3) Country-Sector level
     We can compute GVC participation at the country-sector level. As an illustration,
we pick two sectors – “refined petroleum” and “machinery and equipment” for six
countries in Table 3.
     Since Russia is a major energy producer and exporter, its refined petroleum’s
forward participation ratio, at 38.7%, is the highest among the six countries, while its
backward participation ratio is only 6.2%.
     Japan shows a reverse pattern in refined petroleum: it has a high backward
participation ratio (56.2%) but a relatively low forward participation ratio.
     In machinery and equipment, Germany is revealed as the main global powerhouse as
a supplier. Its forward participation ratio at 34.1% is higher not only than China and India
(13.1% and 10.6%, respectively) but also than Japan and the United States (19.4% and
16.4%, respectively).
     The backward participation ratios are also informative. For developing countries
such as China and India, their backward participation in GVC activities related to
machinery and equipment tends to be stronger than their forward participation; this is
                                             17
consistent with the observation that they rely more on imported parts and components
from advanced countries than they can provide to the world as suppliers. In comparison,
Germany’s backward participation ratio is notably lower than its forward participation.
On the other hand, for the United States and Japan, the backward and forward
participation ratios are more balanced.

For each sector, we can generate a scatter plot of the two participation ratios across
countries. Figure 6 presents the results for four sector groups. Generally speaking, for
manufacturing, service and agriculture sectors, most countries are distributed around the
45-degree line. For most countries, the average level of GVC participation is higher in
manufacturing sector than that in the service or agriculture sectors. In the mining sector,
the forward participation ratio is generally higher than backward participation for most
countries.

3.3 Advantages of the new “GVC Participation Index”

(1) Correcting a bias in traditional indexes

     As mentioned previously, using gross exports as the denominator may lead to an
upward bias at the bilateral/sectoral level. For comparison, we compute both forward
linkage based participation index, the conventional VS1 (as share of gross exports) and
the new participation index GVCPt_f, and GVC activities as share of sector GDP,
respectively. As shown in Table 4, the VS1 shares for 7 out of 56 industries are
substantially larger than 100%. These industries have one thing in common: a great
proportion of their value added is exported indirectly, which is embodied in other
                                               19
industries’ exports. This makes the conventional VS1 measure less desirable at the sector
or bilateral sector level.

     The upward bias is more pronounced for utility and service sectors, as a large
proportion of their value added is exported indirectly.

(2) Differentiating “simple” and “complex” GVC participation

     As discussed in section 2, the domestic value added in gross intermediate exports of
a country can be decomposed into two major parts: DVA crossing the national border for
production only once (GVC_S), representing the type of cross border specialization that
is relatively simple; DVA cross border two or more times (GVC_C, representing the type
of cross border specialization that is more complex, which can be further decomposed
into two parts based on where these embodied factor content ultimately absorbed
Traditional GVC participation indexes cannot make such distinguish, while by our newly
defined indexes, both can be identified and quantified.
     As illustrate by figure 7, the “simple” and “complex” parts of GVC participation are
different in size and the trend of change. The simple part takes a relatively large
proportion, but its relative importance is diminishing over time for almost all countries in
the sample. Instead, the domestic value added exported via complex production sharing
activities is increasing dramatically.


                          Figure 7 Simple GVC production activities

                                               21
       In addition, the relative sizes of returned factor content in total GVC production
activities in different countries may reflect the different roles played in the GVCs by
different countries. Taking 10 countries with largest GDP in year 2014 as examples, as
shown in Figure 8, factor content that “re-imported and absorbed domestically,” accounts
for a substantially larger proportion in the US, followed by China and Germany, as the
US and Germany are controlling both ends (design and sales) of the value chain, and
China serves as the “world's factory” and the world’s largest consumption market.

4. Application: Economic Growth and GVC Participation

4.1 Salient facts

       The world economy expanded relatively fast from 2000 to 2007, experienced a
severe global financial crisis during 2008-2009, which is followed by a slow but uneven
recovery afterwards. We use our decomposition formulas in Equations (5) and (6) and
trace out the evolution of the types of production activities during this period. The results
are reported in Figure 9.
       A few patterns are noteworthy. First, pure domestic activities (use of domestic
factors to produce for domestic final demand) still account for the lion share of overall
production activities, but its relative importance is decreasing over time (Figure 9).
Second, among the three parts of production related to international trade, value added in
traditional trade does not increase as fast as value added in GVC trade, and the share of
value added involved in complex GVCs exhibit the fastest increase. Third, the shares of

                                             22
value added in all types of trade suffer a decline during the global financial crisis of
2008-2009 (and correspondingly, the share of value added in production for domestic
demand exhibits an increase in the same period). The recovery of the GVC trade after
2009 was slow and exhibit another phase of decline after 2011. This pattern is especially
pronounced for value added in complex GVC activities.

                 Figure 9: Evolving Trends of Different Production Activities
                            as a Share of Global GDP (2000–2014)




    To see these patterns from another angle, we present annual growth rates for value
added in different types of production activities (Figure 10). During 2001-2008, there had
been a dramatic expansion of GVC activities, especially the complex production-sharing
activities. The global financial crisis produced a contraction of world production and
world trade in 2009, and the decline was the steepest for complex GVC trade, followed
by simple GVS trade. A rapid recovery of GVC activities was observed for two years
(2010-2011) following the global financial crisis, the growth turned lukewarm since 2012.

          Figure 10 Nominal growth rates of different value added creation activities
                  during the global business cycle, global level (2000–2014)




    We can investigate the evolution of value added in different types of production
activities by sector; this is useful if one wonders whether the picture in Figure 10 is
dominated by commodity price swings over time.
    We report the sector-level patterns on shares of value added in different types of
activities in Figures 11a and 11b. Across all sectors, before the global financial crisis, the
share of value added in trade, especially in complex GVC trade, grew fast (which
produce a corresponding decline in the share of value added in production for domestic
demand). The global financial crisis produced a sharp reversal of this pattern, but the pre-
crisis pattern resumed during 2010-2011, before it becomes bogged down again after
2012.

4.2 Econometric Analysis

    The discussion in Section 4.1 suggests a possible link between the expansion and
recession of aggregate economic activities and the share of GVC trade in total production
activities. A number of recent papers have suggested that joining GVCs can bring
                                              25
positive and significant gains in productivity and technology spillover for the
participating counties thus improving their economic growth (Baldwin and Yan, 2014;
OECD 2014; IMF, 2015, World Bank 2016). This is because integration into GVCs
reflects finer division of labor and task specialization, which enables firms to exploit finer
niches consistent with their comparative advantage. However, none of these studies
decomposes trade into traditional trade, and simple and complex GVC activities.
     In this sub-section, we investigate the correlation between a country-sector’s total
value added growth and its participation in trade in general and GVC trade in particular.
Given the data patterns in Figures 9 to 11, we consider four sub-periods: fast growth
period (2002 to 2008), global financial crisis (2009), after-crisis recovery period (2010
and 2011) and the growth slow down period (2012-2014).

              ΔlnVAict = β0 + β1×V-Shareict + β2×Wct + β3× Zit + γt + δc + uict
where
     ΔlnVAict equals to the change of sectoral GDP, ln(VAict) minus ln(VAict-1), which
quantifies the degree of economic growth (or recession) in industry i of Country c;
     V-Shareict is the share of different types of value added creation activities in sectoral
GDP (D and RT shares, Simple and Complex GVC Participation indexes), which are
derived from the industry level GDP decomposition based on forward-cross country,
inter-industrial linkages;
     Wct and Zit represent country and sectoral level control variables, including GDP per
capita, hours worked by high and medium-skilled workers (share in total hours), and
capital intensity defined as share of capital return in value added.
     We also control for the year and country fixed effects by including a year dummy γt
and a country dummy δc in the model.

     The benchmark regression results are shown in Table 6. Each row represents a
regression. For both the full sample and the manufacturing sector sub-sample, we see a
positive association between GVC participation and economic growth (Period A, B and
C), and the estimated impact of complex GVC is larger and more significant than simple
GVC. On the other hand, a larger share of pure domestic production activities (D) has a
negative association with economic growth. In comparison, there is no clear link between
the share of value-added in traditional trade and economic growth.
     During the global financial crisis in the year 2009, all trade-related production
activities, (both RT and GVC) were negatively affected. The higher the shares in GVC

                                                 27
activities, especially the complex GVC activities, in total GDP, the greater the degree of
such negative impact.
     The relationship between economic growth and different types of production
activities become weak and unclear after 2012.
     When we include year and country fixed effects (Table 7), as well as other country
and sectoral level control variables (Table 8) in our regression, the results still hold.

    We also divide the sample into two country group sub-samples: advanced economies (Table
9a) and developing countries (Table 9b) 6 . We find that the association between GVC
participation and economic growth is more pronounced in advanced economies.

5. Conclusion

        In this paper we propose a production activity accounting framework based on whether
factor content crosses national borders for production or not. This allows one to decompose a
country/sector’s GDP and final goods production into pure domestic activities and GVC
production activities. We show that a pair of GVC participation indices built on such framework
have more desirable properties than the existing ones in the literature.
        Applying our tools to the most up-to-date inter-country input-output database (WIOD,
2016), we show that complex GVC was the most important driving force for globalization and
co-moves strongly with the growth of global GDP, both in booms and in recessions. Our work at
this point only documents an association, investigating causal relations will be a fruitful future
project.

Appendix A: Derivation of term 3b in Equation (3)
     The term 3b in equation (3) can be further divided into returned value added and foreign
value added based on their final destinations of absorption.


                                                                                            (A1)


     Where           is a diagonal matrix of           with sub-matrics, and       is a off-diagonal
matrix of         with sub-matrics.                     is the returned value added embodied in
intermediate exports and further returned home country for production of final goods and
services,                             is the value added embodied in intermediate exports that is
used by partner country to produce exports of final products or intermediate inputs for other
countries’ production of final goods and services that are eventually re-exported and consumed
abroad.


Appendix B: Proof of Equations (5) and (6)
     As equation (2) in main text, the gross input production can be written as:


                                                                                             (B1)
     Pre-multiplying with the GN by GN direct value-added diagonal matrix ,


                                                                                             (B2)



     The gross input production and use balance, or the column balance condition of the ICIO
table in Table 1 can be written as:
                                                                                             (B3)
     Rearranging the equation (B1) yields
                                                                                             (B4)

                                                  33
     Inserting the final products production as a diagonal matrix into equation (B4), the
decomposition of final products production based on the Leontief model can be expressed as
follows:
                                                                                          (B5)
     Expanding equation (B5), final products production at each country/sector pair can be
decomposed into five different parts as follows:
                                                                                          (B6)




Appendix C: Two GVC participation indexes at global level, based on forward and backward
industrial linkages, respectively
       As shown in Equations (6) and (7), the GVC participation indexes based on forward and
backward industrial linkage can be defined as

                                                                                          (C1)

                                                                                          (C2)

       Aggregating to the world level

                                                                                          (C3)

                                                                                          (C4)

     Obviously, the numerators in equations (C3) and (C4) are the same. Therefore, GVC
participation indexes based on forward and backward industrial linkage equal each other at the
global level.
