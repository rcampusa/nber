                                             ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether attacks against Israeli targets help Palestinian factions gain public
support. We link individual level survey data to the full list of Israeli fatalities during the period of
the Second Intifada (2000-2006), and estimate a flexible discrete choice model for faction supported.
We find some support for the “outbidding” hypothesis, the notion that Palestinian factions use violence
to gain prestige and influence public opinion within the community. In particular, the two leading
Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, gain in popularity following successful attacks against Israeli
targets. Our results suggest, however, that most movement occurs within either the secular groups
or the Islamist groups, and not between them. That is, Fatah’s gains come at the expense of smaller
secular factions while Hamas’ gains come at the expense of smaller Islamic factions and the disaffected.
In contrast, attacks by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad lower support for that faction.

1. Introduction

          The Second Palestinian Intifada has been characterized not only by the intensity of

violence between the Palestinians and Israel, but also by the struggle between the different

Palestinian factions for supremacy within the Palestinian community. The Intifada has had

profound consequences for the whole Palestinian political landscape. For example, Hamas, an

Islamist movement responsible for more than 40 percent of Israeli fatalities between 2000 and

2005, secured a large victory in the 2006 elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council.1 Can

Hamas’s electoral success be linked causally to its violent campaign against Israeli targets? In

this paper we seek to answer this question specifically, and, more broadly, we investigate the

extent to which Palestinian factions can use violence to win public support from their

constituents.

         Mia Bloom (Bloom 2004, 2005) has hypothesized that Palestinian factions are engaged in

competition for leadership within the community and use attacks against Israeli targets to

increase their prestige and influence the preferences of the Palestinian population. There are a

number of potential theoretical explanations for why attacks against Israelis could boost public

support for the faction responsible. A first possibility is that violence against Israel can be

viewed as a public good. The Palestinian public has a taste for retaliation against Israel’s actions

(de Figuereido and Weingast 2001), and therefore factions that are able to successfully attack

1
    Hamas eventually took control of the whole Gaza Strip after forcing out Fatah forces loyal to

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in June 2007. As a result of the 2007 violence, the

territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority is today de facto divided into two entities, the

Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and a Fatah-controlled West Bank.




                                                 1
Israeli targets gain in popularity. This model predicts that successful attacks by a given faction

will raise support for that faction at the expense of all other factions.

        A second closely related explanation is that successful attacks are used as a device that

signals the faction’s ability to deliver public goods. Successful attacks reveal that the faction is

of “high quality” and will also be effective in the provision of other public goods such as

schools, hospitals, and other social services. This argument is directly made by Lapan and

Sandler (1993) and by Kydd and Walter (2006), and also implied in the analysis put forward by

Berman and Laitin (2008) to explain the effectiveness of religious radicals in conducting violent

insurgent campaigns. According to Berman and Laitin (2008), radical groups are able to conduct

effective campaigns because the prohibitions they impose on their members allow them to select

only those most committed to the cause and those less likely to defect. Hence, successful attacks

against Israeli targets signal that the faction responsible has highly committed members, and that

those members will not be tempted by corruption and will deliver good governance in other

dimensions of public activity as well.

        As in the “violence as public good” model, the “violence as signal” model predicts that

successful attacks by a given faction will raise support for that faction at the expense of all other

factions. Both of these explanations predict that violence by a given faction will raise support

for that faction. This need not necessarily be the case, however. An alternative theory posits that

Palestinians commit acts of violence to provoke an indiscriminate violent Israeli response.

Israeli indiscriminate violence in turn, causes the overall radicalization of the Palestinian

population, mostly because they dampen economic opportunities in the market economy (Bueno

de Mesquita and Dickson, 2007; Blomberg et al., 2004). Therefore, only radical factions, such

as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), benefit from violence, whereas relatively




                                                   2
moderate factions such as Fatah will lose public support in response to violence by any of the

factions.2

          To answer these questions, we have assembled a unique data set that links micro-level

survey data on Palestinian public opinion to the complete list of Israeli and Palestinian fatalities

from the outset of the second Intifada up to the end of 2005. Moreover, we have identified for

each Israeli fatality the district of origin of the attacker and his or her organizational affiliation.

To study the effect of violence on Palestinian public opinion, we estimate a completely flexible

discrete choice model where we allow the choice of faction supported to depend on the number

of Israeli fatalities claimed by each faction in the three months preceding the survey. We control

for potential endogeneity between local public support and violent activity by including a full set

of district dummies in each of our regressions. Hence, the effect of interest is identified from

variation within districts and over time in violence and public opinion. The model is flexible in

the sense that the effect of the number of Israeli fatalities claimed by Hamas, say, on support for

Hamas is not restricted to be the same as the effect of the number of Israeli fatalities claimed by

Fatah on support for Fatah. Similarly, no restrictions are imposed on any of the cross-effects

(i.e., the effect of violence by one faction on support for other factions).

          We find some support for the outbidding hypothesis, with one notable exception. For the

two main factions, Fatah and Hamas, successful attacks against Israeli targets are associated with

an increase in public support, even though the effect is rather small, and statistically significant

only for the latter. Contrary to the predictions of the outbidding model, support for both of these

    Garfinkel (2004) also studies the effects of terrorism on domestic politics, but focuses on the

struggle for power within the entity that is subject to an external terrorist threat.




                                                   3
factions remains essentially unchanged when the other faction engages in violence. Fatah’s and

Hamas’ gains in support from successful attacks against Israelis do not come at the expense of

each other’s support. Rather, Hamas gains public support mostly at the expense of other Islamist

groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the disaffected (those who support no one), while Fatah

gains mostly at the expense of supporters of other secular groups like the Popular and

Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP and DFLP, respectively). Notably,

Israeli fatalities caused by PIJ are associated with a large and statistically significant decrease in

support for it, as well as a decrease in support for Hamas, while the ranks of the disaffected

increase. These results suggest that to the extent that violence causes shifts in support, these

shifts occur largely within either the secular (Fatah, PFLP and DFLP) or Islamist (Hamas, PIJ)

factions and not between the secular and Islamist groups.



2. Data

       For the purposes of the current study we combine two separate data sets: one describes

the political preferences of the Palestinian population while the other contains detailed

information on all the Israeli and Palestinian fatalities during the second Palestinian uprising.

       The information on Palestinians’ political preferences comes from a set of surveys

conducted by the Development Studies Programme (DSP) at Bir Zeit University. This institute

has conducted regular public opinion polls on all aspects of Palestinian life since the year 2000.

Every poll has around 1,200 observations, with approximately two thirds of them from the West

Bank and Jerusalem and the rest from the Gaza Strip. General information on these polls,

including summary results and demographic information are available from Jaeger et al. (2010).




                                                  4
          In this paper, we focus exclusively on the preferences of the Palestinian population across

the different Palestinian political factions. The exact wording of the question of interest is

“Which of the following political groups do you support?” The available answers include Fatah

and Hamas, the two major Palestinian factions during the time period of interest. They also

included other popular factions like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad as well as the Popular Front for

the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine

(DFLP), the two main leftist factions. In addition, respondents who stated that they were

independent were asked whether their preferences leaned towards Fatah, to one of the Islamic

factions, or to one of the leftist factions. We coded independents leaning towards one of the

factions together with that faction’s outright supporters. We also coded all the Islamic factions

(except Hamas) together with PIJ. The question on political support appeared in 15 polls

between February 2001 and May 2006, for a total of 17,406 observations.3

          Figure 1 depicts the evolution of Palestinians political preferences over time.        We

summarize these movements on an annual basis in Table 1. Over the whole period of interest,

support for Fatah is on average 29.1 percent while Hamas receives 23.0 percent of the

population’s support. The support for PIJ equals almost ten percent, very similar to the support

enjoyed by other groups (comprised mostly by the leftist groups PFLP and DFLP). Notably, the

proportion of respondents reporting that they do not support any group was 28.5 percent, nearly

as large as the proportion supporting Fatah. This suggests that a large fraction of the Palestinian




3
    In particular, this question appeared in three surveys in each of the years 2001, 2003, 2004 and

2006, in two surveys in 2002, and in one survey in 2005.




                                                   5
population feels disaffection from the Palestinian political factions. We address this issue in our

empirical analysis and characterize the attitudes of this group.

       Focusing on the factions’ average support over the entire time period of interest masks,

however, interesting secular shifts in the political preferences of the Palestinian population that

occurred over time. The support for Fatah began at around 23 percent in 2001 and peaked in

September 2005 at 43.72 percent. After the death of Yasser Arafat, support for Fatah increased

by more than 10 percentage points. Support for Hamas has also been variable, reaching its

lowest point of about 15 percent in early 2003 and peaking at nearly 40 percent in March 2006.

Support for PIJ and the other Islamic faction has been relatively steady except for in 2003 when

it increased substantially, largely at the expense of support for Hamas.           The degree of

disaffection (support for no one) and other groups was relatively high in the first years of the

Intifada, but has declined since 2003, seemingly mostly to the benefit of Fatah.

       Information on Israeli and Palestinian fatalities during the second Intifada is taken from

B’tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. B’tselem’s data (thought to be accurate, reliable,

and comprehensive) are widely used in studies focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

(Becker and Rubinstein 2008, Jaeger and Paserman 2006, 2008, 2009, Gould and Klor 2010, and

others). The data include information on the date, location, and circumstances of each fatality

(excluding suicide bombers), which allows us to classify every Palestinian fatality according to




                                                 6
the Palestinian district where the incident took place, and every Israeli fatality according to the

district where the attack originated.4

         We then cross-validated the B’tselem data with data downloaded between 2005 and 2006

from the web site of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) in Hertzliya, Israel

(http://www.ict.org.il),5 from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from published

newspaper reports from the Jerusalem Post and other media outlets. These data were used to

identify the group claiming responsibility for every Israeli fatality. Thanks to the use of multiple

sources, we were able to identify the faction responsible for the attack for 99 percent of all Israeli

fatalities.6

        This paper’s primary concern is not how Palestinian public opinion varies with the number

of fatalities (an issue we have previously explored in Jaeger, et al. 2010), but rather whether

public opinion varies with violence claimed by different factions. In Figure 2 we show the share

    In the isolated instances in which it was not possible to identify the district of origin of the

attacker, we assumed that the district of origin was the Palestinian district nearest to the place of

the attack.

    The database with information on all fatalities during the Intifada is no longer publicly

available on the ICT web site.
6
    Israeli fatalities unaccounted for are classified as claimed by “other” groups. There is a small

number of cases in which more than one group claimed responsibility for an attack, or an attack

was carried out jointly by more than one group. In these cases, we tried to use the best of our

own judgment to assign a unique faction to each fatality. Excluding these cases from the

analysis has no substantive effect on the results.




                                                     7
of Israeli fatalities claimed by the different factions aggregated quarterly (there are too few

fatalities for this graph to be meaningful at the weekly level). There is a fair amount of

variability in which faction claims responsibility. Prior to the 2005 Hudna, or period with a

cease-fire, most fatalities are claimed by either Fatah or Hamas, with Palestinian Islamic Jihad

and other Islamic factions occasionally becoming the primary actors. After 2005, nearly all

fatalities are claimed by PIJ and other groups. Thus, there is a large degree of variation to

identify our model of outbidding.



3. Empirical Framework

        We set up a discrete choice model to study the effects of Palestinian and Israeli violence

on support for the different Palestinian factions. We start from a random utility model where we

specify the individual’s utility from each one of the five different possible choices: Fatah,

Hamas, PIJ, Others and No One, labeled from 0 to 4. Let Ujidt be the utility from faction j for

individual i living in district d at time t :
                                 3

            U jidt = α ʹ′j Pdt + ∑ βʹ′jkIkdt + Xidt Φ j + δ tj + µdj + ε jidt ,   for j = 0,1,...,4.     (1)
                                k =0



where Pdt is a vector of lags of Palestinian fatalities that occurred in district d at time t;            is a
 €
vector of lags of Israeli fatalities caused by faction k, originating from district d at time t (notice

that         , since there are no fatalities claimed by “No One”, faction number 4);                      is a

vector of individual, district, or time-specific characteristics; δtj is a faction-specific, time fixed

effect; µdj is a faction-specific, district fixed effect; εjitd is an error term with a type-1 extreme


value distribution; and                                      are parameters to be estimated (we already impose




                                                               8
here the normalization that                            are all equal to zero, which is necessary for

identification).   As is well known, this model gives rise to the multinomial logit choice

probabilities. That is, the probability that individual i chooses faction j is equal to:



                                                                                                  (2)



        We will also estimate a simplified version of equation (2), where we look at the effect of

overall Israeli fatalities on support for the different factions. This equation will tell us more

generally how violence against Israeli targets affects public opinion. The choice probabilities

then become:



                                                                                                 (2’)




        It is worth remarking on a number of features of equation (2).

    1) Flexible specification. The model assumes that the utility derived from a given faction

depends not only on the number of (lagged) Israeli fatalities claimed by that faction, but also on

the number of Israeli fatalities claimed by all other factions. This allows a completely flexible

pattern of own and cross effects. That is, it is possible that fatalities claimed by one faction (say,

Hamas) raise public support for that faction, while fatalities claimed by a different faction (say,

PIJ) lower support for it. Also, fatalities claimed by one faction may raise public support for that

faction, but this does not need to be at the expense of all the other factions: some factions may

enjoy positive spillover effects from the violence claimed by some of its rivals. Finally, the


                                                   9
flexible specification allows us to learn something about the pattern of competition between the

different factions: for example, if Hamas gains public support as a result of a high number of

Israeli fatalities claimed by it, does this come at the expense of Fatah, its main rival for the

leadership of the Palestinian Authority, or at the expense of PIJ, a faction that is probably closer

to Hamas in policy space?

   2) Lag structure. The vectors Pdt and               contain several lags of Palestinian and Israeli

fatalities. Following our previous work (Jaeger et al., 2010), we allow fatalities in each one of

the three four-week periods prior to the survey to have a different effect on the choice

probabilities. The vector Pdt is defined as                           , where Pdt-s is the number of

Palestinian fatalities that occurred in district d in the sth four-week period prior to the survey

date. Similarly,                        , where        is the number of Israeli fatalities claimed by

faction k and originating in district d in the sth four-week period prior to the survey date.

Therefore, the choice probabilities become:




with




       Given this definition, the individual elements of αj and βjk represent the effect of a one-

time increase in violence occurring exactly in one of the three four-week periods before the

survey on the support for faction j. Since the time pattern of the coefficients may be difficult to

interpret, we also report results from simulations where we introduce a permanent increase in the




                                                  10
number of fatalities claimed by each one of the factions, and study the effect of this change on

the different choice probabilities.

   3) Time and district fixed effects. The inclusion of time and district fixed effects is key

for our analysis. There is substantial variability in the number of Israeli and Palestinian fatalities

across Palestinian districts. If the Palestinian population is sorted across districts according to

their political preferences and violence occurs mainly in radical districts, a simple cross-sectional

analysis would yield a spurious correlation between radical attitudes and violence.               The

availability of longitudinal data allows us to exploit both the time series and the cross-sectional

variability in our analysis. The inclusion of district fixed effects allows to hold constant time-

invariant district attributes, and to achieve identification only from the within-district variation in

political attitudes and in the number of fatalities. Similarly, the inclusion of time fixed effects

allows us to control for common factors that affect support for the different factions uniformly

across all districts at a point in time (e.g., the death of Arafat, and the surge in support for Fatah

that came with it).

       Finally, we must recognize that our empirical strategy may yield a biased estimate of the

causal effect of Palestinian violence on support for the different factions, if the factions respond

endogenously to swings in public opinion by engaging in attacks against Israeli targets. If this

were the case, our coefficients would be picking up the effect of public opinion on Israeli

fatalities, rather than the effect of fatalities on public opinion. We are somewhat reassured that

this is not the case, because we do not find any evidence that Israeli fatalities in the weeks that

follow the survey are correlated with the share of support for the different factions (results

available upon request). The reason for this is that probably attacks against Israeli targets require

a substantial amount of planning, so that it is unlikely that the number of fatalities will respond




                                                  11
very rapidly to changes in public opinion. While this evidence does not completely rule out the

possibility of reverse causality, we believe that it is unlikely that it will affect the results

substantively.



4. Results

       We initially examine the effect of overall Israeli and Palestinian violence on support for

the different Palestinian factions.     As explained in the previous section, we estimate a

multinomial logit model for faction supported. The results are presented in Table 2. To facilitate

comparison across tables, we present the marginal effects of violence on the support for each

faction, rather than the multinomial logit coefficients. In addition to the individual marginal

effects for the number of Palestinian and Israeli fatalities at different lag lengths, we also report

the sum of the three marginal effects. This number tells us the effect of a permanent one-unit

increase in the number of fatalities.

       The results from this analysis show that increases in Palestinian fatalities shift support

away from all the political factions in the short run. The size of the decrease in political support

for Palestinian factions, however, is not statistically or quantitatively significant. The greatest

shift is away from Fatah, and it translates into a decrease in support of roughly one percentage

point in the four weeks prior to a poll for every ten additional Palestinian fatalities. This shift

away from political factions in the short run is not only small, but it also dissipates over time. As

a consequence, Palestinian fatalities do not cause a permanent shift on the preferences of the

Palestinian population, as can be seen from the fact that the sum of the marginal effects is always

small and insignificant.




                                                 12
       Contrary to the changes suffered by all the political factions, we observe a significant

increase in the number of disaffected Palestinians in the short run.            The coefficient on

“supporting no one” is, by construction, equal to the sum of the coefficients on support for all

other alternatives but with opposite sign. This significant shift towards disaffection may also

reflect radicalization as well as disaffection: Jaeger et al. (2010) show that preferences of

disaffected Palestinians are more radical than the preferences of supporters for Fatah, PLFP and

DFLP but less radical than the preferences of Hamas and PIJ supporters. It is also possible that

fatalities induce Palestinians to avoid expressing support for political factions, even if they do

not really shift their actual political allegiance. This possibility seems less likely however, since

the effect of an increase in Palestinian fatalities does not dissipate over time. Therefore, the

permanent effect of Palestinian fatalities on disaffection is also positive, of an important

magnitude, and statistically significant.

       Contrary to the effect of Palestinian fatalities, Israeli fatalities do not seem to have a

patterned effect on the support for any faction or disaffection, either in the short or long run.

This basic specification uses the number of Israeli fatalities originating from each specific

district as the explanatory variable. Though not reported in the table, the results are essentially

the same when we use the number of Israeli fatalities aggregated at the national level or at the

macro-regional level (i.e., West Bank and Gaza) instead of local fatalities as the explanatory

variable.

       We now turn our attention to the main question of this paper, namely whether there is any

support for the hypothesis that Palestinian factions can gain public support by engaging in

violence against Israel. In Table 3 we present the marginal effects from the multinomial logit

model described in equation (2), where we include separately the number of fatalities claimed by




                                                 13
the different factions (Fatah, Hamas, PIJ, and all others) as explanatory variables, at different

time lags. Several of the marginal effects are statistically significant, and one can soundly reject

the null hypothesis that Israeli fatalities have no effect on faction support for three of the four

factions, while the overall effect of Fatah-claimed fatalities is only marginally insignificant.

       It is somewhat difficult, however, to identify a clear pattern for the individual

coefficients. Focusing only on the short run, it appears that Palestinian fatalities lower support

for Fatah and raise disaffection; Fatah-claimed fatalities have no effect on any factions; Hamas-

claimed fatalities lower the number of disaffected; PIJ-claimed fatalities raise the number of

disaffected, at the expense of both Hamas and PIJ; and fatalities claimed by others raise support

for other factions and PIJ, at the expense of Hamas and the disaffected.

       To get a better sense of the magnitude of the effects, we present in Table 4 the results of

simulations where we evaluate how support for the different factions changes as a result of a

permanent two-standard deviation increase in the number of Palestinian fatalities and the number

of Israeli fatalities claimed by each faction. Specifically, in evaluating the effect of a permanent

increase in violence by faction k, we take the following steps:

   a) Calculate the standard deviation of fatalities claimed by faction k for each of the three 4-

       week intervals preceding the poll, separately;

   b) Take the simple average of these three numbers;

   c) Add twice the resulting average to the number of fatalities claimed by faction k in each

       one of the three 4-week intervals.

   d) Re-evaluate the choice probabilities using the estimated model parameters.




                                                 14
Standard errors for the estimates are obtained by taking 5,000 draws from the estimated

parameter vector, and calculating the standard deviation of the predicted change in choice

probabilities.

        The top row of Table 4 shows the benchmark choice probabilities for each one of the five

factions. Then, each row shows the change in support for each faction (in percentage terms) as a

result of a permanent increase in violence by Israel or by any of the factions. To highlight the

own-faction effects (i.e., the change in support for the faction responsible for fatalities) we have

boxed the numbers on the main diagonal of the matrix. Standard errors are in parenthesis.

        Our results show that violence by the different factions does not have a large effect on

Palestinian support for Fatah. While an increase in violence committed by Fatah increases

Fatah’s support and decreases support for Hamas and disaffection, these effects are negligible

and not statistically significant. There is some evidence that Fatah-claimed fatalities lead to a

small drop in support for other Palestinian factions.

        The table provides, however, some evidence that the outbidding hypothesis applies to

Hamas. A higher number of Israeli fatalities claimed by Hamas raises the relative support for

this faction while lowering the share of disaffected Palestinians. Also, the second column shows

that Hamas loses public support when PIJ and other factions claim a high number of Israeli

fatalities.

        We also observe that the outbidding hypothesis applies to the minor factions, grouped

into the “others” category, which are able to significantly increase their popularity among the

Palestinian public through the use of violence against Israelis. This increase in popularity comes

at the expense of both Fatah and Hamas, and of the disaffected.




                                                15
       Contrary to the predictions of the outbidding hypothesis, Israeli fatalities claimed by the

PIJ cause an overall decrease in the support for PIJ, both in the short run and in the long run.

Interestingly, PIJ violence leads to a large loss in public support for Hamas, the other radical

faction, and leads to a large increase in disaffection among the Palestinian population. A

possible explanation for this finding is that PIJ follows a spoiling strategy rather than a strategy

of outbidding. In particular, a spoiling strategy refers to the attempt of extremist factions to

commit attacks during times of particular cooperation between Israel and the leading Palestinian

factions, in order to re-start a process of violence and distrust (Kydd and Walter 2002). While

this strategy may be successful in derailing cooperation and trust between the Israeli government

and the leading Palestinian factions, the data show that it may somewhat backfire for the PIJ with

regards to enjoying the popular support of the Palestinian population. One possible explanation

may be that the Palestinian public supports cooperation with Israel while it is occurring, and

therefore shifts its preferences in favor of disaffection, a more moderate position than support for

Hamas or PIJ, when PIJ commits attacks.

        The magnitude of the effect is not very large, but also not negligible. For example, the

1.83 percentage point increase in support for Hamas as a result of an increase in Hamas-claimed

fatalities is more than half as large as the increase in support for Hamas when going from the

West Bank to the Gaza Strip (3.4 percentage points), about one fourth the size of the effect of

going from a high school degree to a college degree (7.2 percentage points), and also about one

fourth of the effect of going from the youngest (15-29 years old) to the oldest (ages 60 and up)

age group (7.4 percentage points). Importantly, since fatalities claimed by Hamas also lower the

share of disaffected Palestinians, this implies that the share of Hamas supporters among potential

voters may actually increase by as much as 4.3 percentage points,




                                                16
5. Conclusions

       In this paper we provide an empirical test of the hypothesis that Palestinian factions can

effectively use violence to garner support from the Palestinian public, as measured through

opinion polls. We find mixed support for this hypothesis. Permanent increases in violence by

Fatah and Hamas appear to lead to increases in support for these factions, although not through

reducing support for the other faction. Rather, violence claimed by Fatah appears to reduce the

support of smaller, secular factions while violence claimed by Hamas appears to reduce

disaffection (i.e. support for no one). Violence by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other

Islamist factions appears to backfire in terms of garnering support for these factions, but also

reduces support for Hamas and increases disaffection. Other groups (mostly the PFLP and the

DFLP) also seem able to increase their support through violence. In contrast to these results, we

find little evidence that violence by Israel shifts the balance of support in any particular direction.

       All of the effects that we estimate are small relative to the average level of support for

each faction in our data. This suggests that violence against Israelis plays a relatively minor role

in determining support for Fatah and Hamas. Moreover, our results suggest support is not a

zero-sum game between the two main factions. To the extent that violence increases support for

Fatah, it comes at the expense of other secular factions like PFLP and DFLP. Similarly,

increasing support for Hamas through violence comes at the expense of the PIJ and other Islamic

factions. Thus, to the extent that violence shifts support, it seems to shift the balance of power

within the secular factions and within the Islamic factions, but does relatively little to shift the

balance between the secular (Fatah, PFLP, DFLP) and Islamist (Hamas, PIJ) factions.




                                                  17
       The current paper showed that Palestinian violence affects, to certain extent, the political

preferences of the Palestinian population.      Although effective, given the magnitude of the

coefficients, we believe that a rational faction would not find it efficient to launch a terror attack

with the exclusive goal of boosting its relative standing among the Palestinian public. Related

research showed that terrorism is consistently used to reach other goals, like retaliation against

Israeli targeted killings (Jaeger and Paserman 2009), creating political pressure in favor of

territorial concessions (Pape 2005 and Gould and Klor 2010) and affecting the preferences of the

Israeli population (Berrebi and Klor 2008 and 2006).7 Taking that into account, it seems that a

strategy of outbidding cannot explain by itself the observed variation in factions’ terror attacks

against Israel, even if fluctuations in political support across factions are a consequence of

factions’ attacks.

Notes: Entries in the table show the percentage change in choice probabilities as a result of a permanent, two-standard deviation
increase in the number of fatalities claimed by each faction. The choice probabilities are calculated based on the parameter
estimates from the model in Table 3. See text for a full description of the procedure for calculating choice probabilities and standard
errors.
