         HOSPITAL COSTS AND THE COSt OF EMPTY HOSPITAL BEDS

                                ABSTRACT
     The cost of excess capacity in the hospital industry has

reemerged as an important policy issue. Utilized capacity in the

hospital industry, as measured by the inpatient hospital bed
occupancy rate, has declined over the past 10 years and now stands

at approximately 65 percent. Congress and the Administration are
concerned that the costs associated with empty beds represent

wasteful expense and have proposed an adjustment to Medicare
payment rates which will penalize hospitals with low occupancy
rates. Hospitals, on the other hand, have indicated that the costs

of empty hospital beds are low and that reimbursement adjustments

are unnecessary.

     In order to provide more current and representative estimates

of the cost of an empty hospital bed we estimate the cost function

model of Friedman and Pauly using data from a national sample of

5315 hospitals for the years 1963-1987. We find that empty beds

account for approximately 18 percent of total costs, or $546 per
admission (1987 dollars) .    The estimate (in 1987 dollars) of the
coat of an empty hospital bed is approximately $36,000.

    I. INTRODUCTION

          The cost of excess
                                capacity in the hospital
                                                           industry has
      reemerged as an important
                                  policy issue. In the 1970s and early
      1980s, the cost of empty
                                 hospital beds was an
                                                       important
     justification for the health
                                     planning program. With the
     elimination of federal
                              funding for health planning,
                                                             interest in
     the issue waned. Utilized
                                  capacity in the hospital
     measured by the inpatient                               industry, as
                                 hospital bed occupancy
                                                         rate, has
    declined over the past
                             10 years and now stands
                                                       at approximately
    65 percent.' While the costs of excess
                                               capacity are borne
    privately in other industries,

                                                       industry a large
   portion of these costs
                            are publicly paid, due to the presence of
   Medicare, Medicaid, and other
                                    public programs.2 The exclusion

                                   dramatic decline in
                                                        occupancy rates,

                                                   beds as an important
  public policy issue. As

  most of these estimates are derived

  The exceptions are Friedman and
                                  Pauly (1981, 1983) and Pauly and
  Wilson (1986), which are based on a cost function derived for

       In order to provide more current and representative
  estimates of the cost of empty
                                 hospital beds We estimate the
 Friedman end Pauly model using data from a national sample of
 5315 hospitals for the years
                              1983-1987. We also employ
 specification tests to examine the
                                      sensitivity of the model to
 issues of functionaj form,
                            heteros]cedasticity and collinearity.
 Our estimates indicate that the
                                 costs due to empty beds are
 apProximately 18 percent of total costs. This
                                                  is comparable in
 magnitude to the figures in Pauly and
                                         Wilson, who estimate that
 11 to 18 percent of costs can be
                                    attributed to empty beds. In
our sample this amounts to
                              aPproximately $546 per sdmission (in
1987 dollars).

 II. THE MODEL
                                            in this paper is that
      The model of hospital costs employed

 derived by Friedman and pauly (1981)
                                 demand. The basic notion is that
 variable quality and stochastic
                                      product (e.g., a service)
 when a firm produces a heterogeneous

 reduction in the hospital's utility
                                  function. Since neither the

                                     4
  nor the associated penalties are observable, this is called the
  "latent penalty" model.

         If the hospital's inputs, such as labor, are fixed over the

  relevant time period, e.g., due to contracts, then a rational

 response to demand uncertainty is to hire "extrI inputs,       i.e.
 "excess capacity", as a hedge against the latent penalty

 associated with unexpectedly high realizations of demand. Thus,
 inputs are chosen to minimize expected costs, taken
                                                          over all
 possible realizations of demand. The "currently
                                                   fixed" inputs
 can be referred to as "quasiâ€”fixed inputs", and their
                                                        associated
 costs  are termed "quasiâ€”fixed costs". Costs are conseguemtly a
 function of expected demand, actual demand, and other factors
 such   as input prices, fixed capacity, and other hospital
 characteristics which may effect costs,


        C =   C(/g,   V1   k,   X),          (1)



where 6    is   expected demand, q is actual demand, w represents
input prices, k is fixed capacity, and )( are other
                                                        exogenous
hospital characteristics. Quasiâ€”fixed costs will be increasing
in , expected output. Fixed costs are positively related to
                                                                     k,
the level of fixed capacity.

        In the case of hospitals, fixed capacity is
                                                represented by
the number of hospital beds. If a bed is unoccupied, the
variable costs associated with output are avoided, hut fixed

costs which vary with the number of available beds are not. In


                                      S
the context of the Friedman-PaulY model, the cost of an empty bed
which wee forecasted to be unoccupied will be lees than that of

an unexpectedly empty bed, since the variable costs associated
with the forecasted empty bed can be avoided. Thus, the cost of

an (expectedly) empty hospital bed is the fixed cost associated
with that bed. This is arguably the relevant cost of an empty
bed, since unexpectedly empty beds do not represent permanent

excess capacity (assuming rational forecasts).



III. DATA

A. Sources
     we   used   data from the American Hospital Association's (AHA)
Annual Survey of Hospitals for each of the years 1983 through

1987. This is an annual aurvcy of the universe of hospitals in
the United States. it contains data on costa, payments to
                                                  other factors. In
inputs, output, hospital characteristics, and
addition, a Medicare case mix index for each hospital was

obtained from the U.S. Health Care Financing Adminiatration.a We

were able to obtain complete data for 5315 hospitals.9 Hospitals
were deleted if we could not match AHA and Medicare
 identification numbers, if the hospital did not exist for all

 five years, or if the hospital did not report information to the

 B. VARIABLES

 Dependent Variable

      The dependent variable is average cost, measured in real
 tens. This variable was constructed by dividing each hospital's
 total annual expenses by the number of admissions for the year.
 The implicit GNP deflator was used to convert all money figures
 to 1983 dollars.



 Independent Variables

      The independent variables are the ratio of expected to

actusl output, the inverse of the occupancy rate, the number of
hospital beds, the wage rate, the Medicare case mix index, a

dummy variable indicating whether the hospital is forâ€”profit, a

dummy variable indicating if the hospital is public, and a dummy
variable indicating if the hospital is a teaching hospital (if

there are any interns or residents). Descriptive statistics for
all the variables are displayed in Table 1.

      Output is measured as the nuaber of inpatient admissions to

the hospital in a year. Expected output is the econometric
forecast of output for the hospital, as in Friedman and Pauly
(1981) .'Â°   Since we had s relatively short time series for each
hospital (eight years), we were unable to forecast expected

output for each hospital using pure time series methods as




     10A11A data covering the period 1980â€”1987 were used for the
purposes of forecasting expected admissions. The model used three
lags, thus there were forecasted values for 1983-1987.
                                  7
Friedman and Pauly did- Rather we exploited the crossâ€”sectional
as well as the time series variation in the data to generate

forecasts for expected output for each hospital by grouping the
hospitals by geographic area.11 Hospitals which were in the

following categories were pooled together: hospitals in the sane
Metropolitan Statistical Area (NSA), hospitals in the sane urban
area, hospitals in rural sreas in the sane state.11 There were

365 such areas. The forecasting equation used three lags for
admissions, a time trend, and hospital specific dummies. The
hospital specific intercepts allowed us to generate forecasts for

each hospital even though the forecasting equation was estimated
for pooled sets of hospitals. The fits for the forecasting
equations were excellent, with RZ5 in the range of 0.97 to 0.99.

Examples for three NSA5 are reported in an appendix.

     The inverse of the occupancy rate is a proxy for fixed
capacity. Assuming that fixed costs are positively related to
capacity, average fixed costs will depend positively on the
inverse of the occupancy rate- In addition, the number of
inpatient beds is allowed to shift the cost function. This

variable may proxy for unmeasured severity of illness associated

with large size or perhaps economies of scale or scope (Anderson

and Lave, 1986).


     11since hospitals in the same area share common shocks specific
to their market, perhaps not too much is violated by pooling
hospitals in this manner for the purpose of forecasting.
     11MSA5 or urban areas with only one hospital were combined
with rural hospitals in the sane state. There were 14 such areas.
                                 a
     There are no reported data on wages (or other input prices)

by hospital, therefore we used reported payroll per full time

equivalent (PTE) employee as a proxy for hospital wages.12 An
alternative would have been to use a hospital wage index
constructed by HCFA for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement,

but this index is area, rather than hospital specific. the
Medicare case mix index measures the complexity of a hospital's

Medicare cases in any given year in terms of their relative

costliness. It is constructed by HCFA for the purposes of

Medicare reimbursement (see Pettengill and Vertrees (1982) for

details). Last, the ownership form of the hospital and teaching
status are control variables for hospital characteristics which

may affect cost. A hospital is defined as a teaching hospital if
it has any interns or residents.



IV. ECONOMETRIC ISSUES
     The model was estimated by the method of fixed effects, or
least squares with dummy variables. Dummy variables for each
hospital represented unobserved hospital specific effects which
are constant over time. Dummy variables for each year control
for the effect of secular changes over time.

    Since the cost function we estinate has not been derived

from a specific production technology, there is no particular



     12Labor is the chief input in the production of hospital
services. Expenditures on labor constitute approximately 80% of
hospital costs (Freeland, Anderson, and Schendlsr, 1979).

functional   form which is indicated. Friedman and Pauly employed

a linear functional torn, and Pauly and Wilson explored a
                                                                     a'


logarithmic   as well as a linear functional form. Since the
logarithmic functional form has been widely used in the

literature on hospital cost functions, and since the linear form

has been used for estimation of this particular cost function, we
felt we should explore the issue of the appropriate functional

form. MacKinnon, White, and Davidson (1983) provide a
specification test for distinguishing between nonâ€”nested models:

the "Extended Projection" or E test. The linear specification
was rejected in favor of the logarithmic specification at the 1*
level.'3 Nonetheless, we report the estimates of the linear

functional form for the purposes of comparison with earlier work.
     There were two other salient issues to consider concerning

the econometric specification: heteroskedasticity and
multicollinearity. It is often alleged that the errors in
hospital cost regressions are heteroakedastic due to the

differing sizes of the institutions. For that reason we employed

the Breusch-Pegan (1979) test for heteroskedasticity of a
particular form. A computationally convenient form of the test
consists of regressing the squared residuals from the cost




     3The test statistic is the t-statistic on the difference of
the log of the predicted values from the linear model and the
predicted values from the logarithmic value in an augmented linear
regression. Significance of this statistic implies rejection of
the null hypothesis.   The value of the tâ€”statistic is 24.468,
therefore the hypothesis of linearity is rejected at the 1%
confidence level.

 regression on hospital bed size. The test statistic is equal to
 the product of the R2 f roe this regression multiplied by the

 nusber of observations." it is asymptotically distributed x2
 with degrees of freedom equal to the number of regressors. The
 R2 from this regression is zero, therefore the hypothesis of
 homoskedastic errors cannot be rejected)5 Last, we were
 concerned that there might be significant collinearity among
 regressors such as bed size, occupancy rate, and admissions,      we
 therefore utilized the diagnostics of Belsley, Kub, and Welsch

 (1920) to check for sulticollinearity. These diagnostics did not
 detect any significant impact of multicollinearity,


V. RESULTS

      Table 2 contains the fixed effects estimates of the cost
function. The estimates of the individual hospital and time

fixed effects are not reported. Column 1 contains the estimates
from the logarithmic functional form   and   column 2 contains
estimates using the linear functional form. Since the signs of
the estimates do not differ between the two columns (with one

exception), we shall mainly discuss the estimates from column 1.
     Most of the parameter estimates are consistent with
expectations and with the results of Friedman and Pauly and      Pauly



     14This test statistic is asymptotically equivalent to the
LaGrange multiplier test statistic and is also robust to non-
normality (Koenker, 1981).

     15The regression itself was not significant.

that the total effect of bed size on cost is positive.     The

effect of bed size is negative and significant in the linear
specification, although the total effect of bed size is still

positive. The wage rate and case nix index have a positive

impact on costs, as expected. Finally, teaching hospitals are
not significantly more costly, for-profits cost more, and public

hospitals cost less.



VI. WHAT IS THE COST OF WN EMPTY BED?

     In this section we report calculations of the costs
associated with empty beds based en the estimates reported       in
                                                   of total costs

which are fixed costs and the total fixed cost per bed- The

 proportion of total costs due to empty beds is unitless and hence

 is useful for the purpose of comparison with previous estimates.

 as (65 x Beds)/Daya.
                                 12
    changes in regulatory policy.
         The proportion of costs which are fixed costs represent the

    proportion of costs attributable to empty beds. Figure 1
    illustrates the basis for this measure. Long run marginal cost
    (LMC) and average cost (Ac) are equal at minimum efficient scale,

    q* (e.g., at the minimum of the average cost curve). At thia

    point there is no excess capacity and average cost contains no

    fixed costs. At the observed output, , the ratio of long run
    marginal cost to average cost (MC()/AC()) thus provides an
    indication of how far hospitals are from minimum efficient scale,
    since at minimum efficient scale this ratio equals one.

         Comparing the inverse of this ratio to one ([AC(e)/MC()]-l)
    provides an estimate of the proportion of costs which are fixed,

    since there is no excess of average costs over long run marginal

    costs at efficient capacity. Applying this proportion to average
    costs yields an estimate of the fixed cost per case.17

         The cost of an empty bed is the estimate of total fixed

    costs per bed. Since the inverse of the occupancy rate

    representS fixed capacity, its marginal impact on average cost
    can be used to quantify the total fixed cost per bed.

    Multiplying the marginal impact by the inverse occupancy rate



         1TThis is actually an overestisate, or upper bound, since
    marginal costs are higher at minimum efficient scale than at points
    below it. The correct measure is [AC(4)/MC(q*) ]â€”l. Since observed
â€¢
    output is less than minimum efficient scale, q*, our estimate of
    long run marginal cost is less than marginal cost at minimum
    efficient scale, and the ratio AC()/MC() is thus somewhat too
    large.
                                    13
yields the total impact on average cost. Further multiplying by
total admissions and dividing by total beds generates the total
fixed cost per bed, or the cost of an empty bed.18
     Table 3 contains estimates for the cost impacts of empty

beds from both the logarithmic and linear forms, although we only

discuss the estimates from the logarithmic form.19 The estimate
of the ratio of long run marginal cost to average cost is 0.85.

This is close to the figures for this ratio reported by Pauly and
Wilson of 0.85 to 0.9. Friedman and Pauly (1981) a figure of

report 0.98, and Friedman and Pauly (1983) report ratios of 0.92
to 1. This implies that the proportion of total cost
attributable to empty beds (i.e., fixed costs) is approximately
18 percent. This amounts to $546 per admission in 1987 dollars.
     The estimates of the cost of an empty bed are also reported
in Table 3. The cost of an empty bed from the logarithmic form

is $32,568 ($37,918 in 1987 dollars). This estimate is in the

midâ€”range of previous estimates, although it is larger than those
produced by the same method. This may be due to changes in the

hospital production process which may have led to higher fixed
costa (e.g., the diffusion of capital intensive new technologies

such as magnetic resonance imaging), actual diseconoaiss



     18This impact is equal to (Inverse Opcupency 1ete) x
(Admissions)/Beds for the linear form and fl(Average Cost) x
(Admissions)/Beds for the logarithmic form, where $ is the
estimated coefficient of the inverse occupancy rate. Since the
inverse of the occupancy rate represents fixed capacity, the
estimate of its impact on average cost is marginal fixed cost.

          These are evaluated at the sample means of all vsriables.
                                  14
associated with lower occupancy rates (i.e., movement "back up"

the average cost curve), or changea in incentives under the

Prospective Payment System. Thus, it is difficult to discern
whether the cost of an empty bed is truly "higher" than

previously estimated by this method, or whether the production of

hospital services has changed in important but unmeasurable ways.
     These estimates, while significant, is not as large as some
policymakers have contemded. We believe that 18 percent
represents an upper bound on actual realizable cost savings due
to bed reductions, because actual cost savings depend on the
method and volume of bed reductions. In addition, society may
value excese cepacity in the hospital system.2Â°




     20
        The optimal number of beds, of course, depends not just
on the cost of an empty bed, but also on the benefit of an enpty
bed, i.e., the social value placed on having beds available when
needed.
