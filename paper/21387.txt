                                           ABSTRACT

Neoclassical and psychological models of consumer behavior often make divergent predictions for
the welfare effects of paternalistic policies, leaving wide scope for researchers’ choice of a model
to influence their policy conclusions. We develop a framework to reduce this model uncertainty and
apply it to administrative data on consumer decision making in Medicare Part D. Consumers’ choices
for prescription drug insurance plans can be explained by Abaluck and Gruber’s (AER 2011) model
of utility maximization with psychological biases or by a neoclassical version of their model that
precludessuch biases. We evaluate these competing hypotheses using nonparametric tests of utility
maximizationand a trio of model validation tests. We find that 79% of enrollment decisions in
Medicare Part D from2006-2010 satisfied basic axioms of consumer preference theory under the
assumptions of full information,zero transaction cost, and no measurement error. The validation
tests provide evidence against widespreadpsychological biases. In particular, we find that precluding
psychological biases improves the structuralmodel’s out-of-sample predictions for consumer behavior.

      The classical view of consumer theory maintains that people choose best for themselves. Yet
the notion of consumer sovereignty has long evoked criticism. As early as 1966, George Stigler
wrote that critics “say that people typically do not maximize anything—that the consumer is lazy
or dominated by advertisers or poor arithmetic” (p.2). Since then, economists have found numer-
ous examples of people leaving money on the table, even when the financial stakes are high, e.g.
enrollment in retirement savings plans (Madrian and Shea 2001), access to credit (Woodward
and Hall 2012, Agarwal and Mazumder 2013), health insurance (Handel 2013) and prescription
drug insurance (Abaluck and Gruber 2011). These results are often interpreted as evidence that
people make choices that do not maximize their own utility. To explain these results, some re-
searchers have applied the framework of Kahneman, Wakker, and Sarin (1997) in which the “de-
cision utility” (DU) function that guides consumer choice in the marketplace diverges from the
“hedonic utility” (HU) function that measures their satisfaction from consuming the purchased
goods. Perceived divergences between DU and HU are viewed as a rationale for paternalistic
policies intended to increase welfare by guiding people to make better choices, defined as those
that come closer to maximizing HU (Camerer et al. 2003).
      One high profile example of this approach is Abaluck and Gruber (2011), henceforth AG.
They sought to evaluate the quality of consumer decision making in the market for prescription
drug insurance plans (PDPs) under Medicare Part D. AG began by showing that, ex post, over
70% of enrollees could have reduced their PDP expenditures without increasing their exposure to
risk. They used this nonparametric evidence to motivate a parametric test of whether people’s
PDP choices were consistent with maximizing a particular HU function that depends on PDP
quality in addition to the mean and variance of cost. For the purpose of this test, AG defined the
benchmark HU function as a first-order Taylor approximation to a constant absolute risk aver-
sion model and then used data on consumers’ PDP choices to estimate a linear and additively
separable DU function.1 Differences between the HU and DU functions were interpreted as evi-
dence that consumers “simply err” due to heuristics or “lack of cognitive ability” (p.1209), creat-
ing “welfare loss due to consumer mistakes” (p.1194) that could be avoided by policies allowing
“less scope for choosing the wrong plan” (p.1209). Specifically, AG found that their estimated
DU function violated three restrictions implied by their chosen HU function, which they inter-
preted as evidence that consumers make three mistakes: (1) they underweight out-of-pocket costs

1
    AG refer to DU as the “positive utility function” and HU as the “normative utility function.”



                                                                                                    1
relative to plan premiums; (2) their choices depend on financial attributes beyond the extent to
which those attributes affect their own costs; and (3) they underweight the variance-reducing as-
pects of plans. AG used these findings—along with the additional assumption that econometric
errors in their multinomial logit model represent idiosyncratic mistakes made by consumers—to
conclude that consumer mistakes yielded a welfare loss equivalent to 27% of out-of-pocket ex-
penditures on plan premiums and prescription drugs in 2006. Our replication of their analysis
shows that just over two thirds of this estimated welfare loss is due to AG’s interpretation of the
econometric error terms as consumer mistakes.
  In this article we develop a methodology for determining when a structural model of decision
making can be used to infer the quality of consumers’ decisions and use it to assess AG’s con-
clusions. Our research is motivated by the broad interest in evaluating the quality of consumer
decision making and its implications for welfare, the policy relevance of health insurance market
design, and the challenges inherent in both tasks. In particular, a key challenge with using testa-
ble restrictions on parametric models to assess consumer decision making quality is that such
tests conflate two distinct explanations for violations of the parametric restrictions. Varian (1983,
p.99) summarized the issue as follows: “This procedure suffers from the defect that one is always
testing a joint hypothesis: whatever restrictions one wants to test plus the maintained hypothesis
of functional form.” This raises the question: do violations of AG’s restrictions reflect optimiza-
tion mistakes made by consumers; do they represent a rejection of AG’s parametric model for
utility; or some combination of the two? We disentangle these hypotheses and test them separate-
ly using five years of administrative data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS).
  We begin by adapting Varian’s (1983) nonparametric tests of utility maximization to the PDP
markets from 2006 to 2010. During this period the average consumer chose from more than 40
PDPs that differed in terms of expected cost, variance, and quality. We replicate AG’s nonpara-
metric analysis (based solely on the mean and variance of cost) and then extend their analysis to
recognize that consumers may also care about features of plan quality as in AG’s parametric
model. Like AG, we control for aspects of PDP quality that consumers observe but analysts do
not using the brand name of the firm selling the insurance, so that latent “quality” includes all be-
tween-firm differences in PDP attributes besides our measures of mean and variance of ex post
costs. We find that between 2006 and 2010 79% of consumers made PDP choices that were con-



                                                                                                   2
sistent with maximizing some utility function satisfying the basic axioms of consumer preference
theory under the assumptions of full information and perfect foresight about future drug needs.2
    A potential limitation of our nonparametric test is that it reveals whether choices are con-
sistent with maximizing any utility function that satisfies the basic axioms, even if that implies
extreme tradeoffs between PDP attributes. For example, analysts may find it improbable that the
average consumer would be willing to pay over $1,000 per year for latent features of PDP quali-
ty. We address this potential concern by developing a measure of the willingness to pay for firm-
specific quality that is sufficient to rationalize the choice made by each consumer. Over our five
year study period the median sufficient willingness to pay is $47, or 4% of out-of-pocket expend-
itures. We also show that a majority of consumers have the option to choose an inferior PDP of-
fered by their chosen brand and yet most of them avoid doing so. Further, the odds of choosing
an inferior plan decline between 2006 and 2010 despite increasing availability of inferior plans.
In summary, our nonparametric analysis reveals that AG’s evidence of choice inconsistencies is
not robust to alternative specifications for utility. This motivates the need to test the fit and pre-
dictive power of their structural model against alternative models that make different predictions
for the welfare effects of paternalistic policies.
    When we estimate AG’s multinomial logit model using CMS data we replicate the results that
they interpret as consumer mistakes. However, we also find that AG’s evidence of mistakes per-
sists for the 25% of consumers who chose plans on Lancaster’s (1966) efficient frontier in terms
of cost and variance. We then design and implement three tests of AG’s structural model of PDP
choice.
    Our first test estimates AG’s model after adding placebo attributes to each PDP. The results
imply that consumers are willing to pay about as much for the placebo attributes as they are will-
ing to pay for most of the real financial attributes that AG interpret as consumer mistakes. This is
evidence that AG’s parametric test of utility maximization is vulnerable to economically im-
portant type I errors. Our second test leverages heterogeneity in the PDP menu across 32 CMS
markets to investigate whether between-market variation in the signs and magnitudes of the
measures that AG interpret as mistakes can be explained by between-market variation in the fac-
tors that AG hypothesize to cause mistakes. We find that their measures for mistakes, and the as-

  The share of consumers making consistent choices increases if we relax these assumptions to recognize that some consumers are forward look-
ing over multiple years, that consumers differ in the way they form expectations about their future drug needs, or that consumer utility may de-
pend on higher order moments of the distribution of expenditures.



                                                                                                                                              3
sociated welfare losses, often vary by an order of magnitude or more across regions; they also
vary in sign. This variation appears to be unrelated to institutional and demographic factors often
found to be correlated with financial literacy and decision making quality, such as age, dementia,
and the number of choices available. We interpret these results as evidence of potential model
misspecification. Our last test compares the out-of-sample predictive power of AG’s model to
their benchmark model that assumes consumers maximize expected utility. Despite having less
econometric flexibility, the model that assumes people do not make any of AG’s three explicit
mistakes performs about as well, and often better, at predicting how people make choices when
they are faced with different PDP options.
     Overall, we find that AG’s evidence of welfare-reducing optimization mistakes is driven pri-
marily by their assumptions about the parametric form of utility and by interpreting econometric
errors as consumer mistakes. Our analysis of the CMS data provides evidence that consumers
pay attention to how the financial attributes of PDPs affect their own costs.3 We also find that a
simpler version of AG’s model that assumes people maximize expected utility often makes better
out-of-sample predictions. While these empirical results do not prove that people always make
fully informed enrollment decisions in Medicare Part D, they do suggest that welfare-reducing
mistakes may not be as large or as widespread as AG concluded.

                  I.     Testing the Consistency of Consumer Choices in Medicare Part D

    In this section we explain key aspects of Medicare Part D and the distinction between para-
metric and nonparametric tests of utility maximization in a differentiated product market. The
purpose is to provide context for our nonparametric analysis in Sections II and III and our para-
metric analysis in sections IV and V.

                             A. A Standard Model of Prescription Drug Plan Choice

    The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) divides the nation into 34 regions,
each of which offers a distinct set of PDP options.4 During the annual open enrollment, consum-
ers choose a PDP for the following year. Consider the enrollment period in a single region. Con-
sumers are free to choose among j=1,…,J plans that differ in terms of the premium, 𝑝𝑗 , and a

  The CMS data mitigate measurement errors present in the data used by AG and consequently overturn AG’s finding that consumers ignore the
individual benefits of purchasing gap coverage, which led AG to conclude that “individuals consider plan characteristics in making their choic-
es—but not how those plan characteristics matter for themselves” (p 1191).

vector of variables defining drug costs, 𝑐𝑗 , that includes the deductible and the price structure for
each available level of coverage. PDPs may also differ in a vector of quality attributes, 𝑞𝑗 . Ex-
amples include customer service, pharmacy networks, the ease of obtaining drugs by mail order
and the presence of supply-side controls such as prior authorization requirements. These charac-
teristics determine the time and effort required for a consumer to obtain her eligible benefits un-
der the plan.
      Consumer i’s expenditures under plan j equal the premium plus the out-of-pocket (OOP) costs
of any drugs she purchases. Expenditures can be written as 𝑝𝑗 + 𝑜𝑜𝑝(𝑐𝑗 , 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ), where 𝑥𝑖𝑗 is a vector
of drug quantities. In general, OOP costs are a nonlinear function of drug purchases due to the
plans’ designs. The consumer’s health depends on a random shock, 𝑤𝑖 , that she realizes after
choosing a plan, and on her drug consumption: ℎ𝑖𝑗 = ℎ(𝑤𝑖 , 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ). Utility is a function of the con-
sumer’s health, the quality of her PDP, and her consumption of a composite numeraire good, 𝑚𝑖 .
It is useful to decompose the utility maximization problem into two stages, following Cardon and
Hendel (2001).5 In the first stage the consumer selects a plan, and in the second stage she experi-
ences a health shock and purchases drugs. The second stage problem of optimal drug consump-
tion can be written as:

(1)         𝑈𝑖𝑗∗ = 𝑈 ∗ (ℎ𝑖𝑗 , 𝑞𝑗 , 𝑚𝑖 ) = max 𝑈[ℎ(𝑤𝑖 , 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ), 𝑞𝑗 , 𝑚𝑖 ]
                                               𝑥𝑖𝑗


                                                     subject to 𝑚𝑖 = 𝑦𝑖 − 𝑝𝑗 − 𝑜𝑜𝑝(𝑐𝑗 , 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ),

where 𝑈𝑖𝑗∗ is the indirect utility that consumer i experiences from plan j at her optimal level of
drug consumption conditional on that plan. Optimal drug consumption may differ from plan to
plan due to variation in drug prices and plan quality.
      The consumer’s expected utility from plan j is defined by integrating over her perceived dis-
tribution of health shocks, characterized by density function 𝑓𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 ).

(2)          𝑉(ℎ𝑖𝑗 , 𝑞𝑗 , 𝑦𝑖 − 𝑝𝑗 − 𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 ) ≡ 𝐸(𝑈𝑖𝑗∗ ) = ∫ 𝑈 ∗ (ℎ(𝑠𝑖 , 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ), 𝑞𝑗 , 𝑚𝑖 )𝑓𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 )𝑑𝑠𝑖 .

Comparing expected utility over the J plans leads to the first stage problem of choosing the utili-
ty maximizing plan:


5
  Zeckhauser (1970) represents the earliest predecessor known to us. McGuire (2012) follows Goldman and Philipson (2007) with a slightly dif-
ferent approach in which the consumer chooses the level of medical care and an optimal coinsurance rate, where premia are a function of those.
Cardon and Hendel’s approach is also used in Handel (2013) and Einav et al. (2013).



                                                                                                                                            5
(3)                                      max { 𝑉(ℎ𝑖𝑗 , 𝑞𝑗 , 𝑦𝑖 − 𝑝𝑗 − 𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 ) } .
                                            𝑗

In principle, each consumer’s PDP choice and subsequent OOP expenditures can be observed,
along with 𝑝𝑗 , 𝑞𝑗 , and 𝑐𝑗 for every plan. The challenge is to use this information to test whether
consumers make choices that are consistent with utility maximization under full information.


                          B. Parametric and Nonparametric Tests of Utility Maximization

      Consistent with Varian (1983), we define a nonparametric test of utility maximization as a
test of whether the data could have been generated by maximizing a utility function that satisfies
basic axioms of consumer theory (e.g. completeness, transitivity, nonsatiation). In contrast, a
parametric test assesses whether the data were generated by maximizing a particular utility func-
tion. Both tests require data on every variable that enters the maximization problem in (3). First,
the analyst must make an assumption about which moments of the consumer’s perceived joint
distribution of health outcomes and OOP expenditures enter the indirect utility function in (2).
Second, the analyst must make an assumption about the form of 𝑓𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 ) to construct those mo-
ments for each of the J available plans.
      Given these assumptions and data on every plan, the analyst can nonparametrically test
whether people choose plans that lie on what Lancaster (1966) defined as the “efficiency fron-
tier” in characteristics space. A plan is on the frontier if and only if it is not dominated by another
plan on every characteristic. Any choice on the frontier is consistent with the basic axioms of
consumer theory, and any choice off the frontier violates a basic axiom. To conduct a parametric
test, the analyst must further specify the form of utility, and the test results indicate whether con-
sumers’ choices are consistent with maximizing that particular utility function. Hence, paramet-
ric and nonparametric tests present a tradeoff between Type I and Type II errors. A nonparamet-
ric test that fails to reject the hypothesis of utility maximization may imply that consumers are
willing to make tradeoffs between attributes that some researchers view as too extreme to be
anything other than a mistake. In contrast, a parametric test that rejects the hypothesis of utility
maximization may actually be rejecting the researcher’s assumption for the parametric form of
utility in the sense that consumers’ choices maximize other utility functions with attribute
tradeoffs that researchers or policy makers would view as reasonable.6

6
    This assumes the analyst has data on every variable in the maximization problem in (3) and there is no measurement error. Nonparametric tests



                                                                                                                                               6
    If model misspecification can be ruled out, then a parametric test would be decisive and the
results could be used to identify mistakes in the choice process and guide welfare-improving pol-
icies. The innate inability of any analyst to know the parametric form of consumers’ utility, apart
from revealed preference logic, motivates our research design. First, we use nonparametric tests
to reveal whether the results from a parametric test are idiosyncratic to the analyst’s chosen func-
tional form or whether they are robust across the full scope of utility functions that satisfy the ax-
ioms of consumer preference theory. Second, we design tests for misspecification of a parametric
model of the choice process.

                          II. Using CMS Data to Reassess the Facts on Plan Choice

                         A.    Data on drug plan choice and prescription drug expenditures

    We worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to obtain data on
Medicare beneficiaries’ demographics, medical conditions, prescription drug use, PDP choices,
and the set of plans available to them. Additionally, we incorporate institutional knowledge from
CMS to develop the best available calculator for the costs each person would have incurred in
each plan that was available to her.7 We begin with a random 20% sample of every Medicare
beneficiary and then impose a few eligibility criteria. Most importantly, we follow AG in limit-
ing our analysis to people who chose a standalone PDP and did not receive a federal low-income
subsidy. Following AG’s methodology, we also excluded those for whom we could not calculate
the plan-specific variance in costs.8
    Table 1 summarizes our CMS data on plan spending and compares it to the AG data. The AG
data were obtained from Source Healthcare Analytics (then named Wolters Kluwer Health
(WKH)) which collects data primarily via contracts with pharmacies. The WKH data have two
main limitations for studying PDP choice. First, they do not typically capture all of the prescrip-
tions filled by a given individual in a given year. As a result, the actual average OOP costs
($994) are approximately 50% higher than reported by AG ($666).9 Second, the WKH data do

are only affected by measurement error in the case where the error changes the ordering of goods in attribute space. Parametric tests are more
vulnerable to measurement error due to the cardinal nature of the testing procedure.
7
  The “cost calculator” is described in Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers (2014). The correlation between calculated spending and actual spending
ranges from .92 in 2006 to .98 in 2009. AG do not report comparable statistics for their calculator.
8
  We adopt AG’s approach to defining variables except where noted otherwise. Their approach to defining variance was based on grouping peo-
ple into 1000 different cells based on their prior year’s total drug spending, days’ supply of branded drugs, and days’ supply of generic drugs.
Whereas they used a random sample of 200 people from everyone in their data to define a cell’s variance regardless of region or plan type, we
use the full set of people enrolled in a PDP in the same region.
9
  We cannot determine the exact percentage because the WKH data do not identify whether a consumer was enrolled in a PDP for the entire year.
The $995 average cost measure reported for the 2006 CMS data in Table 1 is calculated for consumers who were enrolled the entire year. If we



                                                                                                                                              7
not report which plan each person selects or even whether a person selects a PDP at all. AG at-
tempted to infer each person’s chosen plan based on their OOP costs but found that 50% could
not be matched to any plan and 21% were matched to multiple plans. 10 To overcome this prob-
lem, AG randomly assigned people to one of the multiple potential matches with probabilities
chosen to reproduce each plan’s national market shares.11 This assignment rule helps to explain
the biases in AG’s data evident from Table 1 and in their findings on gap coverage explained be-
low.

       Note: The table compares summary statistics reported in AG using the Wolters Kluwer Health to our data from Centers for Medicare
       and Medicaid Services. We focus on consumers who were enrolled for the entire year, using a 20% sample in 2006 and a 10% sam-
       ple in 2007-2010.



    The final novelty of our data is our approach to defining brands. AG used CMS contract IDs
to create dummies meant to capture unobserved PDP quality. As the name implies, contract IDs
exist for contracting purposes between insurers and CMS; they are not observed by consumers
and in many cases do not match the brand names seen by consumers. Instead, we use company
and plan names to create an alternative set of brand dummies that we expect to be meaningful to
consumers.12


add all the consumers who enrolled for only part of the year, the figure drops to $890. In this article we restrict our attention to people who were
enrolled in a single PDP for the full 12 months, as we expect the choice process may differ for part year enrollees. Excluding them also makes
2006 more comparable to later years, as open enrollment extended through May, creating a large cohort of part-year enrollees for 2006 not found
in other years.
10
   This inference is difficult as a drug can have more than 32 different OOP costs within a single PDP because OOP costs can differ with the 4
phases of coverage, pharmacy type, pharmacy network status, quantity dispensed, and other attributes. Due to this complexity, AG assigned a
person to a plan if they could match (defined as a price within 5%) as few as 50% of the person’s observed OOP costs to the formulary of that
plan every month from June 2006 through December 2006.
11
   The use of national market shares is problematic because a given plan’s market share often varies dramatically across CMS regions due, in part,
to variation in the set of competing plans offered in each region.
12
   Both approaches yield approximately the same number of brands in every CMS region and year, as can be seen from Table 1. CMS made com-
pany and plan names available to researchers in July, 2014. Table A1 provides an example of how we use these new variables to create brand
dummies that differ from those used by AG. Replacing contract id with our brand dummies increases the pseudo R2 for AG’s parametric model
from 0.32 to 0.37. Some of AG’s key results are sensitive to which brand indicators are used e.g. as evident by comparing the region-specific re-
sults in Figures 3 and A3. We report the robustness of our main results to using AG’s dummies in Table A11.



                                                                                                                                                  8
                      B.     Evaluating AG’s Conclusions about Enrollment in Gap Coverage

     AG used the choice of plans with gap coverage in 2006 as their leading result in support of
their conclusion that consumers fail to pay proper attention to plan attributes. Specifically, they
observed that “the percentage choosing donut hole coverage is virtually flat throughout the
spending distribution…[with] the same proportion of individuals in the tenth and eighty-fifth
percentile of the spending distribution choose donut hole [i.e. gap] coverage” (p 1192, emphasis
added). They interpreted the lack of a positive relationship between total spending and enroll-
ment in gap coverage as evidence of consumer mistakes because the expected benefits of gap
coverage are higher for someone in the 85th percentile than in the 10th percentile.13
     AG’s evidence of this effect is provided in panel A of Figure 1 (reproduced from AG Figure
3). The horizontal axis measures the quantile of total (OOP plus third party paid) expenditures on
prescription drugs. The right vertical axis measures the “cost premium” for gap coverage, de-
fined by the amount an individual would save by choosing the lowest cost available plan with
gap coverage instead of the lowest cost available plan without gap coverage. The top locus de-
picts the average cost premium, conditional on drug expenditure quantile. The left vertical axis
and the lower locus indicate the percent of people in each expenditure quantile who choose a
plan with gap coverage. If people were paying attention to plan attributes, preferred lower-cost
plans, and had some foresight about their drug expenditures, then ceteris paribus we would ex-
pect the probability of selecting gap coverage to be inversely associated with the cost premium.
The failure to observe such an upward-sloping relationship in panel A is what led AG to con-
clude that individuals do not consider how plan characteristics influence their own drug expendi-
tures.
     The CMS data overturn AG’s finding that consumers failed to consider how gap coverage
mattered for themselves, as shown in Panel B. The probability of selecting gap coverage increas-
es throughout the spending distribution up to the catastrophic coverage limit, and the rate of in-
crease rises in the gap, where the thresholds at which people enter and exit the gap are demarcat-
ed by the vertical lines. The probability of selecting gap coverage is strongly, positively
associated with total drug spending and inversely associated with the cost premium. In contrast


13
  In 2006, the standard PDP design was required to insure annual prescription drug costs with actuarial equivalence to a schedule that varied with
the beneficiaries’ OOP and gross drug cumulative annual spending. This included no coverage between $2,500 and 5,100 in total (OOP plus in-
surer-paid) costs. Many insurers deviated from this standard plan and offered “enhanced” plans with coverage in the “gap” for generic drugs or
generic and brand drugs.



                                                                                                                                                9
to the statistic that AG report, the percentage of people choosing gap coverage at the eighty-fifth
percentile is actually 4 times larger than the percentage at the tenth percentile: 23.3% compared
to 5.7%. This is consistent with people paying attention to the effects of gap coverage on their
own spending because gap coverage saves enrollees an average of $185 at the eighty-fifth per-
centile and costs them an average of $283 at the tenth percentile. Evaluating the right tail of the
spending distribution in panel B provides further evidence that people are more likely to choose
gap coverage if their cost savings from doing so are higher. For people who exit the gap and en-
ter the catastrophic coverage phase, the cost premium again begins to rise and enrollment in gap
coverage declines.14

             FIGURE 1: PERCENT CHOOSING GAP COVERAGE AND ADDED COST BY EXPENDITURE QUANTILE



     Overall, panel B provides evidence that people in fact did consider how gap coverage mat-
tered for themselves in 2006.15 This finding is especially noteworthy because the market was
new. People appear to have anticipated their own future drug consumption and considered how
this peculiar plan attribute, not commonly found in other insurance products, would ultimately
affect their costs.16
     Several aspects of AG’s data and methodology may have contributed to their inability to de-


14
   We do not know whether AG found the same result because their figure was truncated at the 91.25th percentile. Also in contrast with panel A,
the cost premium declines as expenditures rise. The premium peaks well under $400 at the 0 th percentile, whereas AG indicated that it peaks
above $600 around the 80th percentile. This divergence could be caused by the fact that AG’s cost calculator assumes every drug had a uniform
negotiated price across all plans, whereas the large insurers with popular gap plans, ceteris paribus, would be able to negotiate lower prices for a
given drug.
15
   The experiences of insurers provides additional support for this result. Specifically, the largest provider of full gap coverage, Humana, was re-
ported to lose $20 million (33%) on their full gap plan in 2006 due to the heavy use of gap coverage among that plans’ enrollees. As a result of
these losses, for 2007 they withdrew full gap coverage from the market.
16
   Figure A1 shows that enrollment in gap coverage increased in regions and years where the benefits from gap coverage were larger. Table A2
shows that similar patterns exist for other plan attributes. For example, enrollees’ paid $112 below average in OOP costs; they selected a plan
with 17% less variability in OOP spending; and chose a plan with a 6% higher quality rating.



                                                                                                                                                10
tect the positive relationship between the benefits of gap coverage and enrollment in plans with
that coverage. Perhaps the most important derives from the fact that AG could not observe peo-
ple’s actual PDP choices in their data. In the common case that their choice imputation procedure
yielded more than one potentially chosen PDP, AG randomly assigned people to plans with the
probability of assignment chosen to reproduce national market shares. As the CMS data reveal,
the probability of selecting gap coverage is increasing in drug expenditures. Consequently, ran-
dom assignment would have flattened the curve by placing upward bias on the probability of gap
coverage at low expenditure quantiles and downward bias on the probability of gap coverage at
high expenditure quantiles. In fact, AG noted that their inability to match people to plans was es-
pecially severe for Humana (p. 1188), one of the largest providers of gap coverage in 2006 and,
“the insurer that offered the most generous [gap] coverage” (p.1206).17
     AG emphasized that failure to find a positive slope in Figure 1A suggests choice inconsisten-
cies. One might also ask whether anything less than full enrollment in gap coverage at expendi-
ture quantiles with a negative cost premium is evidence of choice inconsistencies. Inspecting the
micro data underlying the quantile averages in panel B reveals this is not the case: even among
people who ended the year in the gap, the cost premium for gap coverage is positive for 64%.
Hence if every person chose the plan that minimized their ex post costs, then 36% of people in
the gap would have gap coverage. Looking at the full spending distribution, 14% of people could
have saved more than $100 by switching into or out of gap coverage (9.9% by switching to a
plan with gap and 4.2% by switching to a plan without gap). Raising the threshold to $300 low-
ers these percentages to 6.5% and 1.1%, respectively; raising it to $750 lowers them to 2.5% and
0.0%.18 Uncertainty about future drug consumption provides a potential explanation for why
people left money on the table on the basis of this metric, which relies on ex post drug consump-
tion to define the cost premium. The extent to which gap coverage raises or lowers an individu-
al’s costs can vary widely over small movements in the ex post spending distribution around the
gap and catastrophic thresholds, as can be seen from the quantile averages in the figure. Fur-
thermore, the analysis in Figure 1 is unconditional on plan variance and quality. For example,

17
   Many states provide subsidies to populations that do not qualify for the federal low income subsidies. Individual use of these subsidies is not
recorded in CMS or WKH data. The following states did not offer these programs from 2006-2010: AL, AR, CO, FL, GA, IA, ID, KS, KY, MI,
MN, MS, NE, NH, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WY. When we reproduce Figure 1.B using only these states the share of consumers enrolled
in gap coverage at the 85th percentile of the expenditure distribution is more than 5 times as large as the share at the 10 th percentile (27% com-
pared to 5%). This provides further evidence that people pay attention to how gap coverage benefits themselves as the benefits are smaller in
states with these subsidies in ways not incorporated into the CMS data, the cost calculator or the gap cost premium.
18
   Table A3 provides results from additional thresholds in 2006 and 2007. The results show that the share with potential savings at these thresh-
olds in 2007 was about half the share in 2006.



                                                                                                                                               11
among the 4.2% who chose a gap plan but could have saved at least $100 by choosing a non-gap
plan, the gap plan may maximize utility through its ability to reduce variance or through any oth-
er features of plan quality provided by plans with gap coverage. Our nonparametric tests reveal
the extent to which the data are consistent with this explanation.

                  III. Nonparametric Tests of Consistency with Utility Maximization

     The generalized axiom of revealed preference (GARP) is often used to test whether data are
consistent with utility maximization. However GARP is not directly applicable to PDP choice
because consumers are not free to choose continuous combinations of plan characteristics and
the budget constraint is nonlinear.19 Nevertheless, similar axioms imply that a utility maximizing
consumer will choose a plan that lies on Lancaster’s (1966) efficiency frontier. Suppose a con-
sumer is risk averse and has preferences that are complete, transitive, and strongly monotonic
over the attributes of PDPs.20 Under these mild restrictions, optimization under full information
implies the consumer will never choose a plan, k, that lies below the frontier in the sense that
when we compare it to another feasible plan, j, plan k has: (i) equal or higher expected OOP
costs, (ii) equal or more variable OOP costs; (iii) equal or lower values for every dimension of
perceived plan quality; and (iv) at least one of these inequalities is strict. In this case plan j domi-
nates plan k for any utility maximizing consumer. Therefore, calculating the share of people who
choose dominated plans provides a nonparametric test of choice consistency that is robust to any
utility function satisfying completeness, transitivity, and strong monotonicity. These mild re-
strictions are consistent with a broad class of preferences that allow utility to be nonlinear and
nonseparable in plan attributes. They also allow for flexible forms of heterogeneity in risk aver-
sion and in relative preferences for plan quality. For example, a utility maximizing consumer
with strong preferences for more extensive formulary coverage may choose a plan offered by an
insurer that places fewer restrictions on drugs, even if our measures of the mean and variance of
ex posts costs are higher under that insurer’s plans.
     Table 2 reports the share of people choosing plans on the efficiency frontier each year from
2006 through 2010. As we move from row 1 to row 5 we expand the set of attributes assumed to


19
   See Kariv and Silverman (2013) for an overview of the challenges in testing whether data are consistent with utility maximization when con-
sumers are free to choose continuous bundles of homogeneous goods with linear budget constraints.
20
   Completeness says that consumers can compare any two plans. Transitivity says that if plan A is preferred to plan B, and plan B is preferred to
plan C, then plan A must be preferred to plan C. Strong monotonicity says that, all else constant, consumers prefer plans with more of any posi-
tive attribute.



                                                                                                                                              12
enter utility. We start in row 1 with the naïve assumption that mean ex post cost is the only at-
tribute that people value. Specifically, we follow AG’s assumption that consumers should have
perfect foresight on their future drug needs and set 𝐸(𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 ) for year t equal to plan j’s cost of
purchasing the drugs that consumer i actually purchased that year. The share of people choosing
frontier plans in this single dimension ranges from 6% to 10% each year. In row 2 we add
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 ). Accounting for the variance raises the fraction of people on the frontier to between
24% and 36%. The fraction in 2006 is 25%, just below the 30% reported by AG. Importantly,
this is where AG stopped testing.
     Row 3 adds an index of overall plan quality developed by CMS.21 This raises the share of
people choosing frontier plans to 33% to 46%. Row 4 replaces the CMS index with brand dum-
mies, just as AG do in their parametric model.22 The difference is that the nonparametric test al-
lows people to have heterogeneous preferences for unobserved features of PDP quality that vary
from brand to brand.23 When we add these dummies, 73% to 82% of choices are consistent with
maximizing a well behaved utility function. The share of people choosing frontier plans increas-
es further if we allow utility to depend on higher order moments of the OOP distribution, if we
allow the demand for drugs to be less than perfectly inelastic, if we introduce forward looking
behavior and switching costs, or if we allow for heterogeneity in expectations. Row 5 illustrates
this point by relaxing the assumption that every person knows their future drug consumption.
Some people may expect their future drug consumption to be the same as their past consumption,
for example. We allow this possibility by calculating two separate measures of 𝐸(𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 )—one
based on the person’s drug consumption in year t and one based on her consumption in year t-1.
Adding both variables to the utility function recognizes that uncertainty about drug consumption
may cause a person’s expectations to be a weighted average of these two cases. 24 This further in-
creases the rate of consistent choices to as high as 89% in 2009.25




21
   CMS did not construct the quality index for 2006. AG used the 2008 CMS quality index for 2006. We use 2007 ratings, the earliest available,
for 2006. We use updated ratings for each subsequent year, e.g. the 2008 ratings are used for 2008.
22
   The CMS quality index is essentially redundant at this point because there is minimal variation across plans within a brand for a given year.
Adding it as an additional attribute to rows 4 and 5 has virtually no effect on the results.
23
   Appendix Table A4 shows that the results are very similar if we follow AG in using contract ID’s to define brand.
24
   Formally, define consumer i’s expected OOP costs for plan j during year t at the time of enrollment as 𝐸[𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 ] = 𝛼𝑖 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 + (1 −
𝛼𝑖 )𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡−1 , where 𝛼𝑖 is between 0 and 1. When we admit that we do not know 𝛼𝑖 , we cannot conclude that plan j dominates plan k unless
𝐸[𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 ] < 𝐸[𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑘𝑡 ] for every feasible value of 𝛼𝑖 . Therefore, plan k is only dominated if 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 < 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑘𝑡 and 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡−1 < 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖𝑘𝑡−1 .
25
   We cannot perform this test for 2006 because we do not have data on drug consumption for 2005.

Note: The table reports the share of people choosing undominated plans on their efficiency frontier as a function of plan attributes and modeling

     Table 2 reveals that understanding the roles of PDP attributes captured by the brand dummy
variables is essential to determining whether most people are making choices that are consistent
with expected utility maximization. This raises three questions. First, is it plausible for people to
have heterogeneous brand preferences? We think the answer is yes. Brands differ in their formu-
lary design for specific drugs in ways not reflected in our measures of mean and variance of ex
post OOP costs. For example, brands with high cost sharing (e.g. high copays or lack of coverage
altogether) on certain drugs may be unattractive to people who have a high likelihood of pur-
chasing those drugs and irrelevant to people who do not. These aspects are not fully captured by
the measured mean and variance of ex post costs. Likewise brands differ in their reliance on sup-
ply-side controls such as prior authorization and “fail first” requirements, which are also not in-
corporated into the mean and variance of ex post costs. Brands also differ in terms of customer
service, ease of obtaining drugs by mail order and pharmacy networks. Each of these differences
has heterogeneous effects across consumers that cannot be captured by CMS’s homogenous star
ratings.26 People also differ in their past experiences with particular insurance companies, e.g.
while they were covered through their employer prior to age 65. In fact, when Medicare benefi-
ciaries were asked about the factors affecting their choice of PDP in a 2006 survey 90% of re-
spondents stated that company reputation was “important” or “very important” to their choice
(MedPAC 2006). Other factors that respondents commonly identified as important or very im-
portant included having a preferred pharmacy in the plan’s network (84%) and signing up with
the same company as a spouse (42%). These factors vary across brands and people, but not
across plans within a brand, making brand dummies the natural proxy measure of these horizon-
tally differentiated attributes.

26
 Furthermore, CMS did not assign star ratings until 2007 so this information would not have been available to enrollees during the 2006 enroll-
ment cycle.



                                                                                                                                             14
     Second, what causes the share of people choosing plans on the efficiency frontier to rise when
brand dummies are added in row 4 of Table 2? The first mechanism is the quality of decision
making. Each year, the majority of people (52% in 2006 and 72- 79% in later years) had the op-
portunity to choose a plan offered by their chosen brand that was dominated in terms of mean
and variance of ex post cost. The first two bars within each year in Figure 2 summarize their ac-
tual choices: the first bar reports the share of people who chose dominated plans; the second bar
reports the share of people who avoided doing so and chose a frontier plan. Comparing the rela-
tive sizes of the two groups across years reveals that the odds of avoiding dominated plans in-
creased over time. Among those offered a dominated plan, the share choosing a plan on their
frontiers climbed steadily from 62% in 2006 to 77% in 2010. To put both the levels and trends in
perspective, if these people had chosen randomly within their chosen brand then the percent of
them in a frontier plan would have been 54%, 59%, 59%, 56% and 54% for 2006-2010 respec-
tively.27 That said, random choice does not represent a lower-bound. If consumers’ choices em-
bed biases and sophisticated firms design products to profit from those biases (Gabaix and
Laibson 2006, Spiegler 2011, Miravete 2013), then we might expect consumers to do worse than
random, not better as shown in the data.




                 FIGURE 2: CONSUMERS GROUPED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A DOMINATED PLAN



27
  The improvement is similar when we focus on 66-year olds who are making their first full-year PDP choice and are therefore less susceptible to
any state dependence. Hence, the improvement in choice quality over time is at least partly driven by active choices.



                                                                                                                                            15
     The second mechanism is the lack of opportunity to choose a dominated plan. The last group
in Figure 2 includes people whose chosen brand does not offer them a dominated plan. After
2006, the share of people in this group ranged from 21-28%. Their brands offer either a single
plan or multiple plans on the person’s frontier, e.g. one low-cost, high-variance plan and one
high-cost, low-variance plan. If consumer utility depends on horizontally differentiated attributes
that are captured by the brand indicators then these peoples’ choices are de facto consistent with
maximizing utility functions that satisfy the basic axioms.
     The fact that we can explain most consumers’ PDP choices as reflecting preferences for latent
features of PDP quality that vary from brand to brand raises a final question. Are the brand pref-
erences required to rationalize choices so large that we should view them as evidence of mis-
takes? Analysts may wish to move away from testing for consistency of choices with the axioms
of consumer theory and instead place an upper bound on how much a fully informed utility-
maximizing consumer would be willing to pay for unobserved features of PDP quality associated
with their preferred brand. To investigate how such thresholds affect the results, we calculate the
willingness to pay for all between-brand differences besides measured mean and variance of ex
post costs that would be sufficient for a consumer’s PDP choice to maximize a utility function
that satisfies the basic axioms. This measure of “sufficient willingness to pay” (SWTP) is de-
fined as the cost of the consumer’s chosen plan less the highest-cost plan on the portion of her
cost-variance frontier that dominates her chosen plan.28 Intuitively, SWTP is the amount of mon-
ey that a person leaves on the table by choosing a plan off the cost-variance frontier.

Note: The table reports the willingness to pay for brand that is sufficient for consumers’ PDP choices to maximize a utility function that satisfies

28
   The appendix includes a diagram of the SWTP calculation (Figure A2). This is the minimum WTP to trade the bundle of all omitted PDP at-
tributes of the most expensive plan on the segment of the cost-variance frontier that dominates the chosen brand for the bundle provided by the
chosen brand. Central to the logic of this statistic is the fact that by definition, choice of any plan on the frontier is a consistent choice.



                                                                                                                                                16
     Table 3 summarizes the SWTP distribution. When we pool the data over all consumers and
years, the median SWTP for brand is $47, or 4% of total expenditures. 29 The last three rows
show results for people who chose a plan off their cost-variance frontier but on their cost-
variance-brand frontier; i.e. the people who are added when we move from row 2 to row 4 in Ta-
ble 2. Their mean SWTP is $232 in 2006 and it ranges from $116 to $169 thereafter. These
means are heavily affected by small shares of consumers who exceed the $500 and $1,000
thresholds in the second and third rows of the table. Annual median SWTP ranges from $65 to
$136. Although interpretations may differ, we find it plausible that informed consumers would
be willing to pay these amounts for the bundle of unobserved PDP attributes that differ between
brands.30
     In summary, during the first five years of Medicare Part D, 79% of consumers made choices
consistent with maximizing some well-behaved utility function that depends on the mean and
variance of ex post cost and all other attributes that differ between brands. These results suggest
that AG’s parametric evidence of choice inconsistency is primarily driven by their assumptions
about the parametric form of the representative consumer’s utility function.

                       IV. Using CMS Data to Replicate and Extend AG’s Main Results

                   A. Replication of AG’s Main Parametric Results and Further Analysis

     AG assume that consumers’ decision utility (DU) function is a first order Taylor approxima-
tion to a CARA model that is linear and additively separable in plan characteristics,

(4)                          𝐷𝑈𝑖𝑗 = 𝑝𝑗 𝛼 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛽1 + 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 𝛽2 + 𝑐𝑗 𝛽3 + 𝑞𝑗 𝛾 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 ,

where 𝑝𝑗 is the plan premium, 𝜇𝑖𝑗 = 𝐸(𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 ), 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 = 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 ), 𝑞𝑗 is a vector of quality variables
(CMS quality index or brand dummies), and 𝑐𝑗 is a vector of financial plan characteristics that di-
rectly affect 𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗 . This includes the plan deductible, an indicator for whether the plan provides
full coverage of brand name drugs in the gap, an indicator for whether the plan only covers ge-
neric drugs in the gap, a count of the top 100 drugs covered by the plan, and a cost sharing index


29
   This includes 21% of consumers whose chosen plans are dominated by another plan within their chosen brand by treating their SWTP as infi-
nite. If we instead focus on the 79% of consumers who choose plans on their cost-variance-brand efficiency frontier (i.e. the consumers repre-
sented by the second and third bars in Figure 2) then the median SWTP is $32 or 3% of expenditures.
30
   Researchers can also calculate SWTP under stronger restrictions on the shape of the utility function. For example, if we assume that utility is
separable in the omitted variables captured by the brand indicators, then SWTP can be measured by the amount of money that would be saved by
switching to the least expensive plan on the portion of the cost variance frontier that dominates the chosen brand. Adding the separability as-
sumption causes the median SWTP to increase from $47 to $138 and the share with SWTP over $1000 to increase from 0.4% to 0.9%.



                                                                                                                                              17
that measures the average percentage of expenditures covered by the plan between the deductible
and the gap. Finally, 𝜖𝑖𝑗 is a random person-plan specific shock that is assumed to be drawn from
a type I extreme value distribution.

     AG rely on revealed preference logic to interpret their estimate for −𝛼 as the marginal utility
of income and their estimate for 𝛾 as the marginal utility from plan quality. In contrast, they rely
on their assumption for the hedonic utility (HU) function to define appropriate values for the 𝛽
parameters: (1) 𝛽1 = 𝛼̂ because consumers should assign equal weight to premiums and expected
OOP costs; (2) 𝛽2 < 0 because consumers should be risk averse; and (3) 𝛽3 = 0 because financial
attributes have no direct effect on HU under AG’s assumption that 𝜇𝑖𝑗 and 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 are the only mo-



                                                                                                                                              18
ments of the ex post cost distribution that consumers should care about. AG interpret violations
of these restrictions as evidence that consumers made optimization mistakes, as opposed to evi-
dence of omitted variables, model misspecification, measurement error, or finite sample bias.
      We replicate AG’s model (AG Table 1 column 3) using our CMS data for 2006. Table 4 re-
ports AG’s estimates in column 1 and our estimates for their model in column 2. Comparing the
two columns illustrates that we reproduce AG’s three main findings: (i) the coefficient on premi-
um is approximately five times larger than the coefficient on OOP costs; (ii) the negative coeffi-
cient on variance is statistically insignificant; and (iii) coefficients on financial characteristics,
such as gap coverage, are nonzero.31 Column 3 is the same as column 2 except that we replace
AG’s indicators for PDP contract id with indicators based on the brand name visible to consum-
ers.32 This increases the pseudo R2 and reduces the premium-to-OOP ratio from 5.5 to 3.7. It also
changes the signs on two of the five financial variables.

                      B. Replication of AG’s Welfare Calculations and Further Analysis

     In the second to last row of Table 4, we replicate AG’s calculation of the partial equilibrium
welfare gain from a hypothetical intervention “that would make individuals full informed and
fully rational” (p. 1208). For the purpose of estimating welfare losses AG assume that consum-
ers’ HU function is

(5)                          𝐻𝑈𝑖𝑗 = (𝑝𝑗 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗 )𝛼̂ + 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 𝛽̃2 + 𝑞𝑗 𝛾̂,

where 𝛼̂ and 𝛾̂ are estimates from a logit model of equation (4) and the coefficient on variance 𝛽̃2
is chosen to produce a coefficient of absolute risk aversion of 0.0003 as in AG (p.1208). Welfare
is calculated by using (5) to measure the compensating variation generated by switching from the
plan that maximizes each consumer’s DU function in (4) to the plan that maximizes the HU
function in (5) that AG have chosen for that consumer. The calculation is explained in our ap-
pendix. The most important detail is that AG assume that the Type I EV errors in (4) do not enter
the HU function in (5). That is, AG interpret nonzero values for 𝜀𝑖𝑗 as idiosyncratic optimization
mistakes made by consumers.33

31
   Appendix Table A5 demonstrates that we also replicate the pattern of results in AG’s more parsimonious specifications.
32
   Appendix Table A6 reports the results from the model in column 3 separately by year for 2006-2010. Table A7 shows that the premium-to-oop
coefficient ratio in AG’s most parsimonious specification is close to 1 in 2008-2010.
33
   AG refer readers seeking an explanation of their welfare calculations to Appendix D of the earlier NBER version of their paper. That appendix
includes the 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ≡ 0 assumption and the body of their NBER paper reports the same 27% welfare loss. Abaluck and Gruber (2013) make the same
assumption that 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ≡ 0.



                                                                                                                                            19
     To illustrate how AG’s interpretation of 𝜀𝑖𝑗 affects their welfare measure, the last row of Ta-
ble 4 reports the welfare loss under the common interpretation of 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 as a combination of mis-
specification, measurement error, and tastes for unobserved product attributes, in which case 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗
is assumed to enter HU. This calculation isolates the expected welfare loss from the three mis-
takes that AG emphasize. The difference between the last two rows isolates the component of the
welfare loss due to AG’s assumption that 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 represents consumer mistakes. When we set 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ≡ 0
in our replication of AG’s model in column 2, the average welfare loss is within one percentage
point of the statistic they report: 27% of plan costs ($366). In contrast, when we allow 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 to en-
ter utility the average welfare loss declines to 9% of plan costs, or $125 per person per year.
Hence, approximately two thirds of the welfare loss that AG report is due to their assumption
that 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 represents consumer mistakes. The share due to 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 rises to 81% in column 3 when we
replace the contract id dummies used by AG with dummies for the insurance brand names seen
by consumers.
     In a wide variety of empirical contexts, logit models require 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0 for some consumers’ ob-
served choices to maximize the analyst’s specification for utility (e.g. the markets for cars, hous-
es, labor, health care). The decision to interpret 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0 as an optimization mistake in these cases
predetermines that, all else constant, the average consumer will be found to make welfare-
reducing mistakes. For example, in column 4 we estimate equation (5) after adding an error term.
Despite this model precluding all three of AG’s explicit consumer mistakes, the model still gen-
erates large losses under AG’s welfare measure due to nonzero values of 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 .34

                 C. Testing Consistency between Parametric and Nonparametric Results

     To further investigate how assumptions about the shape of utility affect conclusions about
choice inconsistencies, we estimate AG’s model on the 25% of people who chose plans on their
efficiency frontiers in cost-variance space. By definition, these choices are consistent with mini-
mizing costs or with people maximizing utility by “choosing plans with higher mean expenditure
to protect themselves against variance in expenditure” (AG p.1190). As shown in the last column
of Table 4, AG’s model and welfare measure continues to produce evidence of choice inconsist-


34
   The average welfare loss is larger in column 4 than in columns 1-3 primarily because the premium coefficient becomes smaller when we im-
pose AG’s constraints. The results also show that allowing the model to incorporate AG’s three explicit consumer mistakes only improves model
fit marginally, increasing the pseudo R2 from 0.36 to 0.37.



                                                                                                                                         20
encies. While the variance coefficient is negative and significant, the premium-to-OOP coeffi-
cient ratio still exceeds one (1.5) and all of the coefficients on financial plan attributes are still
nonzero. Moreover, the welfare loss from these violations (10% of costs) is about as large as our
estimates for the full sample in column 3. This shows that AG’s evidence of welfare reducing
mistakes is primarily identified by their assumption about the parametric form of utility, not by
consumers making inconsistent choices by choosing plans off the efficiency frontier in cost-
variance space.

                     D. Caveats to Parametric Tests of Utility Maximization

   The research design that AG use to test whether consumers make welfare-reducing mistakes
relies on two general principles. First, there can be no omitted variables. AG addressed this by
stating, “we observe and include in our model all of the publicly available information that might
be used by individuals to make their choices” (p.1194). Second, the analyst must know the true
parametric forms of consumers’ utility functions. AG addressed the possibility that their model
could be misspecified by noting that two of their results are robust to several alternate specifica-
tions. They report 17 sets of estimates in their paper, describe robustness checks not shown in the
paper, and devote an appendix to exploring other utility functions (e.g. CRRA vs. CARA). Nev-
ertheless, these exercises do not validate AG’s methodology for identifying choice inconsisten-
cies: AG’s 17+ specifications represent what Leamer (1983 p. 38) calls a “zero volume set in the
space of assumptions.” In other words, AG’s robustness checks collectively represent an infini-
tesimally small share of the specifications for utility that are consistent with basic axioms of con-
sumer preference theory. Of course, models are meant to abstract from reality. Our point is not
that AG’s model is less than perfect. Our point is that omitted variables, measurement error and
misspecification of consumers’ utility functions can be easily misinterpreted as optimization mis-
takes when common positive models are instead used as normative benchmarks as in AG. Hence
a critical step in relying on this approach to assess the quality of consumer decision making is to
test the validity of the chosen parametric specification.

                          V. Testing Parametric Specifications for Utility

  Let 𝛽 denote a parameter vector satisfying AG’s restrictions on HU in (5): 𝛽 = [𝛽1 , 𝛽2 , 𝛽3 ]
and let 𝛽̂𝑢 denote an unrestricted estimate for 𝛽 from AG’s DU function in (4) for consumers in



                                                                                                   21
market u. The difference between the two vectors can be written as

(6)                                               𝛽̂𝑢 − 𝛽 = 𝑓(𝑔(𝑧𝑢 , 𝑎𝑢 ), 𝜉𝑢 ),

where the hat indicates that 𝛽̂𝑢 is unrestricted and 𝑓(∙) is a vector of functions. The sub-function
𝑔(𝑧𝑢 , 𝑎𝑢 ) is a “consumer mistake function” that explains how optimization mistakes are caused
by the two mechanisms that AG emphasize: complexity of the PDP menu, described by 𝑧𝑢 , and
the distribution of cognitive ability among consumers in the market, described by 𝑎𝑢 (AG p.
1183-1184, 1209). The last term inside 𝑓(∙) represents misspecification of the DU function, 𝜉𝑢 .
By attributing the difference between 𝛽̂𝑢 and 𝛽 to consumer mistakes, AG implicitly assume that
𝜉𝑢 = 0. Our concern is that the difference between 𝛽̂𝑢 and 𝛽 could instead be caused by model
misspecification.35 Therefore, we design three ways to test the hypothesis that 𝜉𝑢 = 0.

                  A. Test 1: Do Placebo Characteristics Appear to Affect Consumers’ Decisions?

       Our first test is a falsification test of AG’s finding that consumers mistakenly allow redundant
financial plan characteristics to affect their enrollment decisions. AG’s interpretation of the non-
zero coefficients on financial characteristics in the logit model as evidence of consumer mistakes
is based on their assertion that their models have no omitted variables (p.1194). Our concern is
that despite AG’s best efforts, and the improvements we have made to the data, the estimated ef-
fects of the financial characteristics may still be driven by correlation with omitted measures of
PDP cost, risk protection, and quality.
       To provide an opportunity to falsify this hypothesis we replace 𝑐𝑗 in equation (4) with 𝑐̃𝑗 ,
where 𝑐̃𝑗 = [𝑐𝑗 , 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑗 ]. Ideally, the placebos should be correlated with premia and OOP
spending, just like the financial characteristics in 𝑐𝑗 . Unlike 𝑐𝑗 , the placebos cannot be observed
by consumers so that 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑗 cannot directly affect consumers’ choices. Under these condi-
tions, the following restriction should hold:

(7)                                              𝛽̂4,𝑢 ⁄𝛼̂𝑢 = 0 ∀ 𝑢,

where 𝛽̂4,𝑢 is the estimated coefficient on 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑗 . A violation of this restriction would be evi-
dence that the model is misspecified in ways that make it vulnerable to finding evidence of con-
sumer biases where none exist.

35
     Given the large size of our CMS sample, we abstract from the potential effects of finite sample bias.



                                                                                                             22
      We create placebos from each plan’s three digit identifier (ID). These IDs were developed by
the CMS contractor BUC-CANEER using an encryption process. The IDs vary across plans and
brands but are themselves meaningless and not seen by consumers. The full set of characters in
the IDs is {8, 9, D, d, e, k, l, o, r, x}. Each character can appear up to three times in an ID code.
Our placebos are counts of the number of times each character appears in each plan’s ID. Like
the financial characteristics, the placebos are mildly correlated with premia and OOP costs be-
cause they and the encrypted ID codes all vary systematically across plans and brands. For ex-
ample, the correlation between OOP cost and full gap coverage is -0.05 compared to 0.04 for
OOP cost and x-count and -0.01 for OOP cost and r-count.36 Finding that the coefficients on x-
count and r-count are zero would build confidence in AG’s conclusion that consumers’ choices
are in fact influenced by financial attributes.
                                                                   Adding full gap coverage                                                  $306

                  FIGURE 3: IMPLIED WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR FINANCIAL AND PLACEBO PLAN ATTRIBUTES


      Our estimates for 𝛽̂4,𝑢 ⁄𝛼̂𝑢 are statistically different from zero for every alphanumeric charac-
ter.37 We assess economic significance by calculating the WTP for changes in the financial and
placebo attributes in 2006 using the same measures of WTP reported by AG (p.1198). To remain
in-sample, we calculate the WTP for replacing two of one character with two of another, yielding
WTP measures that are comparable to AG’s measures of WTP for non-marginal changes in fi-
nancial attributes. Under the hypothesis that AG’s model is correctly specified the implied WTP
for placebos should be closer to zero than the WTP for real financial attributes. Yet this is not the
case. Figure 3 shows that all but one of the financial attributes have WTP measures that are ex-

36
     We report correlation coefficients in appendix Table A8.
37
     The model results are reported in Appendix Table A9.



                                                                                                                                                    23
ceeded by WTP for some of the placebos. For example, the DU coefficients imply that consum-
ers are willing to pay $106 to replace two r’s with two x’s in the plan ID. This measure is 20%
larger than the implied WTP for generic gap coverage and seven times larger than the WTP for
decreasing the deductible from $250 to $0. AG’s model implies similarly large WTP measures
for substitution patterns of other placebo attributes besides r’s and x’s.38 These results show that
consumers’ PDP choices appear to be influenced by fake plan attributes in an economically sig-
nificant way, with magnitudes similar to the WTP measures for real financial attributes.39 This
falsification test casts doubt on whether consumers are really making PDP choices based on a
plan’s cost sharing, generic gap coverage, coverage of the top 100 drugs, and deductible.40

                             B. Test 2: Are the Utility Parameters Stable Across Markets?

      Our second test investigates whether between-market variation in the signs and magnitudes of
estimated mistakes can be explained by between-market variation in the factors that AG hypoth-
                                         ̂ 𝑢 denote a normalized vector of estimates for the 𝛽 pa-
esize to be the sources of mistakes. Let Β
rameters, where each element of the vector is divided by the estimated marginal utility of in-
           ̂1,𝑢 = 𝛽̂1,𝑢 ⁄𝛼̂𝑢 . The purpose of this normalization is to enable comparison across
come; e.g. Β
markets. If observed violations are due to choice complexity and consumers’ lack of cognitive
ability as AG hypothesize (p.1183-1184, 1209), and we estimate the model in two separate mar-
kets, 𝑢 and 𝑣, in which consumers with the same cognitive abilities face different PDP menus
that are equally complex, then a well-specified model will yield two separate consistent estimates
for the same normalized parameter vector:

(8)                               ̂𝑢 = Β
                                  Β    ̂ 𝑣 ∀ 𝑢, 𝑣 ∶ 𝑎𝑢 = 𝑎𝑣 and 𝑧𝑢 = 𝑧𝑣 .

This restriction follows directly from (6). Similarly, under AG’s hypothesis, we would expect the
magnitudes of violations to be smaller in regions where people have greater cognitive ability and
choose from simpler menus. To test these hypotheses we exploit the way CMS divides the nation


38
   The results in the figure can be combined to evaluate the implied WTP for substitution of any placebo attributes, e.g. the results imply a WTP
of $114 for replacing two replacing two k’s with two l's and a WTP of $98 for replacing two o's with 2 d's.
39
   Abaluck and Gruber provided us with results for a slightly different approach to the placebo test, which for the sake of transparency we report
in Table A10. In addition to yielding similarly large implied WTP for placebo attributes, their analysis yields implied WTP for financial attributes
that differ widely from their original estimates and from our estimates.
40
   The relatively larger WTP for full gap coverage could mean that consumers find this plan feature inherently attractive, or it could mean that full
gap coverage is more highly correlated with omitted variables, including observed but misspecified attributes, than our placebos. Some of the
possible omitted variables include higher moments of the cost distribution as well as aspects of risk protection not captured by the AG variance
measure. As one example, having gap coverage helps to smooth expenses across months, which may be important for retired people living on
fixed monthly incomes.



                                                                                                                                                 24
into regions with distinct PDP menus. We estimate the model separately for 32 of these regions
for 2006, excluding Alaska and Hawaii due to small samples. Holding cognitive ability and
menu complexity fixed, instability of the coefficients could indicate that the model is misspeci-
fied in ways that vary from market to market (𝜉𝑢 ≠ 𝜉𝑣 ≠ 0) such as latent heterogeneity in pref-
erences and unobserved PDP quality.41
     In every region, our estimates violate at least two of AG’s three parametric restrictions, but
the violations have inconsistent signs and magnitudes. Our data include between 1,462 and
42,441 people per region, so most of our estimates are statistically precise. Yet the estimated pa-
rameters are highly unstable. The ratio of the premium coefficient to the OOP coefficient pro-
vides a leading example. Figure 4 maps this ratio for each region. Focusing on the 24 markets in
which the estimated marginal utility of income is positive and statistically different from zero,
the premium-to-OOP ratio ranges from 1.1 in region 25 (IA, MN, MT, NE, ND, SD, WY) to
12.3 in region 2 (MA, CT, RI and VT). Taken literally, these results imply that the average con-
sumer in region 25 would pay about $1 in higher OOP costs to reduce their plan premium by $1,
whereas the average consumer in region 2 would pay about $12 in OOP costs to reduce their
premium by $1.42




                      FIGURE 4—RATIO OF PREMIUM-TO-OOP COEFFICIENTS IN 2006, BY CMS REGION
Note: The figure reports the premium-to-OOP coefficient ratio obtained by estimating region-specific models equivalent to the national model in
column 3 of Table 4. In regions with light-shaded numbers, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the marginal utility of income is negative at
the 5% level. Asterisks indicate that the premium-to-OOP ratio is statistically indistinguishable from 1 at the 5% level.


41
  This can also be seen from the axioms underlying the proof of McFadden’s lemma 6 (McFadden 1974).
42
  Figure A3 shows that the range across regions widens substantially if we replace our brand name dummies with the contract ID proxy for brand
used by AG. In that case, the premium-to-OOP ratio ranges from 1.2 in region 25 to 76.1 in region 4 (NJ).



                                                                                                                                               25
     All of the other parameter ratios are similarly unstable, as are the corresponding welfare loss-
es. Most of the ratios span orders of magnitude and many include sign changes. The top part of
Table 5 illustrates this instability by comparing results from our national model to results for the
five largest CMS regions, which collectively represent 36% of the national sample. For example,
under the interpretation that AG give to their national results the ratios imply that people in re-
gions 11 and 25 mistakenly prefer plans with more cost sharing whereas people in regions 4, 17,
and 22 mistakenly prefer plans with less cost sharing. Likewise, people in regions 4, 11, and 22
appear to be mistakenly attracted by generic gap coverage whereas people in regions 17 and 25
appeared to be mistakenly repelled by generic gap coverage.43 The bottom part of Table 5 reports
proxy measures for PDP menu complexity and the average consumer’s cognitive ability. These
measures do not appear to explain the variation in parameter ratios and welfare measures across
the five regions.
     Parameter ratios and welfare measures are similarly unstable across the other 27 CMS regions
as evident from the complete region-by-region results and summary statistics in Tables A13 and
A14. To summarize these results, we use the 24 regions with statistically significant positive es-
timates for the marginal utility of income to estimate a meta-regression of the conditional rela-
tionship between the premium-to-OOP ratio and proxy measures for menu complexity and cog-
nitive ability,

(9)                                    𝛼̂𝑢 ⁄𝛽̂𝑂𝑂𝑃,𝑢 = 𝜑 + 𝛿 𝑧𝑢 + 𝜔𝑎𝑢 + 𝜓,

where the dependent variable is the premium-to-OOP ratio for region u, the 𝑧𝑢 vector includes
the number of plans, the number of brands, the number of plans with gap coverage and the num-
ber of plans with zero deductible, and 𝑎𝑢 includes the mean consumer’s age and the percent of
consumers with dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease). Our results fail to reject the joint hy-
pothesis that 𝛿 = 𝜔 = 0 at the 10% level.44 We obtain similarly insignificant results when we re-
peat the regression using AG’s welfare measure as the dependent variable, regardless of whether

43
   We also observe similar instability in model parameters and welfare measures in Table 5 when use AG’s proxy measures for brand dummies
and when we limit the sample to white females under the age of 80 who have not been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or depres-
sion. Appendix Tables A11 and A12 report these results.
44
   Measurement error introduced by using econometric estimates as the dependent variable in (9) may bias the standard errors downward, rein-
forcing our finding of statistical insignificance. As a robustness check on this finding, we repeat estimation of AG’s model in (4) after adding
terms that interact 𝑧𝑖𝑢 and 𝑎𝑖𝑢 with expected OOP expenditures (𝜇𝑖𝑗 ), and then use the resulting estimates to predict the premium-to-oop ratio for
each region. These predictions are reported in the last row of tables A13 and A14. Consistent with our findings from the meta-regression, there is
little variation in the predicted ratios relative to what we observe in the region-specific estimates. Results from the model with interactions are re-
ported in Table A16.

Note: The top portion of the table reports ratios of parameter estimates from our baseline model (Table 4 column 3) for selected CMS regions
with standard errors in parentheses. Region 25 includes Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Region 17
is Illinois; Region 11 is Florida; Region 22 is Texas; and Region 4 is New Jersey. Mean potential savings is the amount of money the average
consumer would have saved by switching to their lowest cost alternative.



    In summary, the parameters of AG’s behavioral model vary greatly across CMS regions and
these fluctuations produce order-of-magnitude differences in AG’s measure of lost consumer
welfare. These differences are not explained by regional variation in PDP menu complexity and
proxy measures for the average consumer’s cognitive ability. For this evidence to be interpreted


                                                                                                                                        27
as supporting AG’s hypotheses about consumer mistakes, the average consumers in different
CMS regions would have to be reacting to similarity complex PDP menus by making mistakes
that vary greatly in their severity (e.g. the magnitude of the premium-to-OOP ratio) and by mak-
ing contradictory types of mistakes (e.g. changing signs of coefficients on financial attributes).
While enrollees may differ in the extent to which they make fully informed decisions, we would
expect this heterogeneity to be driven primarily by variation across consumers within CMS re-
gions. Hence, we interpret the unexplained between-region variation in the parameters of AG’s
behavioral model as evidence of potential model misspecification.

        C. Test 3: Does Allowing for Mistakes Improve our Ability to Predict Choices?

  Our last test builds on best practices in validation techniques to judge the usefulness of struc-
tural models for informing policy (e.g. McFadden et al. 1977, Keane and Wolpin 2007). In his
summary of the literature, Keane (2010) recommends evaluating the relative performances of
competing models of utility maximization based on two criteria: (i) their ability to reproduce im-
portant features of the data on which they were estimated; and (ii) their ability to make accurate
out-of-sample predictions for how agents will behave in different choice environments. We ap-
ply this logic in a new way and test whether allowing for specific mistakes improves a structural
model’s ability to predict people’s choices. Specifically, we compare the accuracy of predictions
made by AG’s DU model that allows for consumer mistakes (equation 4) with AG’s less flexible
but otherwise identical expected utility maximization (EUM) model that maintains the assump-
tion that consumers do not make any of the three explicit mistakes (equation 5). The two compet-
ing models correspond to columns 3 and 4 of Table 4, respectively. This comparison is relevant
for policy because AG’s EUM model assumes no welfare loss from the three mistakes, i.e.
DU ≡ HU (setting aside AG’s interpretation of the error terms) whereas AG’s DU model allows
DU ≠ HU).
  Because AG’s DU model is more flexible it yields a better fit to the data on which it was es-
timated in the sense that it has a higher pseudo R-squared. The estimated coefficients also allow
us to reject the nested EUM model at the 1% level of statistical significance based on a Wald
test. Yet this rejection could be driven by model misspecification, such as correlation between
the financial plan characteristics and omitted measures of PDP cost, risk protection, and quality.
In this case AG’s simpler EUM model could yield more accurate estimates for people’s PDP



                                                                                                28
choice process and, therefore, more accurate predictions for how people would react to different
PDP choice environments. This is the reason for comparing the two models based on the accura-
cy of their out-of-sample predictions in a choice environment that differs from the in-sample en-
vironment. As Keane and Wolpin (2007) explain, in the absence of a controlled or natural exper-
iment an effective approach to assessing the out-of-sample predictive power of competing
structural models is to use nonrandom holdout samples. The ideal holdout sample is nonrandom
in the sense that it should describe a market in which consumers choose among products with
combinations of attributes that differ from those of the products found in the market used to es-
timate the model. The model that better predicts how consumers behave under choice environ-
ments that differ from the environment under which the model was estimated would also be ex-
pected to yield more accurate estimates for consumer preferences and, therefore, to make better
predictions for the welfare effects of policies that alter the choice environment along similar di-
mensions.45
     Our validation test is based on 𝑠𝑢 , a policy-relevant statistic describing market u that can be
observed in the data as well as predicted as a function of model parameters. The better perform-
ing model is the one that yields a lower value for

(8)                                              |𝑠̂𝑢 (𝛼̂, 𝛽̂ , 𝛾̂) − 𝑠𝑢 |,

where 𝑠̂𝑢 (𝛼̂, 𝛽̂ , 𝛾̂) is a prediction for 𝑠𝑢 based on the AG’s DU or AG’s EUM model. Following
standard practice, we call the predictions “in-sample” if they are based on estimates for 𝛼, 𝛽, and
𝛾 from market u and “out-of-sample” if they are based on estimates from a different market (i.e.
a different CMS region). This is a high-power test in the sense that it is stacked against the less
flexible EUM model. Comparing the two models in Table 4 illustrates that AG’s benchmark
EUM model constrains seven parameters of AG’s DU model (the parameters of the mean and
variance of OOP cost and the five financial attributes). The additional flexibility of AG’s DU
model increases its potential to reflect behaviors present in the data.
     We use each model to predict seven outcomes broadly relevant to consumers and policymak-
ers. The first is the share of consumers with some form of coverage in the gap. This clearly mat-
ters to policymakers given the scheduled transition to mandatory gap coverage in 2015. The sec-

45
  This validation test differs from our regional comparison of AG’s DU parameters in Table 5 in two ways. First, it is unclear a priori how differ-
ences in DU parameters across two regions will affect the accuracy of predictions for policy relevant statistics that are highly nonlinear functions
of those DU parameters. Second, the objective here is to compare AG’s DU and EUM models, conditional on the fact that both use estimates
from one region to predict outcomes for other regions.



                                                                                                                                                29
ond is the share of consumers choosing plans that are dominated in the sense that they lie off the
frontier in cost-variance-brand space. These consumers could have saved money by choosing a
lower-variance plan offered by their chosen brand. Both consumers and policymakers are likely
interested in reducing within-brand overspending. Third, we predict the share of consumers who
choose the lowest cost plan within their chosen brand, conditional on their chosen brand offering
multiple plans. This provides another proxy measure of ex post decision making quality. The
next two statistics describe the median consumer’s expenditures. We predict total expenditures
(premium + OOP) as well as within-brand overspending on dominated plans. The last two statis-
tics are the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and the market share of the most popular brand,
commonly used by regulators as measures of the degree of market competition.
     To implement the validation test we select a single region as the estimation sample and use
the resulting parameters to predict choices in every other region. To be comprehensive we repeat
this procedure 32 times, iteratively using each region as the estimation sample, and then analyze
the combined results from the 32 in-sample predictions and all 992 possible out-of-sample pre-
dictions. To calculate an overall measure of model performance, the in-sample absolute predic-
tion errors are weighted by the share of the CMS sample in each estimation region and the out-
of-sample predictions are weighted by the share in the holdout regions.46 The top half of Table 6
shows the results from models that rely on the CMS star ratings to proxy for plan quality, while
the lower half is from models that use the brand indicators.47
     The first column in Table 6 reports the national values in the data while the next two columns
show the in-sample fit of AG’s DU and EUM models in terms of mean absolute deviation. The
DU model is constrained to reproduce the in-sample share of consumers with gap coverage, and
when brand indicators are used to proxy for quality both the DU and EUM models are con-
strained to match the two market concentration measures. Among the remaining statistics, the
DU model usually does better as expected due to its greater flexibility.




46
   In their comments on an earlier draft of this article, Abaluck and Gruber suggested using 31 regions as the estimation sample to predict choices
in the single remaining holdout region, and then repeating this exercise for each of the 32 regions. This is not an ideal test of a model’s out-of-
sample predictive power. In the PDP context it is very similar to an in-sample test in the sense that the set of plans in the 31 estimation regions of-
ten comes very close to spanning the set of plans in the hold out region. This reduces the power of the test to reject the more flexible AG model in
favor of the EUM hypothesis. Nevertheless, we implement this test and report results in Table A19. AG’s EUM model does as well or better than
their DU model on 11 out of 14 measures.
47
   Many brands are not present in any given region. In those cases we assign brand indicator coefficients via an auxiliary regression. Specifically,
we regress the in-sample brand indicators on their CMS star ratings and use the estimated coefficient to impute any out-of-sample brand indica-
tors that are not present in the estimation sample.

Note: | Model error | refers to the mean absolute deviation between the regional-level model predictions and data, weighted across regions by the
number of people in the sample in the region. The results are based on every possible pairwise combination of regions in 2006 except that they
exclude regions 33 and 34 (HI and AK) due to small samples, and the lower half also excludes region 26 (NM) because the generic gap indicator
is collinear with the brand indicators for that region. Thus the values in the top half are based on the results from all 992 of the possible regional
out-of-sample predictions while those in the lower half are based on 930 of them.


    The last two columns of Table 6 summarize each model’s out-of-sample predictive power.
We expect both models to perform worse out of sample, but the DU model has a relatively larger
reduction in predictive power. Importantly, the EUM model yields predictions that are as close or
closer to the data for 12 of the 14 measures. The fact that AG’s DU model does better at predict-
ing the two measures of market concentration when star ratings are used to proxy for quality
could be because the additional seven parameters of the DU model give it greater flexibility to
capture latent features of PDP quality when brand indicators are omitted.
    Because using brand indicators for quality requires imputing coefficients for brands that are
offered in the prediction region but not the estimation region, we perform a robustness check in
which we limit the validation exercise to region pairs for which one region’s brands is nested in


                                                                                                                                                  31
the other’s. This allows inclusion of brand indicators without imputation. The results of this ex-
ercise, reported in Table A17, affirm the national results in the lower half of Table 6, as do re-
sults from repeating the exercise in Table 6 using the root mean square error as the test statistic
in lieu of the mean absolute deviation (Table A18). Altogether, these results demonstrate that
AG’s benchmark model without welfare reducing mistakes leads to predictions for policy-
relevant statistics that typically match the data on people’s PDP choices about as well, and often
better, than predictions from AG’s model with optimization mistakes.

                                             VI. Conclusion

   Neoclassical and psychological models of consumer behavior often make divergent predic-
tions for the welfare effects of paternalistic policies. As Bernheim and Rangel (2009) observed,
the lack of methodological consensus within economics results in analysts selecting models for
policy evaluation based on ad hoc criteria that are inevitably controversial. Within this conflicted
environment, researchers’ assumptions about what they know about other peoples’ preferences,
constraints, and information have wide scope to influence the researchers’ interpretations of re-
sults and their conclusions about the effects of various policies. One of our objectives for this ar-
ticle was to overcome this impasse by developing a broadly applicable three-step approach to
evaluating the role and validity of modeling assumptions underlying conclusions about the quali-
ty of consumer decision making.
   The first step is to integrate parametric and nonparametric tests of utility maximization by us-
ing internally consistent assumptions about which product attributes affect utility. The nonpara-
metric results will reveal whether inferences based on the analyst’s chosen parametric model are
robust to alternative specifications for utility. If the results are not robust, then the next step is to
calculate nonparametric measures of the sufficient willingness to pay for product attributes.
These measures help to clarify the tradeoffs implied by the set of utility functions that are max-
imized by consumers’ choices. Finally, we propose designing tests to disentangle consumer mis-
takes from the researcher’s misspecification of their utility functions. Of particular value are
head-to-head validation tests of models’ out-of-sample predictive power that build on McFadden
(1977) and Keane and Wolpin (2007). That is, a key step in establishing that consumers are mak-
ing specific welfare-reducing mistakes is to first show that incorporating such mistakes into a
model improves its predictions for how consumers react to changes in the choice environment.



                                                                                                      32
  In the context of Medicare Part D, our nonparametric tests revealed that Abaluck and Gruber’s
(2011) [AG] parametric evidence that enrollees made large welfare reducing optimization mis-
takes in 2006 is not robust to alternative specifications for utility. We showed that these alterna-
tive specifications imply that the median consumer must have been willing to pay at least $80
(6% of total out of pocket expenditures) in 2006 for all between-brand differences in plan quali-
ty. We also found that a simpler version of AG’s model that maintains the hypothesis of ex-
pected utility maximization makes out-of-sample predictions that are typically as good, and often
better, than their model with psychological biases. These empirical results cast doubt on the no-
tion that the three mistakes in AG’s model have an important influence on how people choose in-
surance plans. They also cast doubt on the notion that people would benefit from policies that
would restrict their ability to choose insurance plans for themselves. That said, our results do not
imply that everyone always makes fully informed enrollment decisions or that nobody would
benefit from paternalistic policies. Rather, our results imply that evaluating the distributional
welfare implications of paternalistic reforms to health insurance markets requires us to first de-
velop a better understanding of how heterogeneous consumers obtain and process information
about differentiated health insurance products with uncertain payoffs.

                     I. DERIVING ABALUCK AND GRUBER’S WELFARE MEASURES


AG begin by assuming that consumers’ decisions are guided by a logit model that is linear and
additively separable in PDP characteristics, as shown in (4) and repeated here for convenience.

(A1)                   ̂𝑖𝑗 + 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 = 𝑝𝑗 𝛼̂ + 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛽̂1 + 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 𝛽̂2 + 𝑐𝑗 𝛽̂3 + 𝑞𝑗 𝛾̂ + 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 .
                𝑢̂𝑖𝑗 = 𝜔

In contrast, the actual utility a consumer experiences from her selected PDP is instead defined by
the following hedonic utility function that satisfies AG’s three normative restrictions,

(A2)            𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 𝜔𝑖𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗 = 𝑝𝑗 𝛼̂ + 𝜇𝑖𝑗 𝛼̂ + 𝜎𝑖𝑗2 𝛽̃2 + 𝑞𝑗 𝛾̂ + 𝜀𝑖𝑗 , where 𝛽̃2 < 0.

Because AG assume the marginal utility of income is a constant revealed by 𝛼̂, a consumer’s ex-
pected welfare from choosing plan j can be expressed as
                           1
(A3)           𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝛼̂ 𝐸[𝑢𝑖𝑗 |𝑢̂𝑖𝑗 > 𝑢̂𝑖𝑘 ∀ 𝑘].

PDP choice and welfare are both deterministic from the consumer’s perspective. The expectation
in (A3) simply reflects the analyst’s inability to observe 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 .
    AG aim to calculate the partial equilibrium welfare gain from a hypothetical intervention
“that would make individuals fully informed and fully rational” (p 1208). In other words, they
want to calculate the welfare gain from a policy that would induce the consumer to choose the
PDP that maximizes AG’s normative utility function (A2) instead of (A1). Assuming the policy
has no effect on the marginal utility of income, the welfare gain can be expressed in general
terms as
                               1
(A4)           Δ𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝛼̂ 𝐸[max𝑘 {𝑢𝑖𝑘 } − (𝑢𝑖𝑗 |𝑢̂𝑖𝑗 > 𝑢̂𝑖𝑘 ∀ 𝑘)].

The analytical formula depends on the interpretation of the residual utility terms, 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 and 𝜀𝑖𝑗 .
    In appendix D of the NBER (2009) version of their paper, AG outline two different ap-
proaches to interpreting residual utility. The more conventional approach, laid out in earlier pa-
pers such as Leggett (2002), is to interpret 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 as the idiosyncratic utility from PDP characteris-
tics that consumers observe but the analyst does not. Examples include proximity to in-network
pharmacies, availability of mail-order pharmacies, individual-specific experience with the insur-

                                                                                                     A1
ers, coordination with spouses, disutility from prior authorization requirements, uncertainty
about whether other plans will approve prior authorization requests, and so on. In this case the
policy intervention has no effect on the utility residual because the same unobserved PDP attrib-
utes enter hedonic utility.48 Thus 𝜀𝑖𝑗 = 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 .
     In contrast, the approach that Abaluck and Gruber (2011, 2013) use for their published em-
pirical analyses is to assume that the policy intervention also eliminates the utility residual:
𝜀𝑖𝑗 = 0. That is, 𝜀𝑖𝑗 itself is treated as an optimization mistake in addition to violations in the
three parametric restrictions that they explicitly mention as reducing welfare (p.1208). This ap-
proach embeds at least three important assumptions. First, it assumes there are no omitted varia-
bles. The analyst must have data on every PDP attribute that affects consumers’ hedonic utility.
Second, it assumes (A1) and (A2) are correctly specified. The analyst must know the true para-
metric forms of decision utility and hedonic utility. Third, it assumes the policy intervention has
no direct effect on utility. For example, the two policies suggested in AG may affect welfare due
to distaste for being nudged or distaste for sacrificing control over plan choices to a surrogate de-
cider. Together, these three assumptions are required for AG to treat 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 as an idiosyncratic opti-
mization mistake that is eliminated by their hypothetical policy.
     In the remainder of this section we derive analytical formulas for consumer welfare under
each of the two approaches to interpreting residual utility. Whereas Abaluck and Gruber (2009)
derive measures of baseline consumer surplus prior to any policy intervention, we derive the key
statistic used in their welfare calculations (and ours)—the change in consumer welfare caused by
the hypothetical policy “that would make individuals fully informed and fully rational”.


                      Case 1. Residual Utility is an Optimization Mistake: 𝜺𝒊𝒋 ≡ 𝟎 ∀𝒊𝒋

In this case the analyst can calculate baseline consumer surplus for each individual by using the
marginal utility of income to translate utils into dollars:
                                                𝜔𝑖𝑗
(A5)                  𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝐶𝑆𝑖 =            ̂
                                                      .
                                                 𝛼

After consumers are made to choose the plans that maximize AG’s normative utility function the
post-policy consumer surplus becomes

48
   As we point out in section IV, 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 may also reflect misspecification of the true parametric form of decision utility. In this case 𝜀𝑖𝑗 may differ
from 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 if the policy affects the marginal decision utility of one or more PDP attributes included in 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 .

                                                                                                                                                A2
                                                  1
(A6)                     𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖∗ ] = 𝐶𝑆𝑖∗ = ̂ max𝑘 {𝜔𝑖𝑘 }.
                                                  𝛼

Hence the change in welfare generated by the hypothetical policy is
                                                             1
(A7)                     ∆𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝐶𝑆𝑖∗ − 𝐶𝑆𝑖 = 𝛼̂ [max𝑘 {𝜔𝑖𝑘 } − 𝜔𝑖𝑗 ].

Since 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ≡ 0 the analyst can calculate actual consumer surplus instead of expected consumer
surplus.


                        Case 2: Residual Utility Reflects Omitted Attributes 𝜺̂𝒊𝒋 = 𝜺𝒊𝒋 ∀𝒊𝒋

In this case the analyst must integrate over the assumed Type I EV distribution for 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 to calcu-
late expected consumer surplus prior to the policy. The resulting expression in (A8) depends on
the standard log sum rule as well as the difference between decision utility and hedonic utility
weighted by the probability of selecting each PDP (e.g. Small and Rosen 1981, Leggett 2002,
Abaluck and Gruber 2009).
                                                                                       ̂
                                                                                       𝜔
                                       1                                              𝑒 𝑖𝑗
(A8)                     𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝛼̂ [𝑙𝑛 ∑𝑘 𝑒 𝜔̂𝑖𝑘 + ∑𝑗(𝜔𝑖𝑗 − 𝜔
                                                               ̂𝑖𝑗 ) ∑                   ̂
                                                                                         𝜔     ] + 𝐶̂ .
                                                                                      𝑘 𝑒 𝑖𝑘


In the equation, 𝐶̂ represents the constant of integration divided by 𝛼̂. It arises from the assumed
Type I EV distribution for 𝜀̂𝑖𝑗 and the fact that the level of utility is unknown.
        The policy intervention eliminates the wedge between decision utility and hedonic utility,
simplifying calculation of post-policy consumer surplus:

                                        1                                               𝜌
(A9)                     𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖∗ ] = 𝛼̂ [𝑙𝑛 ∑𝑘 𝑒 𝜔𝑖𝑘 ] + 𝐶, where = 𝐶̂ + 𝛼̂ .


If the policy intervention has a direct effect on utility, defined here by 𝜌, then the post-policy
constant of integration, 𝐶, differs from the pre-policy constant of integration.49 On the other
hand, if we follow AG in assuming that the policy has no direct effect on utility then 𝜌 = 0 and
𝐶 = 𝐶̂ . In this case, the change in expected consumer surplus is
                                                                                                                 ̂
                                                                                                                 𝜔
                                                                  1      ∑ 𝑒 𝜔𝑖𝑘                                𝑒 𝑖𝑗
(A10)              ∆𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖∗ ] − 𝐸[𝐶𝑆𝑖 ] = 𝛼̂ [𝑙𝑛 ∑𝑘                    ̂ 𝑖𝑘 − ∑𝑗 (𝜔𝑖𝑗 − 𝜔

   Equation (A10) isolates the combined welfare effect of imposing the three normative re-
strictions on utility that AG emphasize. In contrast, the 27% welfare gain that AG report in their
conclusion is based on the calculation in (A7) that embeds their normative restrictions along with
the added assumption that residual utility consists entirely of optimization mistakes. Therefore,
comparing empirical results for (A7) and (A10) will reveal the extent to which AG’s reported
27% potential welfare gain is driven by the particular optimization mistakes they emphasize rela-
tive to their novel interpretation of the Type I EV logit error term.

  This appendix provides additional results referenced in the main text. Table A1 provides an
example of the difference between AG’s definition for brand dummies that relies on CMS con-
tract ID codes that are unobserved by consumers and our definition that relies on company and
plan names observed by consumers. We define AARP and UnitedHealth as two distinct brands,
whereas AG group one AARP plan and one UnitedHealth plan into one brand, and two AARP
plans and one UnitedHealth plan into a separate brand.

  Figure A1 reports the gap premium and gap enrollment rates for various alternative samples.
Panel A shows that the divergence between AG’s results and results from the CMS data widens
when part-year enrollees are included in the CMS sample as they likely were in AG’s sample.
The remaining panels provide further evidence that people responded to how gap coverage mat-
tered for themselves. Panel B depicts CMS region 25 which was the region with the largest num-
ber of (non-poor) PDP enrollees. It is comprised of Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North
Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. People in these states had exclusive access to a plan with
especially generous gap coverage, as seen from comparing the cost premia in panel B with that
in Figure 1B. They responded by enrolling at much higher rates—up to 75% at the 98th expendi-
ture quantile. Thus, enrollment in gap plans varied dramatically across regions with the regional
rate of enrollment increasing in the generosity of coverage.

        FIGURE A1: PERCENT CHOOSING GAP COVERAGE AND ADDED COST BY EXPENDITURE QUANTILE


  Table A2 summarizes how the average consumer’s chosen plan differs from other plans the
consumer could have chosen. Each cell reports the difference between an attribute of the con-
sumer’s chosen plan and the mean value of that same attribute calculated over all of the plans
that the consumer could have chosen but did not. For example, in 2006 the average consumer
paid $112 less in out of pocket costs for prescription drugs under her chosen plan then she would
have paid, on average, if she had enrolled in a different plan than was available to her.

    Table A3 provides the share of people in 2006 and 2007 that could reduce their spending by
certain amounts by moving from their plan without gap coverage into the cheapest plan with gap

              FIGURE A2—ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUFFICIENT WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR BRAND


   Figure A2 illustrates how we calculate the sufficient willingness to pay (SWTP) for the bun-
dle of unobserved PDP attributes that vary from brand to brand. To begin, consider a plan, a, that
lies on the efficiency frontier in cost-variance-brand space, where cost means the total cost (pre-
miums plus ex post OOP drug costs) to the individual. Figure A2 is projected in cost-variance
space. The dots represent other available plans. Plans on the efficiency frontier in cost-variance
space have dark shading; plans off the frontier have light shading. The area inside the rectangle
defined by the dashed lines that intersect at point a defines the portion of the efficiency frontier
where other plans dominate a in cost-variance space. In the figure there are two such plans, b and
c. We define SWTP as the amount of income the consumer gives up by choosing to purchase
plan a instead of the most expensive plan on the portion of the cost-variance frontier that domi-
nates plan a. Hence, 𝑆𝑊𝑇𝑃 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 .
   SWTP can be interpreted as an arbitrarily close approximation to the willingness to pay for
latent attributes of the consumer’s preferred brand for a consumer with preferences satisfying
basic axioms of consumer preference theory. To see why, suppose that plan a is sold by brand A
whereas plans b and c are sold by brand B, and the two brands differ in a vector of latent quality

                                                                                                A8
attributes, q. Consider a consumer who prefers plan b to plan c and is indifferent between plans b
and a such that

                        𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 , 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑏 , 𝑞𝐵 )
(A11)                   = 𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎 , 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑎 , 𝑞𝐴 )
                        = 𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 − 𝑆𝑊𝑇𝑃, 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑎 , 𝑞𝐴 ),

where the last line follows from the definition of SWTP. The consumer’s exact willingness to pay
(WTP) to switch from 𝑞𝐵 to 𝑞𝐴 , evaluated at the best available point on the efficiency frontier in
cost-variance space, is implicitly defined by the following equation

(A12)         𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 , 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑏 , 𝑞𝐵 ) = 𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 − 𝑊𝑇𝑃, 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑏 , 𝑞𝐴 ).

Combining (A11) and (A12) yields the following expression

(A13)      𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 − 𝑆𝑊𝑇𝑃, 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑎 , 𝑞𝐴 ) = 𝑈(𝑦 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑏 − 𝑊𝑇𝑃, 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑏 , 𝑞𝐴 ).

  Assuming the consumer’s preferences satisfy global risk aversion and strong monotonicity it
must be the case that 𝑊𝑇𝑃 > 𝑆𝑊𝑇𝑃. This follows from (A13) because quality is held constant
at 𝑞𝐴 . That is, in order to hold utility constant when the variance decreases from 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑎 to 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑏 ,
the risk averse consumer’s income must be reduced. Thus, 𝑊𝑇𝑃 = 𝑆𝑊𝑇𝑃 + 𝜀, where 𝜀 is a pos-
itive constant that reflects the willingness to pay to reduce the variance from 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑎 to 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑏 at 𝑞𝐴 .
Finally, notice that 𝜀 can be made arbitrarily close to zero (e.g. one tenth of one cent) without vi-
olating completeness, transitivity, strong monotonicity or risk aversion. It follows that 𝑆𝑊𝑇𝑃
provides an arbitrarily close approximation to the willingness to pay for latent attributes of the
consumer’s preferred brand, conditional on cost and variance, that is sufficient to rationalize the
consumer’s observed choice. Also notice that SWTP equals 0 for any plan on the efficiency fron-
tier in cost-variance space, whereas no value for SWTP can rationalize the choice of a plan that
lies off the efficiency frontier in cost-variance-brand space.
  This logic generalizes to any number of plans on the portion of the efficiency frontier that
dominates plan a in cost-variance space. Regardless of the thickness or sparseness of plans in at-
tribute space, we can always set 𝜀 to be less than e, where e is an arbitrarily small positive con-
stant. Likewise, this logic can be generalized to any assignment of plans to brands by restricting
the consumer to have identical tastes for the vector of latent attributes associated with brands B,
C, D, and so on.

                                                                                                 A9
   Table A5 reports results from our replication of the first three columns of Table 1 in AG. The
columns of the two tables are directly comparable, and both rely on AG’s definition of the brand
dummy variables. Models with AG’s brand-state dummies (AG’s column (4)) do not converge.

  Table A10 shows results provided to us by AG regarding the placebo test. It al-
so compares the implied WTP for actual plan financial attributes from AG’s 2011
article, our replication of them, their new results and our replication of them. The
results on the financial attributes show that their new results diverge from their
old ones by at least $90 for 4 of the 5 attributes. In contrast, all of ours are within
$65. The lower half of the Table reports the results from their placebo attributes
and our replication of their placebo model. For several reasons these results are
not directly comparable to the results we report, yet they yield similar qualitative
insights: first, they replaced our count variables for each alphanumeric with indi-
cator variables for any positive count of the alphanumeric. Although this makes it
impossible to isolate the marginal effects comparable to the financial attributes, to
facilitate comparison we replicate their approach here. Second, they stated that
they normalized these placebo attributes to zero, relative to whether a “9” is pre-
sent, but they did not implement any similar normalization for the financial attrib-
utes. Third, two separate values are reported for the presence of “k”, and no val-
ues are reported for the presence of an “e”. Nonetheless, as with our results the
test implies that these imaginary attributes influence people’s PDP choices in
economically meaningful ways. For example, AG’s results imply that people
would be willing to pay $117 more for a plan with a “d”, “o” and “l” in the en-
crypted plan ID than for a plan with three “9s”, whereas they would pay $124 for
a plan with three “9s” to avoid a plan with an “8”, “D” and “x”. Both of these, as
well as a number of other combinations, exceed the magnitude estimated for of all
of the real plan attributes in AG 2011 other than full gap coverage.

   Table A13 reports summary statistics of the distribution of region-level results,
restricted to the 24 regions with statistically significant positive estimates for the
marginal utility of income. The last row reports the premium-to-OOP ratio that is
predicted from an extended version of AG’s DU model from equation (4) that al-
lows the premium-to-OOP ratio to vary with the number of plans in the choice
set, the number of brands, the number of plans with gap coverage, the number of
plans with zero deductible, the consumer’s age, and an indicator for whether the
consumer is diagnosed with dementia including Alzheimer’s disease. Coefficient
estimates are reported in Table A16.

 FIGURE A3—RATIO OF PREMIUM-TO-OOP COEFFICIENTS IN 2006, BY CMS REGION USING AG’S
               DEFINITION OF BRAND DUMMIES BASED ON CONTRACT ID

Note: The figure reports the premium-to-OOP coefficient ratio obtained by estimating region-specific models with contract
id dummies. The econometric specification is the same as the national model in column 2 of Table 4. In regions with light-
shaded numbers, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the marginal utility of income is negative at the 5% level. All es-
timates are statistically indistinguishable from 1 at the 5% level.




                                                                                                                       A23
    Table A15 provides the coefficients and standard errors from meta-regressions
of the conditional relationship between the premium-to-OOP ratio and proxy
measures for menu complexity and cognitive ability. The models are limited to
the 24 regions with statistically significant positive estimates for the marginal util-
ity of income. The main text provides additional details.

    To check robustness of the results from the meta-regression in equation (9) we
estimate AG’s DU model (4) after adding interactions between the OOP ratio and
the proxy measures for menu complexity and cognitive ability. This logit model
accounts for variation in menu complexity across CMS regions and for variation
in cognitive ability within and across CMS regions. Each of the interaction coeffi-
cients is statistically significant at the 1% level. To evaluate their economic mag-
nitudes we use the estimates to predict how the premium-to-oop ratio would
change as we move from the lowest value of each variable observed in our data to
the highest value, while evaluating all other variables at their means. The resulting
ranges are reported in the last two columns of Table A16. For example, the results
in the first row of the table imply that increasing the number of plans in a con-
sumer’s choice set from 38 plans to 52 plans would decrease the premium-to-oop
ratio from 4.6 to 2.9, contrary to the hypothesis of choice overload.

    Table A17 provides results from validation tests for the cases where the set of
brands in an estimation region spans the set of brands in the prediction region.
Two pairs of regions meet this criterion in 2006. As a result, we estimate the
AG’s two competing models for region 14 and then use the resulting coefficients




                                                                                                                 A25
to predict outcomes in region 15, and we use estimates for region 30 to predict
outcomes in region 28. Both region pairs are similar in their consumer popula-
tions and PDP menu complexity. AG’s EUM model yields closer out-of-sample
predictions than their DU model in every case but one. The shading indicates
which prediction is closer to the data.

Note: RMSE refers to the root mean square error between the regional-level model predictions and data, weighted across
regions by the number of people in the sample in the region. The results are based on every possible pairwise combination
of regions in 2006 except that they exclude regions 33 and 34 (HI and AK), and the lower half also excludes region 26
(NM). Thus the values in the top half are based on the results from all 992 of the possible regional out-of-sample predic-
tions while those in the lower half are based on 930 of them.

  Table A19 provides results from the national validation test suggested to us by
Abaluck and Gruber. Specifically, we estimate the models using the 2006 data
from 31 regions and use it to predict a single out-of-sample region, repeated using
each of the 32 regions as the holdout region (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). This
is very similar to an in-sample validation test as the set of plans and plan attrib-
utes in the single out-of-sample region is typically very close to being nested
within the in-sample set (see Keane and Wolpin 2007). As before the measures of
market concentration are defined at the region level as that is the policy-relevant
market definition. Hence while the models with brand indicators match the market
concentration perfectly across the 31 in-sample regions in each of the 32 separate
tests (yielding a mean absolute deviation of 0), they do not perfectly predict the
region-level market concentration for any single given in-region sample.
