                                           ABSTRACT

Differences in house price and income growth rates between 1950 and 2000 across metropolitan
areas have led to an ever-widening gap in housing values and incomes between the typical and
highest-priced locations. We show that the growing spatial skewness in house prices and incomes
are related and can be explained, at least in part, by inelastic supply of land in some attractive
locations combined with an increasing number of high-income households nationally. Scarce land
leads to a bidding-up of land prices and a sorting of high-income families relatively more into those
desirable, unique, low housing construction markets, which we label “superstar cities.” Continued
growth in the number of high-income families in the U.S. provides support for ever-larger
differences in house prices across inelastically supplied locations and income-based spatial sorting.
Our empirical work confirms a number of equilibrium relationships implied by the superstar cities
framework and shows that it occurs both at the metropolitan area level and at the sub-MSA level,
controlling for MSA characteristics.

        Over the last 50 years, the number of families in U.S. metropolitan areas doubled, with

the number making more than $140,000 in real ($2000) terms increasing more than eight-fold

according to the U.S. Census. Gains in income growth have been concentrated in those high-

income families. Piketty and Saez (2004) estimate that the fraction of income attributable to the

top one percent of U.S. households rose from 11.4 percent in 1950 to 16.9 percent in 2000.

       Concurrently, two other patterns arose. First, there has been a large dispersion in real

house price appreciation rates across metropolitan areas and towns, with some appreciating at

very high rates. For example, real house price growth in the San Francisco primary metropolitan

statistical area (PMSA) averaged about 3.5 percent per year between 1950 and 2000, more than 2

percentage points higher than the national average. These differences in long-run rates of

appreciation led to an ever-widening gap in the price of housing between the most expensive

metropolitan areas or communities and the average ones. Indeed, the gap in prices between the

most expensive metropolitan area (San Francisco) and the average across all areas doubled

between 1970 and 2000. San Francisco in 2000 had an average house price of almost $550,000,

more than three times higher than the average. Second, real income growth rates between 1950

and 2000 and changes in the income distribution also varied widely across locations. For

example, in the San Francisco PMSA the share of families earning over $110,000 (in constant

2000 dollars) grew by 21 percentage points between 1970 and 2000 versus 9 percentage points

across all metropolitan areas.

       In this paper, we provide evidence that these patterns of spatial dispersion in house price

and income growth are related: they are the inevitable result of increasing scarcity of land in

certain metropolitan areas and towns, combined with a growing number of high income families

nationally. In places that are desirable but have low rates of new housing construction, families




                                                                                                     1
with high incomes or strong preferences for that location outbid lower willingness-to-pay

families for scarce housing, driving up the price of the underlying land. As the number of high

income families grows nationally, existing residents are outbid by even higher-income families,

raising the price of land yet further. By contrast, in municipalities where construction is easier,

any family who wishes to live there – rich or poor – can buy in at the cost of constructing a new

house and, instead of growth in house prices, the area exhibits growth in the quantity of houses.

Land prices act as a clearing mechanism, so lower-income households are disproportionately

excluded from cities that have limited supply, leaving behind concentrations of higher-income

households. In this sense, living in a superstar city is like owning a scarce luxury good.

       Over time, the gap in house prices between cities can keep increasing. Even if each

family individually is willing to pay only a fixed premium for a location, when the absolute

number of rich families in the country increases and their incomes rise, there are more families

who will pay a higher premium for the same perceived difference between cities. Thus, a

changing composition of residents in supply-constrained cities toward higher income families

supports the growth in land prices.

       This process can continue as long as the growth in the income-weighted demand for a

location exceeds the addition in supply, either in the original location or in a close substitute.

Indeed, the inelastically supplied city need not be more desirable on average than any other city,

nor do workers in the city need to enjoy increased productivity by moving there. As long as the

city appeals to a large enough clientele of families, a growing price gap and a shifting of the

local income distribution to the right will occur. We label metropolitan areas and towns where

demand exceeds supply and supply growth is limited, “superstars.” These superstar cities and

towns are ones in which residents are willing to pay a premium to live and into which high-




                                                                                                      2
income superstar-earners disproportionately sort. These markets do not allow for increasing

density through construction, cannot infinitely expand their borders, and have few close

substitute locations. Our results emphasize that even seemingly generic MSAs, for some portion

of the population, are not perfectly substitutable.

        This correlated skewness in house prices and the income distribution is a modern

development at least at the metropolitan area level, because even the densest coastal markets had

plenty of land available for development throughout much of the twentieth century. Once these

MSAs “filled up”, in the sense that adding units to the housing stock became difficult, both

because of geographical limitations and local restrictions on increases in density, growth in

house prices accelerated.

        We begin the analysis by documenting the long-run trends in house price and income

growth and the spatial skewness that has arisen since 1950. Next, we outline a simple two

location model that shows how inelastic land supply can link these stylized patterns. This model

is similar in spirit to Epple and Platt (1998), but allows for differences in the elasticity of supply

across locations, and generates a set of empirically testable predictions. Systematic patterns in

the data are consistent with the equilibrium predictions of this superstar cities model.

        First, the income-sorting predictions of the model are borne out in the data. Income

distributions in superstar cities are skewed to the right, and skew relatively more when the

national number of high-income families rises. Recent movers into superstar cities tend to be

higher-income, on average, than recent movers into other cities, and recent movers out of

superstar cities are drawn disproportionately from the bottom tail of the city’s income

distribution.




                                                                                                         3
       Second, not only do superstar cities enjoy higher long-run house price growth, but prices

in those markets are a higher multiple of current rents, suggesting that homebuyers there

anticipate more rapid long-run rent and price growth. In addition, when the total number of

high-income families living in the U.S. grows more rapidly, the gap in house prices between

superstar cities and other housing markets widens the most.

       These patterns are repeated when we compare superstar towns to other towns within their

metropolitan areas. “Superstar suburbs” typically have more high-income households and fewer

poor ones, and experience a greater rightward shift in their income distributions and more rapid

growth in their house prices when the number of high-income households in their MSAs rises.

They, too, have higher price-to-rent ratios. That we find similar evidence of ‘superstar suburbs’

is an important differentiator from models of urban agglomerations because labor productivity is

unlikely to vary geographically based on where workers live within a given labor market area.

       Consistent with the model’s predictions, once an elastically supplied city or town “fills

up” and future supply growth becomes limited, price-to-rent ratios increase, and income sorting

and house price dispersion accelerates. A number of jurisdictions in our sample undergo this

transition into superstar status. For example, Los Angeles and San Francisco are the first major

metropolitan areas to become supply-limited, and that happened between 1960 and 1980. The

areas around Boston and New York followed between 1970 and 1990.

       The implications of the superstar cities framework are fundamentally different from those

of existing urban models. For example, standard compensating differential models attribute

differences in prices across markets to variation in amenities and other local traits. [Roback

(1982), Blomquist et al (1988), Gyourko and Tracy (1991)] By contrast, the superstar cities

view implies that limited land supply results in a rightward shift in the income distribution and




                                                                                                    4
rising land prices that are neither due to changes in the innate attractiveness of living there nor in

local productivity, but follow from an increasing number of high willingness-to-pay families in

the population. Second, the superstar cities intuition reverses the causality of typical

agglomeration models in which moving to a location enhances a worker’s productivity. [Glaeser

et al (1992, 1995), Henderson et al (1995), Rauch (1993), Moretti (2004a,b,c), Rosenthal and

Strange (2001, 2003)] Instead, high human capital (high income) workers concentrate in

superstar cities because they can outbid less productive workers. We do not claim that

alternative explanations involving the potential impacts of human capital spillovers, production

agglomeration effects, or preference externalities on housing markets are not valid, but we do

show empirically that they cannot completely account for the patterns observed in the data.


1.         Skewness and dispersion in house prices, incomes, and their long-run growth rates

           We begin by detailing the remarkable dispersion – and even skewness – across MSAs in

house price and income growth over the 1950 to 2000 period. Figure 1A plots the kernel density

of average annual real house price growth between 1950 and 2000 for the 280 metropolitan areas

with populations over 50,000 in 1950.1 The tail of growth rates above 2.6 percent is especially

thick and the distribution is right-skewed. Table 1, which lists the average real annual house

price growth rate between 1950 and 2000 for the ten fastest and ten slowest appreciating

metropolitan areas out of the 50 MSAs with populations of at least 500,000 in 1950, documents

that the dispersion seen in this figure is not an artifact of a few areas that were small initially and

then experienced abnormally rapid price growth.

           These annual differences compound to very large price gaps over time even within the

top few markets. For example, San Francisco’s 3.5 percent annual house price appreciation

    The Census data that underlies these calculations is described in Section 3.


                                                                                                      5
implies a 458 percent increase in real house prices between 1950 and 2000, more than twice as

large as seventh-ranked Boston at 212 percent, which itself still grew 50 percent more than the

sample average of 132 percent for the 50 most populous metropolitan areas.2 Figure 2A, which

plots a kernel density estimate of the 280 metropolitan area average house values in 1950 and

2000, shows that skewness has increased over the last 50 years, with a relative handful of

markets ending up commanding enormous price premiums. Figure 2B normalizes the means and

standard deviations of the 1950 and 2000 house value distributions so they are equal and plots

them against each other. In 2000, the right tail of the MSA house value distribution extends to

four times the mean, more than twice the highest MSA from the right tail of the 1950 Census.

The left tail ends at about half the mean in both years, although it is slightly more skewed in the

2000 Census.

         There is also long-run persistence in the markets which exhibit above-average price

growth. Across the two 30-year periods from 1940-1970 and 1970-2000, average annual

percentage house price growth has a positive correlation of about 0.3. Moreover, of the MSAs in

the top quartile of annual house price growth between 1940 and 1970, half were still in the top

quartile and nearly two-thirds remained ranked in the top half between 1970 and 2000.3

         Income growth rates, as well, demonstrate wide dispersion across MSAs over the long-

run. Figure 1B plots the kernel density of average annual real income growth over the 1950 to

2000 period. Growth rates range from 0.8 percent per year to 3.1 percent, and the distribution

also evinces some right-skew.



2
  It is worth emphasizing that the extremely high appreciation seen in the Bay Area, southern California, and Seattle
markets is not restricted to the past couple of decades. The top five markets in terms of annual real appreciation
rates between 1950-1980 are as follows: (1) San Francisco, 3.65 percent; (2) San Diego, 3.49 percent; (3) Los
Angeles, 3.20 percent; (4) Oakland, 2.99 percent; and (5) Seattle, 2.88 percent.

  Over short horizons, such as a decade, MSAs can experience large price swings. The correlation in house price
growth rates across contiguous decades often is significantly negative.


                                                                                                                    6
2.      Superstar Cities

        We turn to a simple model to show that the stylized facts in the previous section may be

linked through the elasticity of supply of land. In our model, households vary by their incomes

and tastes for two locations which differ by whether they have available land. Epple and Platt

(1998, henceforth known as EP) present a more formal and extensive treatment of a similar

model, but assume that land supply is perfectly inelastic in all jurisdictions. By limiting the

model to two cities and allowing for elastic supply in one, we emphasize the testable empirical

implications of differences in the elasticity of supply. In addition, our results do not depend

upon the reasons for location preferences or inelasticity of supply, so we neither attempt to

discern why some families prefer certain cities nor address the causes of limited supply.

        A. A Simple Model of Superstar Cities

        There are two cities: a red city (R) and a green city (G). The red city does not allow new

development and has a fixed size of K units of housing. The green city has a perfectly elastic

supply of new housing units.4

        There are N workers in the economy, with a continuum of worker skills. Wages are

increasing in skill, but are independent of a worker’s location, so worker productivity is

unrelated to the number or concentration of high-skilled workers in R or G. Define n(W) as the
                                                            ∞
distribution of workers who earn wage W. Thus               ∫
                                                           w= 0
                                                                  n(W )dW = N .




4
 While we realize that land is not perfectly elastically supplied anywhere, the ease with which builders construct
new units clearly differs across the country, as shown by Gyourko and Glaeser (2003), Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks
(2005b), and Saks (2005).


                                                                                                                     7
        Each worker has an intensity of preference, c, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, to

live in the red versus green city.5 The higher is c, the more that a worker prefers to live in G.

The preference to live in R or G is independent of income.

        Workers choose two items in their consumption bundle: a city to live in (R or G), and a

quantity of the composite good, A. The price of A is normalized to 1. The rental cost of

agricultural land is l. By assumption, land is perfectly elastically supplied in G so that residents

can always acquire an additional lot at rent l in the green city. If more than K households prefer

the red city, residents of R must pay a per-period rent r+l with the rent premium r>0 determined

based on bidding as described below.

        We assume that a worker gets utility from consumption of A, as follows:

                          UR ≡ (1-c)f(A) and A=w-r                     if worker resides in city R
        U=
                          UG ≡ cf(A) and A=w                           if worker resides in city G.

For simplicity, we normalize w= W-l. This specification assumes that a worker obtains higher

utility from consumption when its preference for its current location is stronger. However, all of

our results presented below still hold if consumption benefits from location and all other goods

were separable.

        B. Solution:

        A worker will choose to live in R and pay rent premium r if and only if UR > UG, or

(1−c)f(w−r) > cf(w). If N/2<=K, r=0 since the red city still has open land and residents sort into

R and G solely based on whether c is less than or greater than 1/2. We will restrict our attention

to the case of N/2>K, so that the expected rent premium in the red city will be strictly positive.

5
  Reasonable alternatives to a uniform distribution of tastes exacerbate the income sorting predictions. Suppose the
Red city is preferred to the Green city by all workers. Then, only high-wage workers end-up in R because they are
the only workers that can afford to live there. Of course, as Epple and Platt (1998) point out, a single preference
model cannot literally be true, otherwise we would observe pure income sorting. Intermediate cases in which higher
income workers have a moderate preference for R versus G would not change our qualitative predictions.


                                                                                                                  8
        The market-clearing rent premium, r*, equates the number of workers desiring to live in R

with the number of lots available by solving:

                                        ∞

                                         ∫c       ( w)n( w)dw ≤ K .
                                              *
(0.1)
                                        w=0


The function c*(w) is the maximum c such that a worker with wage w will choose to live in R and

pay rent premium r*. When w ≤ r*, then c*(w) = 0; that is, workers cannot afford to live in R

unless their wage is greater than the rent required to live in R. When w > r*, c*(w) represents the

preference of a worker of a given wage who is just indifferent between living in R or G. So

workers with wage w and preference c< c*(w) will choose to live in R.

        C. Simulation Results:

        To demonstrate the effect of inelastic supply of land on land prices and income sorting,

we perform a simple simulation. The simulated economy has 100,000 workers, but only 30,000

spaces in city R, and a truncated normal wage distribution with discrete $1,000 increments, a

mean wage of $40,000, a standard deviation of $40,000, the lowest wage truncated at 0, and the

highest wage truncated at $150,000. As above, wages are defined as compensation earned in

excess of the agricultural rent, l. The location preference c is uniformly distributed between 0

and 1, and f(A)=A. Solving for the market-clearing rent premium yields r*= $19,257, or almost

40 percent of the average wage.6

Prediction 1: Rents, the average wage, and the share of high income workers are higher in R

than in G.

Explanation for Prediction 1:




6
  The average wage in the economy is actually $51,246 given that the lower truncation wage of $0 removes more of
the low wage workers relative to the upper truncation wage of $150,000.


                                                                                                               9
         Figure 3 graphs the wage distributions in the red and green cities, with the number of

residents in G equal to the difference between the two solid lines. A disproportionate share of

higher income workers, and no one at all earning below $19,257, lives in the red city.

         This result is purely due to the scarcity of locations in R. At zero rent premium, any

worker with c<0.5 would prefer to live in the red city. Since more workers prefer R than there

are spots, the clearing rent premium is strictly positive, and each worker trades off its intensity of

preference for the red city with the rent premium. For example, any worker with income less

than r* is better off in the free green city, no matter what its value of c. A low-wage worker with

w just above r* will choose R only if c is close to zero, and a high-income worker with w well

above r* will choose R as long as c is at least slightly below 0.5. Thus the income distribution in

R is skewed to the right.7

         Note that this sorting occurs even though a given worker is equally productive in R and G

and worker preferences are independent of income.8 Indeed, with a uniform distribution of c,

more than half of the high wage workers live in the green city. This is because half of the

workers actually prefer the green city and those on the cusp choose to live in the green city

versus paying a rent premium r* to live in the red city. High-income residents comprise a

smaller share of the green city since it is larger than R, with well more than half of the low-

income workers living there.

Prediction 2: Population growth leads to a higher rent premium, higher prices, and more skewed

wages in R relative to G.

7
  Epple and Platt (1998) obtain a similar partial sorting by income. In EP, sorting arises because families have
preferences over a bundle of public goods and tax rates which are provided in different amounts across inelastically
supplied locations. In our illustrative model, we allow for differences in the elasticity of land supply but do not
specify why a household might prefer one location over another.
8
  Because we do not incorporate peer effects or increasing returns to skill, [Moretti (2004b,c)] there is no
countervailing pecuniary incentive for high wage workers with a preference for G to live in R anyway. Given that
the density of high wage workers is higher in R but the absolute number of high wage workers is higher in G, it is
unclear where such effects would be greater.


                                                                                                                  10
Explanation for Prediction 2:

        Suppose that population doubles from 100,000 to 200,000 but the number of spots in R is

unchanged. The equilibrium rent premium increases from $19,257 to $41,263 as the number of

households with c<0.5 doubles.9 Figure 4 illustrates that the wage distribution in the red city

also shifts to the right. Thus, population growth leads to an even more skewed distribution of

wages for workers living in R relative to G. Some families who previously had a strong

preference to live in R will no longer have the income necessary to cover the r*, and others will

no longer prefer it at the higher rent. Families with the lowest incomes are disproportionately

priced out of R as the national population grows.

        Assuming house prices equal the present discounted value of rents, markets with higher

rent levels will also have higher house prices. Rent and price premiums are due to the

underlying scarcity of land, not the cost of housing structures, which is similar across markets.10

        Prediction 3: A thicker right tail in the aggregate wage distribution leads to higher rents

and wages in R relative to G.

Explanation for Prediction 3:

        Even without population growth, an increase in income inequality raises the average

income and thus the willingness-to-pay of the marginal worker who prefers R. Thus the rent

premium rises in R, but less so than in the case of population growth because the number of

families who prefer R does not increase. Higher rent, in turn, displaces relatively more low-wage

workers in favor of high wage workers. This process is illustrated in Figure 5, where the

standard deviation of the truncated wage distribution is raised to $80,000.


9
  The specific percentage change in rent is dependent on the parameter values. Eventually the cutoff rent must grow
more slowly than the population because the upper support of the truncated normal distribution does not change.
10
   Gyourko and Saiz (forthcoming) show that the cost of construction has been declining in real terms, while real
house prices have risen almost everywhere in the U.S.


                                                                                                                11
Prediction 4: When aggregate population growth and/or a spreading to the right of the overall

income distribution is anticipated, R will have a higher price/rent ratio than G.

Explanation for Prediction 4:

          The comparative statics in predictions 2 and 3 demonstrate that population growth or a

right-skewing of the income distribution lead to higher rents in R (r*>0). This prediction

assumes that expected long-run risk-adjusted returns to investing in housing in the two cities are

equated by the market, where rent is analogous to the dividend paid by a house. If workers

anticipate that rents in R will grow faster than agricultural rents, they will bid up house prices so

that the overall return for a house in R is equal to the return on a house in G. If R has a faster

growth rate of rents than G, that market will also have the same faster stationary growth rate in

prices.

          Priced fairly, a house in R earns a lower current yield (lower rent/price ratio), but a higher

future capital gain due to the faster rent and price growth than in G. Thus, when the number of

high-income families is growing, the price/rent ratio should be higher in R than G. In fact, house

price levels are higher in R for two reasons: both land rents and the price-to-rent ratio are higher

in R than in G.

Prediction 5: An unexpected increase in the relative growth rate of rents in R implies a higher

steady state growth rate in prices in R and an increase in the price-to-rent ratio.

Explanation for Prediction 5:

          With stationary growth in rents, the price/rent ratios will be fixed. If there is an

unanticipated shock to the growth rate of rents, the price/rent ratio and the growth rate of prices

can deviate from its steady-state trend. If a city runs out of developable land, thereby

transitioning from a city like G to a superstar city like R, the growth rate of rents (and prices) will




                                                                                                     12
rise accordingly. In the short-term, house prices will grow more quickly than rents as the

price/rent ratio rises to reflect the new higher growth rate of rents. Owners in the newly-created

superstar city will earn a one-time capital gain.



3.       Data description

         We use data from the U.S. decennial census, aggregated to three different levels: the

metropolitan area, which corresponds to the local labor market, the Census-designated place,

which is a political entity such as a city or town, and the household. At the metro area and the

census-designated place levels we obtain information on the distribution of house values, family

incomes, population, and the number of housing units.11 For the analysis across metropolitan

areas, we use a sample of 280 such areas that had populations of at least 50,000 in 1950 and are

in the continental United States.12




11
   Census house price data are imperfect in that they are self-reported and not quality adjusted. We use them
because the length of the panel available allows us to observe the evolution of superstar markets over time. While
correlations between constant quality and unadjusted series can be weak at annual frequencies, the correlation over
the decadal periods, which are the unit of analysis here, is quite high. For example, from 1980-1990 and 1990-2000,
the sole time periods for which both Census and constant quality data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight are available, the correlation in appreciation rates for a set of consistently defined MSAs is 0.94 in the
1980s and 0.87 in the 1990s.
12
   Thirty-six areas with populations under 50,000 in 1950 were excluded from our analysis because of concerns
about abnormal house quality changes in markets with so few units at the start of our period of analysis. Those
MSAs are: Auburn-Opelika, Barnstable, Bismarck, Boulder, Brazoria, Bryan, Casper, Cheyenne, Columbia,
Corvallis, Dover, Flagstaff, Fort Collins, Fort Myers, Fort Pierce, Fort Walton Beach, Grand Junction, Iowa City,
Jacksonville, Las Cruces, Lawrence, Melbourne, Missoula, Naples, Ocala, Olympia, Panama City, Pocatello, Punta
Gorda, Rapid City, Redding, Rochester, Santa Fe, Victoria, Yolo, and Yuma. That said, none of our key results are
materially affected by this paring of the sample. Similar concerns account for our not using data from the first
Census of Housing in 1940 in the regression results reported below. (All individual housing trait data from the 1940
census were lost, so we cannot track any trait changes over time from that year.) However, we did repeat our MSA-
level analysis over the 1940-2000 time period. While the point estimates naturally differ from those reported below,
the magnitudes, signs, and statistical significance are essentially unchanged. Finally, the New York PMSA is
missing crucial house price data for 1960, and is excluded from the analysis reported below. The census did not
report house value data for that year because it did not believe it could accurately assess value for cooperative units,
the preponderant unit type in Manhattan at that time.


                                                                                                                     13
         Since the definitions of metro areas change over time, we use one based on 1990 county

boundaries to project consistent metro area boundaries forward and backward through time.13

Data were collected at the county level and aggregated to the metropolitan statistical area (MSA)

or primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) level in the case of consolidated metropolitan

statistical areas.14 Data for the 1970-2000 period are obtained from GeoLytics, which compiles

long-form data from the decennial Censuses of Housing and Population. We hand-collected

1950 and 1960 data from hard copy volumes of the Census of Population and Housing. Both

sources are based on 100 percent population counts. For the analysis within MSAs, we extract

place-level data for 1970-2000 from the GeoLytics CD-ROMs.15 All dollar values are converted

into constant 2000 dollars.

         Household-level data comes from the Integrated Public Use Micro Samples (IPUMs),

which provide a set of matched variables using common definitions across decades. We use

family income and the MSA of residence five years prior in an analysis of recent movers

reported below. If the resident lived in a different MSA than the current one five years ago, that

individual is an in-migrant to the current MSA and an out-migrant from the host MSA five years

previously. We restrict the household sample to 1980 and 1990 because the ‘MSA-five-years-

ago’ variable did not exist prior to 1980 (except for a few MSAs in 1940), and in 2000 the

number of MSAs identified in the IPUMs was drastically reduced.




13
   We use definitions provided by the Office of Management and Budget, available at
http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/90mfips.txt.
14
   All our conclusions are robust to aggregating to the CMSA level for those few areas with that designation.
15
   While states differ in the extent to which local jurisdictions control new construction or even whether they can
change their boundaries, census-designated places provide a useful comparable sample. The 1970 data include only
6,963 out of 20,768 places. (Conversations with the Census Bureau suggest that the micro data on the remaining
places has been lost or is not readily available.) Fortunately, these places account for more than 95 percent of U.S.
population in 1970. In 2000, 161 million people lived in these 6,963 places, 206 million people in all places, and
281 million people in the entire U.S. We further limit the sample to places within a MSA.


                                                                                                                  14
       In each data set, we divide the distribution of real family incomes into five categories that

are consistent over time. The income categories in the original Census data change in each

decade. We set the category boundaries equal to 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the 1980 family

income topcode, and populate the resulting five bins using a weighted average of the actual

categories in $2000, assuming a uniform distribution of families within the bins. Since 1980 had

amongst the lowest topcode in real terms, using it as an upper bound reduces miscategorization

of families into income bins. We call a family “poor” if its income is less than $39,179 in $2000.

“Middle-poor” are those families with incomes between $39,179 and $78,358, “middle” income

families have incomes between $78,359 and $117,537, “middle-rich” families lie between

$117,538 and $156,716, and “rich” families have incomes in excess of the 1980 real topcode of

$156,716.



4.     A case study of San Francisco and Las Vegas

       A case study of two cities illustrates how the superstar city dynamic plays out in practice.

Over the last 50 years the U.S. has experienced growth in the absolute number, population share,

and income share of high-income households. [Autor et al (2006), Piketty and Saez (2003), Saez

(2004)] The left panel of Figure 6 shows that the aggregate distribution of family income across

all MSAs in the U.S. has been shifting to the right in real dollars as the right tail of the income

distribution has grown much faster than the mean. The right panel of Figure 6 displays the

evolution of the number of families, rather than the share, in each of the income bins. Most of

the growth in the number of families was among those earning more than the $78,358 median

value for our sample.




                                                                                                      15
       These changes in the national high-income share were accompanied by very disparate

patterns at the metropolitan area level. San Francisco, a canonical superstar city, experienced

low levels of new construction and high house price growth. Between 1950 and 1960, the San

Francisco primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) expanded its population by about 48,000

families. Over the subsequent four decades, San Francisco grew by only 44,000 families, with

two-thirds of that growth taking place between 1960 and 1970. Real house prices (in constant

$2000 dollars) spiked in San Francisco after 1970, growing between 3 and 4 percent per year

between 1970 and 1990, about 1.5 percentage points above the average across all MSAs, and 1.4

percent per year between 1990 and 2000, almost one percentage point above the all-MSA

average.

       By contrast, over the same time period, Las Vegas was a canonical high-demand,

elastically supplied non-superstar city. Las Vegas saw explosive population growth, growing

from fewer than 50,000 families in 1960 to the size of San Francisco by 2000. Yet it

experienced modest real house price growth that was well below the national average.

       Consistent with the income distribution predictions of the superstar cities model, as the

number of high-income families in the country increased, San Francisco’s share high-income

grew disproportionately. San Francisco (Figure 7), which always had relatively more rich

families and fewer poor families than Las Vegas (Figure 8), became even more skewed toward

high income families between 1960 and 2000. Since the number of families in the San Francisco

MSA did not grow by much, the MSA actually experienced an increase in the number of rich

families and a reduction in the number of lower income ones. In fact, only the richest groups,

with incomes of $78,358 and above, increased their share of the number of families in the San

Francisco MSA.




                                                                                                   16
         By contrast, the overall income distribution in Las Vegas did not keep up with the nation

(left panel of Figure 8), leaving Las Vegas progressively more poor relative to both San

Francisco and the U.S. metropolitan area aggregate. The large numbers of new families in Las

Vegas were both rich and poor, leading to pro rata growth in the number of families across Las

Vegas’ income distribution. Relative to the national income distribution, which shifted right, the

growth in Las Vegas was skewed towards poorer families.

         In the remainder of this paper, we show empirically that these patterns and the

equilibrium predictions of the model generalize to all MSAs and towns.



5.       How do we determine if a city is a superstar?

         Following the model in Section 2, superstars must be in high demand, relative to supply,

with demand manifested more in price growth than in housing unit growth because of binding

restrictions on the development of new sites. We neither observe the true state of demand nor

the elasticity of supply, so we define a superstar city using housing market outcomes. Growth in

mean real prices and housing units at the MSA level is measured over 20-year periods. This

window size gives us growth rates defined over four time periods: 1950-70, 1960-80, 1970-90,

and 1980-2000. We match each growth rate to the characteristics of the market at the end of the

window so, for example, the 1950-70 growth rates are matched to 1970 data.16

         A MSA is categorized as a superstar if it exhibits high demand, defined as whether its

sum of price and quantity growth over the prior two decades is above the sample median, and it



16
  We chose this algorithm because the model suggests that the predicted income segregation and house price effects
occur after the superstar market has ‘filled up’. The use of lagged data helps guard against us misclassifying an area
as a superstar too early. Also, we wish to classify superstar status of metro areas in the most recent census year,
2000. That said, this choice is not critical to our results. For example, we could match 1950-1970 growth rates to
metro areas as of 1960. That methodology generates superstar classifications from 1960-1990, rather than from
1970-2000. Our findings are robust to such changes.


                                                                                                                   17
has a low elasticity of supply, indicated by a high ratio of price growth to quantity growth. We

allow the high-demand cutoff to vary over time to account for changes in the aggregate

economy. By contrast, the cutoff for having a low elasticity of supply should not vary over time

since aggregate changes in demand should not affect the ratio of price growth to unit growth.

Hence, we use the 90th percentile of the distribution of price growth to quantity growth for all

metropolitan areas over the entire period, which is about 1.7.

       Superstar markets as of 2000, determined using 1980-2000 growth rates, lay in the region

marked A in Figure 9, which plots average real annual house price growth between 1980 and

2000 against housing unit growth. Thus high-demand cities are far from the origin and

inelastically supplied markets are close to the y-axis. Region A is both above the downward-

sloping boundary determining high growth status and above the leftmost upwards-sloping line

marking significant inelasticity of supply. The cities in A include many coastal markets such as

San Francisco, New York, and Boston.

       A metro area has a high elasticity of supply if it builds sufficient new housing to satisfy

demand so that real price growth is low and housing unit production is relatively high, placing it

close to the x-axis in Figure 9. We label these cities with high demand but with a ratio of price

growth to quantity growth being less than 1/1.7 (about 0.59) as ‘Non-superstars’. Non-superstars

are in the C range, below the less-steeply upwards-sloped line and above the downward-sloped

demand cutoff. They include markets such as Las Vegas and Phoenix. The remaining high

demand markets, in-between the superstars and non-superstars, lay in the B range. They have

experienced relatively high demand, and have built at least a modest amount of new units and

experienced a moderate amount of real house price appreciation. The final category consists of




                                                                                                   18
metropolitan areas that are in low demand, defined as the sum of price and quantity growth

below the sample median, and lies in the D region below the negatively-sloped line.17

        We chose to use a discrete method of identifying superstar cities to ease the interpretation

of the empirical results. As will be discussed in the results section, our findings are not affected

by this decision.

        At the Census place level, we use a parallel methodology to determine which places are

superstars. A place is considered to be high-demand if its sum of price and housing unit growth

exceeds that period’s median across all places in all MSAs. It is a superstar place if it is both

high-demand and inelastically supplied, defined as the ratio of price growth to unit growth

exceeding the 75th percentile, or 4.06. Some places experience high price growth but declines in

the number of housing units. To keep the ratio greater than zero, in such places we set the ratio

equal to the sample maximum ratio. Similarly, non-superstar places have high demand and

elastic supply, with a ratio below the inverse of the 75th percentile. If housing unit growth is

positive but prices have fallen, we set the ratio of price growth to unit growth equal to the lowest

positive sample value. Since place data is available only for 1970 to 2000, we assign superstar

or non-superstar categories to places in 1990 and 2000.

        In the face of geographic constraints and politically-imposed restrictions on development,

it seems natural that high-demand metropolitan areas could become more inelastically supplied

over time as they grow and begin to “fill up”. This process would appear as a market moving

over time from area C to B to A. Comparing Figures 9 and 10, we observe such an evolution. In

1980, only San Francisco and Los Angeles clearly qualified as superstars, as can be seen in



17
  We do not distinguish between low-demand areas on the basis of inelasticity of supply. As Glaeser and Gyourko
(2005) note, the existence of durable housing makes most cities appear to be inelastically supplied when demand
falls. Thus inelastic supply in a low-demand city does not necessarily reflect constraints on new development.


                                                                                                             19
Figure 10 which plots the price growth-to-unit growth relationship over the 1960-1980 period.18

Between 1980 and 2000, twenty more MSAs filled up, becoming superstars.



6.       Implications of superstar cities: income distributions and house prices

         An important set of predictions of our framework is that a superstar city’s household

income should be skewed to the right of the U.S. income distribution, and should become more

skewed as the right tail of the national income distribution becomes thicker and as the MSA fills

up.

         A. Income distributions across MSAs

         To see if this pattern holds across all MSAs, we estimate the following regression for

MSA i in year t:

 # in Income Bin yit
                        = β 1 (Superstari ) + β 2 ( Non - superstari )
# of Households yit
+ β 3 (Superstarit ) + β 4 ( Non - superstarit ) + γ 1 (Low Demand i ) +γ 1 (Low Demand it ) + δ t + ε it

This regression relates the share of a MSA’s families that are in each income bin to its superstar

status, and controls for total demand. The model implies that superstar cities should have

relatively larger shares of rich or middle-rich families (highest and second-highest income bins,

respectively) and lower shares of those in the lowest income bins.19

         The first column of the top panel of table 2 is based on a pooled cross section of 1,116

MSA × year observations.20 This regression treats superstar status as a (non-exclusive) fixed

MSA characteristic, including indicator variables for whether the MSA ever was a superstar over

the 1970-2000 period, whether it is ever in the non-superstar range, whether the MSA ever

18
   Enid, OK, barely makes it into ‘superstar’ territory in this time period. This appears to be the result of an
extraordinary, but temporary, oil industry-related shock, as this area is not a superstar later.
19
   See Appendix Table 1 for summary statistics on all variables used in these regressions.
20
   This represents 279 MSAs in each census year from 1970-on.


                                                                                                                   20
moved inside the low-demand area, and time dummies. The intermediate, high demand MSAs

from region B are the excluded category in all the metro area regressions.21

         The difference in income distribution between superstars and all other MSAs is

pronounced. MSAs that ever were superstars have a 2.5 percentage point greater share of their

families that are in the rich category relative to the excluded high-demand cities (row 1, column

1). This effect is largest at the high end of the income distribution and declines in magnitude as

incomes fall. For example, as reported in square brackets in row 1, the high income share of

superstar MSAs is about 83 percent more than the 3 percent share rich for the average MSA that

is not a superstar. The share of the next-highest income category is 69 percent greater in

superstars relative to the average of other MSAs, and 34 percent higher in the middle category.

Markets that have ever been superstars also have a nearly 9 percentage point lower share of poor

families (row 1, column 5), almost 21 percent less than the other MSAs.

         Non-superstar cities appear similar to the in-between group (row 2). Those coefficients

are relatively small and do not exhibit a clear pattern. Low-demand MSAs are less high-income

and poorer relative to all of the high demand categories of MSAs, although the magnitudes are

modest (row 3).

         The superstar cities model suggests that superstar cities should become richer and less

poor when they transition into the superstar region. The second panel of Table 2 addresses this

hypothesis by adding time-varying superstar, non-superstar, and low demand indicator variables

to the previous specifications. Prior to becoming superstars, MSAs that eventually will become a


21
  Our qualitative results and statistical significance in this table and those below are robust to changing the cutoffs
between the regions, including continuous measures of the degree of superstardom, or removing from the superstar
(or non-superstar) ranks any city that failed to qualify as such in at least two consecutive periods. For example, we
have tried including the ratio of price growth to quantity growth, the sum of price and quantity growth, and the
interaction of the two, as superstar fundamentals. We have also tried including price growth and quantity growth
separately. These specifications lead to the same conclusions, though they are more difficult to describe concisely.
The results are available from the authors.


                                                                                                                     21
superstar are richer on average, with a 1.3 percentage point greater share rich and a 7.1

percentage point lower share poor (row 1 of panel 2). When these areas are actually in the

superstar region, their share rich goes up by an additional 2.8 percentage points and their share

poor declines by a further 4.1 percentage points (row 4 of panel 2). Thus superstar cities, as a

baseline, have a 43 percent higher share rich, declining monotonically to 17 percent lower share

poor, than other MSAs. After their transition to superstar status, these MSAs have an additional

80 to 90 percent greater share of the top two income groups and an 8 to 10 percent lower share of

the bottom two income categories. As before, this pattern of results is robust to adding a host of

controls for potential unobservables, such as MSA fixed effects, differential time trends for

superstars vs. not, or separate year dummies for superstars/non-superstars/low-demand MSAs.

       The data do not indicate nearly as much income skewing among non-superstars or low

demand MSAs relative to the omitted group. For example, when MSAs transition into being

non-superstars or low demand MSAs, they appear to lose a small share of rich relative to poor,

although not all of these coefficients are statistically different from zero at conventional levels.

       B. Income distributions across places within MSAs

       Next, we turn to analogous regressions for superstar places within MSAs. Examining

changes in house prices and income distributions at the census-designated place level has several

clear advantages over the MSA level. The most important is that by using sub-MSA variation,

we can control for MSA-level factors, such as agglomeration or other production externalities

that affect the common labor market. By including MSA × year fixed effects, we compare

places within an MSA in a given year. Another advantage is that places exhibit much more

variation in changes in the overall income distribution than do MSAs. On the downside, the

place-level data is noisier than the MSA data, and covers a shorter time period.




                                                                                                       22
          When we regress the share of households in an income category on the time-invariant

measure of place superstar status, using the full 1970 to 2000 sample and controlling for MSA ×

year effects, places that were ever a superstar have a higher fraction of their families in the richer

categories and a lower percentage in the poorer categories. The estimates are reported in the first

row of the first panel of Table 3. Superstar places have a 5.2 percentage point higher share rich

than do places in the same MSA and year that are in the in-between omitted category, an increase

of nearly 150 percent from the sample mean. These places have a 28 percent greater share in the

middle-rich category, and anywhere from a 3 to 11 percent lower share in the three poorest

categories. The non-superstar and low-demand places show the opposite pattern, except in the

poorest category, with generally a lower share of high-income, and a higher share of low-

income, families. Both of these patterns are statistically different from zero at conventional

levels.

          In the second panel of Table 3, we add the time-varying superstar variables. Even when

they are not yet superstars, superstar places are relatively more high-income and relatively less

poor. In the years that a place is a superstar, it has an even larger share of its families in the

highest income category. For example, relative to the omitted in-between group, a place that will

eventually be a superstar has a 3.7 percentage point, or more than 80 percent, greater share in the

rich category. When that place is a superstar, the share in the rich category increases by 4.2

percentage points, or 85 percent of the mean. Once again, we observe the reverse pattern for the

non-superstar places. The patterns are somewhat less distinct because we are limited to the small

sample of 7,584 observations over 1990 to 2000, but one can see that the same general pattern

holds at both the MSA and place levels, and using the time-varying or time-invariant definitions




                                                                                                     23
of superstar status. Finally, the bottom panel shows that we obtain similar cross-section results

whether we use the full sample or the smaller 1990-2000 places sample.

           C. What happens to local house prices and the share rich when the aggregate number
              of rich rises?

           Another implication of the superstar cities model is that when the number of rich families

in the country increases, land prices should rise fastest in superstar MSAs since the clearing price

goes up to equilibrate the limited supply of houses with the increased demand. Similarly, the

income distributions in the superstar cities should shift to the right more than in other cities when

there are more rich families at the national level—as long as some of the added rich families

have a preference for the inelastic markets. The superstar cities model also predicts analogous

patterns at the place level, with the number of rich families at the MSA level positively

correlated with the growth of prices and the rich share of the families in the superstar places.

           First, we examine whether house values in superstar MSAs are linked to the number of

rich families at the national level. We regress a proxy for the entry price of a house – the 10th

percentile house value – on the time invariant city status variable (superstar, non superstar, and

low demand) interacted with the national number rich, plus year and MSA fixed effects, for the

1970-2000 sample period, with the results reported in Table 4. Note that the MSA fixed effects

subsume the non-interacted superstar indicator variables and the year dummies subsume the non-

interacted national number rich, so our estimates are identified from MSA × year variation.

           The results in column 1 show that entry level houses in superstar cities are even more

expensive relative to other cities when the U.S. has more rich families. Indeed, when the

national number of rich families is 10 percent higher, the gap in the 10th percentile house value

between the MSAs that are ever superstars and the in-between MSAs is 1.1 percent greater.22


22
     We find similar results using the average house value rather than the 10th percentile.


                                                                                                     24
However, one should note that our true variation is limited since we observe only four changes in

the number of rich families for the metropolitan U.S. as a whole and are merely observing that

something is happening disproportionately to superstar MSAs at those times.

       This is not the case at the place level, where each of the 279 “parent” MSAs has its own

pattern of growth in the number of rich families over four decades. Once again, the 10th

percentile house price for each place is regressed on the interaction of place superstar status and

the number of rich families in the MSA. We include place fixed effects, and MSA × year effects

to control for MSA-level dynamics. We use all four census years and the time-invariant

definition of superstar places.

       The places results in column 2 of Table 4 show that the entry house price is 0.98 percent

higher in superstar places relative to the in-between places in the same MSA in the years when

an MSA’s number rich is 10 percent greater. The in-between places have 10th percentile prices

that are 1.81 percent higher relative to the non-superstar places when the MSAs’ number rich is

10 percent higher. We obtain very similar results when we restrict the sample to those places

that appear in our data in all four decades (column 3) and when we exclude places with fewer

than an average of 500 families (not shown).

       In the right-hand panel of Table 4, we repeat the exercise with the share of the families in

the MSA (or place) that are in the “rich” category as our dependent variable. Again, the income

distribution in superstars shifts to the right the most when the number of rich families is the

largest. Column 4 shows that, at the MSA level, a 10 percent rise in the national number rich is

correlated with a 0.31 percentage point greater rise in the share rich for superstar cities relative to

in-between cities in the same year. At the place level, a 10 percent rise in a MSA’s number rich

is correlated with a 0.22 percentage point greater rise in the share rich for its superstar places




                                                                                                     25
relative to its in-between places. Again, the place results are robust to including only those

places that are in our sample for 1970-2000 (column 6) or excluding places with fewer than an

average of 500 families.

       D. Mobility and superstar cities

       The superstar cities model suggests that rising incomes in a city are due to a changing

composition of families within superstar cities from an influx of highly productive high-income

workers, rather than through gains in existing residents’ productivity. Ideally, one could

distinguish between these alternatives by comparing workers’ wages before and after

exogenously moving to a superstar city. If the superstar city had a positive influence on wages

over and above what the worker earned prior to moving, that would provide evidence in support

of agglomeration benefits. But, if the type of worker who moved to the city was already high-

income so that his arrival changed the income distribution of the destination city, the pattern

would be more consistent with superstar cities. Unfortunately, in our data we do not observe

preexisting wages (or exogenous moves), so we compare the distributions of recent in-migrants

and out-migrants in superstar cities and non-superstars to identify whether the share of in-

migrants who are currently high-income is greater in superstar cities.

       The top panel of Table 5 shows that the income distribution of recent movers into

superstar cities is shifted toward relatively more “rich” families. Each column corresponds to the

regression of the share of the MSA’s recent movers (in-migrants in the top panel, out-migrants in

the bottom panel) in a particular income bin on the MSA’s superstar/non-superstar status, a year

dummy, and an indicator for low demand status. The out-migrant regressions also include the

share of the MSA’s families in the income category as a control for the at-risk-of-moving

population. The sample contains 231 MSAs with migration data in 1980 and 1990. Relative to




                                                                                                  26
recent in-migrants in the omitted intermediate B category or in non-superstars, superstar MSAs

have fewer low-income in-migrants and more middle-to-upper income ones. This difference in

income distribution is more than twice as thick as the average density of long-time residents on

the rich end and half as thick at the low-income end (see the numbers in square brackets). The

difference in the income distributions of in-migrants between superstar and non-superstar MSAs

is statistically significant in all but the “middle-poor” income category.

       There is not such a strong pattern for out-migrants. Superstar MSAs typically do have a

lower fraction of rich out-migrants and a higher fraction of poor out-migrants. However, these

effects are statistically distinguishable from the in-between MSAs in only three of the five

columns and from the non-superstar MSAs in only one case at the 95 percent confidence level

(and two more cases at the 90 percent level).

       However, the difference in the income distributions of in-migrants and out-migrants

varies considerably between superstar cities and non-superstars. In superstar MSAs, in-migrants

are more often rich and less often poor than out-migrants, while in non-superstars there is little

difference between in-migrants and out-migrants. This difference in net in-migration is

statistically significant in four out of five cases, as reported in the bottom row of the table. This

comparison is especially useful as it differences out MSA-level characteristics that affect the

income distribution of in-migrants and out-migrants equally.



7.     Implications of superstar cities: higher price-to-rent ratios

       Another implication of the superstar cities framework is that the price-to-rent ratio should

be higher in superstar cities. If home buyers correctly anticipate that superstar cities have higher

than average rent growth, they should be willing to pay a greater multiple of current rents to




                                                                                                     27
obtain a house. This is analogous to the price/earnings ratio being higher for stocks with higher

expected growth in earnings.23

         Table 6 reports results from regressing the log of the ratio of average house value to

average annual rent on our indicators for superstar status and year dummies. At the MSA level,

we find that metropolitan areas that became superstars at any time from 1970-2000 have higher

price/rent ratios, consistent with the implication that superstar cities should experience higher

expected rent growth. Relative to the intermediate B markets, the price/rent ratio is 22 percent

(with a standard error of 1.4 percent) higher for MSAs that ever were superstars (first row), and

13 percent (1.2) lower for low demand MSAs (third row). There is no statistically or

economically meaningful difference between price-to-rent ratios for non-superstar metros

(second row) and the omitted group.

         To show that the higher price/rent ratios are not a spurious characteristic of MSAs that

happen to become superstars, in column two of Table 6 we add time-varying indicators for

whether an MSA is classified as a superstar, a non-superstar, or low demand in each census year.

The results confirm that MSAs’ price-to-rent ratios rise when they become superstars.

Specifically, MSAs that will become superstars have 10 percent higher price-to-rent ratios than

the excluded group before they are superstars, but their price-to-rent ratios rise by another 23

percent (row 4) during their actual superstar period(s). Non-superstars have similar price-to-rent

ratios to the in-between group of MSAs when they are not in the non-superstar category, but they

have a 12 percent lower price-to-rent ratio in those years when their supply is most elastic (row

5). Finally, low demand MSAs exhibit their lowest price-to-rent ratios when they are in a low

demand period (row 6). This pattern is robust to many specifications, including adding MSA

23
  In previous research, Sinai and Souleles (2005) show that a higher price/rent ratio is associated with a higher
expected growth rate of rents, measured as the average rent growth over the first nine of the prior 10 years, holding
constant other important factors including differences in risk (volatility of rents) across metro areas.


                                                                                                                   28
fixed effects, different linear time trends for each type of MSA superstars, non-superstars, and

low demand, and different year dummies for each of the four categories of MSAs.

        At the place level, we find a parallel result to the MSA-based analysis: the price-to-rent

ratio is higher in superstar suburbs. We begin by regressing the log price-to-rent ratio on

whether a place ever is considered a superstar, non-superstar, or low-demand, in column 3. We

include indicators for MSA × year to control for unobserved dynamics taking place at the

metropolitan area level, so in essence we are comparing price-to-rent ratios of superstar and non-

superstar places within the same MSA and same year. Because of the short time series at the

place level, we extrapolate superstar status in 1990 or 2000 back to 1970 and 1980. Relative to

the omitted, intermediate high demand category, price-to-rent ratios are 14 percent higher for

superstar (row 1) and 5 percent lower for non-superstar places (row 2). Price-to-rent ratios in

low demand places are nearly 16 percent lower than the high-demand, in-between places (row 3).

All of these results are highly statistically significant.

        In column 4, we examine whether the places that transition in or out of superstar/non-

superstar status experience a change in their price-to-rent ratio. Because we use lagged data to

determine contemporaneous superstar status, we restrict the sample to the places for which we

have data over the 1970 to 2000 period and use only 1990 and 2000 in the regression. These

restrictions result in a drop from 30,539 to 7,584 observations. As with the MSAs, the census

year in which a city achieves superstar status is associated with an increase in the price-to-rent

ratio, although the coefficient is small and the standard error is relatively high. Including place

fixed effects, in results that we do not report here, reduces that standard error sufficiently that the

positive effect is statistically significant. Exiting non-superstar status raises the price-to-rent

ratio by 10.3 percent (with a 3.7 percent standard error).




                                                                                                      29
        These time-varying place results do not appear to be an artifact of the restricted sample.

As a consistency check, in column 5 we repeat the estimation strategy from column 3 using the

smaller sample. We find qualitatively similar, and still statistically significant, results.24



8.      Distinguishing superstar cities from alternative explanations

        Taken in concert, the empirical evidence above indicates that the superstar cities

phenomenon must be at least partially responsible for the skewness in growth rates in house

prices and income sorting that we observe. While alternative theories of urban growth and

agglomeration are consistent with some of the facts we have identified, none except for superstar

cities matches the entire set. Of course, we do not claim that other potential hypotheses are not

also valid; rather they cannot be the only explanations.

        Unlike superstar cities, which contends that house price growth and changes in the

income distribution at the MSA or place level is merely due to exogenous changes in the income

distribution and sorting, typical urban theories postulate that there are locational differences in

underlying value, either as consumption or through production. In the urban compensating

differential literature discussed above, high-amenity locations should have permanently higher

land prices. However, this literature does not typically address house price growth and there is

no reason to believe that local amenities happen to improve the most when the number of high

income people rises. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine that underlying amenities have




24
  Analogously, our MSA results are qualitatively unchanged if we rerun the regressions over the entire 1950-2000
time period using an indicator of supertar status that is extrapolated to the first two decades.


                                                                                                               30
improved nearly enough to account for the dramatic increase in house price dispersion

experienced across U.S. markets.25

         Another way to generate persistent differences in house price appreciation is for some

cities to have faster productivity growth. If a worker must live in a city to become more

productive and land supply there is limited, workers will bid up the price of land, firms will have

to pay higher wages, and land prices ultimately will capitalize the productivity-induced wage

premium. If the productivity in the location increases over time, so will the willingness-to-pay to

live there.

         While we believe that differential agglomeration effects exist across urban areas, there

are two main reasons why they cannot be the sole explanation for the variation seen in the data.

First, the fact that we find similar patterns across places within a MSA strongly suggests that

superstar cities effects exist independently of agglomeration effects. The effect of productivity

growth on house prices should occur throughout the labor market area, even when agglomeration

benefits accrue in the workplace, since MSAs are constructed according to how families

commute to work. Income sorting and skewness in house price growth rates at the sub-MSA

level must be due to some reason other than productivity growth. Second, there is no reason why

the income benefits to productivity growth should accrue disproportionately to recent in-

migrants, as in Table 6.26

         Some related strands of research, in combination with the superstar cities concept,

suggest that the broad theory articulated here may be a better fit of the data than the empirical



25
   While changes in amenities cannot explain differential growth rates, amenities such as good weather or other
people with similar preferences (Waldfogel 2003) may be characteristics that make some families prefer one city to
another. That, plus growth in the right tail of the income distribution, is the mechanism for superstar cities.
26
   Combining these alternatives, Shapiro (2005) reports results consistent with other changes occurring with respect
to the local quality life that could help retain high human capital workers who well could be essential to the
agglomerated firms, thereby reducing their mobility.


                                                                                                                  31
results indicate. For example, if production requires a mix of high and low-skill workers, low-

skill workers in superstar cities would earn a premium to enable them to afford living there. This

theory could partially explain why superstar cities have a lower apparent poor household share,

although superstar cities would still have to be the driving force as to why high-skill workers sort

there in the first place. Consistent with this possibility, Lee (2005) shows that nurses earn large

premiums to work in large cities, while doctors actually earn small discounts in the same cities.

Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2006) develop a theory that helps explain why we observe some poor

households remaining in the superstar cities. If a poor family owns its house, its wealth grows at

the same rate as land prices in a superstar city and thus it can always afford to live in the city,

even though its wage income alone would not support it.27



9.      Conclusion

        The dispersion in house price and income growth rates across locations and the skewness

in house prices, especially the strong growth in the right tail, can be explained in part by inelastic

land supply in some places combined with growth in the high-income population. The view that

some cities and towns have turned into scarce luxury goods, which we label superstar cities, is

supported by a number of consistent empirical facts. First, superstar cities and towns have

higher mean incomes and income distributions that are skewed to the right, consistent with high

land prices discouraging low-income households from living there. Income distributions at the

MSA (or place) level shift right the most when the absolute number of high-income families rise

at the national (or MSA) level. This pattern also kicks in more when a location fills up and

transitions into superstar status. Second, superstar cities trade at higher price-to-rent ratios and


27
   Ortalo-Magne and Rady also note that their theory is consistent with in-migrants having higher incomes than
existing residents.


                                                                                                                 32
that ratio expands further when those cities fill up. Third, superstar MSAs (towns) enjoy

disproportionately high house price growth when the number of high-income families increases

at the national (MSA) level. Lastly, recent movers into superstar MSAs are more likely to be rich

and less likely to be poor than recent movers into other cities.

        In this framework, house prices do not rise in superstar cities because there is increasing

value from amenities or productivity benefits. Instead, the composition of families living in

superstar cities shifts to those who are willing to pay more as high-income families become more

numerous.

        This analysis naturally raises a host of questions. Can the growth in the house price

premiums for living in superstar cities and towns persist? On the demand side, the increasing

house price gap for superstar cities is dependent on the thickness and length of the right tail of

the income distribution, so that any reduction in the absolute number of high-income families or

thinning of the right tail of the wage distribution will put downward pressure on this dispersion

across cities. According to Piketty and Saez (2004), since 1940 there has never been a sustained

drop in either the aggregate income or the average income earned by the top percentile of the

U.S. income distribution (although the share of income held by that percentile has fallen).

Further, U.S. cities may be ever-more dependent on the income distribution internationally, with

superstar residents drawn from the highest income families worldwide.

        What about the supply of superstar cities? Our model is predicated upon cities being

imperfectly substitutable, so that each has a clientele of potential residents that prefer it to others.

However, as cities “enter” the market in response to population growth, they may locate close in

product space to existing cities, siphoning off some of a city’s clientele. The net effect will

depend on the rate of growth of close substitutes, the growth in the high-income population, and




                                                                                                     33
the distribution of intensity of tastes. Second, most existing superstar cities could expand supply

by increasing density, but choose not to. The political economy behind that decision is only just

beginning to be studied. [Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005a), Ortalo-Magne and Prat (2006)]

          In addition, this dynamic has profound implications for the evolution of urban areas

because it implies that even large metropolitan areas might evolve into communities that are

affordable only by the rich, just as exclusive resort areas have done. Is such an MSA sustainable,

or does it lose the vibrancy that makes it unique? Should public policy ensure that living in a

particular city is available to all families or, since superstar cities and towns are like luxury

goods, is it reasonable that low income workers can no longer afford to buy homes in superstar

cities?

Notes: Number of observations is 1,116, for four decades (1970-2000) and 279 MSAs. Standard errors are in
parentheses. All specifications include year dummies. Superstarit is equal to 1 when an MSA’s ratio of real annual
price growth over the previous two decades to its annual housing unit growth over the same period exceeds 1.7 (the
90th percentile) and the sum of price and unit growth over that period exceeds the median. Superstari is equal to 1
for an MSA if superstarit is ever equal to 1. Non-superstarit is equal to 1 when the price growth/unit growth ratio is
below 1/1.7, and non-superstari is an indicator whether non-superstarit is ever 1. To control for MSA-demand, the
top panel includes an indicator variable for whether the MSA’s sum of annual price growth and unit growth over any
20-year period fell below the median in that period. The bottom panel includes that variable plus a time-varying
variable for whether the sum of the growth rates over the preceding 20 years was below the median.

Notes: Number of observations is 31,200 over four decades (1970-2000). This is not a rectangular panel. Standard

ever exceeds 2.06 (the 75th percentile) and the sum of price and unit growth over that period exceeds the median.
Non-superstari is equal to 1 if the price growth/unit growth ratio is ever below 1/2.06 and the sum of price and unit

Notes: Number of observations is 7,584 over two decades (1990-2000), 3,792 places per decade. Standard errors are
in parentheses. All specifications include MSA x year dummies. Superstarit is equal to 1 when a place’s ratio of
real annual price growth over the previous two decades to its annual housing unit growth over the same period
exceeds 2.06 (the 75th percentile) and the sum of price and unit growth over that period exceeds the median.
Superstari is equal to 1 for a place if superstarit is ever equal to 1. Non-superstarit is equal to 1 when the price
growth/unit growth ratio is below 1/2.06, and non-superstari is an indicator whether non-superstarit is ever 1. Low
demand it is an indicator variable for whether the MSA’s sum of annual price growth and unit growth over the prior
20-year period fell below the median in that period. Low demand i is equal to 1 if low demand it ever equals 1.

Notes: The sample period is 1970-2000. At the MSA level, it covers 279 MSAs over four decades. At the place level, the rectangular sample uses the 3,792
Census-designated Places for which we have data over the entire period. The larger sample also uses places that enter the data set post-1970. Standard errors are
in parentheses. Superstari is equal to 1 for an MSA [place] if ever an MSA’s [place’s] ratio of real annual price growth over the previous two decades to its
annual housing unit growth over the same period exceeds 1.7 [2.06] (the 90th percentile) and the sum of price and unit growth over that period exceeds the
median. Non-superstari is equal to 1 if ever the price growth/unit growth ratio is below 1/1.7 [1/2.06] and the sum of price and unit growth over that period
exceeds the median. To control for demand, low demandi is an indicator variable for whether the MSA’s [place’s] sum of annual price growth and unit growth
over any 20-year period fell below the median in that period. Each of these variables is interacted with the either the national number of families in the “rich”
category (in the MSA specifications) or the MSA number “rich” (in the place-level specifications). The uninteracted variables are subsumed by the fixed effects.

Notes: The left-hand-side variable is the share of the MSA’s number of in-migrants (or out-migrants) that are in the
income category. The sample is restricted to 1980 and 1990 and the 231 MSAs per year for which we have
migration data. Standard errors are in parentheses. All specifications include a year dummy and a control for low
demand MSAs. Standard errors in parentheses. Superstarit is equal to 1 when an MSA’s ratio of real annual price
growth over the previous two decades to its annual housing unit growth over the same period exceeds 1.7 (the 90th
percentile) and the sum of price and unit growth over that period exceeds the median. Non-superstarit is equal to 1
when the price growth/unit growth ratio is below 1/1.7. To control for MSA-demand, the regressions include an
indicator variable for whether the sum of the growth rates over the preceding 20 years was below the median. The
out-migrant regressions also include the share of the MSA’s families in the income category as a control.

Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. Superstarit is equal to 1 when an MSA’s [place’s] ratio of real annual
price growth over the previous two decades to its annual housing unit growth over the same period exceeds 1.7
[2.06] (the 90th percentile) and the sum of price and unit growth over that period exceeds the median. Superstari is
equal to 1 for an MSA if superstarit is ever equal to 1. Non-superstarit is equal to 1 when the price growth/unit
growth ratio is below 1/1.7 [1/2.06], and non-superstari is an indicator whether non-superstarit is ever 1. Low
demandi is an indicator variable for whether the sum of annual price growth and unit growth over any 20-year
period fell below the median in that period. Low demandit is a time-varying variable for whether the sum of the
growth rates over the preceding 20 years was below the median.
