The "Tobit" rrdel is a useful tool for estimation of regression rrodels
with a truncated or lirrited dependent variable, but it requires a
threshold which is either a known constant or an observable and
independent variable. The radel presented here ectends the Tobit
rxdel to the censored case where the tbreshold is an unobserved and
not necessarily indep.ndent random variable. !dmn likelihood
procedures can be employed for joint estimation of both the primary
regression equation arid the parameters of the distribution of that
random threshold. The appropriate likelihood function is derived,
the conditions necessary for identification are revealed, and the
particular estimation difficulties are discussed. The nodel is
illustrated by an application to the determination of a housewife 's
value of time.

INTRODUCflON

       Of   concern in this paper are appropriate estimation techniques for
relationships involving "censored" dependent variable. That is we
wish to estimate parameters of a regression model when data on the
dependent variable are incomplete in the sense that the variable is
observed only when it 's value exceeds (or falls short of) some censoring
threshold. The model Iay be written as

(1)           Y.
               1   'X.1 +u.1   If   RHS.T.1

(2)           Y1n.a.           IfRHS<T1
       The distinction between this model and the tobit or limited dependent
variable     model considered by Tobin [6] should he carefully noted. The tobit
model is a truncated variable model with equation (2) replaced by

              Y1T1             1fRHS<T1

and requires that we know both which observations are truncated and the value
of the threshold T.
                 1
                    for at least those truncated observations. In the censored
model    the actual value of the threshold will not generally be known for any
observations.
       As in the tobit model the threshold censoring results in a non-zero
expectation of the disturbance term within the subset of non-censored
observations so that least squares will yield biased parameter estimates.
It    would thus appear that maxirm.un likelihood estimation is more appropriate.

Derivation of the likelihocd function requires a specification of the
behavior of the unobserved thr'eshold.
     part i of this par treats the estimation problem when the threshold
is assumed to be the unobserved endogenous variable of a second regression
relationship. The likelihood function is derived and the model is compared
with simple probit and tobit ndels to highlight. certain' features and diff i-
culties such as conditions necessary for identification of parameters. The
difficulties of obtiring estimates for the rrodel are discussed and the
results of some linitd sinilatiort experiments are presented for some indi-
cation of the performance of the estinators.
     Part II iflustrates the rrx1el with an application to the determination
of the value of a house;ife 's time. Following Gronau [3] and I-ieckrr'an []
the housewife's inaiket wage is the censored dependent variable and the
value of her time at home is the threshold variable. It is argued -that
the censored rrdel discussed here is the appropriate one to use for estima-
tion under the assumptions invoked by Gronau rather than the probit analysis
nodel he employed. The relationship to }ècman's rmodel, in which thc t
equations are simultaneous, is also discussed.

I. The Censored Depender Variable                 Model

      The   model to be cons idered here is

                      Si X1   +u1
                '2t 2 X2 +

                                       '2t
                    -O

     is   the censored dependent variable which, for convenience only, is
assigned the value zero from censored observations.                        and 2t   are   latent
(i.e., not directly observable) endogencus variables and                                  are

perhaps      overlapping vectors of observable exogenous variables             which rray

include the constant unity. u1 id u2 are random distur'bances assumed
here      to follow a bivariate nonrial distribution w1 th a zero mean vector
and   un1iown variances       and   covariance ,
                                                      a3, a2 and    a12.
                                                                            Both disturbances
are   assumed     to be independent     across      observations and independent of
and X2.         From a sample   of T observations on                 and      we    require
estinates of the vectors               and    2   arid the   scalars a2,   a2 and c12.

          For notational convenience let                  2 denote the subsets of
censored and       non-censored     observations respectively. That is, if 'i' is
the set of integers U, ..., TI               then      is the subset of i corresponding
to          <
                2- and '2 is the subset corresonding to                -         Deter!nination
of the subsets           and '2     should   be obvious from an inspection of the data.

The subscript t will be         deleted      in what follows for ease of      notation.

       Clearly ordlairy lea:: squares is not the appropriate estimation
procedure for even             and a2 over the          subsample   P2. The method of censor—
ing intplies that observations with an algebraically srrall value for u1 are
more likely to be censored than observations with relatively large values
for u1. Thus the expected value of u1 over the- subsatple P2 is not zero
and OLS will yield biased estimates. Moreover, the censoring induces a
correlation between u1 and                 within the non—censored subsample.

       Maximum        likelihood appears to be a more reasonable estimation tech- -
nIque   for this model.            To   formulate the likelihood function the distribu-

        Like the likelihood function for the tobit model, (8) and (9)
include both density and distribution functions and yield nonlinear
normal equations so that iterative maximization procedures are required
for obtaining estimates. As will be shown below implementation of such
procedures for the censored rrcdel is mere difficult than for the tobit
and probit rrcdels. Several other aspects of the rrodel, wiU also be
 considered including the marginality of the information in a samtle with
 respect to identification         of   the parameters, the inseparability of the
 nodel which necessitates simultaneous estimation of both equations, and
 methods of obtaining initial estimates to start the iterative maximization
 procedure.

        It is useful to        first   consider a decomposition of the model into
the         tohit and probit models. As was suggested above, the tobit
       related

model requires observations on the threshold variable. Suoose that

was observable. Then the likelihood function would be riften as

allowing estiniation of equation (3) by tobit analysis and equation                          ()
by OLS separately. *            Clearly     the lack of observations on y2 in the            censored
nodel prevents        estimation       by   tobit analysis.     One might    proced instead
to    obtain consistent estimtes of y2 and then apply the tobit model as

atxve using these           estimates   but, as will      be   seen, such estimates nay be

inossib1e to obtain and             even then the quality of           the resulting parameter

estimates might            diminish considerably.
        It is possible to stisrate the             censored    model   directly by       dimcar'ding

the     observations on Y, the only endogenous information retained                       being   the

separation of the sample into the two subsets                      and            That   is the

endogenous        variable retained is         an indicator variable, say          I, defined     by




      Even   if     0 we might proceed to estimate the two equations separately
      arguing, by analogy to the "seemingly unrelated regressions" problem,
      that this sacrifices only efficiency. It is not clear, however, that
      the analogy holds. Separate estimation might lead in this case to
      inconsistent estimates.

tification of the parameters. ( X2 - 3j X1)/cr is observationally equiva—
lent to (K2 X2 - K, X1)IKa, where K IS any scalar other than zero. Thus
we cannot   identify a,      let alone it's separate components a1, a2 and a12,
and    can estinate     the slore coefficients only up to a scalar multiple,
(.lj Ia). Rtrthenrre if X1and X overlaD with corrmon variables, for

example if both equations include an intercept term, the corresponding
coefficients would also not be sepamtely estinable — we could only esti-
mate their difference up to the scalar rrultiple (                   2 lk). Obviously the
endogenous variable I by itself does not provide sufficient infowation
to identify all parameters of the ircdel.

Knowledge of both I andy1 for all observations plus the assumption of
zero covariance are sufficient for the identification of all paraneters
in (lii). Contrasting equations (15) and (13), it is the natural norwali—
zation of the efficient of (-1) for y1 in equation (15) which allows
the identification. It can be shown, however, that when the covariarice
is also to be estimated, as in equation (1'4.), identification is not
guaranteed.

Clearly not all paremeters are identified without furrther restrictions.
That is, since the transformed system is observationally equivalent to
the    original   system we cannot identify the                     parameters         2'      and     012

that original         system. To achieve           identification we need at least one
linear restriction arcng this set of parameters,                                such   as a zero       restric-

tion on    012 or one element of

       The situation is r.earl: analogous to sirrni.ltaneous equation models. The
original system in our rrodel 'looks like" a reduced form while the transforiied
system "looks like" a structural form and the identifiabliliy conditions
"look like" the same. The not so subtle difference is that in this orobit
structure the approach to estimation and identification are backwards. In
SE we could estimate the reduced form directly since each euation involves
only   one endogenous variable. But in our probit formulation the second
equation uses       fran   the first as its threshold, preventing its direct
estimation unless       haoens to be independent of U2.      Thus   we nmist go the
other direction and generate a "structural model" with a recursive form
to use   for estimation.

       Looking   at our transfcrd system as if it were a structural form we can
count the number of restrictions airong the endogenous variable coefficiants
(our matrix A), noting      one 'estriction   for equation one (the 0 in the too
right corner) and one for the second (the element in the lower righc hand
corner which is a linear function of variance terms). Thus we would say that
the model is identified. However since the second equation must be estimated
with probit analysis rather than OLS we sacrifice one degree of identification
and must therefore have one rcre restriction in equation two. So the identi-
fiability conditions scan to be the same. The difference here is that in
simultaneous equations we ask whether the restrictions on the structural
coefficients impose sufficient restictions on the reduced form to ?er!rit
identification. In -this probit model we ask the reverse -          do   the restrictions
on the "reduced form" coefficients impose sufficient conditions on the
"structural" coefficients to permit identifcat ion.

            V.




      As    in the usual simultaneous equations estimation, too many restrictions
result in over identification. In a just identified model we could estimate
the probit equation only, irovided the condition arises fnm a zero covariance
restriction. Othenise we need estimates for both equations since                          and
from the first are used in identifying the second. In an over identified
model we have the problem of multiple solutions when estimating the equations

seperately which     is    easily   solved   by the obvious 2SLS analog     or   FIML,   esti'nation
of the entire     model.
      We can     now restore equation        (5) and   re-examine     prcerties of the
                                                                    the

censored     regiession model in      light of its probit      and tobit analogs. The

model   is like a tobit model except that it does not admit observations                   on

      It    is like a probit model except that y1 is observed for only some of
the observations. We could thus regard it as a hybrid which, unfortunatly,
exhibits all the unattractive features of its parent strains. Specifically
the identifiability conditions are the same as for the last probit model
discussed above. Identification, even when the conditions are met, is however
in some sense only marginal. The identifiability argument with respect to
the   subset of non limit      observations is identical to that presented above
for   the   last probit model       while   the under   identified   result of the first

probit model applies to the subset of limit observations.        the entire
                                                                          Thus

burden of identifiability falls on just the subset of non limit observations.
        A second unattiactive feature of the censored model from the standpoint
of computational difficulty lies in the inseparability, with respect to
estimation, of the two equations. This feature is shared with the first
probit model examined above' and arises because the probability measure for
                                         —12—



limit   observations (see e eaion (6)) involves all prameters of beth
equations in an inseparable form.
        Consider again the iterative naxirriization of likelihood functions
(7) or (8). Experience with the probit arid tobit models suggests that
the Newton-Ra.phsori iterative rrximization algorithm perfoirs quite well
on functions of this sort with rapid cOnvergence rates even when starting
from poor initial values. But the authort s use of th s algorithm on
artificial data for the censored rrDdel gave mixed and disccz'aging results
    factors in particular had to be accounted for. First the log likeli-
hood is not concave over a wide range of the parameter space so that the
matrix of second derivatives may not be negative definite, as is required
for convergence of the Newton algorithm, at any arbitrary set of initial
values for the coefficients. A rrodification to that Hession matrix such
as the one proposed by eenstadt [2]         proved necessary. Second, a
                                              thus

tattern often observed in the iterative maximization was that the coef-
ficients appeared to be moving in the right direction but the steps taken
were so large that eventually the maxinun was oversteped with the variance
terms driven out of the parameter space, resulting in a failure of the
procedure. An algorithm which proved a bit more stable was a 'TLgleg"
algorithm developed by Rick Becker t     i].     That   algorithm was derived
along the lines of Powellt s [.]    I'{[NFA   routine but uses analytic first
and second   derivatives. It uses a combination of Newton and steepest

ascent iterations, explicitly controlling the length         of   steps taken.

        Obtaining starting values for   the iterative nxirnization procedure

proved to be a troublesome task. The procedure adopted for the Drk

presented here   was:   (a) apply OLS   to   equation (3) over the subset of
                                            —13—




observations        (b) obtaL       for the subset 'Y using the OLS estimates;
and Cc) apply the probit ne1 with observed threshold (y, in the set
   and Y in the set 'i'2) to equation (1k). For purposes of obtaining
initial estimates       was 'assurrd to be zero so that the more sirnjle like-
lihood function (15) could be applied in step Cc).
      To   test the feasibility of and provide (atLtedly r?Jzly) evidence
for the perfonmnce of rraxijinim likelihood estimation on the censored rrodel
some limited simulation exDerirnents were conducted. The rcdel used was

                       +        + 2x2   +
                                            U1

Independent variables were drawn from independent nornal distributions with
zero mean and unit variance arid were held fixed in repeated samples. Para-
meter values were chosen so that the tnxe coefficient o1 determination in
bDth regression equations was around.6. Sample size used was 100.
      Results of the experiment are reported in table 1 below. Estimates
of the parameters of equation (3) are notably better then those for equa-
tion ('f) as would be expected. Note that the irde1 above is identified by
the absence of X3 and       in the first equation. Simulations on irx1e1s
with differing de'ees of identification give similar results with some
 irdication that estlirates of equation two and the covariance improve as
degrees of identification increase.

II. An Application to th. :stiation of Value of Time
     Estirration of labor supply relationships at th micro level i.s
often frustrated by th abscence of potential wage data for non-
participants in the labor force. If the decision to vork was rnide
independently of potential wage rates, wage deterniriaicn relationships
could be estimated directly from samples drawn from he labor force.
it is more reasonable to assume however that such decisions are
directly affected by uae offers. Other things ecual the higher the
offered or potential wage the more likely a potential w3rker will
accept the offer and enter the labor force. Thus such sajrples would
tend to overestimate potential wages f or nonworkers. Such a mechanism
is captured in the familiar diagram illustrating indifference curves
in the income-leisure plane.

       onau was conoerrc with estimating the value of a housewife' S
time and, more specifically, on the effect of children on the value of
her time. The model he usd can be formulated as
(20)               f(E)
(21)         V     g(C)

(22)                      if      >   V

                   0      otherwise
where      is a housewife's potential wage which deDends               on her   rrarkatable
characteristics CE) such as training and work experience, V is                   the value

of her time at hoice with zero hours of work which is a function of such
characteristics as fanily income and nber of children, arid                       is the
wage she recieves if she does in fact enter the labor force. The reader
i_s refered to Gronau's paper for a derivation of the relationship fran
household utility maximizetion anda discussion of assumptions underlying
the model and the possible bias they introduce when violated. One
particularly troublesome assumption which was neglected in his paper
is flexibility in hours worked for working women. Since the same problem
arises    in Hec}cnan's    analysis a discussion of it will be delayed            until

later.
        Gronau applied probit analysis to obtain estiirates for equation (21).

As he discussed and        as   explained in section I of this paper,           neglecting
any    observed   wage rates and      analyzing    the labor   fonce   participation

decision    with   straight forward         application of   probit methods provides

 estimates of coefficients only up to a scale factor and                 even   then does not

 permit   separate     estirriates of     coefficients for variables corrrnon to both
                                       —18—




equations. On the other 1nd if potential wages were                    for all
nen this variable, he argued, could be included as a variable in the
probit rrdel, its coefficient providing an estimate of the variance
and thereby permitting identification of the coefficients in equation
(21). Since potential wages are not always obse'ied h devoted con-
siderable attention to obtaining proxy measures for it. His efforts
n this direction ere admirable and promising but -t1rr success hinges
crucially on the assunptlon of zero correlation bet;een               and the
disturbance in the value of time equation. Other authors, Hec)ran [4]
for emple, have provided evidence that the assizapton does not hold.
If the threshold in a probit rodel is not independent of the disturbance,
consistent estimates will not be obtained. The censored variable
estimation procedure directly overcomes the problem of missing potential
wage data. Furthermore it relies on the zero correlation assnption
only as one means of achieving identification. (Unfortunately the data
source used by onau and his specification of the model invokes this
reliance as will be explained below.)
     To illustrate the method we returned to the data source used by

Gronau, the   1960 census 1/1000      sample and collected a random sample of
750 observations for urban white rrrried women, spouse present,            who

           It   is iinortant       to note that for this specification, as indicated by
    the   variable list above,          of factors     detenrining    the potential '.:age and.
    the value of time, the arameters of ecuation (21) are identified only
    if there is zero co'iariance between the disturbances in the two equations.
    This is unfortunate since, as already noted, the validity of the zero
    covaraince assumption is doubtful. However since the primary purpose
    here is illustration we proceeded under this assumption in order to
    crtpare as closely as possible             the results of the censored and robit

    approaches to Gronau's model. The identification problem arises                       here
    because     of the limitations imposed by the data source. Potential

    wages   ought to deend on             education, seciai training         and work experience.
    Since   only   the     first of these is available from the 1960 census, age

    was used as a proxy           for   experience and this variable also appears as

    a factor in value of time. Had              a   proper measure     of   experience been

    available for use in equation (20), exclusion of it                     in   (21) would have
                                     —20—




been sufficient    for iden:ification without the zero coveriance assurption.
       The choice of variables follows Groriau arid the reader is refered to
his paper for a justification for that choice. We dsvia.e from hIs
choice only in that he included other measures for the effect of children
to account for possible nonlinearities or returns to scale. Gronau
experJiiented with both additive and multiplicative functional foniis for
the two equations and, ultimately adopted the later for iore appealing
theoretical rational and greater explanatory power.           experience: was
the same. This te fonctional form used for the results enDearing
below was     Yb0bTh2 bd for both equations whofe t-e         dStLTbarce u

was assumed.to follow a log normal distribution. (Estimates presented

are for parameters of the form ln(b.).)

          The model was estImated using both the censored and probit procedures.
The details of the later require more detailed explanation. One of the

procedures used by Gronau was to estimate, via probit analysis, the model

               Ll if b'C+u>ln(t)
                 0 if'.b'C+u<lri()
where L is the labor force participation indicator arid         was taken to

be the geometric average of wages recieved by working women with charac-

teristics      C1-C1. This was the   procedure adopted for use here.   Results
 for   the two methods are presented in     table II below. As can   be seen
 the   differences in the coefficient estimates are not striking but there

 is   a   sizea.hle difference in the estimate of the mean value of a housewife' s

 time.

       As   noted earlier Hecrar'i C 4] looked at the same basic problem but
used a different estirrtion procedure. Ills nde1 fo 2ation is
(23)         W f(E)
(2L)           V =   g(rI,C)
where H represents hours worked and other variables are as previously
defined. If hours worked are perfectly flexible then crking woin
will adjust H so as to equate W and V. When a corner slution is
reached (H       0)       exceeds V, both are unobserved and the individual
drops out of the labor force. The interpretation placed on V by the
two authors is somewhat different. In Hec1oran's formulation V is the
shadow price of time or the slope of a tangent to the indifference
curve, which of course varies as hours of work change. ronau on the
other hand specifically chose V to prepresent the value of time for a
nonparticipant, or alternatively the asking wage, arid this value of
time will be equal to the slope of an indifference curve only at zero
working hours.
       A crucial assumption in both models is flexibility in hours worked. It
might   be argued however that HecI<jnan' s analysis relies r.ore heavily
on that assumption. Any rigidity here would mean that only by chance
would the shadow price of time equal the market wage at any institu-
tionally fixed hours of work. In Groriau' s analysis on th other hand
the    only observations violating the conditions of his     model are those

for    which the potential wage exceeds      the value of time   but, at the
rigid hours, places the individual on a lower indifference curve than
                                          —23—
. ,


      would nonparticipation. In both cases rigid hours lead to a bias in
      the estimates obtained but the conjecture is that the bias would be
      greater using Heckiran' s approach. Verification of    this conjecture   and,
      more important,     a method for estimation accounting for such rigidity await
      further   research. In fairness it should be noted that Eeck'an's pro-

      cedure. is   more powarful in terTiis of the uses to which it rray be put

      since it does oemit estimation of indifference curies :hic'n the cen-

      sored ndel ccs nc.

              To estimate his odel Heckinan used maximum likelihood, deriving,

      as in the censored model, Pr(g(0,C)>f(E)) for nonworking women and

      for working women using the pdf representing the joint distribution of
