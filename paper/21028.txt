The Impact of Consumer Inattention on Insurer Pricing in the Medicare Part D Program

                                        ABSTRACT

The Medicare Part D program relies on consumer choice to provide insurers with incentives to
offer low-priced, high-quality pharmaceutical insurance plans. We demonstrate that consumers
switch plans infrequently and search imperfectly. We estimate a model of consumer plan choice
with inattentive consumers and show that high observed premiums are consistent with insurers
profiting from consumer inertia. We estimate the reduction in steady state plan premiums if all
consumers were attentive. An average consumer could save $1050 over three years; government
savings in the same period could amount to $1.3 billion or 1% of the cost of subsidizing the
relevant enrollees.

1    Introduction and Motivation

    The addition of pharmaceutical benefits to Medicare in 2006 was the largest expansion to

the Medicare program since its inception. Not only is the program large, it is also innovative in

design. Traditional Medicare Parts A and B are organized as a single-payer system; enrollees see

the physician or hospital of their choice and Medicare pays a pre-set fee to that provider, leaving no

role for an insurer. In contrast, Part D benefits are provided by private insurance companies that

receive a subsidy from the government as well as payments from their enrollees. The legislation

creates competition among plans for the business of enrollees, which is intended to drive drug prices

and premiums to competitive levels. Each Medicare recipient can choose among the plans offered

in her area based on monthly premiums, deductibles, plan formularies, out-of-pocket costs (OOP

costs or copayments) for drugs, and other factors such as the brand of the insurer and the quality

of customer service.

    The premise of the Part D program was that consumers’ ability to choose their preferred plan

would discipline insurers into providing lower prices and higher quality than would be achieved

through a government-run plan. Critically, these better outcomes require that consumers choose

effectively, so that demand shifts to plans that consumers prefer because they offer low prices or

high quality. If consumers choose plans randomly, a plan will have no incentive to lower its price

because this will not affect enrollment, and markups will be high. In contrast, if many consumers

choose to enroll in a plan that lowers its price, markups will fall as firms offer lower premiums to

consumers.

    This paper compares Part D plan pricing when some consumers are inattentive to the case

when all consumers are attentive. We demonstrate that, in reality, consumer choices are made

with substantial frictions. Consumers rarely switch between plans and do not consistently shop for

price and quality when they do switch. We provide evidence that, because of the absence of strong

disciplining pressures from consumers, insurers set prices above the level they would choose if all

consumers were attentive. Thus plans extract high rents due to consumer inattention. Not only

would improved consumer search benefit consumers directly, it would also lead to plan re-pricing

that would save both consumers and the government significant sums. Our estimates indicate

that removing inattention and allowing prices to adjust while leaving other sources of consumer


                                                  2
preferences unchanged could reduce consumer expenditures by over $1000 per enrollee over the

three years 2007-9. Under our assumptions, government program costs would fall by $1.3 billion

over the same period due to plan re-pricing. We find that the insurer response - lowering premiums

- results in significant savings to both enrollees and taxpayers.

   One concern when Part D began was that the prices the plans paid for drugs would rise because

plans would lack the bargaining power of the government. Duggan and Scott Morton (2010)

demonstrate that this did not happen. Rather, prices for treatments bought by the uninsured elderly

fell by 20% when they joined Part D. Since the program’s inception, increases in pharmaceutical

prices have been restrained. This is due in part to aggressive use of generics by many insurers, but

also to insurers’ ability to bargain for rebates in exchange for favorable formulary placement and

therefore market share. According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, drug costs under the

basic Part D benefit increased by only 1.8% per beneficiary from 2007-2010 net of rebates. The

remainder of plan expenditures - approximately 20% of total costs according to the CBO - consists

of administration, marketing, customer service, and like activities. The PCE deflator for services

during this same time period increased at an average annual rate of 2.40%. Yet, despite these

modest increases in the costs of providing a Part D plan, premiums in our data were on average

62.8% higher in 2009 than they were in 2006, the first year of the program, which corresponds

to a 17.6% compound annual growth rate. The CBO estimates indicate that plan profits and

administrative expenses per beneficiary (combined) grew at an average rage of 8.6% per year from

2007 to 2010.

   These figures raise the question of why slow growth in the costs of drugs and plan administration

were not passed back to consumers in the form of lower premiums. One possibility is that Part

D may be well designed to create competition among treatments that keeps the prices of drugs

low, yet may not do so well at creating competition among plans in order to restrain the prices

consumers face. Because the program is 75% subsidized by the federal government, any lack of

effective competition would increase government expenditures as well as consumer costs. Our

objective in this paper is to investigate the extent to which consumer choice imperfections in this

market impede competition between plans.

   Part 2 of the paper describes the Medicare Part D program and discusses reasons for search

imperfections. In Parts 3 and 4 we review the literature related to consumer demand with choice

                                                  3
frictions, in Medicare Part D and elsewhere, and the dynamics of pricing in that environment. In

Part 5 we describe our dataset, which provides detailed information on the choices and claims of non-

subsidized enrollees in New Jersey. In Part 6 we observe that consumers consistently make choices

that are financially costly given their consumption patterns, and that this pattern of choosing

expensive plans when cheaper ones are available does not appear to diminish with either experience

in the program or time. Consumers seem to switch plans in response to “shocks” to their health

or current plan characteristics, but are much less sensitive to changes in other plans. Motivated

by these findings, we develop a two-stage consumer decision model for estimation which accounts

for inattention as a source of inertia. We identify the effect of consumer inattention separately

from other potential sources of choice persistence, such as persistent heterogeneous unobserved

preferences, using a detailed panel dataset which documents the choices of new entrants to the

Part D program and then follows each individual’s choices over time. Our identification strategy

is similar to that utilized in recent related papers that investigate the reasons for consumer choice

persistence in other health insurance programs (Handel (2013), Polyakova (2014)). The estimates

indicate that inattention is an important part of the story.

   Having established the behavior of consumers, we turn to analysis of the supply side of the Part

D marketplace in Section 7. Using a dataset of nationwide plan characteristics and enrollment,

we show that plans with larger market shares set prices in a manner consistent with high choice

frictions. We also document rapid growth in plan prices that is not accounted for by changes in

costs, and high dispersion in relatively homogenous standard benefit plans that is indicative of

search frictions.

   The final section of the paper, Section 8, uses the estimated demand model to conduct simula-

tions that allow the supply side to adjust to a reduction in the proportion of consumers who are

inattentive. We focus on plan premium choices. We abstract away from dynamics and model plans

as profit-maximizing insurers that take into account the elasticity of demand, including consumers’

attentiveness, when choosing a markup over cost. More attentive and price-elastic consumers will

generate lower insurer margins. We use accounting data from the Part D program to estimate firm

costs and then predict plans’ optimal static premium bids under various assumptions regarding the

proportion of consumers who are inattentive, and hence the expected premium sensitivity faced by

insurers. We show that the greater the percent inattentive, the higher the optimal premium bids

                                                 4
chosen by plans. In our preferred simulation, removing inattention—and allowing plans to reprice

in response to this change—would generate savings of $1,050 per consumer over the years 2007-

2009. These results indicate that even if consumers do not choose the lowest-cost plan for them,

whether due to information processing costs or for other reasons, simply prompting them to choose

a new plan every year has a substantial effect on costs through the channel of plan premiums. If we

assume these changes can be generalized to plans nationwide, the federal government would save

$1.3 billion between 2007-2009 if inattention was removed. Although we note that allowing for dy-

namic pricing would affect these predictions, perhaps generating an increase in premiums over time

as plans “invest” to attract enrollees and then “harvest” their installed base, our static analyses

are sufficient to demonstrate the substantial long-run savings, to consumers and government, that

could result from increasing competition through reduced inattention.

    Studies such as ours are crucial both to future policies concerning Part D plan design, infor-

mation provision, and quality regulation, but also to those same issues in health insurance. Our

results are relevant for policy and market design decisions in any health care market that relies on

competition as a means to control costs and deliver quality.



2    Medicare Part D

    Pharmaceutical benefits were not part of Medicare when it was first launched in 1965. However,

the rising share of pharmaceuticals in the cost of healthcare created significant OOP expenditures

for seniors and led to the creation of the Part D program under President Bush in 2006. The

novelty of this government benefit is the fact that it is essentially privatized: insurance companies

and other sponsors compete to offer subsidized plans to enrollees. The sponsor is responsible for

procuring the pharmaceutical treatments and administering the plan.

    The Basic Part D plan is tightly regulated in its benefit levels so that there is limited flexibility

for plans to reduce quality and thereby lower costs and attract enrollees. Plans must offer coverage

at the standard benefit level, and each bid must be approved by the Centers for Medicare and Med-

icaid Services (CMS). The coverage rules include restrictions on plans’ formularies, including which

therapeutic categories or treatments must be covered. Plans are mandated to cover “all or substan-

tially all” drugs within six “protected” drug treatment classes, as well as two or more drugs within


                                                   5
roughly 150 smaller key formulary types. The protected classes include many treatments that would

identify very sick patients such as AIDS drugs, chemotherapy treatments, and antipsychotropics.

Plans’ placement of these drugs on their formulary is required, and the cost-sharing required of

beneficiaries is carefully scrutinized by CMS to ensure plans are not discriminating against sick

beneficiaries. Hence it is not straightforward for a plan to avoid the sickest enrollees; this was

particularly true in the first years of the program when it was unclear which enrollees would have

particular costs or utilization profiles and there was no usage history. Moreover, subsidy payments

to plans are risk-adjusted according to their enrollee’s demographics and health status. There is

an additional multiplier to increase the subsidy for low-income and institutionalized status. Thus

sponsors receive higher payments for sicker enrollees which reduces their incentive to seek out

healthy participants. In addition, plans must evaluate their predicted costs using CMS-specific

actuarial models. This limits their ability to attract consumers by shifting costs to a part of the

benefit that the enrollee has difficulty evaluating or will pay later. The result of this fairly tight

regulatory environment is that the plan’s premium emerges as its most salient characteristic for

consumers, particularly for the defined standard benefit plan.1 We will see in our empirical work

that consumers place high weight on a plan’s premium when they make choices among plans. The

deductible and other characteristics have an effect, but their empirical magnitude is much smaller

than that of the premium.

       Enrolling in Part D is voluntary, and one might be concerned that adverse selection would mean

only sick seniors enroll. However, the subsidy for the program is set by legislation to be an average

of 74.5% of costs, so for the vast majority of seniors, enrolling is financially favorable (see Heiss et

al. (2006)) and most eligible seniors did enroll. In addition, the newly eligible who delay enrolling

(perhaps until they become sick) are required to pay a higher price for coverage when they do join.

       Many observers have noted that the Part D choice problem is difficult and the empirical liter-

ature indicates that consumers do not choose plans that minimize their costs. In 2006 when the

program began there were at least 27 plans offered in each county in the US. Enrollees had to con-

sider how premiums varied across these plans, forecast their drug consumption in the year ahead

and compare the OOP costs for that set of drugs across plans. In addition enrollees might receive
   1
    As we show in the paper, enrollees can do better by searching for the plan-specific out-of-pocket payments for
the particular drugs they will consume.



                                                        6
an adverse health shock during the year that would change the set of medications demanded, ne-

cessitating the comparison of expected expenditures across plans. Furthermore, no major program

like this existed in the US at the time Part D began, so seniors likely had no experience attempting

to make these calculations. Lastly, most Part D consumers are older Americans; outside the dual-

eligible and disabled, Medicare eligibility begins at age 65. Finding a low-cost plan in the Part D

program therefore requires the elderly to carry out a fairly difficult cognitive task.

   Part D benefits are provided through two types of private insurance plans. The first is a simple

prescription drug plan (PDP) which provides coverage only for prescription drug costs for seniors

enrolled in the standard fee-for-service Medicare program (which does not cover drug costs). In

2006, 10.4 million people enrolled in PDPs. Medicare Advantage plans (MA-PD), for seniors who

have opted out of standard Medicare, function similarly to an HMO; such plans insure all Medicare-

covered services, including hospital care and physician services as well as prescription drugs. In

2006, 5.5 million people enrolled in MA-PDs. By 2013, of the 32 million Part D enrollees, almost 20

million were enrolled in PDPs. MA-PD plans have particularly low enrollment in New Jersey, the

state from which our data are taken: only 18-20% of NJ Part D enrollees were in MA-PD plans in

2006-9, compared to 32-38% in the U.S. overall. This paper focuses solely on PDPs and prescription

drug coverage. We assume that PDP enrollees do not consider enrolling in an MA-PD plan. We

justify this assumption by noting both the low share of New Jersey MA-PD plans and the fact that

moving from a stand-alone PDP to an MA-PD plan incurs the substantial cost of changing coverage

(and potentially providers) for hospital and physician services as well as prescription drugs.

   A fee-for-service Medicare enrollee can choose among all the PDPs offered in her region of the

country. A plan sponsor contracts with CMS to offer a plan in one (or more) of the 34 defined

regions of the US. The actuarial value of the benefits offered by a plan must be at least as generous

as those specified in the legislation. In the 2006 calendar year this included a deductible of $250, a

25% co-insurance rate for the next $2000 in spending, no coverage for the next $2850 (the “coverage

gap”), and a five percent co-insurance rate in the “catastrophic region”, when OOP expenditures

exceed $3600. As these figures change annually, we report them through 2013 in Appendix Table 1.

A sponsor may offer a basic plan with exactly this structure, or one that is actuarially equivalent -

for example with no deductible but higher cost-sharing. Enhanced plans have additional coverage



                                                  7
beyond these levels and therefore higher expected costs and higher premiums.2

    The way in which sponsors bid to participate in the program is important to an analysis of

competition. Sponsors must apply to CMS with a bid at which each plan they wish to offer will

provide the benefits of a basic plan to enrollees.3 Importantly, the costs that the plan is meant to

include in its bid are those it will expend to administer the plan, including for example, the cost

of drugs, overhead, and profit, and net of any costs paid by the enrollee such as the deductible or

copayments and reinsurance paid by CMS.4 The bid is supposed to reflect the applicant’s estimate

of its “average monthly revenue requirements” (i.e. how much it wants to be paid) to provide

basic Part D benefits for a well-defined statistical person. CMS takes these bids and computes a

“national average monthly bid amount” (NAMBA).5 CMS uses the government subsidy percentage

(74.5%) plus an estimate of its reinsurance costs and other payments to determine how much of

the bid the beneficiaries must pay on average. This is called the beneficiary premium percentage,

and in the first year of the program it was 34%6 . The Base Beneficiary Premium (BBP) is then

the average bid (NAMBA) times the percentage payable by consumers. The premium for any

given plan is this BBP adjusted by the full difference between the plan’s own bid and the NAMBA

average. If a plan’s monthly bid is $30 above NAMBA, then its premium will be $30 above the

BBP, and similarly if the bid is below the NAMBA (with the caveat that the premium is truncated

at zero). This scheme makes the consumer bear higher premiums at the margin, which contributes

to differences in premiums being important in consumer choice.

    Two types of beneficiaries do not pay the full cost of Part D coverage. Approximately 6.3

million dual-eligible Medicaid recipients were automatically enrolled in Part D in 2006, as were

an additional 2.2 million Low Income Subsidy (LIS) recipients. Premiums and OOP costs are

fully paid by the government for the former, while the latter receive steep discounts. Foreseeing
   2
     The added benefit typically takes the form of either additional coverage in the coverage gap, reduced copayments,
or coverage of certain drug types excluded from normal Part D coverage, such as cosmetic drugs and barbiturates.
Plan sponsors offering plans with enhanced coverage must also offer a basic plan within the same region, and sponsors
are prohibited from offering more than two enhanced plans in a given region. Enhanced plans do not receive higher
subsidies, and any incremental costs are paid entirely by enrollees.
   3
     Any costs of enhanced benefits in enhanced plans must be excluded at this stage.
   4
     CMS may not bargain with plans over their bids. The agency may disallow a bid if some aspect of the plan such
as the formulary or the actuarial equivalence does not follow regulations.
   5
     In 2006 the various plans were equally weighted, but from 2008 onwards the NAMBA slowly transitioned to an
enrollment weighted average.
   6
     The sum of the government subsidy and the beneficiary premium percentage is over 100% because part of the
government subsidy is used for plan reinsurance rather than as a direct subsidy to premiums.

that LIS enrollees might be less price sensitive than regular enrollees, the Part D regulations only

provide a full subsidy for LIS recipients who choose a plan with costs below the benchmark for their

region.7 If a plan loses benchmark status, its enrollees are automatically reassigned (equally across

qualifying plans) to a benchmark plan in their region unless they choose to opt out and pay the

cost difference themselves. Approximately 10% of enrollees in this category chose to opt out and

become active “choosers” in 2007-8 (Summer et al 2010). Although our demand model considers

only non-LIS enrollees who are not dual eligible, that paper suggests that LIS enrollees who opted

out behaved in a manner consistent with inattention, like the population we consider.8

       The participation of private sector insurers in this new program in 2006 was voluntary and

therefore uncertain. However, it turned out that many sponsors, both public and private, entered

the Part D market in 2006. There were 1429 PDP plans offered nationwide in 2006 (though this

had fallen to 1031 by 2013); every state had at least 27 PDPs every year during our sample period.

Enrollees select one of these plans during the open enrollment period each November to take effect

in the subsequent calendar year. The program includes many sources of aid for enrollees in making

these decisions. Most importantly, CMS has created a website called “Planfinder” that allows a

person to enter her zip code and any medications and see the plans in her area ranked according

to OOP costs. The website also enables prospective enrollees to estimate costs in each plan under

three health statuses (Poor/Good/Excellent), to estimate costs in standard benefit plans based

on total expenditures in the previous year, and to filter plans based on premiums, deductibles,

quality ratings and brand names. A Medicare help line connects the enrollee to a person who

can use the Planfinder website on behalf of the caller in order to locate a good choice. However,

conversations with CMS representatives suggest that very few enrollees make full use of the website.

Pharmacies, community service centers, and other advocates offer advice. Survey evidence (Kaiser

Family Foundation (2006), Greenwald and West (2007)) indicates that enrollees rely on friends and
   7
     For the first three years of the program, the benchmark was calculated as the equal-weighted mean basic PDP
plan premium in a region. In later years it was an enrollment-weighted mean. Because lower cost plans have more
enrollees, this policy change reduced the number of plans that qualified as benchmark over time.
   8
     Because carriers set a single premium for a plan that enrolls both LIS and non-LIS consumers, there may be
interactions between the two markets. For example, a strategy studied by Decarolis (2012) in the early years of Part
D involved cycling of plans. A sponsor would raise the price of an existing plan above the benchmark, but introduce
a new plan below the benchmark to catch auto-assigned LIS recipients, meanwhile keeping any choosers and other
enrollees in the original plan. We note that this cycling strategy was not used by all insurers, and declined over time.
For example, Summer et al (2010) report that by 2010, 92% of all auto-assignments were across corporate boundaries.
In the analysis below we find no evidence of this cycling behavior by plans in our New Jersey sample; we do not
attempt to account for it in our model of supply.

3    Literature Review: Consumer Demand

    The introduction of Part D immediately created a literature evaluating outcomes from the

novel program structure. An important early paper documenting that the elderly do not choose

optimally is that of Abaluck and Gruber (2011, hereafter AG). Using a subset of claims data from

2005 and 2006 and a similar methodology to our own, the authors show that only 12% of consumers

choose the lowest cost plan; on average, consumers in their sample could save 30% of their Part

D expenditure by switching to the cheapest plan. Consumers place a greater weight on premium

than expected OOP costs, don’t value risk reduction, and value certain plan characteristics well

beyond the way those characteristics influence their measure of expected costs. These results have

been largely corroborated by Heiss et al. (2013) and Ketcham et al. (2012) among others.

    Other studies have examined infrequent switching between plans as an explanation for inefficient

consumer choice in the Part D market. In a field experiment, Kling et al. (2012) show that

giving Part D consumers individualized information about which plans will generate the most

cost savings for them can raise plan switching by 11% (from 17% to 28%) and move more people

into low-cost plans. Ketcham et al. (2015) use administrative data through 2010 to show that

switching increases when more plans are available and that people become more responsive to

large increases in their plans’ costs over time. Polyakova (2016) estimates a model of plan choice

featuring consumer switching costs and adverse selection, with unobservably riskier beneficiaries

choosing more comprehensive coverage. She uses the model to simulate the effect of closing of the

coverage gap on adverse selection and finds that switching costs inhibit the capacity of the regulation

to eliminate sorting on risk. The presence of switching costs and consumer choice frictions has been

documented in other health insurance markets by Handel (2013) among others.

    Abaluck and Gruber followed up their results with a study of how enrollees’ choices varied

across the first four years of Part D (Abaluck and Gruber (2013), hereafter AG13). AG13 finds

that consumers continue to make significant mistakes and that there is no measurable learning

over time in their national sample. These findings are consistent with the estimates from our New

Jersey sample. In both sets of results consumers continue to be extremely sensitive to premiums.


                                                  10
The empirical specification in AG13 is more reduced form than our model, but the two papers

estimate similar levels of welfare loss from inertia. AG13 controls for brand fixed effects but still

finds a strong role for inertia, concluding “rather than reflecting persistent unobserved factors of

chosen plans, [inertia] reflect[s] either adjustment costs or inattention.” Our paper explores the

inattention hypothesis in more detail. Our specification separately models consumer inattention,

consumer valuation of the insurer’s brand, and also persistent unobserved heterogeneity in prefer-

ences for a particular product. We continue to find an empirical role for inattention even in this

more sophisticated choice environment. AG13 concludes that choice inconsistencies are “driven

by changes on the supply side that are not offset both because of inertia and because non-inertial

consumers still make inconsistent choices.” By modeling the supply side, as we do in this paper,

we can simulate how insurers will set premiums in response to changing consumer attention. This

step has received very little attention in the Part D literature. Ketcham, Kuminoff and Powers

(2016) predict the impact of various policies to reduce the impact of choice imperfections in Part

D, for example by reducing the size of the choice set, but they assume plan premium adjustments

are designed to maintain the net revenue per enrollee that they earned prior to the policy. This

assumption does not capture the impact of consumer inattention on plan markups that is the focus

of this paper.

   There is a great deal of research in both psychology and economics literatures on consumer

search and choice. Iyengar and Kamenica (2010) provide evidence that more options result in

consumers making worse choices. In contrast to the prediction of a standard neoclassical model,

more choice may not improve consumer welfare if it confuses consumers and leads them to seek

simplicity. A large literature studies the importance of information processing costs to explain

deviations from the choices expected of computationally unconstrained agents (see Sims (2003)

and Reis (2006) for examples). Models of consumer search with learning, where each consumer

uses the observed price of a single product to infer the prices likely to be set by other firms, also

indicate that consumers may incur excessive costs by searching either too little or too much (e.g.

Cabral and Fishman (2012)). Agarwal et al.(2009) show that the ability to make sound financial

decisions declines with age. Because Part D enrollees are either disabled or elderly, and seem likely

to experience cognitive costs of processing information, it may be reasonable to expect less optimal

behavior from Part D consumers than from the population as a whole. These types of results

                                                 11
have led some critics of Part D to call for CMS to limit the number of plans available to seniors.

On the other hand, using data on private-sector health insurance, Dafny et al. (2013) show that

most employers offer very few choices to their employees and that employees would greatly value

additional options. Moreover the results from Stocking et al. (2014) suggest that merely limiting

the number of available plans would not be sufficient, as this would limit competition and lead to

higher prices. Thus while the difficulty of choosing an insurance plan may lead consumers to choose

expensive plans, it is not clear that limiting the range of options is the correct policy response.

    Other authors have found evidence for inattention or lack of comparison shopping in complex

and infrequent purchase decisions. In the auto insurance market, Honka (2014) finds that consumers

face substantial switching costs, leading them to change plans infrequently, and that search costs

lead those who switch to collect quotes from a relatively small number of insurers. Sallee (2014)

uses the idea of rational inattention to explain why consumers under-weight energy efficiency when

purchasing durable goods. Busse et al. (2010) find that consumers are inattentive and use a limited

number of “cues” such as price promotions and mileage thresholds to evaluate auto purchases rather

than actual prices and qualities. Luco (2016) and Illanes (2016) consider switching costs and firm

competition in retirement investment choices. Hortaçsu et al (2015) examine consumer choices

and switching behavior among retail electricity suppliers in Texas and conclude that high search

frictions lead to a high market share for the incumbent supplier.



4    Dynamics and Pricing Responses

     Farrell and Klemperer (2007) surveys the substantial theoretical literature considering the

effects of consumer switching costs and other sources of inertia on firm competition and pricing.

There are two sets of results: the first relates to price changes over time while the second considers

steady state price levels. We discuss both here but focus on the latter in our estimation.

    Papers such as Klemperer (1987) and Klemperer (1995) argue that, if firms cannot commit

to future prices, consumer switching costs provide an incentive to “invest” and then “harvest”.

“Investing” is the process of building up market share through low prices in order to increase

future profits, while “harvesting” is the process of reaping those profits by raising prices on an

installed base. If the market begins in some particular period (as in 2006 for Medicare Part D),


                                                 12
and all consumers have zero switching costs in that period, one might expect to see low initial prices

and then price increases over time as the incentive to harvest the installed base increases relative to

the incentive to attract new market entrants. In the longer term, once the market reaches steady

state, multiple possible pricing patterns could emerge. If firms cannot discriminate between cohorts

of consumers (as in the Part D application), new firms may choose a single price that is attractive

to new consumers, and thereby effectively specialize in selling to new customers. Firms with old

locked-in customers will choose a single price that is higher, and effectively specialize in selling only

to old consumers, leading to cycling (Farrell and Klemperer 2007). Alternatively, a firm may hold a

“sale” in a particular period to attract new customers, while other firms pursue the same strategy

in possibly different periods (Farrell and Shapiro 1988, Padilla 1995).

   Several prior empirical studies have investigated the evidence for these dynamic pricing patterns

in the presence of choice frictions. Ericson (2012) and Ericson (2014) analyze the insurer’s problem

in Medicare Part D and show that firms initially set relatively low prices for newly introduced plans,

but then raise prices as plans age, consistent with the “invest then harvest” dynamic. Similar

questions have been studied empirically in other markets, e.g. by Miller (2014) in the case of

Medicare Advantage, and Cebul et al (2011) in commercial health insurance. Decarolis (2015) and

Decarolis et al (2014) also study the supply side of the Part D market paying particular attention

to the interaction of low-income subsidy and other enrollees.

   We show below that premium trends in the data are consistent with the predictions of these

models: premiums increase substantially between 2006-2009, and they increase particularly for the

plans with the greatest incentive to harvest their installed base (those with the greatest number of

enrollees and in years with the smallest number of new entrants aging into Part D). However we do

not explicitly model price dynamics and our counterfactual analyses do not predict price patterns

over time. Instead our simulations utilize the predictions of theoretical papers that analyze the

impact of switching costs on price levels.

   Beggs and Klemperer (1992) examine a no-sale equilibrium of an infinite-period duopoly model

with consumer switching costs, in which in every period new consumers arrive and a fraction of old

consumers leaves. Firms cannot discriminate between these groups of consumers. Consumers are

forward-looking and firms make dynamic profit-maximizing pricing decisions. Under the assump-

tion that switching costs are sufficiently large that old consumers are locked into the product they

                                                   13
have previously bought, there is a steady state Markov perfect equilibrium where firm prices are

higher than in the model without switching costs.9 The intuition is that consumer lock-in gives

the firm effective market power over some portion of consumers, which implies a price increase

relative to the case with no switching costs. A similar intuition is provided in Radner (2003) which

considers a model of “viscous demand”, i.e. where demand adjusts slowly to changes in prices.

This viscosity provides the firm with a kind of market power as it can raise its price above that of

competitors without immediately losing all of its customers. In the homogenous product duopoly

case there is a family of Nash equilibria where, once firms have achieved their target market shares

and the total target market penetration, they both charge a price equal to consumers’ willingness to

pay (similar to a collusive outcome, with prices strictly greater than the equilibrium price without

viscosity).

       Farrell and Klemperer (2007) summarize these models, and other related papers, and conclude

that there is a “strong presumption” that switching costs make markets less competitive, i.e. lead

to increased equilibrium prices.10 Moreover, our setting has an additional feature that reinforces

this conclusion. We find that consumer inertia in the Part D setting is caused by inattention (or

asymmetric search costs) rather than switching costs of the conventional type. Because incumbent

enrollees in a particular plan will only rarely notice other plans’ prices, the incentive for firms to

reduce prices in order to attract consumers from competitors (“invest”) is small compared to a

model with conventional switching costs. The intuition in Beggs and Klemperer (1992) is therefore

likely to hold in the Part D context: equilibrium prices are likely to be higher than in the case

without consumer inattention.11

       Our counterfactual analyses investigate the magnitude of the steady state price increases likely
   9
      The authors note that the results will also hold if there is a startup cost K of trying a brand and K 0 of switching
to a new brand, for K, K 0 sufficiently large.
   10
      Work such as Dube, Hitsch and Rossi (2008) shows that this result may not hold in cases where a firm’s incumbent
customers are not fully locked into a single firm. That paper solves and/or simulates several simplified versions of
a model with differentiated products, consumer switching costs and imperfect lock-in. The authors show that as
switching costs grow, equilibrium prices first fall and then increase relative to the case with no switching costs. The
intuition is that with low switching costs the incentive for a firm to invest in future loyalty, and attract consumers
from its competitors, by lowering current prices can dominate the incentive to harvest. The competitor anticipates
this and lowers its price to prevent the customer from switching. This effect is much less relevant for our setting
because inattention is unlike other switching costs. Inattentive consumers do not notice a lower price and therefore
cannot be attracted by it.
   11
      The papers on consumer search and learning referenced above (e.g. Cabral and Fishman (2012)) also consider how
firms price in response to consumer search. They contain similar intuition and make the point that the equilibrium
outcome for prices depends on the size of the search cost relative to the variation in firm costs of production.



                                                           14
to be generated by inattention given our estimated model. We abstract from firm dynamic choices.

We are interested in the steady state pricing of a marketplace of plans selling to fully attentive

consumers compared to one pricing to inattentive consumers. We argue, following the intuition

in Beggs and Klemperer (1992) and related papers, that the existence of inattentive enrollees

has the effect of reducing the average elasticity faced by insurers. The true elasticity of any

consumer’s demand does not change, but a fraction of consumers is inattentive and therefore

behaves inelastically. This group does not switch plans in response to a price increase and therefore

lowers the effective insurer elasticity of demand. We use this insight to generate a range of estimates

of the premium effect of inattention.



5    Data

    Our primary data source, provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),

contains information on prescriptions and plan choices for Part D enrollees from New Jersey in

2006-9. Our data consist only of enrollees who did not have LIS status at any time and who were

enrolled in stand-alone PDPs, rather than MA plans. Limiting the study to these enrollees reduced

the population size from all New Jersey enrollees in PDP plans, of which there were between 527,000

and 545,000 from 2006 to 2009, to between 300,000 and 325,000 over the same time period. We

chose New Jersey partially because it had a very low percentage of MA-PD enrollees compared to

the national average—18-20% of NJ enrollees were in MA-PD plans compared to a national average

of 32-38%—and because the total number of enrollees that met our criteria was not far above the

CMS cutoff of 250,000. From this subpopulation we drew a random sample in 2006 and a random

sample of new enrollees in 2007-9 to bring the total sample up to 250,000 enrollees. We limited the

sample to unsubsidized PDP enrollees in order to focus on a setting where consumers had to pay

the listed price for every plan and where plans had relatively standardized quality (not the case for

MA-PD plans which include medical as well as pharmacy benefits). Details of the data cleaning

procedure are provided in the Appendix.

    Appendix Table 2 shows the number of enrollees in our dataset each year, ranging from 127,000

in the first year of the program up to 160,000 in 2009. Just over 60% of enrollees are female, and

about 90% are white. The breakdown by age group is also shown in the table. Over our sample


                                                  15
period the entering cohort, ages 65-69, grows in size from under 20% to almost 28% of the sample.12

Because we have data from four years of the program we can study the behavior of enrollees who

have different numbers of years’ experience in Part D. About 10% of each cohort leaves the program

each year, and between 27,000 and 30,000 new enrollees enter each year.

       The average quality of PDP plans nationally, as measured by the proportion of the 117 most-

commonly prescribed chemical compounds covered by the plan, rises over time from 51% to 80%.

Appendix Table 3 summarizes the variation in this measure of quality across plans and over time.

When weighted by enrollment we see that consumers are slightly more likely to choose plans that

include more drugs: the enrollment-weighted average coverage begins at 59% and rises to 82% by

2009. Our demand model accounts for this issue through consumers’ expected out-of-pocket pay-

ments and through brand fixed effects and enhanced plan-year interactions.13 Preferred pharmacy

networks—which are not observed in our data—were not a significant factor during our time period.

The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that only 6% of enrollees had a preferred pharmacy network

in 2011, though they became popular shortly after that and expanded to 72% of enrollees by 2014.

       For each enrollee, we estimate counterfactual costs in each plan (after discarding very small

plans) holding consumption constant. While Einav et al (2015) have shown that moral hazard

affects an enrollee’s drug consumption and, in addition, an enrollee might be elastic across ther-

apeutic substitutes when she changes plans, dealing with these issues is beyond the scope of the

current paper. We follow the existing literature in our calculation of counterfactual costs. Our

methodology, described in detail in section 2 of the Appendix, combines elements of the techniques

used in AG (2011) and Ketcham et al. (2012). First we asked a physician to classify drugs as either

chronic (taken regularly over a prolonged period) or acute (all other). We assume that chronic

drug consumption is perfectly predicted by the patient and calculate the total underlying drug cost

for each enrollee of the observed chronic drug prescriptions. For acute drugs, as in AG (2011) we
  12
     It may be that over time employers and their about-to-be-retired employees no longer make other arrangements
for pharmaceutical coverage, but build in to the employee benefit that he or she will use Part D. An evolution of this
type would cause the flow rate into Part D at retirement to increase over time.
  13
     One other dimension of quality that consumers might care about is customer service. CMS has a star rating
system for enrollees to rate plans (with 3-5 stars available in each of 11-19 categories). Appendix Table 3 indicates
that consumers may prefer higher-rated plans. However, the method used to assign star ratings changed dramatically
between 2007 and 2008, making comparison between the 2006-2007 and 2008-2009 period difficult. There is evidence
in prior papers that utilization management varies over time and across plans. The weighted average use of prior
authorization for expensive drugs is 22% in 2014 (Hoadley et al 2014). We do not observe this in our data; it is
captured in the brand and enhanced plan-by-year fixed effects in our utility equation.



                                                         16
assign each individual to a group of ex-ante “similar” individuals and assume that the consumer

expects to incur a total per-month underlying drug cost equal to the median within her group.

Following Ketcham et al. (2012), we then apply each plan’s coverage terms (deductible, copayment

or coinsurance rate on each tier, gap coverage) to each individual and use his or her predicted total

(chronic plus acute) monthly drug costs to predict total out-of-pocket (OOP) spending given these

terms. This procedure yields estimates which closely track those we observe in the data for chosen

plans. While we expect there to be very little measurement error in the chronic OOP spending

variable, as this is derived from observed utilization, there may be some measurement error in the

acute OOP spending variable. Hence in much of the analysis we treat these variables separately.



6         The Behavior of Part D Enrollees

In this section we explore the implications of the data for consumers’ plan choice behavior. Further

details and analyses are provided in section 3 of the Appendix. Table 4 of that Appendix reports

enrollee switching rates by demographic group in each of the observed open enrollment periods.

From 2006-7 a total of 19% of enrollees switch plans; this increases to 24% in 2007-8 but falls

to 8% in 2008-9.14 In every year, women and non-whites are more likely to switch plans than

other enrollees. The probability of switching increases monotonically with age. We create a group

of those under-65 but eligible for Medicare due to disability. This group is similar in switching

behavior to the 85+ group. The switching probability also decreases monotonically with income15 .

         We define the gap in payment as the expected OOP payment (including premium) in the chosen

plan less the minimum expected OOP payment in any other plan in the choice set. We refer to this

payment gap as “overspending” or gap spending. We note that, if consumers have preferences for

non-price characteristics, these may lead them to choose a plan other than the cheapest available;

such a choice would not be an “error” and therefore the term we use in the paper is “overspending”.

Table 1 summarizes the level of overspending by year in our sample16 .

         In 2006, the first year of the program, the average amount paid above the minimum expected
    14
     There are consumers who “passively” switch in the sense that the firm retires their plan and automatically moves
them into a different plan run by the same firm, and we do not count these as switches.
  15
     Income is measured as the median value in the enrollee’s census tract; see Appendix for details.
  16
     We include both chronic and acute payments in our measure of OOP spending; the qualitatitive results change
very little when we exclude acute spending.



                                                         17
OOP payment available to the enrollee, including premium, was $425.37, or 37% of the OOP

payments. The percent and dollar amounts both fell in 2007 but then increased in both 2008 and

2009, to a level of $436.96 or 36% of total spending in the final year of our sample. Thus high

spending is not declining over time in our sample. The data also indicate that part of the spending

gap results from enrollees opting not to switch plans. Appendix Table 5 demonstrates that the

spending gap is lower for consumers who have just switched plans, while it increases over time for

non-switchers. Appendix Table 6 shows that by 2009, over a quarter of switchers spent less than

110% of the cost of their estimated lowest-cost plan, while only 4% of those not switching achieved

this.

       One potential explanation for this behavior, which has been explored in numerous papers in this

and other settings, is that consumers face switching costs which lead to inertia. If switching costs

were important, the consumers choosing to switch would be those for whom the value of switching

was high enough to compensate them for these costs. Our data appear consistent with this idea. On

average over all years and plans, switchers would overspend relative to the minimum-cost plan by

$524 if they remained in their current plan, while the figure for non-switchers is $338 on average.17

We decompose this difference in next year’s overspending between switchers (if they remained in

the current plan) and non-switchers, for each year 2006-2008, into five categories: overspending

in the current year, the increase in the current plan’s premium and in its predicted out-of-pocket

cost (TrOOP) relative to the current year, and the reduction in the lowest-cost plan’s premium

and in its predicted TrOOP relative to the current year18 . We report this decomposition, by base

year, in Table 2, where a positive number indicates a larger contribution towards overspending

for switchers than for non-switchers. The decomposition is illuminating. While the proportions

differ over time, in two out of three years over 55% of the difference between switchers’ and non-

switchers’ overspending if they remain in the current plan comes from changes in their current

plan’s premium.19 In other words, a key distinguishing feature of switchers is not just that their

value of switching plans is high, but that they also receive a signal of this fact in the form of a large

increase in their current plan’s premium.
  17
      We exclude enrollees who enter or exit the program the following year from this analysis.
  18
      Throughout the paper, TrOOP refers to “true out of pocket costs”, or OOP costs excluding premium, while OOP
is the equivalent figure including premium.
   19
      In the first year of the sample, the dominant factor is that switchers have larger errors in the current year than
non-switchers.


                                                          18
       Given these findings, we propose a slightly different explanation for the infrequent switching

observed in the data. Rather than facing switching costs, consumers may be inattentive and in the

absence of highly visible “prompts” may simply roll-over their current plan choice. We argue in

section 4 of the Appendix that this behavior can be generated by a model where consumers have a

cost of obtaining and processing information regarding alternative plan options and choose to incur

this cost only when prompted by “cues” or “shocks” that are freely observed.

       We investigate this hypothesis by considering three shocks to the consumer’s own characteristics

that could prompt her to incur the costs of search: two types of bad news concerning her current

plan’s characteristics for next year (the plan’s premium will rise or coverage will fall noticeably) and

an unusually high OOP payment driven by a health shock. We define a shock to premiums in the

enrollee’s current plan (vp ) as a premium increase of more than the weighted median increase in the

relevant year. A coverage shock (vc ) is defined as the plan dropping coverage in the coverage gap or

moving from the defined standard benefit to a different (tiered) system in the Pre-ICL phase. An

enrollee is defined as having an acute shock (vh ) when she is in the top quintile of total drug cost

as well as the top decile of either percent spending on acute drugs or deviation between predicted

and observed spending. The distribution of these shocks in the population and their correlation

with the decision to switch plans are shown in Table 3.20 These three shocks appear to explain

switching behavior well. Those who receive no shocks switch very infrequently, only 4% of the

time, while those who receive multiple shocks are much more likely to switch plans21 . Almost all

switchers (87%) receive some shock in the year of the switch.

       We present further evidence in support of consumer inattention in the Appendix. In particular,

Appendix Table 7 sets out probit regressions of decision to switch plans on own-plan, low-cost plan

and personal characteristics. The estimates suggest that consumers’ switching probabilities increase

when their own plans’ premiums and OOP costs rise, but we find no evidence that consumers

respond to changes in premiums and costs for the lowest-cost plan available, the lowest-cost plan

within-brand, or the average of the five lowest-cost plans.
  20
     The acute shock has a cross-year correlation of around .5, which is considerably lower than the cross-year corre-
lation of other measures of sickness. Total spending, total supply, and acute supply each have a cross-year correlation
between .8 and .9, implying that the acute shock is substantially less persistent than underlying health status.
  21
     These findings are corroborated by Hoadley et al. (2013), who find that premium increases and removal of gap
coverage are the best predictors of switching behavior.




                                                          19
Consumer Demand Model

We specify a simple two-stage model of consumer decision-making with inattention. We assume

that each consumer i, once enrolled in a plan, ignores the choice problem until hit by a shock to the

OOP costs of her current plan or to her health. We consider the same three shocks vp , vc , vh defined

above; these are assumed to have additively separable effects on her decision to re-optimize her plan

choice. Additionally, the consumer could simply receive a random shock that causes awareness, for

example from a younger relative visiting the consumer and reviewing her plan choices. We label

this shock ve . The sum of these shocks creates a composite shock received by consumer i at time t:


                              vi,t = vi,p,t β1 + vi,c,t β2 + vi,h,t β3 + vi,e,t                   (1)


where the weights β allow the different shocks to have different effects on the propensity to search

(for example shocks to premiums may increase the likelihood of switching more than other shocks).

   When the composite shock vi,t is large enough, i.e. when:


                                                vi,t ≥ ṽi,t ,                                    (2)


then the consumer becomes aware and decides to re-optimize her plan election. Here ṽi,t is a

function of consumer demographics related to health status and sensitivity to changes in plan

characteristics: age groups, income quartiles, gender and race. We also include year fixed effects

in ṽi,t to account for differences in the environment (e.g. advertising, phyarmacy and government

outreach) across our three different enrollment periods.

   The second stage of the model examines how consumers who have decided to re-optimize choose

whether to switch and to which plans. We assume that, once aware, consumer i makes a choice

from the full choice set (including her current plan) based on the following utility from choosing

plan j in year t:


                            ˆ
                ui,j,t = T rOOP i,j,t β1 + P remiumj,t [β2,1 + vi,p,t β2,2 ] + Dedj,t β3,1

                       + Gapj,t [β4,1 + vi,c,t β4,2 + vi,h,t β4,3 ] + Xj,t β5,i + i,j,t

                       = δi,j,t + i,j,t                                                          (3)


                                                      20
                                                          ˆ
where expected chronic OOP spending excluding premium (T rOOP i,j,t ) is calculated using the

method described above, P remiumj,t and Dedj,t are annual premiums and deductibles and Gapj,t

is an indicator for any coverage in the gap. Xj,t are non-price plan characteristics including brand

fixed effects (defined at the carrier rather than the plan level) and an indicator for enhanced plans

interacted with year fixed effects, and i,j,t is an IID extreme value type 1 error term (assumed to

be independent of vi,e,t ). We allow consumers prompted to search by shocks to premiums to place

additional weight on premiums. Consumers experiencing shocks to coverage, or acute shocks, are

permitted to place additional weight on the plan offering gap coverage.

    We model persistent unobserved preference heterogeneity by including normally-distributed

random coefficients β5,i on fixed effects for the three dominant brands, which together have over

80% market share in 2006, and on the enhanced plan fixed effect. The model therefore allows choice

persistence (such as a lack of switching away from a particular plan even when other plans reduce

their premiums) to be caused either by heterogeneous preferences (some consumers have a very

strong valuation for this brand that makes it worthwhile to remain enrolled even at a high relative

price) or by inattention (consumers who are not affected by any of the previously-defined shocks

are unaware of other plan premium reductions).

    The model is estimated using a random coefficients simulated maximum likelihood approach

similar to that summarized in Train (2009). The likelihood function for each enrollee is predicted

for a sequence of choices from entry into the Part D program until the end of our data panel. A full

description of the empirical model is provided in the Appendix, where we also present estimates of

the demand parameters. In all specifications, consistent with a model of intattention, the estimates

indicate that consumers are significantly more likely to switch plans after receiving premium or

coverage shocks or having an acute shock to their health. We now turn to the emphasis of the

paper, an analysis of firm behavior in the Part D marketplace.



7    The Supply Side of the Part D Market

The New Jersey Part D Market

    We begin with an overview of the supply side of the Part D market using a dataset of Part D

plans generously provided by Francesco Decarolis (Decarolis (2015)) that comprises CMS files on


                                                 21
plans, ownership, enrollment, premiums, formularies, and other characteristics. It covers all plans

in all regions of the US for the years 2006-2012.22 We focus on stand alone Part D PDPs in New

Jersey, as these are the plans which serve the consumers modeled in the previous section.

       There were 44 PDP plans active in New Jersey in 2006, the first year of the Part D program; this

is in line with an average of 42.2 plans per region nationwide. The New Jersey market is quite highly

concentrated in every year of our data: measured in terms of enrollees, the 4-firm concentration

ratio begins at 0.862, declines to .617 in 2008 and rises again to .753 by 2012. Herfindahl indices

show the same pattern. Our data agreement does not allow us to provide names for the large plans

in our data. However, a table containing publicly available CMS information on the names and

market shares of the five largest PDP plans in New Jersey in 2006, together with their brands, is

provided in Appendix Table 13. There was little change in the rankings of these top five plans over

the period of our data23 .

       There was some plan entry in New Jersey in the first several years of the program but subsequent

entry was limited. A total of 19 plans entered in 2007, joining 36 continuing from 2006, and 9

others entered in 2008, but from 2009 to 2012 no more than 3 plans entered in any year. After

2008 plan attrition reduced the number of active firms in every year from 57 down to 30 by 2012.

Enhanced plans proliferated in the first few years of the program, going from 17 plans with a

combined 12% market share in 2006 to 27 plans with a combined 31% market share in 2009. This

coincided with a near-continuous shift away from Defined Standard Benefit plans; by 2012, only 3

such plans remained in the market, down from 8 in 2007. These statistics, presented in Table 4,

suggest an oligopolistic market characterized by increasing product differentiation and increasing

concentration.


Insurer Pricing Strategies

       We now consider the effect of consumer inattention, coupled with product differentiation and

imperfect competition, on insurer pricing strategies in the Part D marketplace. We assume, as is

traditional in industrial organization research, that insurers have rational expectations and are able

to study the market in advance and choose an optimal strategy. We focus on the insurer’s choice
  22
    See Decarolis (2015) for a detailed description of the data.
  23
    The market shares listed in Table 4 and Appendix Table 13 are slightly different from the shares of the plans in
the data used for our analysis, because as noted in the Appendix, we drop very small plans from our sample.


                                                        22
of premium. This is partly because the premium is the most important characteristic for consumer

choice. It is also the metric CMS uses to approve plans and calculate each region’s benchmark.

Other aspects of the plan’s strategy such as the design of the formulary (which as noted is quite

tightly regulated) or gap coverage options are important areas for research (see for example Carey

(2016), Einav et al (2016) and Lavetti and Simon (2016)) but are beyond the scope of the current

paper.

   One would expect a profit-maximizing insurer to set its premiums in a way that took advantage

of consumer choice frictions. In this section we show that the patterns in the data are consistent

with this intuition. Consider first price dispersion. Varian (1980) features search in an environment

of a homogeneous product, multiple sellers, and heterogeneous consumers. In this model, consumers

do not engage in sequential search but rather “become informed” (perhaps by paying a cost) and

at that point know all prices. This model fits the situation where a consumer who has experienced

a shock decides to re-optimize her plan choice, enters her ZIP code and medications in the Part D

website, and then has access to all firms and prices. The equilibrium symmetric outcome of Varian’s

model is price dispersion, which we certainly see in the Part D marketplace. In particular, Defined

Standard Benefit plans are so tightly regulated as to represent a nearly homogeneous product.

Each plan offers exactly the same financial tariff and any given medicine is exactly the same in

each plan. The plans differ by formulary, customer service, and brand. Different formularies will

create differences in expected costs across individuals, but formularies are regulated by CMS to

ensure that every therapeutic category has sufficient coverage and utilization management tools

are appropriate – so the average value of each plan will be similar. Nevertheless, Table 14 in the

Appendix shows that price dispersion persists among Defined Standard Benefit plans. Though

the difference between the minimum and maximum premium is falling over time, there is still

considerable variation in the cost of this close-to-homogeneous product by 2012.

   As discussed in Section 4, consumer inertia is likely to have the effect of increasing equilbrium

price levels and creating an upward slope to prices. The upward trend may not be a steady-state

phenomenon; it occurs because the entire market begins in 2006. Thus every plan faces only

elastic choosers in that year and no locked in base. Table 5 shows that, consistent with these

predictions, premiums increase on average almost every year from 2007-12. The average annual

premium increase for basic plans (weighted by enrollment) is small, less than $6 per month in every

                                                 23
year. Premiums for enhanced plans increase more quickly; in 2008, the weighted-average premium

increase for enhanced plans is over $14 per month, and in 2011 and 2012 smaller enhanced plans

post large premium increases. The second panel of Table 5 flags plans that raise premiums by more

than $10. For three years from 2008 to 2010, at least a third of enrollees in enhanced plans face

large premium shocks, although the rate is lower in other years.

       We can also use the intuition from the theory to predict differences in premium growth across

insurers. First, the change in profit for a given change in price is a function of both the intensive

margin (profit per enrollee) and the extensive margin (number of enrollees). Because larger firms

have a larger intensive margin, we should expect large firms to raise prices more than smaller firms

all else equal. Second, we should expect slower premium growth when the number of consumers

purchasing for the first time is high relative to the size of the installed base. Thus premiums should

rise more slowly in years with high attrition (e.g. high death rates) or large cohorts aging into the

Part D program.24 We estimate regressions of annual premium increases on lagged market shares,

growth rates, and other plan variables that might affect costs for all PDP plans in the national

dataset.

       Table 6 reports the results of the main specification. When we control for region and carrier

fixed effects and coverage variables that may affect costs, lagged market shares significantly predict

future increases in premiums, providing evidence in support of the first hypothesis. The estimates

also indicate that the growth rate of enrollment in the region, which we treat as a proxy for new

Part D enrollment, is negatively associated with price increases. This result provides evidence

for the second hypothesis, that price increases should be small when there are relatively more

unattached consumers to compete for. Taken together, the results of these regressions provide

evidence consistent with the theory relating to price trends.

       A further issue is that firms can sponsor more than one plan to offer more than one price. The

work of Ericson (2012) and Decarolis (2015) leads us to investigate whether there is evidence of

segmentation of consumers and price discrimination. In particular, the entry of basic “sister” plans

may allow an existing plan to convert to enhanced status and raise its premium. The low-priced

sister plan could enable the insurer to attract some enrollees who are auto assigned, or actively
  24
    Because of our focus on shocks to consumers’ attention and the dynamics of pricing, we do not estimate our
motivating regression in levels like Polyakova (2016), but rather in premium changes. It is the increase in price that
becomes more lucrative with an increase in installed base.


                                                         24
switch, to a low-priced plan. If carriers engage in this kind of consumer segmentation and “cycling”,

we should see higher premium growth of an existing plan when a new plan is added to the carrier’s

portfolio. The results of specifications including indicators for “sister” plan entry are provided in

Appendix Table 15. We consider the impact of adding any “sister” plan and also the effect of

adding a low-cost option: a plan whose premium is the lowest offered by the relevant carrier in the

market. In both specifications, the relevant coefficient is negative and significant, implying that on

average plan premiums actually fall when a sister plan is introduced. These estimates suggest that,

in contrast to Ericson (2012) and Decarolis (2015), in our sample premiums do not increase more

than average when the carrier adds a new plan to the portfolio. We will not model this cycling

behavior in the simulations below.


Insurer Cost Estimates

    Our next step is to use accounting data (our claims data from New Jersey) to estimate each

plan’s average cost per enrollee. These costs will be used as an input to the counterfactual premium

simulations in the following section.

    The claims data indicate the gross drug cost for every claim, including the drug ingredient cost

plus the dispensing fee and sales tax paid to the pharmacy, but not accounting for manufacturer

rebates or plan administrative costs. For each branded drug we find the average gross drug cost of a

thirty-day supply across all plans and all encounters in the relevant year and apply a 20% rebate to

that average cost. For generic drugs we assume a $4 cost per 30 day supply for all plans25 . We use

these figures, and the observed drug utilization for each enrollee, to predict an average drug cost

net of rebates per enrollee per year. Our methodology also accounts for the fact that, as part of

its risk-adjustment strategy, the government covers 80% of all drug costs in the catastrophic phase

so that the plan pays at most 20% of these costs.26 We reduce the effect of outliers by winsorizing

the estimated per-person costs at the 2.5% level (i.e. replacing the top and bottom 2.5% with the

2.5th and 97.5th percentile, respectively). We then compute the average per-person drug cost of the
  25
     A study by the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General (Levinson (2011)) found that, in
2009, rebates reduced Part D drug expenditures by 19% on average for the 100 highest-volume brand name drugs.
Our assumption regarding generic drug costs is based on Walmart’s well known “$4 for any generic prescription”
program.
  26
     In most cases the beneficary pays a 5% copay in the catastrophic phase, so for branded drug events we assume
the plan pays 15%. Fewer than 5% of enrollees reach this phase so this has little effect on predicted plan costs.



                                                       25
plan’s beneficiaries.

      We expect these cost estimates to be fairly accurate for several reasons. The cost of generics

and average branded discounts are unlikely to vary across plans as they might in a less regulated

market. Because formularies in Part D are highly regulated (e.g. the protected classes must contain

substantially all drugs in the class and other classes must have a certain number of drugs covered)

and may not be designed to drive away sick enrollees, plans cannot differ substantially in the

“tightness” of their formularies – and this tightness is what determines elasticity and therefore the

size of a brand rebate (Duggan and Scott Morton, 2010). Furthermore, we know exactly which

drugs, and how many units of each, were dispensed by each plan.

      Finally we need to account for plan administrative costs. Sullivan (2013) notes that the National

Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) includes the administrative costs of Medicare Advantage

plans and Part D plans in its report of total Medicare administrative costs. We use this fact, and

data from the NHEA for 2006-2010, to back out administrative expenses of 14-16% of total costs

- or 16-19% of non-administrative costs - for Parts C and D combined. We therefore inflate the

estimated average plan-level drug cost per enrollee per year by 120% to account for administrative

costs. Additional details on the construction of the cost estimates is provided in section 5 of the

Appendix.

      The resulting plan costs per enrollee are summarized in Table 7. We report weighted averages

and standard deviations of both the total cost per enrollee and the estimated cost net of enrollee

out-of-pocket payments27 . The latter will be the cost variable used as an input into the premium-

setting simulations below. Finally we report for comparison the weighted average observed bid and

observed premium separately for each year of our data. Observed bids are about $10 lower than

predicted costs net of TrOOP on average in 2006, the first year of the program. Observed bids fall

slightly in the second year, and this together with an increase in estimated costs implies a lower

average markup. Bids increase much faster than predicted costs in the following two years.

      The plan markup does not equal the bid less the cost and for this reason we do not report a

markup estimate based on these data. Plan revenues also include an additional premium amount

for enhanced plans plus reinsurance payments from CMS. The plan profit equation in Section 8

provides more details of these elements of revenue. For now we note that the estimates in Table
 27
      We truncate the plan-level average cost net of OOP payments at zero; this step involves only a few plans.

7 clearly indicate that plan margins did not converge towards zero over the first few years of the

program.



8    Counterfactual Simulations

    Previous studies have considered the effects of various interventions designed to ease the decision-

making process at fixed prices. For example, in a randomized experiment, Kling et al. (2012)

provide information to Part D enrollees regarding their best plan choice, and find that it increases

the probability of switching by 11 percentage points. Abaluck and Gruber (2013) predict that if

an intervention could make consumers fully informed and fully rational, they would choose plans

that reduced their costs by about 27%. However these papers do not account for plans repricing

in response to changes in consumer behavior, potentially further lowering program costs. In this

section we use the estimated demand model and our measure of firm costs per enrollee as inputs

to counterfactual analyses. We calculate how insurer markups respond to consumer behavior.

    We investigate the magnitude of the steady state price increases likely to be generated by

inattention given our estimated model. Note first that while the firm pricing problem in the

observed data is dynamic, the dynamics come from the opening of the market and from the forward-

looking choices of firms who anticipate future consumers will be “sticky” so that prices chosen in

one period affect enrollment in future periods. We abstract away from these dynamic pricing issues

in the simulation in order to compare steady states. We argue that the change in steady state

outcomes is of most policy relevance for a program that is long-lived. We assume in our demand

model that attentive consumers are not forward-looking or strategic; rather, they choose the plan

they most prefer today based on today’s characteristics. (This seems very likely given what we

know about the sophistication of these consumers and their uncertainty about how the market

will develop in the future.) This estimation therefore yields preference parameters that are valid

representations of consumer behavior, regardless of the strategy the firms may be pursuing. We can

then use these preference parameters combined with our cost data to generate a variety of different

static equilibrium markups, corresponding to different levels of inattention and hence different

premium elasticities, using a simple system of static first-order conditions. We consider only non-

LIS enrollees and focus on the simple situation where consumer preferences are not affected by


                                                  27
shocks experienced in the previous year.

       We focus on the premium markup for several reasons. First, the results of Abaluck and Gruber

and others indicate that consumers choose poorly in this marketplace and are unable to properly

weight attributes of a plan such as out of pocket costs and deductibles. Consumers often choose

plans based largely on the premium. Our demand estimates are consistent with this finding, im-

plying that removing inattention (without addressing other choice frictions) would affect consumer

sensitivity to premiums much more than their response to out of pocket costs. That is, we focus on

the plan characteristic that is most likely to respond to the removal of inattention. Further, basic

plans are constrained to offer a tariff that is actuarially equivalent to that set out in the law, so they

are financially fairly homogeneous to the average consumer except for the premium. While insurers

may design the formulary, and hence out-of-pocket payments, of their plans (particularly enhanced

plans) in a strategic way to influence enrollee choices and utilization, the plan’s bid is the choice

over which it has most discretion and the one that feeds directly into the premium calculation and

therefore its competitiveness in the marketplace. We focus on this choice, leaving issues related to

formulary design for future research.28

       We begin by predicting plans’ optimal premiums in the simple scenario of full attention; details

of our method are provided in the following subsection. The next step is to use the premium,

coverage and acute health shocks observed in the data (generated by realized plan premium and

coverage changes) to calculate the proportion of consumers that our model (equation (2)) predicts

will be attentive in each year. For example, the shocks in the data imply that 37% of consumers

will reoptimize in 2007, while 100% are assumed to optimize in 2006. We assume that attentive

consumers make choices to maximize the estimated utility equation (3) while inattentive consumers

have a zero price coefficient in that equation. This provides a simple way to translate the “proba-

bility of attention” implied by the mix of attentive and inattentive consumers in the data into an

expected premium sensitivity that is faced by insurers.29 It is then straightforward to repeat the

exercise of predicting equilibrium premiums using static first order conditions given the new (less

negative) premium coefficient.
  28
     Papers such as Carey (2016), Einav et al (2016) and Lavetti and Simon (2016) consider strategic factors affecting
insurers’ formulary choices in Part D.
  29
     We generate a new utility equation that is the same as equation (3) except that the premium coefficient is scaled
by the percent of consumers who are attentive. It would be more accurate to assume that inattentive consumers had
a zero price elasticity, but this would substantially complicate the simulations.


                                                         28
   This method abstracts away from several complicating factors. First, as noted, our desired

simulation does not require us to address dynamics at all. Secondly, we do not compare our

simulated outcomes to data because the data contain in them the impact of the dynamics—which

might lower the absolute level of markups in early years, for example—and therefore are not directly

comparable to our predictions. Our objective is to provide an approximate magnitude of the

impact of consumer inattention on the steady state markup. We therefore calculate a range of

possible premium effects under different assumptions regarding the mix of attentive and inattentive

consumers in the population. As we vary the proportion of consumers who are attentive, we vary

the price elasticity of demand facing the insurer, and hence its incentive to choose a particular

premium level. We assess the range of likely premium effects of inattention by reporting predicted

consumer spending when the percent attentive varies between 20% and 80% of the population.

   A second caveat is that we do not model each individual plan at the micro level to make the link

between that plan’s premium choice and the attentiveness of its own incumbent enrollees. That

is, our analysis does not model the strategy of each plan to raise premiums and lose some (newly

attentive) consumers. We instead assume a population-level probability of consumer attentiveness,

and then calculate premiums that generate an equilibrium at the population level. Our preferred

method uses an iterative algorithm to address the issue that the premiums chosen by particular

plans may generate premium increases (and hence shocks) that affect the proportion of enrollees

choosing to re-optimize, implying that assuming a fixed probability of attentiveness to which plans

respond when choosing premiums may generate predictions that are internally inconsistent. Our

iterative algorithm proceeds as follows. The predicted premium choices in iteration k are used

to generate predicted premium shocks and therefore a probability of attentiveness (from equation

(2)) and new premium coefficient (in equation (3)). That premium coefficient is used to predict

new premium choices in iteration k + 1. We repeat until convergence, thereby ensuring that the

population percent attentive is consistent with the proportion of plans generating premium shocks.

   We note that some price changes over time are predicted in our simulations, despite their being

a steady state exercise. We do not mean these to be interpreted as “dynamics.” Rather, they are

changes in static predictions that occur due to changing inputs, such as underlying plan costs, and

to the fact that the proportion of enrollees new to Part D differs by year. For example, premiums

are predicted to be low in 2006 in every simulation, as all consumers are new to the market in that

                                                29
first year and therefore are assumed to be attentive.

   We now discuss the possible sources of error in our approach. As noted above, we expect our

approximation of costs to be fairly accurate. Any mismeasurement would in any case be likely to

affect cost levels rather than the differences across our simulations. Second, our model does not

account for the possibility that consumers may in fact be forward-looking, choosing plans with

relatively high prices because they expect those plans to have lower prices in the future when they

are inattentive. However, there is a large amount of research into the behavior of Part D consumers,

none of which indicates that this kind of forward-looking planning is probable. Third, there might

be a steady state that is a perpetual cycle (perhaps with entry and price changes, or LIS cycling as

in Decarolis 2015) and not the static outcome we simulate. Our approach also abstracts away from

other reasons why premiums might change over time, including insurer learning and low pricing in

early years to attract enrollees with the goal of switching them to MA plans. While these dynamic

effects are certainly possible, we showed in Section 7 that we found no evidence of premium cycling

in response to sister plan entry in our sample. Further, we argue that short-term issues such as plan

learning are of second-order importance for the steady state premium effect of inattention that is

our focus.

   An alternative approach to our counterfactuals would have been to simulate the dynamic path

of premiums in the baseline model with inattention. However, predicting the equilibrium of a

dynamic pricing game with many firms is difficult. Papers on the methodological frontier have

either considered very simple markets with two firms and small numbers of consumer types (e.g.

Dube et al (2010)) or made other simplifying assumptions, e.g. of a finite time horizon, or the

simplification that markets are large enough that the random evolution of individual firms “averages

out” and each firm can be assumed to respond to a long-run average industry state rather than the

predicted current choices of its competitors (Weintraub et al (2008) and applications such as Miller

(2014)). None of these assumptions seems reasonable in our setting. We argue that our simulations

provide a reasonable first approximation to the substantial cost savings, for both consumers and

the federal government, that could arise from policies to increase consumer attentiveness. We leave

the specification and estimation of a dynamic premium-setting model as an important path for

future research.



                                                 30
Counterfactual Details

We simulate consumer and plan choices using the fixed sample of 40 New Jersey PDP plans that

entered the market in 2006; we follow each plan through to its exit from the market.30 By limiting

ourselves to these 40 plans we ensure that the reported numbers focus only on within-plan price

and spending changes.

      Recall that each insurer submits a bid for each plan. That bid determines the price consumers

face (the amount over the base beneficiary premium). This institutional reality requires us to

reframe the static price-setting game that is standard in the industrial organization literature as a

game where insurers choose bids given a prediction of the implications for the premiums faced by

consumers. Importantly, each basic plan must offer actuarially equivalent coverage if it does not

follow the tariff set out by law. This means that for a statistical person, the mean of OOP charges

must be the same in expectation for all basic plans, so plans cannot respond to increased consumer

premium sensitivity by reducing premiums while increasing average OOP charges. Additionally, the

subsidy for each enrollee is risk-adjusted depending on age, chronic conditions, LIS, and institutional

status. While the risk-adjustment mechanism is potentially manipulable, risk-adjusted subsidies

plus the high share of catastrophic costs paid by CMS (80%) mean it will be difficult for firms to

immediately determine whether particular enrollees are profitable or not, and the computation will

be complex. We therefore abstract from selection issues as we model the behavior of insurers. We

model insurers’ choices of bids while holding the schedule of OOP charges fixed.

      We write plan j’s variable profit in year t as:


                                    πj,t = (Bj,t + Ej,t − Cj,t )Nj,t                                  (4)


where Bj,t is the bid made to CMS reflecting the plan’s average monthly revenue requirement per

enrollee in a basic plan (including profit), Ej,t is the additonal amount charged to enrollees in an

enhanced plan (the “enhanced premium”; this is zero when j is a basic plan), Cj,t is the plan’s cost

per enrollee net of enrollee OOP payments and Nj,t is its number of enrollees.

      The premium charged to enrollees in a basic plan is the difference between the bid and the
 30
   There were actually 44 PDP plans in New Jersey in 2006 (Table 4); as noted in the Appendix, we drop the
smallest plans in the sample, so we focus on 40 of these 44. 31 of the 40 plans were still active in 2009.

where γt is the proportion of the NAMBA that is paid by the government and Jt is the number of

Part D plans included in the average in year t.31 This expression reflects the fact that, in the first

two years of the program, the NAMBA was an unweighted national average of bids for all MA and

PDP plans. From 2008 on, CMS phased in the implementation of a weighted average, where the

weight was the plan’s enrollment.32

       We take several steps to account for CMS’s risk adjustment strategy. The government subsidy,

which is written into law at 74.5% of the NAMBA, is split between a premium subsidy and reinsur-

ance or risk adjustment payments. The latter include a commitment to pay 80% of the total cost

of drugs above each enrollee’s catastrophic threshold and payments to keep plans within symmetric

risk corridors that limit their overall losses and profits. We adjust our measure of plan costs per

enrollee to take account of the catastrophic drug subsidies as described in the previous section. We

use the true proportion of the NAMBA that is paid by the government in every year (which is

observed in our data, e.g. 66% in 2006) as an input to the premium calculation in equation (5).

We assume that the remaining risk adjustment payments offset the effect of enrollee selection on

plan costs, i.e. the cost per enrollee does not change with enrollees’ plan choices in our simulations.

       Under each counterfactual scenario we consider a single-stage consumer demand system. We

use the estimated parameters of the utility equation described in Section 6 (the full specification,

model 4 of Appendix Table 11) but set the coefficients on premium, coverage and acute health

shocks to zero. The premium coefficient is adjusted as described above to approximate the effect of

a particular mix of attentive and inattentive consumers on premium responsiveness. The resulting
  31
      CMS requires that the basic premium never fall below zero. Our simulations account for this constraint. However
we note that the constraint is not binding for PDPs in our data, although MA-PDs, which bundle prescription drug
insurance with Medicare Part C insurance and whose bids are included in the NAMBA, often have very low premium
bids.
   32
      The premium charged to enhanced plan enrollees is the basic premium defined in equation (5) plus the enhanced
premium Ej,t . The enhanced premium is negotiated between the carrier and CMS and is meant to comprise the
average additional cost of enhanced benefits provided to enrollees in the plan. It is not subsidized by CMS. We
observe this variable in the data for every plan-year and account for it in our simulations under the assumption that
it does not change in response to changes in enrollee attention.

      Here Λi,j,t (.) is the predicted probability that consumer i chooses plan j in period t; it is a

function of all plan characteristics including their premiums. We consider plans’ optimal choices in

the static bid-setting game. The first-order condition for plan profits with respect to the bid Bj,t

is:

                                                               ∂Nj,t
                                       (Bj,t + Ej,t − Cj,t )         + Nj,t = 0.                                      (8)

                                        ∂Nj,t
      Calculating the derivative        ∂Bj,t   requires us to predict the effect of a change in the bid Bj,t on

the premium. We use the expression in equation (5) under the assumption that the NAMBA is an

(unweighted) national average for MA-PD and PDP plans and that plans internalize their impact

on the NAMBA, and therefore on the government subsidy, when choosing their bids33 . We predict
  33
     We account for the fact that a change in one plan’s bid will affect all plans’ premiums via the subsidy. We use
national NAMBA figures published in annual press releases as an input to this analysis. The bid-setting game is
solved for New Jersey PDP plans, assuming that PDP plans outside NJ will change their bids proportionately with
NJ PDP plans, but holding fixed the bids of MA plans both within and outside this state. See Appendix for details.

Counterfactual Results

Tables 8-10 report our results. Table 8 sets out the cross-enrollee average premium costs and OOP

spending (including premiums) predicted by our model with and without inattention. The first col-

umn shows the predictions under full attention. Column 2 (“Inattention (Using Observed Shocks)”)

shows the same simulated costs when the shocks observed in the data between 2006-2008 are used

to predict the proportion of consumers who are attentive the following year (given equation (2))

and the premium coefficient in equation (6) is scaled down accordingly. The proportion attentive

is reported in the column labeled “P(att’n)”. It equals 1 in 2006, the first year of the program;

predicted spending with and without inattention are equal in that year. In the subsequent three

years the percent attentive varies between 0.33-0.45. Premiums and OOP spending are lower under

full attention in each of these years for two reasons. First, plans reduce their premium bids in

response to the higher premium elasticity, generating a reduction in premiums charged. Second,

enrollees place a higher (negative) weight on premiums in the utility equation, and hence choose

lower-premium plans. These results indicate a large saving from the simulated change in elasticity

due to attention: a total out-of-pocket cost saving (including premiums) of $1,154.20 per enrollee

over three years or 25.6% of total spending.

   The third column of Table 8, labeled “Inattention (Iterative Algorithm)”, contains our preferred

specification under inattention. As described above we begin with the outcome under “Inattention

(Using Observed Shocks)” and iterate, predicting the shocks in iteration k using premiums gener-

ated in iteration k − 1, and repeating until convergence. Thus the predicted premiums reported

                                                    34
in this column are consistent with the proportion of consumers assumed to be attentive (i.e. the

proportion with a non-zero premium coefficient). The results change only slightly: the probability

of attention is slightly higher than in column 2, varying from 0.38-0.42 in the years 2007-9, and the

corresponding consumer spending is slightly lower. Savings from a move to full attention are now

$1,051.90 or 23.9% of total spending.

       Table 9 sets out additional robustness tests in the spirit of providing a range of estimates of the

effect of consumer inattention. We report consumer spending under different assumed proportions

of attentive and inattentive consumers in the population: we allow the proportion attentive to vary

from 0.2 to 0.8, in increments of 0.2. The estimates are intuitive. The higher the proportion atten-

tive, the higher the effective premium elasticity, and the lower is consumer spending on premiums,

both because plans adjust their premiums strategically and because consumers increasingly prefer

low-premium plans. The relationship between percent attentive and total consumer spending is

not linear: the spending reductions fall with each incremental increase in percent attentive. This

is unsurprising because the premium coefficient is one input into a non-linear choice model that

determines plan market shares and hence both bids and consumer spending. However, it is clear

that the higher the initial percent attentive, the lower the saving from removing inattention. The

estimates range from a 43% saving if only 20% of consumers are initially attentive, to a 5% saving

if the initial proportion is 80%.

       Table 10 reports the cross-plan unweighted average bids (the NAMBA) that generate the pre-

miums reported in Table 8, with and without inattention. Because we assume that all consumers

are attentive in 2006, the same average bid—$1027.40 per enrollee per year—is predicted in both

columns 1 and 2 of the table (“attentive” and “inattentive”). In later years, as expected, average

bids are lower when all consumers are assumed to be attentive (column 1) than under our preferred

iterative algorithm for inattention (column 2). For example, in 2007, the predicted NAMBA under

full attention is $964.30 per enrollee per year, while under inattention the corresponding figure

is $97 higher at $1,061.50. The difference varies over years, with changes in plan costs and the

observed enhanced premium, but it is greater than six percent of the “inattention” level in every

year 2007-9.34 Finally, we note that the unweighted national average NAMBA observed in the
  34
    The reductions in bids reported here are smaller than the reductions in consumer spending due to endogenous
consumer choice. The Table 10 bid numbers are unweighted averages across plans, consistent with the method used
to calculate government program costs in the first few years of the program. In contrast Table 8 reports averages


                                                       35
data for 2006 is $1,108; it varies between $965 and $1,110 in the years 2007-9. While plan dynamic

choices are likely to generate changes over time that we do not expect our simulations to match,

the fact that the difference between observed and predicted NAMBA is never more than 9% of our

simulated estimate is evidence of the accuracy of our cost measures.35

    If we are willing to assume that our New Jersey estimates can be extrapolated to the entire

nation, we can use the predicted bids to calculate the implied government savings for enrolled

consumers over the years 2007-9. These savings are substantial. Program cost savings result

from the reduction in plan bids, of which the government pays a sizeable proportion. Applying the

conservative assumption that reinsurance costs remain fixed so that the government saves a fraction

of the difference in average bids equal to one minus the Base Beneficiary Percentage (γt in equation

(5)), we find that government savings amount to between $45 and $64 per covered life per year in the

years 2007-9. Assuming further that low-income subsidy payments are unaffected and multiplying

this figure by the non-LIS PDP population in each year generates an estimate of the government’s

total savings from reduced bids. We predict savings of $1.3 billion or 1% of the government’s cost

of this part of the program over the three years 2007-9.36 This is a conservative estimate: we use

unweighted average bids, consistent with the use of unweighted averages to calculate the NAMBA

in the first few years of the program, so our projections do not account for the impact on the

weighted NAMBA of differential enrollee sorting into low-cost plans when bids change.37 Clearly

we have made multiple assumptions to arrive at these numbers. However, when combined with

the theoretical results discussed in Section 4, our estimates are sufficient to provide clear evidence

that removing inattention would lead to substantial savings both to the federal government and to

consumers.

    The CBO calculated that from 2007-10 the cost of the drug component of the basic benefit
across enrollees rather than plans. Consumers tend to choose lower-premium plans, particularly in the “full attention”
simulations when the premium coefficient is most negative.
  35
     These reported observed NAMBAs are unweighted national averages, while those in Table 7 are enrollment-
weighted averages for NJ PDPs only (reported in $ per month for comparison with our cost estimates).
  36
     This simple calculation assumes that, if inattention is removed nationally, the reduction in bids for PDP plans
outside New Jersey will be the same as the average predicted reduction in NJ PDP plan bids, while MA plan bids
remain constant. The $1.3 billion saving is 1% of the government’s cost of subsidizing PDP premiums for non-LIS
enrollees nationally.
  37
     This is the primary reason why the predicted government saving is lower than the weighted average saving to
consumers from removing inattention. A second reason for the difference in percent savings is that the denominator
for the government is the total cost of subsidizing PDP premiums, including risk payments and reinsurance, while
for the consumer it is simply out-of-pocket payments.

increased by 2.8% per annum on average for Part D enrollees while administrative costs and profits

rose at 6.7% (CBO report “Competition and the Cost of Medicare’s Prescription Drug Program

2014”). Premiums increased from a weighted average of $25.93 to $37.25 from 2006 to 2010 accord-

ing to the Kaiser Family Foundation (Hoadley (2015)). This is the environment we explore with our

data and seek to explain as rational pricing in the face of consumer inattention. Interestingly, the

environment changed significantly in the second five years of the program. From 2010 to 2014 the

rate of generic penetration increased significantly and the introduction of new branded blockbuster

drugs slowed. National pharmaceutical expenditure actually fell in nominal terms in 2012 and 2013

according to IMS data (Schumock et al (2014)). However, from 2010 to 2015 stand alone Part D

premiums stayed approximately constant at between $37.02 and $38.54 (Hoadley (2015)). Because

drug costs fell modestly in those years, it is not clear what happened to the margins of the insurers

participating in Part D. Ideally, effective regulation should ensure that costs are reflected in prices.

That is, falling drug costs should benefit consumers in the form of falling premiums if a program

is delivering the competitive benefits society expects. The available evidence suggests that this did

not happen, adding weight to our hypothesis that consumer inattention limits the effectiveness of

competition in this market. It may be the case that the underlying cost environment has changed

again recently, as several sources (e.g. the Express Scripts 2014 Drugs Trend Report) report signif-

icant increases in specialty drug spending for 2014. Further research into the impact of consumer

choice in Part D on competition is clearly warranted.



9    Conclusions

    In this paper we have developed a model of consumer choice in the Part D program and have

analyzed how firms set prices in response to the presence or absence of consumer inattention. The

data support a model where consumers face costs of processing information. This leads them to

avoid making new choices, rolling over their plan selections from one year to the next unless shocked

by a change to their current plan or their current health.

    We provide evidence that firms’ premium choices are responsive to consumers’ search frictions.

In particular, when consumers are attentive, firms are incentivized to lower their margins, resulting

in lower premiums. Using our estimates of consumer behavior and a model of firm price-setting


                                                  37
we use a simple approach to approximate the steady state effects of consumer inattention on

premiums charged and consumer spending. We predict a large price response to full consumer

attention because, in that environment, an effective way for plans to attract customers is by lowering

premiums. Our simulations indicate that the combination of the demand- and supply-side changes

would reduce the amount consumers spend by 24%. The natural plan response of increasing other

components of the price, like the OOP cost schedule, is constrained by the quite tightly regulated

standard benefit levels.

   We do not consider price dynamics. We note that theory predicts an increasing path of prices,

particularly in early years of the program, as plans respond to incentives to “invest” in new enrollees

and then “harvest” their installed based; this implies that the price effects of inattention may be

increasing over time. However there are also other, potentially offsetting effects, such as insurer

learning about the Part D environment during the first few years of the program. Steady state

equilibria could also involve plans cycling between high and low prices, particularly in situations

where several plans are offered by a single insurer. Our simulations do not capture these effects,

nor do they consider the impact of changes in the number of plans per insurer, or the number of

insurance carriers, active in each market. All of these issues are potentially fruitful areas for future

research. However our approach is sufficient to provide a feasible range of estimates of the price

effects of inattention that demonstrates the empirical and policy relevance of the issue.

   The role of plan re-pricing in response to more frequent and effective consumer search has not

been analyzed to the best of our knowledge in the Medicare Part D economics literature to date.

It is an important element in the evaluation of any policy that would help consumers choose better

plans. In particular, while clearly the extrapolation of our New Jersey estimates to the national level

should be interpreted with some caution, the implied government savings from consumer choice –

$1.3 billion in the years 2007-9 - indicate how important well-designed insurance marketplaces can

be. Indeed, without effective consumer choice that puts market pressure on insurers, a policy of

privatizing the delivery of benefits can be very expensive. This cost of privatization should be taken

into account by policy makers in light of our results.

Notes: Decomposition of the difference between the change in overspending of switchers vs non-switchers
if they remain in their current plan. This difference is broken into five components: the contributiong
from the current year (defined as over-spending in current year relative to lowest-cost plan), the increase in
current-plan premium and TrOOP, and the reduction in lowest-cost plan premium and TrOOP.

APPENDIX FOR ONLINE PUBLICATION

1    Sample Definition

    The original sample consists of 249,999 Medicare Part D beneficiaries from the years 2006 to

2009. The panel is unbalanced, with some beneficiaries entering and others exiting throughout

the sample, so the number of observations for each of the four years are, respectively, 209,827,

220,716, 226,501, and 227,753. We restrict the sample only to beneficiaries residing in New Jersey

who, for any four consecutive months during the year, were enrolled in a Medicare PDP but were

neither Medicaid-eligible nor on low income subsidy. We also exclude beneficiaries whose Medicare

termination code or ZIP code is unobserved. We then discard data from any month in which a

beneficiary is Medicaid-eligible, low-income subsidized, or either not Part D enrolled or not enrolled

in a Medicare PDP (e.g. in an MA plan or employer-sponsored coverage). New Jersey sponsors

a prescription-drug assistance program for the elderly, PAAD, which caps out-of-pocket (OOP)

payments at either $5, $6 or $7 (depending on the year and the drug type) so long as the beneficiary

opts into the program and enrolls in an eligible low-cost plan. We infer the presence of this benefit,

which is unobserved in the data yet severely restricts the set of possible plan choices, and exclude

any beneficiaries enrolled in PAAD. We define a beneficiary as PAAD-enrolled if they enroll in a

PAAD-eligible plan without gap coverage or deductible coverage and at least 95% of events that

occur in the deductible or coverage gap phase with total cost greater than the PAAD maximum

copay resulting in the beneficiary paying the PAAD copay. We restrict the number of plans to

64 large plans covering around 95% of the sample and exclude any beneficiary ever enrolled in a

different plan. Finally, we also exclude any beneficiaries observed only in non-consecutive years, as

these observations do not assist in identifying the determinants of switching plans. This yields a

final sample of 214,191 unique beneficiaries with the observations for each of four years, respectively,

as 127,654, 141,897, 151,289, and 159,906.

    We supplement the data with several additional variables from outside sources. First, we map

beneficiary ZIP codes to census tracts using ArcGIS. We then define the income and percent

college educated of each ZIP code as the tract median income and percent with a bachelor’s degree

or higher from the 2000 Census. In cases where a ZIP code mapped to multiple census tracts, the



                                                  49
associated income and education levels were defined as unweighted averages across the tracts. We

then convert these measures of income and education level into quartiles at the ZIP code level.

Next, we obtain a list of commonly-prescribed drugs covering 92% of the events observed in our

sample and classify these according to whether they are branded or generic and whether they are

used for chronic or acute care. Of these, 464 distinct brand names for chronic drugs, representing

13.8 million of the 19.1 million events in our sample, are classified according to the condition they

are most-commonly prescribed to treat. We then defined indicators for the 20 most common chronic

conditions for which Medicare patients are prescribed medication based on whether the beneficiary

was observed taking a drug to treat that condition. Finally, we generate estimated costs under

a variety of counterfactual plan choices, a more detailed description of which is contained in the

following section.



2    Out-of-Pocket Cost Calculation

    We partition the set of prescribed drugs into 464 common chronic drugs and all others. We

assume that all other drugs treat acute conditions. We define the total cost per month supply for

each common chronic drug in each plan to be the sample average cost per month for drug events

where the supply length is between 7 and 90 days.

    We approximate acute drug costs using a different method. We classify individuals into one of

7,040 “severity” bins. Whites, who are over-represented in the sample, are classified on the basis

of gender, four age groups (< 65, 65-75, 75-85, > 85), income quartiles, deciles of days’ supply

of chronic drugs, ten plan indicators (the largest nine plans plus “all other”) and an indicator for

receiving medication for any of hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes or Alzheimer’s. Nonwhites

are classified on the basis of the same criteria, excepting plan indicators, for which there are not

enough observations. Within each of these 7,040 bins, per-month acute drug cost is estimated as the

median per-month amount. We divide these estimated per-month acute shocks into a branded and

generic amount based on the percent of acute drug spending on generic drugs each year and generate

an estimated sequence of acute drug events with two drug events (one branded, one generic) on the

15th of each month in which the beneficiary is observed in-sample. To this we add the observed

sequence of chronic drug events and treat this as the estimated sequence of drug events.


                                                 50
   We do not observe plan formularies; our next step is therefore to approximate the true formulary

for each plan. In many cases, the tier on which a drug is categorized is observed for the plan, and

when this is the case we use the observed tier. If the tier is unobserved (i.e. there are no instances

in the data of a prescription written for a given drug in a given plan-year), we classify it as either

a branded or generic drug based on the observed classification in other similar plans and fill in

the tier accordingly. For generic drugs, we place the drug on the plan’s generic-drug tier if such a

tier exists. For branded drugs, if the drug is observed for a plan offered by the same carrier, we

fill in the tier as the corresponding drug-type tier for that plan. If the drug is not observed for

any plan in that contract, we assume the drug is not covered by the plan. These assumptions are

based on consideration of the actual formularies used by 5 of the largest Part D providers, which

share a common list of covered drugs for all plans sponsored by the provider and typically cover

any generic drug but not all branded drugs. For simplicity we assume that the Pre-Initial Coverage

Limit and Gap phases employ the same formulary structure, as they do for the few plans with Gap

tiers, and we ignore the effect of specialty tiers as only one of the 464 most-commonly prescribed

chronic drugs is a specialty treatment.

   Finally, to generate counterfactual spending under each plan we step through the simulated

sequence of drug events and generate counterfactual benefit phases and patient OOP payments

according to the plan’s stated cost structure, the estimated formulary, and cumulative spending

for the year. Counterfactual OOP payments for each plan are estimated as the sum of OOP

payments for the observed chronic drugs and simulated acute events for each beneficiary in each

large plan every year. Note that, as in previous papers, our method assumes no moral hazard, and

unlike Ketcham et al. (2012) we assume no elasticity with respect to plan prices for chronic drug

consumption, in that patients take the same sequence of prescription drugs in every plan regardless

of the costs they face. The plan-specific medians allow for some price elasticity for acute drugs for

large plans. For simplicity we ignore the effect of prior authorization requirement, step therapy

regimens and quantity restrictions.

   The estimated payments, which represent the “True Out-of-Pocket Payments”, are added to

a premium payment for each month in which the beneficiary is enrolled in the plan to create a

counterfactual “Total Payment” variable for each beneficiary in each plan. These numbers are

scaled up to a 12-month equivalent for each beneficiary enrolled for fewer than 12 months. The

                                                 51
minimum cost plan for each beneficiary is defined as the plan with lowest “Total Payment” in each

year.



3       Analyzing the Empirical Behavior of Part D Enrollees

     We investigate of the behavior of Part D enrollees by considering the amount they pay in

their chosen plan given the costs of the other plans that are available to them. We refer to the gap

between what the consumer spent and the lowest cost plan she could have chosen as “overspending”

or gap spending. Table 1 in the text shows overspending relative to the minimum cost plan by

Part D cohort. These numbers indicate that there is variation across cohorts, particularly between

new enrollees and those with experience of the program. New enrollees’ spending gap was lower in

2008 and 2009 than that of continuing enrollees, reaching a level of $371.78 or 32% in 2009. 2006

enrollees (those who first entered the program in 2006 and remained in it throughout our sample)

had above-average gaps in every year relative to the full sample; their level of spending above the

lowest cost plan in 2009 was $459.19, or roughly the same percentage of total cost (37%) as in 2006

despite their long exposure to the program.

    Part of the spending gap shown by Part D enrollees is a result of failing to choose a new plan

each year. Column 1 of Appendix Table 5 shows that in every year, consistent with Ketcham

et al. (2012), the spending gap is on average lower for consumers who have just switched plans.

Moreover, the spending gap for the group switching decreases slightly over time, while that for

non-switchers increases. Columns 2-5 of the same table show that switchers on average would have

had a higher gap than non-switchers, and a larger increase in the spending gap year-on-year, if

they had remained in the same plan. Appendix Table 6 considers the fraction of enrollees spending

within 10% or 25% of their estimated lowest-cost plan and shows much the same pattern. By 2009,

over a quarter of switchers spent less than 110% of their cheapest-plan cost, while only 4% of those

not switching achieved this.

    The disparity in overspending between switchers and non-switchers appears to be growing over

time. By 2009, around 62,000 enrollees present in all four years, or just under half the original

cohort (not adjusting for attrition) had never picked a new plan. While switchers continued to

overspend even after switching plans, enrollees who had never switched overspent by more. By


                                                52
2009 they spent on average about 40% more than they would in their lowest-cost plan; only 2%

of them were within 10% of their lowest-cost plan. Overspending increases monotonically in years

since last plan election. This suggests that the failure of consumers to switch plans is one important

factor contributing to them spending well more than the lowest cost plan available.


Evidence for Inattention. We have shown that switchers on average reduce their spending

relative to the minimum in the following year. The next key question is why people do not switch

more frequently. If we conservatively define switching as the optimal choice whenever a consumer’s

current plan is expected to cost more than 125% of the cheapest plan’s cost next year, then the

optimal choice for about 83% of enrollees in 2008 was to switch plans. However, less than a tenth

of that number actually switched.

    Given these findings, we propose that consumers may be inattentive and in the absence of

highly visible “prompts” may simply roll-over their current plan choice. We investigate whether

the data are consistent with this intuition. Recall that spending above the minimum is a function

of three variables: consumers’ current plan characteristics, the characteristics of their lowest-cost

plan, and their drug consumption. We consider whether the decision to switch plans places more

weight on own-plan and personal characteristics, which are readily observable, than on optimal-plan

characteristics, which require costly search.

    We construct three simple indicators for “shocks” to expected spending that depend only own-

plan and personal characteristics. We define a “premium shock” as an increase in own-plan premi-

ums the following year of greater than the weighted median increase across all consumers (about

$4 in 2007, $7 in 2008, and $4.50 in 2009).38 Each year in the open enrollment period an existing

enrollee receives a letter from his or her plan detailing changes in the coming year. To the extent

the enrollee opens the letter and reads it, the premium increase becomes known and salient at a

time when the enrollee can easily switch plans. A “coverage shock” is defined as occurring when

either (a) the consumer’s current plan drops coverage in the coverage gap or (b) the plan moves

from the defined standard benefit pre-ICL (before hitting the coverage gap) to a tiered system

in that region.39 Third, we define enrollees as receiving an “acute shock” if they are in the top
  38
     We have experimented with different cutoffs and the median does well in terms of simplicity and explanatory
power.
  39
     Recall that basic plans must meet a coverage standard and be actuarially equivalent to the tariff set out in the



                                                         53
quintile of total spending and also the top decile for either percent spending on acute drugs or

deviation between predicted and observed spending in the current year. This shock is meant to

capture unanticipated short-term illness, which may prompt the consumer to scrutinize her choice

of insurance while also serving as signal of high expected future spending.40

    Appendix Table 7 shows the results of probit regressions of decision to switch plans on own-plan,

low-cost plan and personal characteristics. If consumers prefer low premiums and high coverage but

are inattentive, we expect them to switch more frequently when their current plan raises premium

or reduces coverage than when other low-cost plans reduce premium or increase coverage. If they

switch in response to acute shocks we expect those with high OOP spending to switch. The

estimates in Appendix Table 7 are consistent with this intuition. In all specifications enrollees with

high OOP spending and those with high premiums and deductibles and without gap coverage switch

more than other consumers. Model 1 indicates that consumers’ switching probability increases when

their own plan’s premium rises or when their own plan removes gap coverage. Model 2 adds the

equivalent variables for the average of the five lowest-cost plans and shows that, to the extent

changes in other-plan characteristics affect switching at all, the correlations run in the “wrong”

direction. In particular it seems that consumers are more likely to switch when low-cost plans

increase their premiums. Changes in low-cost plans’ gap coverage have no significant effect41 .

    Appendix Table 8 presents evidence that consumers who switch select plans with characteristics

that vary depending on the shock that prompted the switch. Consumers who receive acute shocks,

which we can think of as signals of future ill-health, tend to prefer higher coverage conditional on

switching than those who do not. The same is true of those receiving coverage shocks. Consumers

facing premium shocks tend to choose plans with lower premiums. This suggests that consumers

treat shocks to their health status and plan characteristics not only as prompts to switch but also

as “cues” to search for particular plan attributes, as in Busse et al. (2014).
law. The declines we label as “shocks” are declines in one part of the benefit schedule, which we treat as appropriate
measures of rapidly increasing premiums and eroding (or increasingly complex) coverage on some dimension. We
could also potentially have considered other shock definitions such as pharmacy network changes, or indicators for
individual enrollees’ preferred drugs being dropped. Unfortunately the data were not ideal for these definitions.
  40
     We do not have information on diagnoses because we only have data from Medicare Part D and not Parts A
and B. However, a diagnosis - and in particular an inferred diagnosis - may be a less precise measure of how much
pharmaceutical spending increases compared to actual utilization.
  41
     The results are insensitive to using either the lowest-cost plan available, the lowest-cost plan within-brand, or an
average of the 5 lowest-cost plans.




                                                           54
Alternative Explanations. There is a significant insurance literature that examines the ques-

tion of risk-aversion and whether consumers over-insure themselves because they have great distaste

for risk. This might be an explanation of our initial findings, and those of other Part D papers.

However, in our data we do not find evidence to support this theory – that high spending by non-

switchers is related to over-insurance, as would be the case if risk aversion was causing the observed

overspending. Appendix Table 9 shows that the percentage of enrollees’ total costs covered in the

gap is much higher for switchers than for non-switchers, while premiums are on average lower for

switchers. Thus higher coverage is chosen by people who overspend by less, rather than more, on

average. In addition, this increased gap coverage does not come at the expense of reduced coverage

in the pre-ICL phase (the main coverage phase), as the percent of covered costs isactually higher

in this phase on average for switchers as well. Note that the coverage figures in Appendix Table

9 summarize the percent of costs covered for consumers enrolled in the relevant plan, not for the

statistical average enrollee used for the CMS actuarial equivalence calculations.

   We also run cross-sectional regressions of percent overspending, defined as the difference be-

tween the chosen and minimum cost plans divided by the chosen plan’s cost, on plan and enrollee

characteristics. The results are set out in Appendix Table 10. Having switched plans is negatively

and significantly related to overspending, and whether or not we control for having switched plans,

gap coverage is negatively related, and premiums and deductibles positively related to overspending

conditional on observed OOP costs. Therefore we conclude that overspending is not on average

associated with overinsurance in our data.

   A second possible explanation for overspending is that it takes experience to learn how to shop

in the Part D marketplace. Perhaps an enrollee’s overspending falls over time as she learns. Table

1 in the text addresses this issue. 2006 enrollees - those who first entered the program in 2006 and

remained in it throughout our sample - had higher overspending in every year than the average for

the full sample; their overspending in 2009 was $459.19, or roughly the same percentage of total

cost (37%) as in 2006 despite their long exposure to the program. This suggests that overspending

is not declining with experience in Part D.

   Appendix Table 8 also provides insight on whether the small number of consumers who switch

despite not experiencing shocks are more sophisticated than those who switch due to highly visible

prompts. In fact these consumers are less likely to choose a plan whose costs are within 25% of the

                                                 55
lowest available level than are consumers who switch in response to a shock. It may be appropriate

to think of consumers who switch without being prompted by an observed shock as responding

to some unobserved random shock to the likelihood of switching along the lines of a friend or

relative advising them to do so. We account for this in the estimated demand model. We also

consider whether consumers who switch plans on a regular basis are more sophisticated than other

consumers. A small number of consumers (less than 4% of the sample) choose a different plan in

every year of our data. They are enrolled in lower-cost plans on average in 2009 than the population

as a whole in 2006. However, rather than being particularly sophisticated dynamic optimizers, it

seems that these consumers are simply unlucky in terms of the number of shocks they receive over

time. Virtually the entire segment receives a premium shock each year, and these consumers are

also three times as likely as other consumers to receive acute shocks.



4      A Model of Consumer Behavior

4.1     A Framework for Consumer Inattention

      We outline a model under which the consumer inattention we observe in the data is caused

by costs of processing information. Our framework draws from the models of rational inattention

developed by Sims (2003) and Reis (2006) and from the models of consumer search and learning of

Cabral and Fishman (2012) and Honka (2014) among others.

    Consider a model with the following assumptions. A risk-neutral, myopic consumer i may

choose from a set of plan options j = 1, ..., J. The consumer has a limited capacity for processing

information: acquiring and processing the data needed to understand the characteristics of all plans

in the choice set has a cost ṽi,t = f (Zi,t ), where Zi,t are consumer characteristics such as age and

sickness level which could affect, for example, the likelihood of a younger family member helping

with the plan choice process. The consumer’s utility from plan j if she was fully informed of its

characteristics in period t would be


                                    ui,j,t = βXi,j,t + γci,j,t + i,j,t                            (9)


where ci,j,t is the OOP cost paid by the consumer, Xi,j,t are other plan characteristics relevant to


                                                    56
the choice and i,j,t is an i.i.d. shock known to the consumer but not to the researcher42 .

    At the end of year t each consumer observes her own plan k’s cost in the following year; this

is sent to her in the mail. (We normalize any processing cost involved in reading the letter to

zero and consider as “costs” activities more difficult than that.) After receiving this mailing she

chooses whether to incur cost ṽi,t in order to observe all plans’ terms and choose the plan that

maximizes her utility, or whether to incur no cost and remain in plan k the following year. Under

these assumptions the consumer will choose to pay the cost ṽi,t provided the expected benefit is

greater than the cost:

where X̄i,k,t+1 are the characteristics (Xi,k,t+1 , ci,k,t+1 , i,k,t+1 ) of plan k in period t + 1 and the

expectation is taken over the characterstic she searches for: cost ci,j,t+1 for all plans j 6= k.43

    The literature on consumer search and learning indicates that, under these assumptions, the

consumer may choose to default into her current plan until she experiences a sufficiently large

shock to her own plan’s cost or her own health. Cabral and Fishman (2012), the study most

relevant for our application, shows that observing a high price or a large price increase has two

effects: it increases the expected benefit from search (it’s likely that a better deal can be found)

but also reduces it because the consumer assumes firm prices will be correlated. Under reasonable

assumptions, the first effect dominates, and a large increase in price prompts the consumer to

search for alternatives.

    A shock to the consumer’s health may increase the probability of search and switching for two

reasons. First it may decrease ṽi,t , for example by prompting the senior’s relatives to help evaluate

the plans in her choice set. It could alternatively increase the variance of the consumer’s expected

distribution of costs ci,j,t+1 . Sallee (2014) shows that, in a similar model where consumers choose

durable goods based partly on their expected lifetime fuel costs, an increase in the variance of the

cost distribution (uncertainty) implies an increase in the expected benefit from search.
  42
     We break out ci,j,t into its component parts in the model for estimation; it is condensed to a single variable in
this section for simplicity of exposition. The utility equation may not be “rational” in the sense that agents weight
premium and copays equally, for example. However we assume that γ < 0.
  43
     As discussed in the paper, consumers are able to perfectly forecast a significant fraction of the future OOP costs
of any plan.

4.2     Demand Model for Estimation

       Having outlined a framework under which costs of processing information can generate the

consumer inattention we observe in the data, we move on to specify a simple two-stage model

of consumer decision-making for estimation. Consistent with the framework just developed, we

abstract away from risk aversion and learning and assume that consumers are myopic in their

choice of plans. We distinguish between two possible unobserved sources of choice persistence:

persistent variation in unobserved preferences and inattention. We account for inattention using

the following simple framework. We assume that each consumer ignores the plan choice problem

until hit by a shock to the OOP costs of her current plan or to her health. These shocks are

assumed to have additively separable effects on her decision to re-optimize her choice of plan. If

she chooses to re-optimize, she makes choices according to a utility equation to be estimated.44 We

use this simple decision model to predict the behaviors that will affect the optimal plan strategies:

consumers’ decisions to switch in response to different changes in the market and in their own

health and the types of plans to which they switch after each type of shock. Then we use the

estimates to explore how firms respond to this consumer behavior.


Specification      As described in the text, we consider three shocks to the consumer’s own charac-

teristics that could prompt her to incur the costs of search. We define a shock to premiums in the

enrollee’s current plan (vp ) as a premium increase of more than the weighted median increase in

the relevant year. A coverage shock (vc ) is again defined as the plan dropping coverage in the cov-

erage gap or moving from the defined standard benefit to a different (tiered) system in the Pre-ICL

phase. An enrollee is defined as having an acute shock (vh ) when she is in the top quintile of total

drug cost as well as the top decile of either percent spending on acute drugs or deviation between

predicted and observed spending. Additionally, a consumer i could simply receive a random shock

that causes awareness, for example from a younger relative visiting the consumer and reviewing her

plan choices. We label this shock ve . The sum of these shocks creates a composite shock received
  44
    Our consumers are “naive,” in the sense that they do not realize that they are inattentive, and therefore their
decisions do not take into account that they may not reoptimize again for a long time.




                                                        58
by consumer i at time t:


                                   vi,t = vi,p,t β1 + vi,c,t β2 + vi,h,t β3 + vi,e,t                                (11)


where the weights β allow the different shocks to have different effects on the propensity to search

(for example shocks to premiums may increase the likelihood of switching more than other shocks).

We assume that the random shock vi,e,t is distributed IID Extreme Value Type 1.

    When the composite shock vi,t is large enough, i.e. when:


                                                     vi,t ≥ ṽi,t ,                                                 (12)


then the consumer becomes aware and decides to re-optimize her plan election. Here ṽi,t is a

function of consumer demographics related to health status and sensitivity to changes in plan

characteristics: age groups, income quartiles, gender and race. In our model consumers are not

heterogeneous in the weights they place on the three different shocks. Heterogeneity in search costs,

however, is an important part of the model and the data, as can be seen for example in Table 245 .

We also include year fixed effects in ṽi,t to account for differences in the environment across our

three different enrollment periods. We expect that the amount and nature of advertising and of

pharmacy and government outreach affected consumer attentiveness, and we expect these factors

varied over time.

    The second stage of the model examines how consumers who have decided to re-optimize choose

whether to switch and to which plans. We assume that if equation (4) holds then consumer i makes

a choice from the full choice set (including her current plan) based on the following utility from

choosing plan j in year t:


                               ˆ
                   ui,j,t = T rOOP i,j,t β1 + P remiumj,t [β2,1 + vi,p,t β2,2 ] + Dedj,t β3,1

                           + Gapj,t [β4,1 + vi,c,t β4,2 + vi,h,t β4,3 ] + Xj,t β5,i + i,j,t

                           = δi,j,t + i,j,t                                                                        (13)
  45
     Note that ṽi,t should not be strictly interpreted as a search cost because we have not fully specified a first stage
in which the consumer re-optimizes when the expected benefit of search is greater than its cost. However it has a
similar interpretation: it is the level above which shocks to the consumer’s attention will lead to search.




                                                           59
                                                  ˆ
where expected OOP spending excluding premium (T rOOP i,j,t ) is calculated using the method

described in Section 4, P remiumj,t and Dedj,t are annual premiums and deductibles and Gapj,t

is an indicator for any coverage in the gap. Xj,t are non-price plan characteristics including an

indicator for enhanced plans and brand fixed effects (defined at the carrier rather than the plan

level) and i,j,t is an IID extreme value type 1 error term (assumed to be independent of vi,e,t ).

       In the reported specifications we use chronic TrOOP as our measure of out of pocket costs, as

acute TrOOP may be measured with error while this is unlikely to be the case for chronic TrOOP.46

Note that a consumer who could calculate expected costs perfectly would value a given change in

either TrOOP equally, and with the same weight as premium, as they are all measured in dollars.

We do not include a term for the variance of chronic TrOOP because consumers are assumed to

predict their chronic drug costs with certainty. While in principle a risk-neutral consumer should

not put any weight on other plan financial characteristics after correctly calculating TrOOP, we

know from past research that they do. Therefore we include other financial characteristics of the

plan (the size of the deductible and an indicator for coverage in the gap) in the utility equation

to help us predict consumer choice. Significant coefficients on these characteristics may reflect

consumer risk aversion, the salience of particular publicized plan characteristics, or other choice

frictions that we do not not formally model. In addition we allow consumers prompted to search

by shocks to premiums to place additional weight on premiums. Consumers experiencing shocks

to coverage, or acute shocks, are permitted to place additional weight on the plan offering gap

coverage.

       We model persistent unobserved preference heterogeneity by including normally-distributed

random coefficients β5,i on fixed effects for the three dominant brands, which together have over

80% market share in 2006, and on the enhanced plan fixed effect. The model therefore allows choice

persistence (such as a lack of switching away from a particular plan even when other plans reduce

their premiums) to be caused either by heterogeneous preferences (some consumers have a very

strong valuation for this brand that makes it worthwhile to remain enrolled even at a high relative

price) or by inattention (consumers who are not affected by any of the previously-defined shocks

are unaware of other plan premium reductions). One of our objectives in estimating this equation
  46
   In robustness tests we show that including acute TrOOP as a separate input to the utility equation has very little
impact on the results.

is to distinguish between these two effects.47

       The model is estimated using a random coefficients simulated maximum likelihood approach

similar to that summarized in Train (2009). Details are provided in the following subsection.


Identification       The intuition for identification of this model is now fairly standard in the literature

(see for example Handel (2013) and Polyakova (2016)). We use the panel structure of the data,

which implies that we can track individuals making consecutive choices over several years, together

with the fact that new enrollees in the program enter the data in every year. These new enrollees are

assumed to choose without inertia; we also assume that the normally distributed random coefficients

fully capture the unobserved heterogeneity in their preferences. The parameters governing the

unobserved preference heterogeneity (the distribution of the random coefficients) can therefore

be estimated from the choices made by new enrollees in the program. Other determinants of

the decision to switch, most importantly the parameters governing inattention, are identified from

consumers’ observed sequences of choices in the years following entry. The initial conditions problem

(e.g., Heckman (1991)) does not arise in our data because we observe the first Part D choices for

all individuals in the estimation sample.

       Endogeneity issues are of course also relevant for identification. A classic endogeneity problem

would occur if a plan’s additional coverage was valued in ways we did not observe and this additional

coverage was correlated with the plan’s premium. An insurer with an unobservably good plan that

wanted to charge a higher price could submit a higher bid to CMS and this would show up as a

higher premium. However, the institutional features of the Part D setting reduce this endogeneity

concern considerably. Because plans must meet the CMS’ actuarial standards for coverage for an

average statistical person, insurers are not permitted to offer plans with the types of unobservable

quality typical in other differentiated products markets. What consumers purchase is a tariff; any

given treatment does not vary in its characteristics across plans, and coverage is regulated by

CMS. Hence the possible ways to differentiate in an unobservable dimension are limited. Here we
  47
     We choose not to model a third possible source of choice persistence: the existence of switching costs defined to
be distinct from the attention and search costs here. While switching costs has been a focus of some previous papers
on health insurance markets (e.g. Handel (2013) and Polyakova (2016)), we find it difficult to separate out what those
might be (time, effort, searching) and whether they overlap with the cognitive effort of paying attention to a particular
decision and investing in optimization. The evidence presented above indicates that inattention is an important source
of search frictions in our data. We focus on identifying the effects of inattention separately from persistent unobserved
preferences, choosing not to attempt the notoriously difficult empirical task of also distinguishing between the effects
of asymmetric search costs (inattention) and switching costs.


                                                           61
consider unobservable quality appearing through the formulary, additional benefits, and customer

service. Anecdotally, customer service does not appear to be a very important force in this market.

We predict consumer OOP payments using observed chronic drug utilization and demographic

and utilization types, as described in section 2 of this Appendix. If there is some error in this

calculation, we may predict OOP costs that differ from consumers’ own predictions, implying that

consumers may perceive some plans to be more attractive than is indicated by our OOP spending

variable. In this case the error may be correlated with the premium, leading to downward bias in

the premium and premium shock coefficients. For example, if a plan offers a low-priced version

of a chronic drug, many consumers might choose to switch to it if they enroll in that plan. Our

OOP cost measure assumes that consumers do not switch chronic drugs so we would systematically

over-estimate OOP costs for that plan. If premiums are increased to account for this “unobserved

generosity”, the estimated premium coefficient will be biased towards zero. We address this concern

by including carrier fixed effects in all specifications, as formularies are almost always fixed across

plans within a carrier48 . The fact that formularies are nearly always constant across an insurance

carrier’s plans is helpful for us because it means that unobserved quality related to the formulary

is picked up with our brand fixed effects. The last possible endogeneity problem we consider is the

additional coverage offered by enhanced plans, which is subject to less tight regulatory scrutiny

than that of basic plans. We include enhanced plan fixed effects in all specifications and add

enhanced-year interactions to account for time variation in the quality of enhanced plan coverage

in some specifications. The typical unobserved quality dimension correlated with premium, as in

Berry (1994), is therefore unlikely to play a major role in our data.


4.3      Details on Demand Model Estimation

       We estimate the model using simulated maximum likelihood. Let XS and θS denote respectively

the observed variables and parameters governing the decision to search, with XC and θC analogously

denoting the observed variables and mean values of the parameters governing the individual’s choice
                       R denote the R individual-specific random preference parameters, with
of plan. Further let θ̃C,i
                                                R ∼ M V N (θ R , ΣI Σ0 ), where θ = {θ R , θ N R }.
associated observed variables XCR . We assume θ̃C,i         C      R             C    C C
  48
    We also included carrier-year fixed effects, in a simpler specification without random coefficients on the brand
fixed effects, with little effect on the estimates.



                                                        62
Then for some individual-specific R−dimensional IID-N(0, 1) vector νi , we can express utility as:


                                                   NR    R         R
                                ui,j,t = XC,i,j,t θC  + XC,i,j,t θ̃C,i + i,j,t
                                                        NR    R
                                            = XC,i,j,t θC  + XC,i,j,t νi Σ + i,j,t

                                            = δi,j,t + i,j,t


The parameters to be estimated are then Θ = {θC , θS , Σ}.

   Estimation is complicated by two problems. First, the individual-specific component of prefer-

ences, νi Σ, is unobserved. Second, we do not observe the individual’s decision to search, only to

switch plans, and hence must estimate the probability of remaining in the current plan as a mixture

over cases in which the individual searched and chose their current plan and cases in which the

individual did not search. We can account for the second problem directly by writing the likelihood

conditional on νi and Θ as a mixture:

independent draws {νis }Ss=1 from a standard normal distribution for each individual i and apply

them to the individual for all years in which they are active in the data. At Step m of the likelihood

maximization routine, for the current guess of Θ(m) we compute Li,j,t |νis , Θ(m) for the individual’s

observed sequence of choices for each νis and approximate the integral above with the sample average

over the S draws. We then maximize the likelihood using KNITRO maximization software.


4.4      Demand Estimates

       The estimated coefficients and standard errors for four separate demand specifications are shown

in Appendix Table 11; the means and standard deviations of the variables used in estimation are

reported in Appendix Table 12 below. Model 1 uses a simple specification where only chronic

TrOOP, premium, brand fixed-effects and an enhanced plan fixed effect, with random coefficients

as specified above, are included in the utility equation. We add variables incrementally in the

following columns; Model 4 is our full specification. In all models the switch parameter estimates

indicate that consumers are more likely to switch plans if they receive premium or coverage shocks

or have an acute shock to their health. Women, nonwhite, lower-income and older enrollees have

lower threshold values to trigger awareness, and hence are more likely to switch. These results are

consistent with the switching estimates above and also with intuition. Failing to choose the lowest-

cost plan is more costly for older enrollees who already spend a higher fraction of their income on

drugs, and for lower-income enrollees for whom the excess spending is more burdensome. For this

reason they tend to require smaller prompts in order to re-optimize their choice.

       The third panel of Appendix Table 11 sets out the estimated choice coefficients. As noted in

the previous literature, if consumers are risk neutral and perfectly predict their expected OOP

costs, we expect the coefficients on TrOOP and premium to be negative and approximately equal

in magnitude. Consistent with AG, our estimates do not satisfy this criterion. Consumers are

estimated to place a much greater weight on premiums than on chronic TrOOP.49 . If we ignore

shocks for simplicity, the model 4 estimates imply that a one-standard-deviation (or $241) increase

in premium for a single plan, holding all other plans’ characteristics fixed, generates an average

reduction in the probability that the plan is chosen of 8.5%, while a one-standard-deviation increase
  49
    Evidence for consumers over-weighting premiums and other plan variables relative to expected costs in other
insurance markets is presented in Handel (2013).



                                                      64
in chronic TrOOP, which is a much larger dollar increase of $935, leads to a 7.6% reduction in

probability of choice. Consumers also put significant weights on both gap coverage and deductibles.

Model 4 implies that, for plans offering coverage in the gap, eliminating that coverage has an

equivalent effect to a $252 increase in annual premium, a $915 increase in the deductible, or a

$1211 increase in chronic TrOOP. The significant coefficients on gap coverage and deductibles

could be due to consumer risk aversion or the salience of these easily-observed plan characteristics.

These variables may also absorb the effect of expected acute OOP costs which are not included

in our primary specifications.50 . Overall we conclude that a plan’s premium is clearly the most

important characteristic affecting demand.

       The random coefficient estimates are intuitive. While our data agreement prevents us from

specifying the names of individual insurers, we can say that the three largest brands have a combined

market share of over 80% in 2006-7. Consistent with this large enrollment, all three random

coefficients are estimated to have positive and significant means. Those for large brands one and

two, the largest in the sample, are particularly high and have variances of the same order of

magnitude as the means. The third large brand has a relatively low premium which helps rationalize

its high market share; its brand fixed effect has a somewhat lower mean and relatively higher

variance compared to the others. The remaining brand dummy variables (not reported) indicate

that consumers are willing to pay on the order of $500 to move from the second-lowest-value plan

to one of the three largest brands. Conditional on all other plan variables, consumers show a slight

aversion to enhanced plans on average, although the variance of this random coefficient is three

times larger than its mean. When we break out the enhanced plan coefficient by year in Model

4, we see that enhanced plans become increasingly attractive over time; the overall coefficient is

positive by 2009.51

       The choice equation also identifies a second source of frictions in consumer decision-making.

Consistent with the evidence presented above as well as that in Busse et al. (2014), consumers

switching plans following a shock to premiums place additional weight on premiums in making their
  50
     Acute TrOOP is excluded from the main specifications because of measurement issues: it is generated from
an average within a group defined by demographics and utilization and thus does not pick up private information
regarding idiosyncratic cost variation within the group, which is likely to be an important factor in consumers’ choice
of plan. When we add acute TrOOP to models 1 and 2 its coefficient has the wrong sign but most of the other
estimates change very little.
  51
     Some of the effect of enhanced benefits could be subsumed in the estimate for gap coverage which many enhanced
plans provide and many basic plans do not.

choice, while those switching following a health shock place additional weight on gap coverage. The

magnitudes of these interaction terms indicate substantial effects. In particular, the weight placed

on premiums by consumers who have experienced a premium shock is more than twice that for

other consumers.



5         Details on Counterfactual Simulation

         In order to simulate plan pricing in the counterfactual, we first must construct an estimate

of plan costs that accounts for manufacturer rebates. In each year for each drug observed in the

prescription drug event file, we categorize the drug as either branded or generic. For drugs that

cannot be categorized, we label them as generic if their average cost is below the median among

uncategorized drugs. Then for each branded drug and each year we generate the average cost

per day’s supply of the drug and apply it to each observed prescription, scaled by the observed

supply length. We assume the cost net of rebates is 80% of this amount52 . For generic drugs, we

assume the cost is $4 per month’s supply and scale by the observed supply length53 . For drug

events in the catastrophic phase, we assume the plan pays 15% and the beneficiary pays 5%, while

for all other events we treat the beneficiary’s TrOOP payment as known. We sum these drug

costs over beneficiaries to generate an estimated annual cost figure and annual TrOOP for each

beneficiary. Then within each plan and year we winsorize by replacing estimated annual costs and

annual TrOOP for the bottom 2.5% of beneficiaries with the 2.5% quantile, and analogously for

the top 2.5%. These winsorized annual figures are then averaged within plan and year to generate

estimates of benefit cost and TrOOP per covered life. Applying an administrative cost assumption

of 16% of drug costs54 , we generate an estimate of total costs per covered life net of TrOOP, which

is treated as Cj,t in Equation (4).

         The second step in our simulation is to refine our estimates of each individual’s unobserved type
    52
     A study by the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General (Levinson (2011)) found that, in
2009, rebates reduced Part D drug expenditures by 19% on average for the 100 highest-volume brand name drugs.
We assume a slightly lower percentage to account for potentially lower rebates for lower-volume drugs.
  53
     Our assumption for generic drug costs is based on Walmart’s well known “$4 for any generic prescription”
program.
  54
     Sullivan (2013) notes that the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) includes the administrative costs
of Medicare Advantage plans and Part D plans in its report of total Medicare administrative costs. We use this fact,
and data from the NHEA for 2006-2010, to back out administrative expenses of 14-16% of total costs - or 16-19% of
non-administrative costs - for Parts C and D combined.

                                                                               C C


               R we can compute the likelihood of a given sequence of choices C Obs directly using
Given Θ̂ and θ̃C,i                                                             i

the choice probability of each individual for each plan-year in our static simulations takes the simple

logit form:

                                                  k=1 e


while the unconditional probability is the integral over the filtered distribution from step 2:

                                                 Z
                                                                      R
                                 Λi,j,t =                Λ̃i,j,t P (θ̃C,i |CiObs ) ∂ θ̃C,i
                                                                                       R

Plan j’s enrollment in year t under the counterfactual is therefore:


                                              Nj,t = ΣN t
                                                      i=1 Λi,j,t



where Nt is the number of beneficiaries active in year t.

      Denote the bid, base premium, enhanced premium and costs for plan j in year t by Bj,t , Pj,t ,

Ej,t , and Cj,t , respectively. Plan profits are a function of the bid, enhanced premium, costs, and

enrollment, and plans choose their bid to maximize profit:


                           Bj,t = ARGM AX πj,t = (B + Ej,t − Cj,t )Nj,t

subject to the restriction that their premiums are determined by the Medicare Part D bidding

mechanism, and are constrained to lie above zero:55


                                   Pj,t = Bj,t − N AM BAt + BBPt + Ej,t

                                BBPt = BP Pt × N AM BAt
                                                     1 Jt

                                   Pj,t ≥ 0


Under the assumption that the Base Premium Percentage (BP Pt ), enhanced premium and costs

are exogenous, we can write the plan’s premium in terms of its own and all other plans’ bids,

yielding an expression for the derivatives of plan premiums with respect to own- and other-plan

bids:

                                       ∂Pj,t              Jt − (1 − BP Pt )
                                                     =
                                       ∂Bj,t                      Jt
                                       ∂Pk,t              −(1 − BP Pt )
                                                     =

                                                     = β2,1 Λ̃i,j,t (1 − Λ̃i,j,t )
                                      ∂Pj,t
                                     ∂ Λ̃i,j,t

                                     ∂Pk,t

where β2,1 is the utility parameter for plan premiums.
  55
   This is a simplification of the true system in which the base premium, not the total including the enhanced
premium, is constrained to be weakly greater than zero.

   Combining the expressions above, we can write the plan’s optimal bidding problem as:


                                         M AX (B + Ej,t − Cj,t ) × (ΣN t

where Ei,t , BP Pt and Jt are given. We can derive a first-order condition for the plan’s bidding

decision as:

                           ∂πj,t                                            ∂Nj,t

We solve for each plan’s choice of bids, and hence premiums, by solving the system of first-order

conditions expressed above using Gauss-Jacobi and SQP. In each step, we solve each plan’s con-

strained optimization problem using the current-iterate bids and the expressions for the bidding

mechanism above, and then generate choice probabilities and update the bid accordingly. Choice

probabilities are generated using Model 4 from Appendix Table 11, where we assume that the shock

interaction effects are all zero, and we use the observed Base Premium Percentage in each year.

   Some of the inputs to this analysis need to be imputed from the data. We observe PDP plan

total and basic premiums for NJ and infer enhanced premiums as the difference between the two.

The NAMBA, Base Beneficiary Premium and Base Premium Percentage are published annually

by CMS, and in the years over which we simulate, they are, respectively, ($92.30, $32.20, 34.88%) in

2006, ($80.43, $27.35, 34.00%) in 2007, ($80.52, $27.93, 34.68%) in 2008, and ($84.33, $30.36, 36.00%)

in 2009. For the purposes of determining monthly per-member subsidies, plan bids are actually

scaled by a risk metric (RxHCC) that varies depending on the average demographic and chronic

conditions of the insurer’s risk pool. We ignore this metric, assuming that the government reinsur-

ance program removes any incentives that may result from the scaling, and assume that each plan is


                                                                69
paid their bid (Bj,t ) plus their enhanced premium (Ej,t ). We assume the enhanced premium is held

fixed at observed levels. The NAMBA is a national average over all MA-PD and PDP plans. We

use our NJ data, and the observed total number of MA and PDP plans included in the NAMBA,

to back out the national sum of MA bids under the assumption that MA and non-NJ PDP plans

have the same average bids. We hold MA plan bids fixed in our calculations. We assume that

non-NJ PDP plan bids change by the same percentage, on average, as the predicted change for NJ

PDP plans.
