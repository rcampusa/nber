Customers and Investors: A Framework for Understanding Financial Institutions

                                          ABSTRACT

Financial institutions have both investors and customers. Investors, such as those who invest in
stocks and bonds or private/public-sector guarantors of institutions, expect an appropriate risk-
adjusted return in exchange for the financing and risk-bearing that they provide. Customers of a
financial intermediary, in contrast, provide financing in exchange for a specific set of services,
and do not want the fulfillment of these services to be contingent on the credit risk of the
intermediary, even when they are not small, uninformed agents lacking in sophistication. This
paper develops a framework that defines the roles of customers and investors in intermediaries,
and uses the framework to provide an economic foundation for the aversion to intermediary credit
risk on the part of its customers. This customer-investor nexus has implications for a host of
issues related to how contracts between financial intermediaries and their customers are
structured and how risks are shared between them, as well as the consequences of (unanticipated)
deviations from the ex ante efficient contractual arrangement for institutional design, regulatory
practices, and financial crises. Moreover, customers and investors are often intertwined in
practice, and so this intertwining provides insights into the adoption of “too-big-to-fail” policies
and bailouts by regulators in general.

1 Introduction
        In three papers, Merton (1989, 1993, 1997) introduced the idea that many types of financial

intermediaries provide “credit-sensitive” financial services, i.e., the effective delivery of these

services depends on the credit-worthiness of the provider.1 The intermediary's credit standing can

generate externalities for the different business activities of the intermediary, even when they are

not directly interconnected through common customers or other such elements. A concrete

example is an investment bank that expresses an interest in participating in a bridge loan as an

attempt to start a merchant banking business and in doing so runs the risk of having institutional

customers flee its over-the-counter derivatives business (e.g. long-dated swap contracts) because

of concerns about the ability of the bank to fulfill its contractual obligations on its derivative

products were it to suffer losses on its bridge loans (see Merton (1997)).2 In various theories of

financial intermediation, the raison d’etre of a financial institution is to serve its customers

(depositors and borrowers in the case of a bank, for example), so the potential sensitivity of the

perceived value of the intermediary’s services to its own credit risk has important implications.

Our main goal in this paper is to study how this aspect of the relationship between a financial

intermediary and its customers affects the design of contracts between intermediaries and their

customers, and how it helps us to better understand commonly-observed features in a wide variety

of real-world contracts, institutions, and regulatory practices.

        Financial institutions differ from non-financial firms in many significant respects. First,

  See also Merton (1992a).

  A specific example of such a scenario is the case of Salomon Brothers and RJR Nabisco. When Salomon expressed
interest in undertaking a leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988, many of Salomon’s credit-sensitive customers
fled because of concerns of how such moves may affect its overall creditworthiness. Salomon’s response to mitigate
this concern in subsequent years was to create a “ring-fenced” AAA-rated subsidiary called Salomon-Swapco as a
counterparty for its OTC customers’ derivatives trades.

what investors in a financial institution purchase looks very similar to what its customers purchase.

For example, investors who buy a bank’s subordinated debt have a financial claim that is similar

to the claim of the bank’s depositors in that both are debt claims on the bank’s cash flows. In

contrast, customers and investors in non-financial firms look quite different—a customer who buys

a General Motors car is transparently different from an investor who buys the company’s bonds.

A second distinguishing feature of financial intermediaries is that their assets and liabilities are

closely related. For example, in a bank one group of customers—borrowers—provide financing to

the bank in the form of deposits (also structured as debt contracts). Thus, the bank has customers

with debt contracts on both sides of its balance sheet. The fact that much of a bank’s assets and

liabilities are comprised of forms of debt also contributes to much higher leverage in banks (and

other financial institutions) compared to non-financial firms. In contrast, in a non-financial firm,

assets and liabilities typically appear to be very different. In an automobile company, for instance,

the assets are manufacturing plant and equipment and its inventory of cars, whereas liabilities are

the money the company has borrowed from investors.

        A third important distinction is that in financial institutions both investors and customers

provide financing to the intermediary.3 Investors, such as stockholders or bondholders of an

intermediary, provide risky financing—they expect the payoffs of their claims to be linked to the

intermediary’s outcomes.           Included among investors are also external guarantors of an

intermediary’s liabilities. Thus, investors provide financing as well as risk-bearing. Customers,

on the other hand, expect services in exchange for the financing they provide, but prefer to not




3
  In non-financial firms, suppliers provide the firm with trade credit, which is short-term financing in the form of
payables. However, customers end up being consumers of finance rather than providers of it. In contrast, in the case
of commercial banks, deposits represent customer-financing and make up typically 70%-80% of the bank’s total
financing.

                                                         3
have the services they receive depend on the fortunes of the provider of the service.4 Here we need

to distinguish between two types of customers. “Credit-sensitive” customers provide financing to

the intermediary in exchange for the provision of future services by the intermediary. The

financing provided by these customers appears as a liability of the intermediary. These customers

derive utility from the services the intermediary provides to them, and this utility is diminished by

an increase in the credit risk of the intermediary. Other customers are those who receive financing

from the intermediary, such as mortgage or other loan borrowers. They appear on the asset side of

the intermediary’s balance sheet, are not credit-sensitive since they have an obligation to repay the

intermediary in the future.

        Our focus in this paper is on “credit-sensitive” customers (we refer to them as just

“customers” henceforth). For these customers, we show that the additional expected return

required to induce them to bear the credit risk of the intermediary exceeds that required to induce

the investor to bear it. Thus, a financial intermediary that imposes credit risk on its customers will

not be able to compete against one that does not. For example, for a whole-life policyholder in a

life insurance company to be indifferent to a lowering of the likelihood that the policy will pay off

in the event of death, the insurance company will have to increase the expected return on the

customer’s investment more than it would have to if it imposed this risk on its investors instead.5

The key here is not the identity of the economic agent, but the role played by that agent, i.e.,

whether the agent is an investor or a customer who also provides the financing. In some instances,



4
  For example, a life insurance company's policyholders are customers who purchase insurance policies, which provide
cash premiums to finance the company’s assets, but also create liabilities for the insurance company. Similarly,
depositors in a bank provide (debt) financing for the bank, but they are also consumers of a variety of safe-keeping,
liquidity and transaction services.
5
  Survey evidence is in line with our main point. Wakker, Thaler, and Tversky (1997) report that respondents in their
surveys said they would pay 20% less for an insurance policy if the probability of default by the insurance company
rises from 0% to 1%. Wakker, Thaler, and Tversky (1997) argue that this is hard to reconcile with standard expected
utility theory. Our framework provides a rational explanation for such behavior.

                                                         4
the agent may play multiple roles, and may therefore have different expectations of the institution

in different roles. For example, a policyholder in an insurance company is a customer but may

also hold the company’s stock as an investor.6 This clarifies that the focus of our analysis is not

on the primitives associated with economic agents—such as their preferences, beliefs, or wealth

endowments—but rather what they view as the optimal contract between them and the

intermediary in a given role. An efficient contract will need to ensure that the credit risk of the

intermediary is borne by the right party, and we argue that this is the investor, not the customer.

         The questions we address in this paper are: what are the implications of this customer-

investor nexus for how the financial intermediaries structure efficient (first-best) contracts with

their customers? How does this perspective help us to understand the microfoundations of

observed (second-best) contracts between intermediaries and their customers? And does it help

us better comprehend certain aspects of financial crises, especially the early triggers?

         In our discussion, we make a number of observations that shed light on these questions and

also suggest an agenda for future research. First, we begin with a discussion of the first-best

contract, and argue that as long as the contract with the customer is creating a positive social

surplus, it is optimal for the intermediary to structure the contract so that it is as insensitive as

possible to the fortunes of the intermediary itself.7 This means that the first-best is a contractual

arrangement in which the customer is exposed only to the risk inherent in the contract terms—the




6
  As another example, consider an agent who has a deposit account at a bank and also owns equity in the bank, making
him/her both an investor and a customer. However, our argument is that the expectation of what the two contracts will
provide is different. For the deposit account, the agent cares about the service the bank supplies, and will want to
minimize his/her exposure to the credit risk of the bank. In contrast, for the equity share, the agent expects the credit
risk of the bank to be reflected in the risk/return tradeoff of the contract.

risk that the contract itself has specified—and not to the credit risk of the intermediary itself.8 Put

another way, it is not simply that a customer is averse to the contractually-stipulated riskiness of

cash flows, but that a customer is effectively “risk averse” with respect to the contract itself not

being fulfilled. This is something that can occur due to inefficient risk-bearing created by the

customer being exposed to the credit risk of the intermediary. At a basic level, exposing the

customer to this credit risk is akin to affixing a lottery to the customer’s contract which adds

unnecessary risk-bearing with no added gain. In contrast to risk-sharing, this added uncertainty

does not have social value, as the customer’s uncertainty is increased and no other agent’s

uncertainty is reduced. Investors, by comparison, are in the business of bearing this risk. In a

simple analytical example in which customers attach separable values to the monetary flows and

the services provided by the intermediary, we explain how exposure of the customer’s contract to

the idiosyncratic credit risk of the intermediary can result in an inefficient loss of economic surplus.

An example of this effect would be a customer that has an annuity contract which is dependent on

the fortunes of the issuing firm (and thus is suboptimal for the customer). That customer may

optimally want to replicate that contract by purchasing small portions of that annuity from, say,

1000 different intermediaries. However, transactions costs for the customer would make doing so

prohibitive. We point out that this desire on the customer’s part to not be exposed to the credit risk

of the intermediary can also be viewed as a manifestation of a particular form of market

incompleteness. We discuss the reasons why these markets are incomplete.

        To illustrate this point further, consider briefly some examples; these are developed in more

detail in Section 4. A bank depositor is a customer who wants a sure payoff that is not exposed to


8
 In other words, a customer may understand that the contract he/she purchases from an intermediary may have a risky
payoff (for example, a mutual fund account that is indexed to the S&P 500). However, the customer does not want
any uncertainty about receiving the promised payoff because the intermediary is insolvent.


                                                        6
the credit risk of the bank; those who guarantee these deposits in some way (e.g. the shareholders

and the subordinated debtholders implicitly and the deposit insurer explicitly) are investors who

bear the risks that depositors do not.9 Similarly, when a customer purchases an annuity, the

customer is guaranteed certain income, even though the value of the annuity is stochastic. By

contrast, a bond sold by the same institution represents a claim held by investors who are exposed

to the idiosyncratic risk of the institution. Another example is a homeowner who purchases

property insurance from an insurance company. The policyholder does not wish to bear any risk

of not receiving the promised payoff in the state of the world in which the home is destroyed and

the insurance needs to pay off. Shareholders and those who purchase bonds in the company are

the insurance company’s investors. Yet another example of customers who are not exposed to the

intermediary’s credit risk are those who invest in a mutual fund, say Vanguard’s S&P 500 fund.

They receive efficient risk-adjusted returns in a CAPM sense because the risk of the fund not

paying out is remote.

         Second, there are many possible reasons why this insensitivity is achieved in the efficient

contract by creating a de facto firewall between the customer's contract and the intermediary's

credit risk, rather than by letting the customer bear some of that risk in exchange for a lower price

of the contract. Our reasoning proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we argue that the market

incompleteness mentioned above constrains the customer’s ability to diversify away the

intermediary’s credit risk if this risk were to be imposed on the customer. As a result, customers

are not the best suited to bear this risk—it becomes undiversifiable idiosyncratic risk to customers,

and intermediaries that attempt to compensate customers for this risk will not be competitive

against intermediaries that instead insulate customers from it. In the second step, we discuss two

reasons why there is this kind of market incompleteness—moral hazard and adverse selection.

         The essence of our explanation for the insulation of the customer from the credit risk of the

intermediary is that the intermediary is providing the customer a vector of services—a monetary

payoff and also a non-monetary service—and this creates a positive economic surplus. Thus, the

loss of this surplus due to the failure of the intermediary would represent a net social loss, and the

efficient (first-best) contract will be designed to minimize this loss. In the conceptualization of

the efficient contract, two pertinent facts about the contract should be noted. One is that the service

the intermediary provides the customer involves a contractual relationship between the

intermediary and the customer, and—for reasons of moral hazard and adverse selection—it cannot

be replicated by a claim that is traded in an anonymous market in which its value is independent

of the institution offering the service. The other is that the monetary and service components of

the contract are often inseparable in the sense that the service is indeed the provision of a specific,

contractually-stipulated monetary payoff stream. The combination of these two facts means that

the market for the customer’s contract is essentially incomplete—one cannot buy a portfolio of

primitive claims from anonymous agents to achieve the same vector of services provided by the

intermediary.10 Moreover, the economic essence for the existence of the intermediary implies that

it is inefficient for the customer to replace the contract with a large number of smaller contract

purchased from different intermediaries. This incompleteness necessitates a linkage between the

intermediary and the customer’s contract and therefore creates a potential (off-the-equilibrium-

path) exposure to the credit risk of the intermediary that the customer cannot diversify away.

Asking the customer to bear this idiosyncratic risk is therefore inefficient and the intermediary

attempts to make the customer’s contract insensitive to the credit risk of the intermediary.


10
  Indeed, the very existence of the intermediary implies that the market is incomplete, sans that intermediary, for its
customers.

                                                          8
         Third, we turn to the second-best contract, which is constrained-efficient in the sense that

the intermediary may face financing frictions—due to adverse selection and/or moral hazard—and

thus may find it infeasible or prohibitively expensive to completely insulate the customer from the

credit risk of the intermediary. In this case, there is a tradeoff between the loss of efficiency

(relative to the first-best) from exposing the customer to the intermediary’s credit risk on the one

hand, and the cost of insulating the customer from this credit risk on the other hand. Consequently,

the second-best contract may expose the customer to some of the credit risk of the intermediary,

absent government intervention. Indeed, government intervention in some cases may be

rationalized by the desire to eliminate or reduce these costs.

         Fourth, we argue that the efficiency of insulating the customer from the credit risk of the

intermediary and the possible lack of perfect insulation in the second-best can explain a variety of

observed real-world contracts, institutions, and practices. The contracts that are rationalized by the

framework developed in this paper are: government-guaranteed (riskless) bank deposits, mutual

funds, insurance contracts, and repos in shadow banking.11 We argue that our framework also

produces a new perspective on another financial contract: contingent-capital (CoCo) bonds in

banking that have been recently proposed as a way to infuse more risk-absorbing capital into banks

during periods of stress (see Flannery (2013), for example).12 An institution we analyze with our

framework is a futures exchange.

         Our framework offers insights into some regulatory practices in banking. One of these is

the practice of protecting the largest banks in an economy by considering them as “too big to fail”

(TBTF) while small banks are allowed to fail.13 To understand this, we argue that bigger banks

   For mutual funds, the exception is if the mutual fund is providing liquidity services for cash.

   Adoption in Europe of CoCos is going on now.

   See Kaufman (2013) for a discussion of too-big-to-fail.

are more complex than smaller banks in many ways. The complexity of interest to us involves the

greater intertwining of customers and investors in bigger banks. The bigger the bank, the more

difficult it becomes to keep separate investors from customers, so the second-best contract between

the bank and its customers exposes customers to more credit risk than in less complex

organizations. If the bank is allowed to fail, it also hurts customers as this intertwining means that

there is no easy way to protect customers while exposing investors to credit risk. It thus may be

necessary to provide guarantees to investors in order to protect customers. The greater loss in net

social surplus from the damage sustained by customers in large banks compared to small banks

provides a novel economic rationale for too-big-to-fail policies in an environment in which banks

rely on second-best contracts with customers and limited government resources force the

government to choose to bail out only a subset of banks.14 This desire to protect customers from

the credit risks of their institutions has motivated many government-assisted rescues. For example,

the Federal Reserve stepped in to assist Bear Stearns when it was on the verge of collapse in 2008

because of a concern about the possible effect of its failure on the customers of the investment

bank; it was involved in trillions of dollars of repo agreements and swap contracts. In the process,

of course, the investors of Bear Stearns were also protected. While such interventions are most

common in financial services, they have occasionally occurred even for non-financial firms, but

for the same logic—the protection of customers.15 Thus, an important empirical implication of

our analysis is that government bailouts are most likely to occur when the failure of the institution

is expected to significantly hurt customers and it is difficult to protect customers without also




14
   We want to emphasize that what is at issue here is not just the sheer size of the bank’s balance sheet, but rather its
complexity that leads to intertwining of credit-sensitive customers and investors and thereby the systemic nature of
the risk involved in large bank failures. We elaborate on this in Section 5.
15
   For example, the government’s bailout of GM and Chrysler during the 2007-2008 financial crisis was also partly
motivated by the desire to protect customers.

protecting investors.

        Another regulatory initiative we analyze with our framework is the Dodd-Frank Act, a

major financial services regulation enacted in 2010 in response to the 2008-2009 global financial

crisis. The element of this regulation we focus on is the requirement for swaps to be traded through

clearing houses and exchanges. We argue that this feature finds economic foundation in our

analysis.

        The final part of our analysis extends the framework to examine financial crises, and

particularly how they are propagated. A crisis can be thought of as an event that is outside of

agents’ “model of the world” —when the event happens (to which the agents may have assigned

an arbitrarily low probability, effectively zero, ex ante), agents cannot comprehend it and are

therefore unable to engage in the usual Bayesian belief revision contingent on observing the event.

Consequently, they do not quite know how to react. This is somewhat similar to the idea of

“neglected risks” in Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012, 2015),16 and is closely related to the

idea of a customer who purchases a contract with an embedded promise of no exposure to the

credit risk of the selling intermediary—the customer believes that the contract is first-best and so

one does not need to worry about the solvency of the intermediary. When the customer

subsequently experiences financial distress of the issuing intermediary, an event that was believed

could not happen, the customer has no contingency—even a mental one—for this event. Hence,

with the discovery that this is a second-best contract whose value depends on the financial health

of the selling intermediary, the customer does not know how to react. This connection allows us

to understand how crises may spread through the customer-investor nexus that we describe. To

illustrate, suppose that there is a customer who assumes a particular “model of the world” (i.e. the


16
  The psychological foundations for why agents may not fully take into account all their information are provided
by Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012) and Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010).

                                                        11
customer believes that a contract is not dependent on the intermediary’s credit risk) but who then

observes an outcome that is contrary to his prior belief about the model of the world. This may

cause the customer to question his own “first level” prior beliefs about his model of the world,

rather than simply arriving smoothly at a Bayesian posterior belief based on the observed outcome.

A shift in the first level of priors over the correct model of the world can cause customers to

terminate their contractual relationships with the intermediaries, causing a drying up of funding

from that source for intermediaries, and triggering/propagating a crisis.

       The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related

literature. In Section 3, we present the basic framework of a financial intermediary with investors

and customers and discuss the first-best contract. We provide various examples involving real-

world intermediaries that correspond to our abstract construct. We discuss the economic argument

for insulating the claims of customers from the fortunes of the intermediary in the first-best. We

then proceed to discuss, in Section 4, why such separation between the contract and the credit risk

of the intermediary can be less than perfect in the second-best contract, and explore the steps

intermediaries can take to provide customers as much insulation as possible, even in these cases.

We show how the degree of exposure of the customer to the credit risk of the intermediary in the

second-best contract is determined. Section 5 turns to regulatory practices, and uses the framework

to discuss the Dodd-Frank Act and why too-big-to-fail policies make sense even without concerns

about systemic risk. Section 6 discusses financial crisis triggers in this framework, with a more

formal framework presented in the Appendix. Section 7 provides concluding remarks.




2 Related Literature
       Our paper is related to a strand of the literature which rationalizes why bank deposit

                                                12
contracts are designed to be information-insensitive. Gorton and Pennacchi (1990) first explained

that agents who lack the skills to efficiently acquire and process information would prefer to invest

in instruments that are informationally insensitive, and that depositors were agents of this type.

The reason is that when an uninformed agent trades against an informed agent, the uninformed

agent loses on average. Therefore, informationally-sensitive contracts are less liquid than

informationally-insensitive contracts, and liquidity-seeking agents prefer to invest in deposits that

are riskless and hence informationally-insensitive. Since then, others have rationalized debt

contracts that are optimally informationally-insensitive for a variety of reasons, including optimal

risk sharing. See Dang, Gorton, Holmstrom, and Ordonez (2014), and Holmstrom (2015).

            For example, the Dang, Gorton, Holmstrom, and Ordonez (2014) paper relies on the

Hirshleifer (1971) notion that information may sometimes not be released because its release can

distort risk sharing. In their model, there are two generations of depositors, who are effectively

risk-averse.17 The early generation of depositors will wish to sell their claims to the late generation

if hit by a liquidity shock. The liquidity needs make these depositors risk averse to changes in the

values of their claims, and so they do not want the late depositors to produce costly information

about the value of the bank’s assets, since this would make their exit price contingent on this

information and hence stochastic. The bank will oblige by not releasing the information it has

about its own assets and by investing in opaque assets that would discourage the second generation

of depositors from producing information. Thus, the bank in this setting should optimally be

opaque—it should withhold information about the bank’s risk from depositors. Gorton and

Ordonez (2014) use this idea of the demand for information-insensitive debt to argue that a

financial crisis can arise if a shock causes holders of such debt to wish to produce information

     The assumption is that their utilities are piecewise linear, but globally concave.

about the collateral backing the debt, as this will lead to a decline in output.

         A somewhat different perspective on why bank deposits are (optimally) riskfree, at least

asymptotically, is provided by earlier work that rationalized financial intermediaries based on

informational frictions. In both Diamond (1984) and Ramakrishnan and Thakor (1984), it is

efficient for the intermediary to diversify away the idiosyncratic risks of individual loans (or

funded projects), so that even if an individual loan that is monitored/screened by the bank remains

(partially) opaque, the bank itself becomes riskfree. The optimality of such an intermediary does

not depend on depositor risk aversion, however.18

         Our focus differs from this previous work in a number of ways. First, in our framework, it

is not only bank deposits that should be optimally insulated from the credit risk of the bank—and

hence insensitive to whatever information might exist about the bank—but all efficient contracts

between the financial intermediary and its customers should be insulated. This includes a far bigger

set of contracts than bank deposits. Second, in our framework, the efficient claim of the customer

need not be riskless—it can be risky, but the risk must be confined to the promised contingent

payoffs of the contract itself and cannot include the credit risk of the intermediary. Third, we

address the important question of why all of the credit risk and informational risk should be borne

by the intermediary's investors in the first-best case, and not by its customers, and we also use our

framework to shed new light on issues like too-big-to-fail and the triggers of financial crises.

Finally, our main finding that the value of the customer’s claim must be independent of the credit

risk of the intermediary in the first-best does not depend on information acquisition by customers




18
   And these papers reach essentially the same conclusion of riskfree deposits as Dang, Holmstrom, Gorton, and
Ordonez (2014), but reverse the causality in the argument—the bank is not opaque because it wants to appear
informationally-insensitive to its depositors, but rather it diversifies away the idiosyncratic risk associated with each
individually-opaque asset it monitors/screens in order to reduce contracting costs and thus asymptotically eliminate
risk for its depositors, so that its overall asset portfolio is indeed transparently riskfree to its depositors.

being costly or inherently inimical to stability. Rather, our approach suggests that in well-

functioning markets, customers (such as depositors) do not have a need for their contracts to be

opaque, since their contracts should be optimally structured to insulate them from the risks of the

service-providing intermediaries. While opaqueness may be beneficial to producers (e.g. banks),

our analysis suggests that it need not be beneficial to customers. In other words, customers will be

indifferent to opaqueness as long as their claims do not depend on the fortunes of the intermediary.

Therefore, in high-quality debt markets, it need not be the case that transparency causes

dysfunction or that opaqueness is necessary.

       Our paper is also related to the literature on the functional perspective in finance (for

example, Merton (1993, 1995), Merton and Bodie (1995), and Merton and Bodie (2005); see

Campbell and Wilson (2014) for a review). In particular, our focus in this paper is on the functions

that financial intermediaries serve in meeting the needs of their customers. Thus, while we list

specific contracts and institutions as applications of our framework, these serve mainly as

examples of the functions we seek to highlight in the customer-intermediary interaction. This is in

line with the functional perspective, which also focuses on the economic functions served rather

than the specifics of the institutions that serve them.




3 Financial Intermediaries and Customers

3.1 Motivation

       Financial intermediaries have customers and investors as key stakeholders. As we pointed

out in the Introduction, the crucial difference between a customer and an investor lies not in who

provides financing—both do—but in who bears intermediary-specific risk. In what follows, we



                                                  15
will show that the efficient (first-best) contract is such that investors bear this risk, but customers

do not. By “first-best”, we mean that the intermediary does not face any financial frictions in

raising financing from investors or in purchasing guarantees in the capital market that can insulate

its customers from its own credit risk. The labels “customer” and “investor” refer to roles rather

than individual. Thus, an agent may be both a customer and an investor of the same institution, by

purchasing products/services and also providing risk-bearing financing. It is, however, essential to

keep separate the two roles and not attempt to combine them in cases where the same agent serves

both roles. In our discussion, we will generally refer to a customer-financier as simply a

“customer”.

       Customers of an intermediary may want services where the outcome is risky in the sense

that the payoff is random, but they do not want the outcome to be dependent on the credit risk of

the intermediary. For example, a customer of a brokerage firm who purchases a share in the S&P

500 through that broker expects the performance of that purchase to be uncertain. However, the

customer does not want the position to be dependent on the fortunes of the brokerage firm.

Customers who have this risk are transformed into investors, which they do not wish to be.

       As discussed in the Introduction, in a financial intermediary, a distinction can be made

between two types of customers: “credit-insensitive” customers—those whose interaction with the

intermediary is such that they are largely unconcerned about the intermediary’s credit risk—and

“credit sensitive” customers, who care about the intermediary’s credit risk. Credit-insensitive

customers do not provide financing to the intermediary and essentially pay for what they purchase

after they purchase it, which means the intermediary’s credit risk does not have an impact on the

supply of the service to them by the intermediary. Examples include an individual who asks a

broker to purchase a security on his behalf and pays the brokerage commission when the trade is



                                                  16
executed, a home seller who pays a commission to the real estate broker (intermediary) when the

house is sold, and a borrower who gets a bank loan. Credit-sensitive customers are those who

provide the intermediary financing by essentially paying for the services up-front, and

subsequently receiving these services over time. Because the receipt of the services that have

already been paid for is contingent on the survival of the intermediary, the value of the services to

the customer becomes dependent on the intermediary’s credit risk. Examples are bank depositors,

insurance company annuity and life insurance policyholders, and those who purchase standby

letters of credit from banks.     Thus, both types of customers purchase services from the

intermediary—for example, a bank’s depositors purchase the service of having a safe place to keep

cash that is available on demand and accumulates interest, whereas its borrowers view the bank as

a source of loanable funds. Our focus is on credit-sensitive customers, who we refer to as

“customers” for short.

       It should be noted that the customers we focus on in our analysis are not simply “widows

and orphans” or unsophisticated investors. A customer could be a large institution, such as the

World Bank or a large pension fund. Thus, the desire to be insulated from the credit risk of the

intermediary is not limited only to customers who are informationally-disadvantaged in trading

with informed investors, as in Gorton and Pennacchi (1990). The key is that the customer demands

a specific set of services, and is averse to any risk that the set of services specified by the

intermediary may not be fulfilled. What we argue is that this aversion does not necessarily spring

from primitive preferences (i.e. concave utility or risk aversion), but rather is rooted in the

efficiency of the intermediary’s contracts with its customers and its investors. In essence, when

the customer is exposed to the credit risk of the intermediary, an unnecessary lottery is added to

the contract, which makes it inefficient for the customer. An intermediary’s investors are the ones



                                                 17
who are willing to take this risk. So the World Bank may want to hedge its interest rate exposure

costs efficiently, and thus hold large exposures to those rates through relatively few financial

intermediaries. It can only do so prudently if it is satisfied that the promised payments on its swaps

will be made.



3.2 Analytic Setting: Efficient Customer Contracts

       To fix ideas more concretely, we now introduce a simple analytic example to help the

exposition of our analysis. Let V be the value of the service that an intermediary provides to its

customer. It is the monetary equivalent of the expected utility (or the certainty-equivalent of the

expected utility) that the customer gets at t = 0 from the intermediary’s services, and can have

many components, as we discuss below. Thus, if the customer is a depositor, then V could

represent the monetary value the depositor attaches to having access to a liquid claim at a moment's

notice, being able to write checks against the deposit account to conduct transactions, availing of

safe-keeping services associated with being able to deposit money in a secure place, etc. For a

policyholder in an insurance company, V could represent the value of the utility the individual

derives from being able to insure against an accident or a catastrophic event like death. In all of

these cases, the contract calls for the customer to provide a set of payments ft to the intermediary

at various dates t  [0, T ] , where [0, T ] is the period over which the contract exists, in exchange

for a vector of services that may include future monetary payments.

       More specifically, from the perspective of the customer, V includes two components. The

first component is Vm , which is the monetary equivalent of the utility that the customer derives

based on the net monetary flows between the customer and the intermediary—i.e., the money ft

flows from the customer to the intermediary, and whatever (possibly state-contingent) money F is

                                                 18
paid by the intermediary to the customer as part of the service. In a bank, F could be the amount

of deposits (plus interest) withdrawn by the depositor.19 In an insurance context, F would be the

payment made by the insurance company in the event of an accident or death. While F may be

deterministic, it can also be stochastic. The second component is Vs , which is the monetary

equivalent of the utility the customer derives from the services provided by the intermediary. As

an example, if the customer is a bank depositor, then Vm would be the monetary equivalent of the

depositor’s utility from receiving interest on the deposit (the difference between what the bank

returns to the depositor and what was deposited in the bank), whereas Vs would include the

monetary equivalent of the utility associated with check-writing privileges (access to liquidity),

safe-keeping services, cash management advice, etc. Put together, the two components sum up to

V, so Vm + Vs = V.

        Now define V
                   ̅ to be the monetary equivalent of the reservation utility of the depositor—it

will capture the opportunity cost for the depositor to use bank deposits rather than invest the money

elsewhere, say in a money market mutual fund. Satisfaction of the depositor’s participation

constraint requires

                                                   Vm + Vs = V ≥ V
                                                                 ̅                                             (1)

Let k > 0 be the cost to the intermediary of providing the vector of services that the customer

values, and VIm the monetary value (in dollars) at t = 0 to the intermediary of obtaining financing

from the customer. Figure 1 below describes the relationship between the intermediary and the

customer in terms of the values and costs of the financing provided by the intermediary and the

value of the services provided by the intermediary.



19
  Put another way, Vm is the monetary equivalent value of the expected utility from F – PV(∑𝑡 ft ), which represents
the present value of all monetary flows. There need not be only one withdrawal. With multiple withdrawals, F would
be the present value of all withdrawals.

                                                        19
                      Figure 1: Values and Costs of Financing and Services




        We assume that

                                                VIm ̶ k > 0                                      (2)

Taken together, (1) and (2) imply that intermediation creates a positive net economic surplus. This

net surplus (in dollars) is

                                                ̅ + VIm ̶ k > 0
                                            V ̶ V                                                (3)

We can attribute this surplus to the specialization-related skills that provide the economic rationale

for the existence of the financial intermediary. Let the duration of the contract between the

intermediary and the customer be over the time period [0,T].

        For simplicity of exposition, suppose the contract is entered into at t = 0, at which date the

customer provides financing, and then the contract is fulfilled at a single date t = T, at which time

the intermediary provides all of the services the customer values at V. Let p  [0,1] be the

probability that the intermediary will be solvent at t = T, and only if it is solvent can the services

valued by the customer be provided. Thus, 1 – p, the complement of this probability, represents

                                                 20
the idiosyncratic credit risk of the intermediary that the contract is exposed to. The value of the

contract to the customer now becomes pV, and the participation constraint now becomes pV ≥ V
                                                                                           ̅.

Thus, the customer’s net expected economic surplus relative to its other options is pV ̶ V
                                                                                         ̅. This

net surplus is V ̶ V
                   ̅ if there is no credit risk, which means that the expected loss of net economic

surplus due to the intermediary’s credit risk is [1 ̶ p]V. The total expected value (to both the

intermediary and the customer) due to the contract is pV + VIm , and the total net expected economic

surplus considering the intermediary’s cost of service provision k and the customer’s alternative

to the contract is pV + VIm ̶ [V
                               ̅ + k].20 If there is no intermediary credit risk, the net economic

surplus is V + VIm ̶ [V
                      ̅ + k]. This means that the expected loss of net economic surplus due to the

credit risk of the intermediary is [1 ̶ p]V, a quantity that is increasing in the intermediary’s credit

risk, [1 – p]. We call this a “customer contract fulfillment” (CCF) cost. The efficient contract drives

this cost down to zero.

         Figure 2 below shows how the total economic value of the contract (to the customer and

the intermediary) surplus and the customer’s share of this total contract value behave as functions

of the intermediary’s credit risk, 1 – p. It is easy to verify that the total economic value line has

the same slope as the customer’s contract value line. In Figure 2, for any given contract, 1 ̶ p0 is

the intermediary credit risk at which the customer’s net expected economic surplus, pV ̶ V
                                                                                         ̅,

becomes zero, and 1 ̶ p* is the intermediary credit risk at which the total expected net economic

surplus pV + VIm ̶ [V
                    ̅ + k] becomes zero. It is straightforward to verify that 1 ̶ p* > 1 ̶ p0 .




20
   VIm is not multiplied by p in these expressions because all financing is provided by the customer up front at t = 0.
Thus, insolvency on the part of the intermediary at a later date will not reduce the value to the intermediary of obtaining
financing from the customer.

                                                           21
     Figure 2: The Effect of Intermediary Credit Risk on Contract Value and Expected Net

                                                Economic Surplus




         Two points are worth noting. First, if the intermediary exposes the contract to its own

credit risk, the customer cannot recover the entire loss of surplus by hedging this risk—say by

buying a put option on the intermediary. The reason is that such risk mitigation can prevent the

expected loss of at most [1 ̶ p]Vm of the contract value to the customer, as the expected loss of

the service portion of the contract value to the customer, [1 ̶ p]Vs , is unrecoverable. This results

in a value wedge or deadweight loss in terms of economic surplus. To ensure that the surplus

related to this part of the contract value is not lost, the intermediary has to be solvent at t = T.21


21
  Thus, another way of thinking about V in relation to the earlier discussion, is that Vm could be viewed as the monetary
equivalent of the standard utility over wealth for risk-taking (i.e., the monetary flows that the contract stipulates is

                                                          22
Second, this suggests that the more efficient solution is for the intermediary to undertake risk

mitigation to insulate the contract from its own credit risk, rather than expect the customer to do

it. Merton (1997) identifies various ways in which the intermediary can do this: hedging,

purchasing insurance from a guarantor, and keeping sufficient equity capital on its balance sheet.

        It is important to note that this result does not depend on risk aversion, in the traditional

sense, on the part of the customer. Risk aversion (for example, making the customer infinitely risk

averse) may be one particular way to capture this phenomenon. But if one resorts to this

explanation, then it should be emphasized that this would be risk aversion with respect to the

uncertainty about the ability of the intermediary to deliver the embedded promise in the contract

itself, and not necessarily the randomness in the final payoffs that contract might specify the

customer would be exposed to. For example, a customer may indeed expect the final payoffs of

the contract to be risky (as in a stock index mutual fund or a swap contract), but it is not risk

aversion with respect to these payoffs that should play a special role in any explanation based on

the risk aversion of customers. That is, the normal concept of risk aversion from holding stocks

and bonds does not accurately capture the behavior of customers that we are discussing here, where

we are comparing the efficacy of alternative contracts with the financial intermediary.



3.3 The Inefficiency of Risk Mitigation by the Customer

        There are two ways in which a financial intermediary’s customer can mitigate the

intermediary’s credit risk if such risk is imposed on the customer: (i) by diversifying across many

intermediaries, or (ii) by accessing an Arrow-Debreu market in primitive state securities to




risky), while Vs can be viewed as a separate component for the services the intermediary provides, which the customer
wants to be credit-insensitive.

                                                         23
replicate the vector of services provided by the intermediary without being exposed to the credit

risk of the intermediary. We explain now why both are either inefficient or infeasible.

        First, consider (i). To diversify away the intermediary’s idiosyncratic credit risk, the

customer would have to replace the contract that it has with a single intermediary with a large

number of smaller contracts with many intermediaries. However, one reason why we have

financial intermediaries is that they achieve economies of scale and scope and reduce transaction

costs; in our model, this would be reflected in k being, say, invariant to or concave in the size of

the intermediary’s contract with the customer. Thus, any attempt on the customer’s part to

diversify across intermediaries will inherently be inefficient due to transaction costs.

        Now consider (ii). Our argument is that replicating services is infeasible because of market

incompleteness in contracting. The incompleteness is that the customer cannot purchase a separate

(Arrow-Debreu) claim that would deliver the service that the intermediary provides when it is

solvent. That is, the intermediary is unique in providing its service once it has entered into a

contract with the customer. In a complete market, the monetary and service component of the

intermediary’s contract would be traded separately as bundles of primitive Arrow-Debreu claims.

This would enable the customer to purchase market-based insurance against the intermediary’s

credit risk. But this is often physically impossible because the service the intermediary provides is

inseparable from the monetary component of the contract, as explained in the Introduction.22

        But even if physical separability of these two components was possible, markets for

intermediary services to customers would not be complete because the service is something that

has to involve a contractual relationship between the intermediary and the customer—it cannot be

something remote from the intermediary that can be traded in an anonymous market and purchased


 The possibility of purchasing such primitive claims (with no contract risk) to replicate the desired payoff would
22

mean that there would be no economic role for the financial intermediary in the first place.

                                                       24
by the customer. This essential coupling of a specific intermediary with a specific customer often

generates valuable customer-specific information that is available privately only to the

intermediary, information that the intermediary can use to enhance the value of its service to the

customer. This rules out a complete market in which state-contingent claims can be created with

values that depend only on states of the world and not on the “institutional affiliation” of each

claim.23

         One could argue that one way to get around this problem would be to have a third party

purchase the service the intermediary is providing the customer and have it as part of a separate

contract that is now decoupled from the intermediary. However, such an arrangement suffers from

moral hazard and adverse selection frictions, as we discuss next.



3.4 Moral Hazard as a Source of Market Incompleteness

         Another reason why the optimal contract should be insulated from the credit risk of the

intermediary is moral hazard, which is an important element of many contracts (e.g. Holmstrom

(1979)). We argue in this section that it can stand in the way of a complete market in customer

contracts. In the framework described above, moral hazard can come in two forms. If k, the

intermediary’s cost of providing services is unobservable and cannot directly be contracted upon,

then the intermediary may underinvest in service provision. For example, a depositor in a bank

may be a small business that views cash management advice as part of the services the bank

provides depositors, and the bank can underinvest in the personnel capable of providing this

advice. Another example is a mutual fund company that offers its customers the choice of



23
  This is somewhat similar to the idea in Froot and Stein (1998) that financial institutions hedge the risk of illiquid
assets in the capital market.

                                                          25
allocating their savings across multiple mutual funds managed by the company. 24 Part of the

services valued by the customers may be the advice fund employees can offer on how the customer

should allocate funds, based on personal financial goals. The fund company can underinvest in

the provision of this service by employing fewer people, so customers have to experience long

waiting times when they call. The key here is that the service the customer receives has already

been paid for by the customer, so the usual contractual resolution of moral hazard, namely

conditioning the intermediary’s payment on the service provided, does not work here.

         A second kind of moral hazard arises from the intermediary’s incentives to take excessive

risk. Because the customer’s financial claim is a variant of a debt contract, the intermediary’s

(shareholders’) payoff is isomorphic to a call option on the total payoff of the intermediary. This

can lead to excessive risk taking at the expense of the customer.25

         While insulating the contract from the intermediary’s credit risk will not fully resolve the

first kind of moral hazard, not insulating the contract will worsen it. The reason is that a

financially-distressed intermediary has stronger incentives’ to underinvest in serving the

customer.26 It is clear that insulating the contract from the credit risk of the intermediary

completely resolves the second kind of moral hazard.

         Moral hazard thus provides another powerful reason for the intermediary to pre-commit to

not expose its customers to its own credit risk, and take steps to either mitigate it in the financial

market or transfer it to the shareholders (pure investors). Doing this not only lessens the moral

hazard but also preserves more of the surplus the intermediary is able to create by contracting with




24
   For example, Fidelity and Vanguard give their customers the ability to split their investments across dozens of
funds.
25
   See Merton (1977), but this may not always be the case (e.g. Merton (1992b)).
26
   While the ship is sinking, the intermediary’s attention is likely to be focused on cost-cutting rather than customer
service, since this conserves financial resources.

                                                         26
the customer, thereby reducing the customer contract fulfillment cost. Of course, in the second-

best case, moral hazard may impede the ability of the intermediary to insulate its customers from

its own credit risk, and may thus distort the outcome away from the efficient separation between

the intermediary-customer contract and the intermediary’s credit risk achieved in the first-best



3.5 Adverse Selection as a Source of Market Incompleteness

       While different intermediaries may offer exactly the same contract to customers, so that

customers can evaluate the contract independently of which intermediary is offering it, the

intermediaries themselves may be quite different from each other. As long as the contract is

insulated from the credit risk of the intermediary, this cross-sectional heterogeneity is irrelevant.

But if the credit risk of the intermediary is commingled with the risk embedded in the contract

payoffs to the customer, then the customer needs to discover the credit risk of each intermediary.

This may be costly, so not insulating the contract from the credit risk of the intermediary can result

in wasteful investigation costs.

       But discovering each intermediary’s credit risk may not be enough. The customer may

need to also learn how this credit risk will affect the contract between the intermediary and the

customer. This may be very difficult, so in the end it may prove to be prohibitively costly for the

customer to acquire the necessary information about the true risk in the contract through its

exposure to the credit risk of the intermediary. In such a situation we will have adverse selection—

each intermediary knows more about its own credit risk and the implications of this for its contract

with the customer than the customer does.

       As Akerlof (1970) showed, adverse selection can cause a market breakdown. In our

framework, suppose that it is common knowledge among potential customers that the value of p


                                                 27
varies in an a priori unobservable way among intermediaries. Each intermediary knows its own p

privately. Others only know that p is distributed in the cross-section according to a probability

density function h(·). Then, if all financial intermediaries offer the same (pooling) contract to

customers, they will value it at

                                                                                                 (4)
                                            ∫ Vpf(p) dp = pV

And for p < p* , no contracting will occur because the total economic surplus will be negative. In

such instances, financial intermediaries will have a strong incentive to insulate their contracts with

customers from their own credit risk.

       This insulation, if it can be achieved, will succeed in allowing intermediaries to raise

financing from customers. But what will be the impact of adverse selection on the intermediary’s

ability to raise financing from investors? In other words, the more the intermediary insulates the

customer from adverse selection, the more of the adverse selection it shifts to the investors. This

has not been an issue thus far because we have been discussing the first-best contract where the

intermediary does not face any frictions in raising financing from investors. However, in the

second-best contract, when such frictions are encountered, an important question arises: why is it

economically more efficient for the risk/cost of adverse selection to be borne by investors rather

than by customers?

       This question is central to understanding why the efficient contract involves intermediaries

insulating customers from their own credit risks, and what the limits of this insulation might be in

the second-best case. We know from the work of Myers and Majluf (1984) that adverse selection

in the market for raising financing can generate serious distortions, including firms eschewing

positive-NPV projects. So, why are financial intermediaries willing to expose themselves to these

potential distortions in order to insure customers against this risk?

                                                 28
         An economic rationale for this lies in the fact that securities are traded in the capital market,

whereas the claims of customers are not. We explained earlier, in the context of market

incompleteness of the contract between the intermediary and its customers, why the claims of

customers are typically not traded. Right now, we focus on how this tradability distinction between

investors and customers leads to the optimal allocation of risk between them.

         When the financial intermediary raises financing from investors, the adverse selection

creates incentives for some agents to invest in acquiring privately-costly information to learn

which intermediaries in the pool of ex ante observationally identical intermediaries are more highly

valued. In a market microstructure model such as Kyle (1985), the informed agents are able to

earn trading profits due to their knowledge of which firms are overvalued and which are

undervalued, and this is possible because noise trading prevents all of the information possessed

by the informed traders from being reflected in market prices.27 This preserves the incentives for

some investors to become informed, and also results in some of the adverse selection problem

being dissipated.28 This is because although not all of the information of the informed investors is

reflected in prices, some of this information is incorporated into prices due to rational inferences

by the market maker based on observing the total order flow in the equity of the intermediary.

That is, due to the trades of informed investors, intermediaries with different (privately-known)

values trade at different prices in equilibrium, with higher-valued firms trading on average at

higher prices.      Consequently, active trading helps to lower the adverse-selection costs that

intermediaries face in raising capital from investors.



27
   We could think of noise traders whose trading motives are not related to private information about asset values and
are thus exogenous and random.
28
   It is also possible that each informed trader has a different piece of information, so that the market-clearing price
aggregates over all these disparate pieces of information and the market thus “knows” more than any one individual,
or even the intermediary itself. This is the essence of Hayek’s (1945) case for the superiority of decentralized market
outcomes over central planning.

                                                          29
         The contracts between customers and intermediaries are typically not traded. A simple

reason for this is that different customers may assign different values to the services they consume,

and these values may be privately known. That is, Vs may vary in the cross-section of customers

in a way that is not publicly observable.29 This will impede the tradability of these contracts. Lack

of trading means that adverse selection cannot be diminished for these contracts the way it can be

for capital raised from investors.

         The fact that investors’ claims are traded also means that they can diversify away the

idiosyncratic risk of the intermediary. In an efficient market, each risk should be borne by those

with the greatest risk-bearing capacity for that risk. Since customers cannot diversify (or hedge)

the intermediary’s idiosyncratic credit risk but investors can, it is investors who should bear this

risk in an efficient arrangement.

         This discussion indicates that even the second-best contract will seek to protect customers

against the credit risk of the intermediary, because customers will continue to display extreme

aversion to being exposed to this risk. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that financing

frictions faced by intermediaries may be so large that the second-best contract may involve the

customer bearing some of the credit risk associated with the intermediary, i.e., the second-best

contract may involve a positive CCF cost, as we discuss in the next section.



3.6 The Constrained-Efficient (Second-Best) Contract

         In the analysis in the previous sections, it was implicitly assumed that the cost to the

financial intermediary of insulating its customers from its own credit risk—via hedging,


29
  Another possible reason is that the contract is intended to provide risk-sharing services to the customer, and trading
of the contract may destroy optimal risk sharing. For models along these lines, see Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and
Dang, Gorton, Holmstrom, and Ordonez (2014).

                                                          30
purchasing insurance from a guarantor, or keeping sufficient equity capital—was less than the

benefit of the insulation to the customer. But there may be a variety of costs the intermediary faces

in providing its customers complete insulation from its own credit risk. We discuss these below.

3.6.1 Equity Capital

       One way that the intermediary can protect its customers from its own credit risk is by

putting equity on its balance sheet. With sufficient equity, the intermediary can minimize its credit

risk. However, as has been well-established in the literature, the intermediary may face costs with

respect to keeping a significant amount of equity on its balance sheet.

       Adverse selection costs are one reason why it may be costly for the intermediary to raise

external equity (as explained by Myers and Majluf (1984)). Moral hazard may be another reason

why the intermediary may find it costly to keep a lot of equity on its balance sheet. Hart (1995)

explained how debt can discipline the firm by imposing a periodic fixed payment obligation that

provides incentives for the firm to generate cash flows that are sufficient to meet debt repayment.

Equity does not have this feature, so by using substantial equity, the intermediary may forgo this

discipline on its managers. There may also be other costs of keeping equity. The tax shield

associated with debt is one widely discussed reason, for example. Moreover, for intermediaries

like banks, implicit bailout protection offered by the government can make debt financing

“artificially” cheap compared to equity (which lacks such protection).

       All of these costs of equity relative to debt can mean that the amount of equity needed to

trivialize the intermediary’s credit risk may be so large that it causes the intermediary’s capital

structure to deviate too far away from its private optimum to make it optimal for the intermediary

to keep that much capital.




                                                 31
3.6.2 Hedging and Purchasing Insurance from a Guarantor

         If there is moral hazard in the sense that the intermediary can choose (privately costly)

hidden action that can affect the returns to investors, then investors will reflect that in the pricing

of securities.30 This pricing is a source of capital market discipline, and it can move the

intermediary closer to choosing the action that maximizes the (financial) value of the intermediary.

Examples of such discipline include the actions creditors can take, such as monitoring and

restrictions imposed on the intermediary when covenants are violated.

         However, this discipline imposed by investors can be supplemented with discipline

imposed by the intermediary’s customers. We argued in the previous sections that customers will

display extreme aversion to being exposed to the intermediary’s credit risk. This aversion too can

be a source of market discipline if customers are even partially exposed to the intermediary’s credit

risk. That is, if the intermediary does not devote enough resources to significantly reducing its

credit risk and customers are partially exposed to it, they will flee the intermediary, as discussed

in the Introduction (see Merton (1997)).31 This threat of loss of customers can provide additional

discipline on the intermediary. By purchasing insurance from a guarantor or by hedging, the

intermediary could choose to completely insulate the customer from its own credit risk, but then

market discipline from customers would be lost. So the second-best contract may involve

customers being (at least potentially) exposed to some credit risk.

3.6.3 Customer Risk Exposure in the Second-Best Contract

         In more analytic terms, let FC(p) represent the “financing cost” faced by the intermediary


30
   Examples of such hidden action are the effort choices of the intermediary’s managers, the risk profiles of the
projects the intermediary invests in, the resources it devotes to risk management, etc.
31
   This includes instances in which this credit risk exposure results from inefficient choices by the bank. Calomiris
and Kahn (1991) model such a situation. In their model, (uninsured) depositors flee the bank if they observe/suspect
that the bank manager is making bad investment decisions, and this threat disciplines the manager.

                                                         32
in reducing the customer’s exposure to the credit risk of the intermediary, where 1 – p is the

customer’s credit risk exposure. We assume ∂FC / ∂p > 0 and ∂2 FC / ∂p2 ≥ 0. The customer

contract fulfillment (CCF) cost we discussed earlier is [1 – p]V, which is decreasing in p. Thus, in

the second-best contract, the intermediary will choose [1 – p̂ ], the credit risk its customers are

exposed to, by trading off FC(p) against the CCF cost, as shown in Figure 3 below.

4 Examples of Customer Contracts and Institutional Design
       Many observed customer contracts and institutional designs fit within our framework. We

briefly discuss some examples of these in this section.

                                                33
4.1 Customer Contracts

4.1.1 Bank Deposits

       A demand deposit in a bank represents a contract between the bank and a customer

(depositor). In practice, the funds provided by depositors are invested in risky securities (e.g.

loans), and uninsured depositors are exposed to the credit risk of the bank, consistent with the

second-best contract. However, the depositor would prefer not to have to worry about the credit

risk of the bank if the bank could find a cost-effective way to achieve this.

       There are a number of potential institutional formats that achieve this. One is for the bank

to be a “narrow bank”, i.e., a bank that invests only in assets like U.S. Treasury bonds that are free

of default risk. For example, a money market mutual fund that invests in short-maturity U.S.

government bonds would functionally be an example of a narrow bank. In this case, depositors

are not exposed to any bank-specific credit risk, but such a bank would be reduced to its basic

functions. Because of its limited scope, a narrow bank may be an extreme case, and the economic

functions its scope would exclude may have to be performed less efficiently elsewhere in the

economy, representing a potential economic loss.

       A second way to do this is to have the bank raise financing from investors that is junior to

the claims of depositors. This financing can come from investors who purchase the bank’s

preferred stock and common stock. This allows the bank to create a cushion that absorbs some of

the bank’s idiosyncratic risk and keeps it from affecting depositors. A similar role is played by

third-party guarantors, whether they are private-sector guarantors or government deposit insurers.

But as we pointed out in the previous section, it may be prohibitively costly to eliminate all of the

customer’s credit risk exposure this way.

       A third way to achieve the informational insensitivity that customers desire is to have

                                                 34
deposit insurance. This insulates the depositors against the credit risk of the intermediary, even

without narrow banking. However, deposit insurance has some well-known shortcomings. When

deposit insurance is incomplete (so that only a portion of deposits are insured), some depositors

may be exposed to the bank’s credit risk if the bank makes risky investments. Indeed, no country

has unlimited deposit insurance, so some deposits are uninsured.32 Moreover, deposit insurance

creates moral hazard (see Merton (1977)). Thus, even in the presence of deposit insurance, the

second-best contract may expose the customer to some credit risk.

4.1.2 Mutual Funds

         For mutual funds, customers are investors in the fund—each customer is purchasing a

service (in this case, the portfolio management service and the promise of some risky return), while

also providing financing through the money invested in the fund. In this case, the customer’s final

contract payoff need not be a riskless claim. Indeed, the customer understands that the contract

purchased from the mutual fund may have a risky payoff, for example, linked to the S&P 500. It

is only the credit risk of the intermediary that the customer wishes to be insulated from. That is,

the customer does not want any uncertainty about receiving the portfolio management service or

promised payoff because the fund is insolvent, possibly due to unobserved risky investments with

fund money or “tunneling” that leads to a misuse of fund capital.

         A mutual fund is a good example of a contract that imposes risk on the investor (customer)

that is related to the contract itself.33 As long as the mutual fund does not have any risk that the

fund investors are exposed to beyond the risk of the underlying portfolio on which the fund


32
   It may also be that some deposit insurance is optimally kept incomplete, to the extent that some depositors could be
considered as investors rather than customers. For example, they may be agents who have liquidity on which they
seek a yield, but want to have the flexibility to withdraw it at a moment’s notice in case some future (unanticipated)
need for that liquidity arises. However, they have no need for any other service that the bank offers. Jumbo CDs and
brokered deposits are examples of this. Unlimited deposit insurance may be made available only if banks in the
aggregate are in trouble, as during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
33
   E.g. the custodian holds securities and provides insurance on theft.

                                                          35
investors have equity claims and there is no informational asymmetry between the fund manager

and investors about the assets the fund is investing in, investors are willing to accept fund portfolio

risk in their role as customers. Indeed, customers often invest large parts of their life-savings in

mutual funds, with an expectation that they will be exposed to some degree of market risk,

depending on what the fund invests in.

       The desire to confine their risk exposure to only the (systematic) risk inherent in the fund’s

contractually-stipulated investment portfolio is one reason why investors put their money in funds

managed by reputable intermediaries like Vanguard, Fidelity, and the like. That is, if one invests

in the S&P 500 through one of these funds, the risk (R) is RS&P 500 . Indeed, other than differences

in expenses, the risk in the fund is the same regardless of whether it is offered by Vanguard or T

Rowe Price or American Century. If these funds were rated, they would all be AAA, even though

their future value is (systematically) risky. However, if one chooses to invest in the S&P 500

through an individual/company of lesser reputation, say agent XYZ, then the investor’s risk is

RS&P 500 + RXYZ , where RXYZ is the credit risk of XYZ. Thus, in the case of many mutual funds, the

second-best contract closely approximates the first-best as customers are exposed to little, if any,

credit risk of the intermediary offering the fund.

4.1.3 Insurance Contracts

       An individual who purchases a whole life insurance policy is a customer who is buying a

bundle of two products—an insurance payoff in the event of death and an investment. The

policyholder is willing to accept randomness in the return on the investment portion of the product,

but not the risk that the insurance company may fail due to other exposures and hence be unable

to pay in the event of the death of the insured. If the insured were to be exposed to such risk, it

would represent inefficient risk bearing because it would not be efficient for the insured to buy a



                                                  36
large number of smaller life insurance policies to diversify across insurance companies. The key,

according to our framework, is in the degree of transparency for the customer. The efficient

contract would be one that involves the insurance company designating a special account—

analogous to the kind of bankruptcy-remote trusts or special investment vehicles used in

securitization—in which the policyholders’ funds are kept and then invested in a pre-designated

basket of securities. That way the policyholders would not need to have any information about

the credit risk in the rest of the insurance company. Absent this, an insurance fund that backs up

insurance companies and protects policyholders would be needed. In all fifty U.S. states, state

insurance funds provide this service.34 With both arrangements, the policyholders would not need

to have any information about the credit risk in the rest of the insurance company. Thus, the

second-best contract achieves close to the efficiency of the first-best.

4.1.4 Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

         Repos have been the mainstay of short-term financing in the shadow banking sector for

over a decade, and this sector is now globally bigger than commercial (deposit-based) banking. A

repo contract is an excellent illustration of our framework. The financial intermediary is an

institution that has collateral in the form of bankruptcy-remote securities like U.S. Treasuries or

high-grade mortgage-backed securities, but has need for liquidity over a short time period. The

customer is another institution that has excess liquidity on which it wishes to earn additional yield

income. The customer provides financing to the intermediary in exchange for taking ownership

of the collateral for the duration of the loan. Since the loan amount is less than or equal to the

value of the securities used as collateral, the customer is not exposed to the credit risk of the



34
   This also applies to property and casualty insurance. Property and casualty guaranty funds are part of a non-profit,
state-based system that was created by statute, which pays outstanding claims of insolvent insurance companies. As
of 2015, there were about 550 insolvencies since the inception of the guaranty funds.

                                                          37
intermediary. As a result, the second-best arrangement approximates the efficiency of the first-

best.35

4.1.5 CoCo Bonds

          As a way to reduce taxpayer losses from bank failures, a number of papers have proposed

Contingent Convertible (CoCo) bonds as something banks should have in their capital structures

(see Flannery (2013)) for a review of this literature. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has the

power to recapitalize financially-distressed firms by “bailing-in” bondholders. However, such

recapitalization when the firm is financially stressed can be challenging. CoCos, which are

essentially convertible bonds that can be converted to equity via a regulatory trigger, provide an

alternative way to recapitalize a distressed firm.36

          While this is the main objective of a CoCo, our analysis provides another perspective on

the role of CoCos. Imagine a bank with (pure) investors and customers. Most of the bank’s

financing is in the form of debt, but some of the debt is provided by customers and some by

investors. Then the investors can buy CoCos and the customers can buy more senior (non-

convertible) debt. The CoCos would necessarily be exposed to the credit risk of the bank.

However, a sufficiently large amount of CoCos can insulate the more senior debt from the bank’s

credit risk, making it a good kind of debt for customers (even in non-depository institutions) to


35
   Indeed, whenever there are doubts about the extent to which the repo contract is insulated from the credit risk of
the borrower, counterparties often refuse to enter into the contract or substantially increase the “haircut” on the repo.
For example, as it approached insolvency, Bear Stearns was unable to find counterparties for even repos involving
Treasuries as collateral.
36
   There is a large literature on how a regulatory trigger can itself serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy (in the sense of
Merton (1948)) and add to the firm’s financial distress, especially when the conversion trigger is based on the market
value of the bank’s equity. See, for example, Sundaresan and Wang (2015). A related issue is the knife-edge case in
which a firm is close to the conversion threshold, leading to changes in behavior by market participants to try and
cause conversion. This can be addressed in a straightforward fashion by more sophisticated designs. Potential
solutions to these issues include making triggers mechanical and contractual, such as conversion when the book value
of equity falls below 2.5% of assets, and the use of serial bonds or bonds that have the ability to reconvert to debt.
Thus, the variety of triggers and designs possible with CoCos is extensive. In general, the value of CoCos is driven
by conversion, and conversion is driven by credit quality, so the Merton (1974) model serves as a useful starting point
for valuing these bonds.

                                                           38
hold. This may function in a similar way, from the view of the customer, to no-fault default or no-

fault bankruptcy. This can move the intermediary’s second-best contract with the customer close

to the first-best in terms of efficiency.37



4.2 Customer Contracts and Institutional Design: Futures Exchanges

         A futures contract essentially guarantees the ability to sell or buy some commodity or

security in the future at a price that is predetermined. If this contract were negotiated as a forward

contract with a financial intermediary, the holder of the contract would be the intermediary’s

customer.38 Clearly, if the intermediary becomes insolvent prior to the delivery or execution date

on the contract, the customer would be unable to avail of the insurance against the price risk that

the customer sought under the contract.

         A futures contract is traded on an exchange with liquidity and collateral provided daily,

rather than being merely a bilateral arrangement between the bank and the customer that may not

be collateralized. The exchange stands behind the execution of the contract. Consequently, the

customer is protected against counterparty risk. Thus, the use of futures contracts over forward

contracts may be rationalized as a means of insulating customers against the credit risk of an

intermediary.




37
  See Merton (1992c) on no-fault default.
38
   With swaps and forwards, the two parties can switch back and forth between being a creditor or debtor to one
another based on movements in the underlying assets. So approximately half the time, the customer will be owed
money by the intermediary and thus be credit-sensitive. As noted previously, if a customer owes money to the
intermediary, then he does not fit into the definition of credit-sensitive customers that we focus on here. In this sense,
options traded on an exchange may be a better example. However, even for swaps/forwards, as long as there is a
chance that the customer will become the creditor in the contract (if the market value of the underlying goes the other
way), the effect that we emphasize will still be present.

                                                           39
5 Regulatory Practices
       In this section, we apply our framework to two important regulatory practices: the recently-

enacted Dodd-Frank Act, and the practice of protecting large banks against failure.



5.1 The Dodd-Frank Act

       One aspect of the Dodd-Frank Act that can be understood within the context of our

framework is that under Title VII of the Act, all non-exempt swaps to which a clearing exception

does not apply (i.e. “standardized” swaps) must be cleared and exchange traded. Mandatory

clearing and exchange trading of swaps is already underway. Our framework provides an

economic rationale for this. By making swaps exchange-traded, counterparty credit risk is greatly

reduced. Thus, the customers who hold these swap contracts need not worry about the credit risk

of the intermediary they are working with, provided that the exchange is bankruptcy remote.



5.2 Too-Big-To-Fail

       Firms and banks fail quite often, and these failures have negative consequences for at least

some of their stakeholders. Typically, these negative externalities are not considered excessive

and the usual resolution provided by the bankruptcy code is allowed to operate, leading to either a

reorganization and restructuring of the firm or liquidation. However, in some cases, the negative

externalities from the firm’s failure and subsequent bankruptcy resolution are estimated to be so

large that the government steps in and protects the firm’s investors (creditors and sometimes even

shareholders) from losses that would have been suffered if the usual bankruptcy resolution regime

had been used. In this case, the firm is deemed to be “too big to fail” (TBTF). The concept of


                                                40
TBTF is most commonly applied to banks and other financial firms—in such instances, the firm

may be deemed a “systemically important financial intermediary (SIFI), and thus subject to

additional rules and more oversight. One perhaps unintended consequence may be that such

institutions may gain an advantage over others because the SIFI designation may signal a

government de facto (implied) credit guarantee that non-SIFI institutions do not have.39

         It is worth clarifying what we mean by TBTF. As Kaufman (2013) and Seelig (2004) point

out, there are many types of TBTF interventions. The one we have in mind is the one in which the

insolvent bank’s shareholders are both protected against the loss that they would suffer in

bankruptcy, and they remain in control of the institution, with the cost of this protection being

absorbed by a third party. Since the shareholders are not wiped out, all customers and other

creditors are fully protected against any loss. Most importantly for our purposes, the contracts the

bank’s customers have with it remain unruptured. Such a resolution is called “open bank

assistance”.40

         There has recently been a surge of interest in TBTF, especially since the 2008-2009

financial crisis led to highly visible too-big-to-fail interventions, and these interventions are funded

by the taxpayers. Because even in-the-money counterparties of failing firms are often protected,

the taxpayer funding of such bailouts can be quite large. Moreover, institutions protected by TBTF

may also exhibit moral hazard, investing in excessively risky assets (see Strahan (2013) and

Afonso, Santos, and Traina (2014)). For these reasons, there is controversy about the desirability

of TBTF.



39
   One could argue that a case such as General Motors (GM) might be close to TBTF as well, but for other economic
reasons than the ones we emphasize here.
40
   For the purposes of our discussion, we would even include an intervention in which management does not remain
in control, but all customers and investors are protected fully as the failing bank is acquired by a healthy bank, with
assistance from the government. An example of this is the government-assisted acquisition of Bear Stearns by JP
Morgan Chase during the 2008 financial crisis.

                                                         41
         TBTF typically covers large and complex financial institutions. Small banks are routinely

allowed to fail when they become critically undercapitalized.41 This raises an interesting question

that we address in this section: why are only large and complex financial institutions protected by

too-big-to-fail, and small banks allowed to fail? The standard answer to this question is that the

failures of large banks can result in contagion and cause the toppling of other banks. The specter

of a systemic collapse is one reason why governments are interested in preventing large-bank

failures. What we will argue is that TBTF protection for large institutions may make economic

sense even without such systemic risk concerns. Moreover, our framework explains why too-big-

to-fail is limited to large and complex financial institutions. Note first that too-big-to-fail is costly

to taxpayers and is controversial, so the estimated benefit of the intervention has to be large enough

to overcome the cost. The question thus boils down to why the benefit-to-cost ratio is viewed as

being higher for large and complex institutions than for smaller ones. 42 Of course, leaving aside

the issue of government bailouts, the reason why customers in both small and large banks are

exposed to the credit risk of their banks is that second-best contracts are in place.

         At a basic level, one explanation for the special treatment of large banks is that there are

far more customers in large banks, so any disruption of the bank’s provision of services to these

customers—something that is unavoidable if the bank fails and especially if it is liquidated—

means that more customers are exposed to its credit risk ex post, which represents a shock that was

unanticipated ex ante. However, beyond this, we argue that there is greater intertwining of

customers and investors in large banks, and hence it is more difficult to separate out customers and

investors in large banks than in small banks. Given second-best contracts, this produces greater


41
   Of course, if the bank has insured deposits, these claims would be covered, but management would lose control and
the bank’s assets would be sold to another bank by the deposit insurance.
42
   Note that we are not referring to the absolute cost of the intervention to taxpayers, which is obviously larger for
bigger banks (as is the benefit). We are referring to the cost-benefit ratio.

                                                         42
efficiency losses from failure for large banks than for small banks.

        The essence of this argument is that the greater intertwining between customers and

investors makes it very difficult to cleanly separate customers from investors, which then makes

it challenging to protect customers from the credit risk of the intermediary while exposing

investors to that risk. That is, this intertwining is likely to result in greater credit risk exposure for

customers than would otherwise be the case with a second-best contract. As a result, a failure of a

financial institution will be dysfunctional for the customers of that institution—when the

institution goes bankrupt, the claims of investors and customers are settled in court, and it is

uncertain what customers will receive. This amounts to a lottery for the customer when this

happens, which we argued is inefficient.

        There are many specific ways in which this effect could operate. Here, we provide a few

examples to illustrate the main idea. A straightforward example is a bank that provides transaction

services to depositors, and uses the liquidity provided by deposits to fund the services provided to

customers. Some of the depositors are also investors in the bank. Now imagine that the bank is

financially distressed, and is allowed to fail, wiping out all the investors. Because the investors

have lost their money, they then rush to withdraw their deposits—even if these deposits are insured

and hence safe—in order to meet their own liquidity needs and invest the money elsewhere in

order to meet their investment goals. The loss of deposits then deprives the bank of the ability to

provide deposit services, thereby adversely affecting the depositors who have not withdrawn their

money. This kind of spillover effect is more likely in a larger and more complex bank, as this type

of bank is more likely to have multiple types of investors who are intertwined with customers.

        As another example, imagine a bank that has multiple customers, and which has arranged

highly-customized swap contracts for a subset of its customers. Some of these customers are also



                                                   43
investors in the intermediary, but given the size of the intermediary, it would be difficult and

expensive for an outside party—even the bank’s regulator—to determine which of the bank’s

customers are also investors and how much each has invested in the bank. If this bank fails and is

not bailed out, the investors will experience a possibly significant decline in their wealth due to

their losses on their investments in the bank. This wealth decline could lead some of these

investors to discover that the swap contracts they had initially entered into are no longer useful.

This may cause them to walk away from these contracts. If the bank has failed, it may not be in a

position to step in as a counterparty to replace the lost customer. Thus, the bank’s swap contracts

may be adversely affected, with associated welfare losses.

          A somewhat different example is an individual who has purchases a whole-life insurance

policy from an insurance company that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company. This individual

is also an investor in the bank holding company, holding some of its equity and bonds. If the bank

holding company fails and is not rescued by the government under TBTF, its shareholders and

bondholders are wiped out. This results in a significant decline in the wealth of the individual who

has purchased the life insurance policy, and the decline may be so great that the individual cannot

afford the premium on the policy anymore. He may therefore abandon the policy, thereby

destroying the consumer surplus that was initially anticipated to be created by the policy. Thus,

in highly-intertwined intermediaries, there are many ways in which customers can be adversely

affected and social surplus destroyed as a result when investors are wiped out. The bigger and

more complex the intermediary, the more difficult it is to protect the sheep while letting the wolves

perish.

          Such spillover effects from investors to customers due to the complex and difficult-to-

detect intertwining of customers and investors in large financial intermediaries often compel



                                                 44
regulators to bail out TBTF institutions, because their lack of knowledge of the extent of the

intertwining makes them hesitant to see what happens if they do not bail out these institutions.

Indeed, this was a rationale for the Federal Reserve’s intervention to rescue Bear Stearns, given its

rather significant role in the repo and swap markets, as indicated earlier. This demonstrates that, if

one is unable to partition out customers and investors, then it may be necessary to guarantee

investors in order to protect customers. Such concerns are substantially smaller in less complex

and systematically less important (smaller) banks. Having said this, failures of even small banks

are inefficient due to the impact of the failures on these banks’ customers. But it may be that the

costs of TBTF discussed earlier may exceed the costs of letting such banks fail.

       Finally, while we have focused here on how our framework provides a way to understand

bailouts, it can also help to analyze and better understand other related regulatory policies. One

such policy that is also designed to relieve banks in distress is to have “bail-in deposits”—deposits

that transform into equity when the bank is in trouble (see Zenios (2014) for a discussion of bail-

in policies in the Cyprus crisis). Our analysis suggests that the optimality of having bail-in deposits

depends on whether the depositors are customers or investors ex ante, and whether they can be

separated. If certain depositors expect ex ante that they may be transformed into equity investors,

then they can be considered to be investors. For these investors, a bail-in may make sense as a

way to shore up banks. However, if depositors are customers as we have defined them, then they

will be forced to be exposed to the bank’s credit risk by becoming equity, which we have argued

is inefficient (at least in a first-best sense). Therefore, a bail-in policy may make sense if customers

and investors can be separated; otherwise, customers will be forced to become investors, thus

making the policy inefficient.




                                                  45
6 Customers and Financial Crises
         Our framework may provide some new insights into how financial crises are propagated,

and how they should be dealt with. A crisis can be thought of as an event that is outside of agents’

“model of the world”—when the event happens, agents have difficulty reconciling it with their

view of the world, and therefore do not have a predetermined direction to go once it happens. For

example, the most recent financial crisis was precipitated by a large decline in housing prices,

which was an event that many people did not expect and did not have a contingency plan for. A

defining element of a crisis is closely linked to the defining element of customers that we have

described. When customers expect to receive a credit-risk-insensitive vector of services from

contracts with intermediaries because they believe these are first-best contracts and unexpectedly

learn that these contracts have been jeopardized by the impending insolvencies of these

intermediaries, it can generate the same forces that give rise to a financial crisis—an unanticipated

event which the customer did not consider a possibility and thus does not know how to respond to.

Consequently, customers may withdraw their funds and cause a crisis. This correspondence

between crises and customers also underscores how difficult it is to deal with such financial

episodes, since customers, who provide a substantial portion of funding (but not risk-taking),

attach different values to the services they receive under their contracts. This heterogeneity can

lead to customer reactions to news about elevated intermediary credit risk that are quite

unpredictable.43 More directly, one of the reasons (even uninsured) intermediaries are so often

bailed out by the government during crises is because investors and customers are intertwined in

complex ways in many cases, and the unpredictability of customer reactions represents another



43
  Since the market for customer contracts is incomplete, the intertemporal marginal rates of substitution that are used
to value future random payoffs are not the same across all customers.

                                                          46
reason why regulators are unwilling to “roll the dice” and let institutions fail.44 Indeed, when such

institutions go through bankruptcy, customers are inexorably caught up in the bankruptcy process,

which makes it uncertain what claim they will eventually get through the courts.

        A key to exploring this potential connection between customers and crises is to understand

how a financial crisis may be propagated by the beliefs revision process of customers who

experience breaches of contract. While in a typical setting, a new event would prompt economic

agents to revise their beliefs in a Bayesian manner, for a customer who believes the contract is

first-best, a breach of contract due to exposure to the credit risk of the intermediary is unexpected

and is outside the “model of the world” —this precludes the usual Bayesian revision of beliefs.

This can cause the customer to question the very model of the world he started with, and sometimes

result in a switch to a different model. For example, a customer may have started with a model of

the world in which its contract with the intermediary is inoculated against the credit risk of the

intermediary. But when the customer finds out that the continued provision of intermediary

services is predicated on the solvency of the institution and thus only second-best, it would switch

to a different model. When this happens, the revision of beliefs is no longer a “within-model”

Bayesian process, and this can introduce discontinuous, non-Bayesian shifts in beliefs. The result

can be massive fund withdrawals by investors and a liquidity crisis for institutions that is triggered

by concerns about the impact of their credit risk on the fulfillment of contracts with customers. In

the Appendix, we provide one way to develop this argument more formally using recent work on

non-Bayesian beliefs revision.

        Our approach bears similarity to the “neglected risks” approach to financial crises in



44
  For example, money market funds, which fully disclose that they are not insured or guaranteed by anyone. However,
in September 2008, the U.S. Treasury instituted an insurance program to prevent money market funds from breaking
the buck.

                                                        47
Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012, 2015). They argue that investors often ignore (highly

unlikely) tail risks, perhaps because they use intuitive short-cuts based on memory that tend to

overemphasize the more salient risks (e.g. as in Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012), and

Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010)), leading to excess demand for some assets. However, when the

risks in these assets become more evident, investors flee them, and this could precipitate a crisis.

A key distinction is that our argument is focused on the aversion of customers to the credit risk of

the intermediary as the risk most relevant in this calculus.




7 Conclusion
       In this paper, we have developed the notion of “customers” and “investors” as a framing

of the roles played by different groups of agents in funding financial intermediaries. Customers

provide a significant amount of the funding, but want no risk-bearing. In contrast, investors

provide both funding and risk-bearing.        The customers’ dislike for the credit risk of the

intermediary makes them different from investors, and this distinction leads to a rich set of

implications.

       The most important implication that we focus on is the economic rationale for designing

efficient (first-best) contracts that insulate customers from the credit risk of the intermediary and

impose all of this idiosyncratic risk on the investors. We show that because customers cannot

replicate the services they receive from intermediaries due to a form of market incompleteness,

exposing customers to the idiosyncratic credit risk of the intermediary results in an inefficient loss

of economic surplus. Intermediaries thus have an incentive to design contracts that protect the

customer from the intermediary’s credit risk. However, in a second-best setting in which providing

such risk insulation is costly, a tradeoff must be made between the cost of insulating the customer

                                                 48
from the credit risk of the intermediary and the cost of leaving the customer partially exposed. This

perspective helps to explain the design of a variety of contracts in the real world—including not

only deposit contracts in banking, but also the other contracts such as mutual funds, insurance

contracts, repos, and CoCos. It provides a fresh perspective on why we have exchanges, and

generates an economic rationale for the swaps clearinghouse requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act.

It also helps to explain why too-big-to-fail protection is offered to large and complex banks, but

not to small banks. Finally, this perspective also helps shed light on how financial crises can be

propagated by the customer-investor nexus.

       We view this framework as a useful starting point for identifying and understanding how

the key roles of customers and investors impact financial intermediaries. Future work could derive

additional equilibrium predictions in a more formal setting based on this framework. In addition,

our framework also has implications for how certain types of contracts should optimally be

structured, such as debt contracts between intermediaries and customers. An interesting extension

would be to look at how our framework bears on the work related to opacity and transparency in

contracts.

Appendix
A.1 A Formal Framework of Customers and Crises
       To provide one way to more formally explore the link between customers and financial
crises, we use the model developed by Ortoleva (2012), who provides the axiomatic foundations
for non-Bayesian updating of beliefs in such an environment. While this phenomenon could be
captured in other ways, we view this framework as a useful starting point in describing it. The
basic idea is to introduce two types of uncertainties: (i) “within-model” uncertainty about future
outcomes, and (ii) model uncertainty.        Fixing the economic model the agent has for the
determination of outcomes that the agent has in mind, there is a (subjective) probability distribution
over those outcomes that captures the agent’s prior beliefs, given that model. However, the agent
may not be entirely sure of the correct model of the world. Model uncertainty means that the agent
is unsure of the “correct” economic model that determines outcomes and thinks it could be one of
M > 1 possible models. Thus, if x̃ is the random outcome whose future realization will be observed
in the future, gi (x) is the probability density function of x̃, then model uncertainty means that the
set of possible density functions (or economic models) is:

                                    M = {gi | i ∈ {1, …, M}}                                   (A-1)

The agent will have some prior beliefs, represented by a probability distribution, say 𝜋, over 𝑔𝑖 .
This distribution is called a “prior over priors”. The main idea in Ortoleva (2012) is that the agent
establishes some “threshold belief”, say a probability ε > 0, and starts by picking a model of the
world, say some gi . The gi chosen is the one that the prior over priors assigns the highest likelihood
to, i.e., he picks the most likely model of the world in a maximum likelihood fashion. He then
observes the realized value of x̃. If the prior probability of x̃ occurring, given gi , is above ε, he
uses Bayes rule to arrive at a posterior belief, without changing the model of the world he started
with. But if the realized value of x had a prior probability of occurrence that was below ε, the
agent would think that he may have chosen the wrong prior. In this case, he will update his prior
over priors, and then pick the gi that has the highest likelihood in the posterior belief over priors,
given this updating. A new model of the world (gi ) may be chosen, after which Bayes rule is used
to update beliefs related to within-model uncertainty.
       To illustrate how this applies in the context of financial intermediaries and customers,

                                                  50
suppose that there are two possible models of the world: Model I is one in which intermediaries
have taken all possible actions to ensure that the payoffs to customers are independent of the credit
risk of the intermediary itself, so the contract is first-best. In this case, the payoff to the customers
has a two-state payoff: it is a high payoff with probability q ∈ (0,1) and a zero payoff with
probability 1 ̶ q. Model II is one in which the customer’s payoff depends on the credit risk of the
intermediary with which the customer is contracting, i.e., the contract is only second-best. There
are three types of intermediaries: good (G), medium (M), and bad (B). The prior beliefs over
intermediary types are represented by pi , i ∈ {G, M, B}, with pi ∈ (0,1) ∀ i. In this model, the
customers get a high payoff with probability qi when contracting with an intermediary of type i,
with q > qG > qM > qB > 0. Assume q > pM , so the customers’ share of the economic surplus is
positive.
           Suppose customers start with a prior over priors described by probability π1 ∈ (0,1) that
Model I is the true economic model of the world and probability 1 ̶ π1 ≡ π2 ∈ (0,1) that Model II
is the true model of the world. Let π1 > 0.5, so customers will choose Model I when the economy
opens. In this model, the probability of a zero payoff is 1 ̶ q, and assume that this is a very small
number. Now suppose customers observe a zero payoff. If 1 ̶ q < ε, then they will question
whether they started with the right prior beliefs about the model of the world. They will update
their beliefs about the true model, using Bayes Rule:
                                                                                 (1 ̶ q)π1
           π̂ 1 = Pr(true model is Model I | zero payoff) =
                                                                    (1 ̶ q)π1 + ∑i ∈ {G, M, B} pi [1 ̶ qi ]π2
                                                                                                                (A-2)
The customers will now compare the posterior belief π̂ 1 to the posterior 1 ̶ π̂ 1 = π̂ 2 . Suppose
π̂ 1 < 0.5. Then customers will switch their view of the right model of the world and adopt Model
II. Given Model II, customers will arrive at posterior beliefs about the type of the intermediary
they are dealing with.45 Thus,
                                                                                  (1 ̶ qi )pi                   (A-3)
                   Pr(intermediary is type i | zero payoff) = p̂ i =
                                                                           ∑i ∈ {G, M, B} pi [1 ̶ qi ]
for i ∈ {G, M, B}. If




45
     These beliefs were irrelevant if Model I was viewed as the correct model of the world.

                                                           51
                                                   ∑           p̂ i qi < p*                     (A-4)
                                               i ∈ {G, M, B}

then customers will view the total economic surplus from contracting with intermediaries as
negative, and all financing from customers will vanish. Thus, a financial crisis can come about as
customers’ perceptions of risk rise in a discontinuous manner from a perceived probability of the
good-payoff state dropping from q to ∑i ∈ {G, M, B} p̂ i qi .
        In the context of our previous analysis, the payoff uncertainty reflects the fact that the final
payoff from a contract may be uncertain (e.g. a mutual fund), while the model uncertainty relates
to the possibility that the customers’ belief that contract payoffs are insensitive to the credit risk
of the intermediary may be incorrect. Our analysis here shows that the model uncertainty can
create a situation in which a financial crisis is triggered and propagated. An important ingredient
in our explanation is the somewhat unique role of customers in financial intermediaries as
significant providers of financing to these intermediaries. This means that when these customers
are exposed to the credit risk of the intermediary, they can exhibit a discontinuous change in beliefs
that causes them to withdraw from the market. The resulting loss in liquidity can trigger a crisis,
as we saw with the drying up of liquidity in the repo market during the 2008-2009 crisis.
