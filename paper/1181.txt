        Monetary Policy Regimes, Expected Inflation, and the
          Response of Interest Rates to Money Announcements



                              AB STRACT



     This paper examines the response of the term structure of interest

rates to weekly money announcements. Estimated responses for both the

pre— and post—October 1979 periods are first presented. Then, two com-

peting hypotheses involving the policy anticipations and expected infla-

tion effects are formally specified and compared to the estimated responses.

Both hypotheses are found to be consistent with the responses, but they

have sharply different implications about the Federal Reserve's short—

run monetary policy. The expected inflation hypothesis implies that

weekly money surprises should have persistent effects on the level of the

money stock, reflecting shifts in the Federal Reserve's long—run target.

In contrast, the policy anticipations hypothesis implies that the effect

of money surprises should diminish over time, reflecting the Federal

Reserve's desire to offset deviations from target. Additional empirical

results reported in the paper support this latter description of the

money stock process.

               MONETARY POLICY REGIMES, EXPECTED INFLATION,
                    AND THE RESPONSE OF INTEREST RATES
                          TO MONEY ANNOUNCEMENTS

                     V. Vance Roley and Carl E. Walsh*

      Recent studies on the response of interest rates to weekly money

announcements reveal several interesting empirical relationships. First, the

empirical results of Berkman (1978), Grossman (1981), and Urich and Wachtel

(1981) indicate that Treasury bill yields rise (fall) in response to an unanti-

cipated increase (decrease) in the announced money stock.- Second, Roley

(1982, 1983) and Cornell (1983) find that the magnitude of the bill—yield

response increased following the Federal Reserve's announced change in operating

procedures on October 6, 1979. Third, Cornell (1983) estimates significant

positive responses for long—term yields in both the pre— and post—October 1979

periods, with a significantly larger response in the post—October 1979 period.

      These empirical results are of interest not only because of the

magnitude of the interest—rate fluctuations associated with unanticipated

announced changes in money, but also because the estimated responses potentially

provide evidence on the short—run monetary policy rule describing Federal

Reserve behavior. In particular, under rational expectations, the market's

response depends importantly on the Federal Reserve's desire to offset deviations

in money from its target. The empirical evidence, however, appears to be consis-

tent with two different hypotheses about the Federal Reserve's desire to control

money as well as the information content of weekly money announcements.

      One hypothesis relies on studies by Fama (1975) and Nelson and Schwert

(1977), among others, who estimate that changes in expected inflation account

for most of the fluctuations in nominal interest rates.-1 Under this hypothesis,
                                    — 2—




a positive surprise in a weekly money announcement that is not expected to be

offset totally by the Federal Reserve leads to an increase in expected infla-

tion. Thus, the increased interest—rate response following the change in

operating procedures in October 1979 is interpreted as evidence that the

Federal Reserve is less committed to monetary control. Moreover, the signi—

ficant response of long—term interest rates in both the pre— and post—October

1979 periods is interpreted as reflecting changes only in expected inflation

[e.g., Cornell (1983) and Hardouvelis (1982)].

      The other hypothesis is based on a policy anticipations effect. Under

this hypothesis, market participants are assumed not to revise their expectation

about future inflation on the basis of any one—week's money surprise. Instead,

the Federal Reserve is assumed to offset at least partially any deviation in

money from its target. A positive money surprise would then imply a rise in

expected future interest rates in anticipation of policy actions designed to

bring the money stock back to target. This paradigm, therefore, suggests that

real interest rates change in response to unanticipated announced changes in

money. Thus, in contrast to the expected inflation hypothesis, the increased

interest—rate response after October 1979 is consistent with a greater desire

by the Federal Reserve to control money along with other possible effects

related more closely to the change in operating procedures itself [e.g., Roley

(1982, 1983) and Walsh (1983)]. Evidence supporting the policy anticipations

hypothesis is presented by Cornell (1982) and Engel and Frankel (1982) who find,

in the context of the foreign exchange market, that the dollar appreciates in

response to a positive surprise in announced money.' However, both Cornell
                                      —3—



(1983) and Hardouvelis (1982) claim that the response of long—term interest

rates Is too large to be explained by this effect.

      The purpose of this paper is to specify separate models consistent with

the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects, respectively, and to

compare their implications for interest rate responses over the entire term

structure. The increased response of interest rates after October 1979 and

the relatively large response of long—term rates are shown to be consistent

with the policy anticipations effect. In particular, these phenomena can be

explained by the Federal Reserve's change in operating procedures, the degree

of short—run monetary control, and the persistence of money demand shocks.

Other models of the policy anticipations effect do not include long—term

interest rates, and they selectively ignore such important institutional

features as the type of operating procedures used by the Federal Reserve, lagged

reserve accounting, and the lag in money announcements [e.g., Urich (1982)

and Nichols, Small, and Webster (1983)]. This institutional detail plays a key

role in the models considered here.

      In the first section of this paper, the response of the term structure

of interest rates in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods is estimated.

The policy anticipations and the expected inflation models are presented in

the second and third sections, respectively. In the fourth section, the empirical

results are reconciled with the predictions of both models, and additional

empirical evidence on the relative merits of the two models is discussed. The

main conclusions are summarized in the final section.

      I. Estimated Response of Interest Rates

      In this section, the response of the term structure of interest rates

in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods is estimated. The empirical results
                                         —4—



exhibit both the increase responsiveness since October 1979 and the relatively

large response of long—term yields. These results are presented following

brief discussions of the specification and data used in the estimation.

 Specification

        The usual efficient markets approach is adopted to estimate the

 response of interest rates to weekly money announcements.     To conform with

 the theoretical models presented in subsequent sections, the consequences

 of the efficient markets hypothesis may be represented as

            =                  —
                b0 + b1            1nN) + et
 where Rt = change in the interest rate over a time interval including the
                money stock announcement in week t

            =   announced level of the money stock in week t

            =   market's rational expectation of the announced level of the
                money stock in week t

            =   random error term uncorrelated with any information available
                to the public prior to the money announcement in week t

     b0,b1 =    estimated coefficients

 While a constant term is always included in the empirical specifications,

 it should equal zero under the null hypothesis of market efficiency and in

 the absence of systematic measurement error.

 Data

        All of the data described below are weekly and span the period beginning

 on September 29, 1977 and ending on October 15, 1982.     The last observation of

 the pre—October 1979 subsample falls on October 5, 1979. Observations were

 excluded if either discount rate changes or announcements of other relevant

 economic data were made within the time interval corresponding to the measured

 change in interest rates.'

      The money stock data consist of announced weekly levels of the narrowly

defined money stock, in billions of dollars, as reported in the Federal Reserve's

H.6 release. From the beginning of the sample through January 31, 1980, the

data correspond to "old Mi," and weekly announcements were made on Thursday.

From February 8, 1980, through October 15, 1982, announcements were made on

Friday. For this period, the data employed are those for Mi—B, and more

recently, Ml, where the definition of this latter aggregate is equivalent to

that of Ml—B.-"

      Data for the expected announced level of the money stock are based on

the survey data compiled by Money Market Services, Inc. The survey data

represent the market's expected announced change in the money stock. To

construct expected levels, market participants are assumed to expect no revi-

sion in the previous week's announced level.-" The survey data begins on

September 29, 1977. Prior to February 8, 1980, the median of the Thursday

survey is used to represent the market's anticipated money announcement on

each Thursday. For the remainder of the sample, the survey was conducted

on Tuesday for the Friday announcement. Because of this misalignment, a

revised expectation reflecting the availability of new information from

Tuesday to Friday is used.Zi

      The yield data are taken from the H.15 release, published by the

Federal Reserve. All data are in terms of coupon—equivalent yields, in

percent, and quoted bids are used. The change in interest rates is measured

from 3:30 p.m. on the day of a money announcement to 3:30 p.m. on the following

business day. Thus, any effect of money announcements—which are made at
                                                              8/
4:10 p.m.—should be reflected in the measured change in yields.—

Empirical Results

      Estimation results of the efficient markets model (1) over the pre—
                                                          9/
and post—October 1979 subsainples are presented in Table 1.—   Within each

subsample, the estimated response of Treasury security yields declines, with

one exception, as maturity increases. In the pre—October 1979 subsample, for

example, the 3—month Treasury bill yield is estimated to increase by about

6 1/2 basis points for a 1 percent announced money surprise, while the 20—year yield

increases by about 1 basis point. Similarly, in the post—October 1979 subsample,

the 3—month yield's response is over 2 1/2 times greater than that of the

20—year yield. Despite the lower estimated response of long—term yields,

Cornell (1983) and Hardouvelis (1982) suggest that the response is nevertheless

too large to be explained by the policy anticipations effect, especially in the

post—October 1979 period. Instead, the expected inflation effect is hypothesized

to account for the response of long—term yields.

      The empirical results in Table 1 also Indicate that the estimated response

for all maturities of Treasury securities is over five times larger In the post—

October 1979 period. In the last column, the equality of the response is

formally tested, and In each case the null hypothesis can be rejected at less

than the 1 percent level of significance) As mentioned earlier, these

results are apparently consistent with two competing hypotheses.   First, the

response may have increased because of the change in Federal Reserve operating

procedures and perhaps a somewhat greater commitment to monetary control

 [Roley (1982, 1983) and Walsh (1983)]. Second, the larger response may reflect

less desire to control money, implying larger changes in expected inflation for

a given money surprise (Cornell (1983) and Hardouvelis (1982)]. These empirical

 results are discussed further in the fourth section in the context of the two

 competing hypotheses.

      II. Policy Anticipations Model

      In this section, a model of the response of interest rates to money

announcements is developed which focuses exclusively on the policy ariticipa—

tions effect. By ignoring the role of expected inflation, it will be

possible to determine whether the policy anticipations explanation is, in

isolation, consistent with the empirical results reported in Table 1. Of

particular interest is the ability of the model to explain the response of

long—term interest rates as well as the increased response of all rates in

the post—October 1979 period. Because institutional features are important

for a complete understanding of the policy anticipations effect, it will

be useful to begin with an overview of the Federal Reserve's policy proce-

dures before turning to the formal model.

      The money stock figure released at 4:10 p.m. on Fridays is the Federal

Reserve's current estimate of the money stock during the settlement week

ending nine days previously. This has two important implications. First,

because of lagged reserve accounting, the Friday announcement provides

market participants with an estimate of the deposit levels against which

required reserves for the current settlement week are levied. Second, because

money demand shifts cause week to week movements in the quantity of money, the

announcement provides information on any money demand shift which may have

occurred two weeks previously.--"

      In estimating the money stock prior to the Friday announcement, the

Federal Reserve may adjust its target path for the monetary aggregates in

light of any deviation of actual money from target. Under lagged reserve

accounting, monetary policy is implemented by using a policy instrument—
                                         —8—



 the   federal   funds rate in the pre—October 1979 period and nonborrowed

 reserves in the post—October 1979 period—in an attempt to make money

demand equal to the targeted quantity of money. While the direct effects

of Federal Reserve actions are to influence the federal funds rate, this

is not the interest rate most relevant for the demand for money. The

Federal Reserve must, therefore, estimate what change in the funds rate will

lead to changes in other short—term rates which, in turn, will produce the

desired effect on the demand for money. Any model of the policy anticipations

effect needs, therefore, to specify: 1) the informational content of the

money announcement and how it depends on the operating procedures of the

Federal Reserve; 2)      the determinants of the demand for money; 3) the linkages

between variables influencing money demand and the Federal Reserve's policy

instruments; 4) the operating procedures followed by the Federal Reserve in

attempting to achieve its monetary targets; and 5)      the manner in which the

target path for money is adjusted in light of deviations between the actual

quantity of money and the target path.

        Within this conceptual framework, consider the actions of the Federal

Reserve at the beginning of settlement week t. Assume, for simplicity, that

in setting its policy instrument for week t, the Federal Reserve, but not

yet the public, knows m2, the (log) money supply during week t—2. This is

the number which will be announced on Friday of week t. The Federal Reserve

cannot yet observe           but on the basis of m2 (and perhaps other inforina—

tion), an estimate of week t—l s deviation from target, E(m1Ict) —

is   formed, where      denotes the Federal Reserve's information set at the start

of week t, E(m1Jc) is the expectation of ini conditional on             and
                                             —9—



            is the target value for mi which had been set at the start of

week t—l based on 2         .   The estimate of this deviation is used to revise the
                      t—1
target path. The policy rule is assumed to be,


      mT.() -    m+.(Qi)                 +   (lA)   (l-oi)]


                                       [E(m_i) —     mi(i)J;        i =   0,1,...   (2)


According to (2), a deviation from target during week t—l leads to a revised

target path for money for all future weeks. Equation (2) implies that the

Federal Reserve plans to offset eventually a fraction (l_l) of the week t—1

deviation from target. It does so only gradually, however, at the rate (1—A)

per week. The remaining fraction of the deviation, ,           is   not offset.1

If    =   0, the new path [m+(2)] returns to the old path [m+.(2i)] as j-.
Because this section treats expected inflation as constant in order to emphasize

the policy anticipations effect, equation (2) implicitly assumes that the

Federal Reserve does not revise its targeted long—run growth rate for the

money supply.

      The Federal Reserve has two potential policy instruments: the weekly

average federal funds rate, i, or the weekly average path of (log) nonborrowed

reserves, 1n1BR.-1 Dealing first with the pre—October 6, 1979 period, i

will initially be treated as the tool used to implement policy.

Pre—October 1979 Qperat ing Procedures

      Prior to October 1979, the Federal Reserve used           in trying to equate

money demand to the targeted quantity of money. It is assumed that money demand

is given by
                                                      —10—



where Pt is the log of the price level and rt is the rate on an n—week

security, such as a 13—week Treasury bill. The appearance of r in (3)

captures the notion that the demand for money does not depend on the federal

funds rate, but on a longer term interest rate. Income is treated as a

constant for this analysis and is not explicitly included in (3). Since, in

this section, Pt will be treated as a constant, it will be covenient to define

cx =      + Pt and write

        mt =a—cr
            0  It +u t                                                                   (3)

As (3) is a weekly money demand equation, the random disturbance
                                                      14/
is likely to exhibit a high degree of serial correlation.— To model this

in a simple way, assume

        Ut =   pu   1+ Ct, p1 < 1                                                        (4)


where      is a white noise process.

        An expectations model of the term structure of interest rates is used

to link i and r .
           t           t
                                  If   4'
                                         t
                                             is defined as the information set available to the

public,
                           n— 1
           =   (1/n)        Z E(i+.I).                                                  (5)
                       j =0

Equation (5) reveals why current interest rates such as rt will depend on

anticipated future policy since rt is a function of expected future settings

of the policy variable

        Using the money demand function (3), the Federal Reserve can calculate

the path of rt which is consistent with its target path for the money stock,

conditional on the information available at the beginning of week t. If

r÷.(c) is this target path, suppose i'+.O7) is the path for the federal funds

rate which satisfies:
                                                  —11—


                                 n-i
                     =   (1/n)    E ÷÷); I = 0,...
                                 J=O
                                                                                      (6)



Because of idiosyncratic developments during week t, assume the funds rate

actually set by the Federal Reserve is given by

             =
                 i()      +


where        is a mean zero, serially uncorrelated weekly policy deviation from

the targeted value of the funds rate.

        With a funds rate operating procedure, the Federal Reserve sets

according to (7) at the beginning of the settlement week. Because i(c2) is

based on t which includes information not available to the public prior to

the Friday announcement, the public cannot distinguish the component parts

in (7). Using the term structure equation (5), the appendix shows that r can

be written as

                 l/it —                             —
        rt                                 E(m÷÷

                 +                                        +
                         j=O
                               E(u÷+i —                        E(rI)                  (8)



Equation (8) shows explicitly how r depends on the public's expectations about

the target path for the money supply.

        In order to analyze the effects of the money announcement, it will be

necessary to define more specifically the public's information set                   and relate

it to the Federal Reserve's information set                   Let   denote the public's

information prior to the money announcement. Let r be the equilibrium value

of rt, just prior to the announcement, obtained by substituting                for          in

                                       =          ) as the public's information set after
(8). Similarly, define                     {m2,
                                                    —12—



        is announced. The interest rate after the announcement is r. Since

 the only new information analyzed here is the announcement of tn2, it follows

 that        =
                 —1            =


        From     (3), m2 =             — r2       + u2 so that prior to the announcement,

 E(rn2I) =           c cr2 + pu3. The new information contained in the announce-
                       —



ment of m2 is then equal to
                 —
                     E(m2I)        =
                                       u2 — pu3 = c_2.                                            (9)


The money "surprise", the difference between the announcement on Friday and

the public's expectation of in2, is just the week t—2 innovation in the money

demand disturbance.

        Making use of the policy rule (2), together with (8), it is possible to

derive the adjustment in r which occurs in response to the announcement (details

can be found in the appendix):


             —   b =           p(l_X)2(l_o1)[(1_A)fl — 1]                (1fl_l)

                                                                                       (n—l)1p1
                                                                                                        (10)

        Although the money surprise, 2' is itself direct information only                         on

the week t—2 money demand innovation, its effect on r can be seen from (10)

to consist of three components. The last term, c (l--n)1p/n < 0 is a Keynesian

liquidity effect. To the extent that a positive deviation above target, for

example, is partially accommodated                         <   1),   the money supply will be

permanently higher. Since the interest elasticity of the demand for money

is negative, interest rates must fall.

        The middle term in (10) is positive and represents the effect on                    r of
the public's revised expectations about future money demand. If                        c2 > 0,
                                          —13—



individuals revise upwards their estimates of future u's. Higher estimates

of future money demand lead to expectations of higher future interest rates

for a given target path.

        The first term in (10), is negative since (l_X)hl < 1.         The upward

pressure on interest rates produced by a positive surprise is moderated to

the extent that the Federal Reserve is expected to return in to the target path
                 15/
only   gradually.—
        The effect of the money announcement in this policy anticipations model

on interest rates of longer maturity than rt can also easily be derived using

the expectations model of the term structure. Let Rt be the rate on a security

with rnn weeks to maturity. Then
                       rn-i
        R = (1/rn)      Z E(r+k).                                                       (11)
                       k=0

Making use of some earlier results, it can be shown that

        R - R   =    (l/m)(r   -
                                   r)   (l/m)_1                        + kl]

                     + [(l—m)/m]
                                   61t—2                                                (12)


The first and second terms on the RHS of (12) are both positive if                 >   0.

The final term is negative, and it represents the money surprise that is

permanently accommodated and which, therefore, through a Keynesian liquidity

effect, tends to reduce future interest rates. If the Federal Reserve always

attempts to return to target,           = 0 and IR —

Post—October 1979 Operatin& Procedures

       Equations (10) and (12) give the response to the money announcement

of both short— and long—term interest rates under a federal funds rate operating
                                       —14—



procedure. On October 6, 1979, however, the Federal Reserve shifted to a

nonborrowed reserves operating procedure. Such a procedure involves setting

a path for rionborrowed reserves which is consistent with achieving the targeted

path for money. To analyze the interest rate response to a money announcement

during the post—October 1979 period it is necessary to note that the current

week's funds rate,         is no longer fixed. A positive money surprise indicates

to market participants that the level of required reserves for the current

settlement week will be higher than expected. This should lead to a higher

funds rate in the remainder of the current week, which through the term

structure equation (5), leads to a higher r. To explicitly model this

additional effect, it is necessary to incorporate into the model a specification

of the market for reserves.

      Under lagged reserve accounting, the log of required reserves is given

by
            =   k   + m2                                                     (13)

where k is the log of the required reserve ratio. For simplicity, it is

assumed that all deposits are subject to the same reserve ratio and that the

deposit to money ratio is constant. Assuming excess reserves are zero,

equation (13) gives the demand for reserves.

      The supply of reserves consists of nonborrowed reserves—taken to be

the policy variable in the post—October 1979 period—and borrowed reserves.

A rise in the funds rate relative to the discount rate leads to a rise in

bank borrowings and a fall in nonborrowed reserves as a fraction of total

reserves. This relationship is specified as
                                             —15—

where            is the discount rate, and v is a mean zero, serially uncorrelated

disturbance term.

        To represent the determination of the policy variable in week t, assume

        lnNBR = lnNBR +
where lnNBR is the (log) value of nonborrowed reserves consistent with

achieving the target path for the money supply and                is a transitory policy

deviation from the target. Equation (7) replaces (7) in an analysis of the

post—October 1979 period. Parallel with the treatment of the pre—October

1979 period, assume that at the beginning of week t, the public knows lnBR

but not its decomposition into lnNBR and

        Under this operating procedure, the federal funds rate adjusts to

equilibrate the reserve market. Equating the demand for reserves to the supply

and solving for i yields
             =        + [k +            + m2 — ln1BR + v —     ].                  (15)

The response of the funds rate to the announcement can be shown to equal

        E(i) -           E(i) '(m2
                                =              —

A positive surprise (cr2 > 0) causes an upward revision in expected reserve

demand over the remainder of the settlement week, leading to a rise in the

funds rate.

        To determine the impact under a reserves operating procedure of the

announcement, equation (5) can be utilized, along with (16) to derive the

response of the short—term interest rate:
                                              —16—

       One result is immediate from a comparison of (10), the pre—October 1979

effect, and (17), the post—October 1979 effect. For given values of a, p, A,

and 5, the change in operating procedures introduces a new term, l/n > 0,

into the response coefficient. A given money surprise has a larger effect on

short—term interest rates under a nonborrowed reserves operating procedure

than under a funds rate operating procedure. This is consistent with the

increased response after October 1979 documented in Table 1. From (12) and

(17), however, it may be shown that the response of longer term (in—quarter)

yields increases by only 1/m .      1/en.     Thus, some other factors in the model must

contribute to the increased response of long—term yields.

       One possibility is that the change in operating procedures was viewed

by the public as accompanied by a shift in the policy adjustment rule followed

by the Federal Reserve. If the use of noriborrowed reserves rather than the

funds rate was interpreted as signaling a greater determination on the part

of the Federal Reserve to keep money on target, either A or           (or both) may

have changed. A fall in         would indicate that less of any deviation from

target would be accommodated, while a rise in A would indicate a faster elimina-

tion of any deviations. Either such change tends to increase the response to

the money surprise in (17) and (12).

      Another result of the change in operating procedures was a large increase

in the volatility generally of interest rates. In Walsh (1982, 1983), it is
                                   —17—



shown that a rise in the volatility of interest rates may lead to a fall in

the interest elasticity of the demand for money which is proportional to the

rise in volatility. Such a decline in      as a consequence of the shift to a

nonborrowed reserves operating procedure would also tend to increase the

response of both short— and long—term yields to a given money surprise.    The

effects of changes in these various parameters are examined further using

numerical examples in the fourth section.

      III. pected Inflation Model

      The model in the previous section, in order to focus on the policy

anticipations effect, assumed that the expected rate of inflation remained

constant in the face of the money announcement. This implies that the interest

rate adjustments were adjustments in real interest rates. An alternative view

of interest rate determination argues that real interest rates are independent

of monetary influences so that any response of interest rates to a money

announcement must be due to changes in the expected inflation premium incorporated

in market rates. The present section develops a model of interest rate responses

which attributes all changes in rates to changes in expected inflation.

      If p is the constant ex ante real rate of interest and rt is, as before,

the rate on an n—week security, then

      r = p+                   —       +                                    (18)
                   [E(Pt+It)
              16/ and n Is a mean zero disturbance term assumed to be serially
where y = 5200—        t


uncorrelated.
      In the model of section II, any deviation of the money stock from its

target value leads to an adjustment in target levels but no change in the targeted

long—run growth rate. This assumption needs to be modified to allow for the

possibility that a value of m_2 above target leads the Federal Reserve to revise
                                                   —18—




upwards its targeted growth rate. If this occurred, the public, in the face of

a positive money surprise, might infer faster money growth and higher inflation

in the future. This possibility can be captured by rewriting the policy

reaction rule in the form

                    —
                        m+.(i) =          [(j+l)2     +    + (l_A)3(l_i)]pc2;

                                         j   =   0,1,...                                (2)
where use has been made of the fact that Pc_2 =
                                                                E(m
                                                                              —
                                                                                  mi(ti).     To

understand the role of 2' suppose that the targeted growth rate is k and that

      =
          m2   + (j+2)k. The actual growth rate from t—2 to t—l is estimated,

at time t, to be k+ pc2. If this growth rate were to be maintained, the new

target for m+. would be                  =
                                             E(m 1Ic2) + (j+1)k + (j+l)pc2 (ignoring A
and       for simplicity). If the deviation has no effect on the targeted growth

rate, m+. = E(mt tt) + (j+1)k, which is the case considered in the previous

section. Equation (2) allows a fraction t52 of the growth—rate deviation to

have a permanent effect on the Federal Reserve's growth—rate target.

      To determine the expected rate of inflation as a function of the under-

lying parameters of the model, it is first necessary to find the equilibrium

solution for the log of the price level. From the money demand equation (3)

and the Fisher equation (18):

      m — Pt    =        —   a[p + (y/n)(E(pt+             —     + u.                       (19)
                    a0

Solving for p, equation (19) implies
           = (n+yct)                                              —
                             [n1n +   n(aii —

Since ya/(n+ya) <       1, equation (20) can be solved forward under the assumption
of rational expectations. This yields

     any   permanent change in the annual growth rate of money leads to a one—f or—

     one rise in long—term interest rates.

             Because interest rates in this model adjust only in response to                         changes
     in the expected rate of Inflation, It Is possible to solve for the adjustment

     responses in (22) and (23) without any reference to the Federal Reserve's

     operating procedure. The expected Inflation model predicts that the interest
                                  —20--




rate response to a money announcement is independent of the particular proce-

dure used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy. To explain

the large increases in the response coefficients reported in Table 1 within

the context of the inflation expectations model, it is necessary to assume

that there were shifts in the basic model parameters at the time of the change

in operating procedures. For example, a rise in 62 the fraction of the week

t—2 to t—l growth rate deviation which the Federal Reserve accommodates, would

increase the response coefficients. Using numerical examples, the model is

also compared to the estimated responses in the next section.

      IV. Evaluation of the Models

      In this section, the stylized models of the policy anticipations and

the expected inflation effects are examined in terms of their consistency

with the empirical results reported in Table 1. While the models are specified

under a variety of simplifying assumptions, they nevertheless embody the impor-

tant features of the underlying hypotheses. Following the evaluation of the

models, additional empirical evidence is presented on the persistence of

announced money surprises.

      In examining the consistency of the models with the estimated responses

in Table 1, iterative grid searches are performed over the models' parameters

in both the pre— and post—October 1979 periods. In addition, the searches

are implemented simultaneously for the 3—month (n=13), 1—year (m=4), 5—year

(m=20), 10—year (m=40), and the 20—year (m=80) yields. For the policy
anticipations model, the response of the 3—month yield is represented by (10) and

(17) for the pre— and post—October 1979 periods, respectively. For longer

term yields (m=4, 20, 40, 80), the response under both policy regimes is
                                      —21—



given by (12). For the expected inflation model, the response of the

3—month yield is represented by (22), and the response of longer term yields

is given by (23). In each case, all parameters of the models——A,                 ,   p,

and cS2 (when relevant)——are subjected to the grid search. The criterion

used in the search is to minimize the sum of the absolute percentage

differences from the point estimates in Table 1 across the five yields._Z'

Is the Policy Anticp!4ons Model Consistent with the Estimated Responses?

      The response of the term structure of interest rates under the policy

anticipations hypothesis is computed for selected parameter values in Table 2.

The reported values for the responses consist of both those conforming to the

estimated responses in Table 1——given the criterion described above——as well

as examples exhibiting the effects of changes in parameter values. As is

apparent in the table, sets of parameters are calculated separately for the

pre— and post—October 1979 periods.

      For the pre—October 1979 period, the policy anticipations model is

capable of yielding responses fairly close to those in Table 1 when the

parameters take values of p =    .986,       =   .143,   A   .687, and   =   .000.

The response of the 3—month yield, for example, is calculated as 6.48, which

is identical to its estimated value in Table 1. Moreover, the responses of

longer term interest rates are all positive and fairly close to the

corresponding estimated values.

      The reported parameter values implied by the responses for the pre—

October 1979 period suggest that weekly money demand disturbances are highly

serially correlated (p =    .986),   and that they are eventually offset

completely (6, =   0).   The speed at which a money demand shock is offset,
                                    —22—



 however, is implausibly high. In particular, the value in Table 2 (A =     .687)
 implies that approximately 68 percent (A      p   cr2) of a surprise in

 announced money is offset during the week of the announcement. The responses

 are nevertheless quite insensitive to changes in the rate at which surprises

 are offset, as indicated by the third and fourth rows in Table 2. In contrast,

 the fraction of the surprise accommodated has a larger impact on the responses,

as indicated in the second row, where        is increased to .100.

       In the lower panel of Table 2, sets of parameter values for the post—

October 1979 period are reported. The first row again corresponds to the

parameters obtained from the grid search. The next three rows report values

for selected changes in the policy parameters, as before. The results for

the post—October 1979 period suggest that money surprises are somewhat more

highly serially correlated (p =   .996),   and that the interest—rate responsiveness

of money demand is over five times smaller than that in the pre—October 1979

period.--' Because of the persistence of money demand shocks and the much

lower interest—rate responsiveness of money demand, short—term rates must

remain above their original levels for an extended period of time if the

original long—run target path for money is maintained (        0).   The combination

of these factors is sufficient to explain the relatively large response of long—

term interest rates. By comparing the first and fifth rows in each panel, note

that changes in policy parameters across periods have negligible effects on

the responses.

Is the Expected Inflation Model Consistent with the Estimated Responses?

     Analogous to Table 2, the response of the term structure of interest

rates under the expected inflation hypothesis is solved for selected parameter

values in Table 3. As before, parameter values may be obtained which are consis-

tent with the estimated responses in Table 1. In the pre—October 1979 period,

the value for the serial correlation of money demand shocks is again quite high,

but the interest—rate responsiveness of money demand Is lower than that computed

under the policy anticipations hypothesis. The policy parameters also differ

substantially. In particular, the rate at which money surprises are offset

(X) is .438, although the reported responses are fairly insensitive to this

parameter, as Indicated in the fourth and fifth rows in the table. In addition,

the results suggest that a portion of the shock is accommodated by changing the

level of money's target path (oi =   .006),   and that the Federal Reserve permanently

raises its target growth rate in response to a positive shock (62 = .000192).

For a positive 1 percent shock, for example, the target annualized growth rate is

increased by almost .01 percentage points (52       62). As indicated in the table,

the 20—year yield's response of about 1 basis point predominately reflects this

revision in the target growth rate. This sensitivity is also apparent in the

sixth and seventh rows in the table, where the responses are calculated with

different values of 62. The response of short—term yields also depends

importantly on the initial accommodation in the current level of money (6i),

as may be seen in the second and third rows.

      For the post—October 1979 period, the two main changes in the parameters

are that 62 increases to .00256 and the interest—rate responsiveness of money

demand is about one—half its previous value. As suggested by Cornell (1983)

and Hardouvelis (1982), the increase in 62 indicates greater accommodation of

money surprises by the Federal Reserve through revisions in its target growth

 rate. In this case, the calculated value of 62 indicates that a 1 percent
                                   —24—



money surprise leads to a revision in the target annualized money growth of

 .13 percentage points. Again, the 20—year yield's response of 14.6 basis

points predominately reflects this accommodation. The eighth row in each panel

also indicates the key role of this parameter.

Persistence of Money Surprises

      The previous two subsections indicate that different sets of parameter

values may be found that make both the policy anticipations and expected infla-

tion hypotheses consistent with the estimated responses in Table 1. Despite

this inability to distinguish between the hypotheses on the basis of their

consistency with the estimated responses, the implications of the models do

differ dramatically. In particular, under the policy anticipations hypothesis,

the parameter values indicate that money surprises are totally offset after

some period of time. In contrast, under the expected inflation hypothesis,

target growth rates are permanently changed in the direction of the surprise.

      These different implications suggest one way in which the hypotheses

may be distinguished. In particular, under the policy anticipations hypothesis,

past surprises in the announced level of money would be expected to have

diminishing effects on the level of the money stock over time. Under the

expected inflation hypothesis, this should not be the case. Indeed, for

money surprises to affect expected inflation over the maturity of a long—

term security, surprises would be expected to persist over lengthy intervals.

      The monetary policy rule specified previously (2) may be used to

illustrate the possible relationship between past money surprises and the

level of the money stock. In particular, recursive substitution
                                                                  yields

where      =                +           +        Under the pure policy anticipations model,

62 = 0 so that as j becomes large, the coefficients on the lagged money

surprises decline, approaching 61p asymptotically. In contrast, the infla-

tion expectations model requires 62 >                   0.   In this case, equation (24) shows

that as j becomes larger, the coefficients on the lagged money surprises

must eventually start increasing with j. For the parameters reported in

                                                                               .438,        =   .021,
Table 3 for the post—October 1979 period, for example (A =

        .00256),      the coefficients are increasing for j              10.
62 =

        Equation (24), therefore, suggests a simple means of discriminating

between the policy anticipations hypothesis and the inflation expectations

hypothesis. To examine the persistence of money surprises, the following

empirical analogue of equation (24) is estimated:

        m = b         + b       •   trend t + E c.                                              (24)

         t                  1
                                             j
where    the trend variable is used to proxy                               If 62 >     0,   the c.'s

should eventually increase with j; if 62                      0, they should decline towards a

possibly nonzero constant. The estimation results for equation (24') for

both the pre— and post—October 1979 periods are reported in Table 4. In

each case, the equation is estimated without any constraints on the lag
               20 /
structure.—

        The estimation results suggest that money surprises are offset within

one year. In both periods, additional lag terms were included in the equations

until the estimated coefficients appeared to remain around, or even below,

zero.—' In the pre—October 1979 period, the unconstrained estimates become

negative after 33 weeks. Similarly, estimated lag coefficients for the post—

October 1979 period become negative after 48 weeks. This empirical evidence,

at least, casts strong doubt on the validity of the expected inflation hypothesis.

     V. Summary of Conclusions

     By constructing a model of interest rate responses to money announcements,

it has been possible to examine explicitly the effect of the Federal Reserve's

operating procedures and policy rule on the responses across the entire term

structure of interest rates. Two main conclusions follow from this paper.

      First, despite claims to the contrary, the policy anticipations hypothesis

is capable of explaining the response of the entire term structure of interest

rates to surprises in weekly money announcements. This hypothesis was shown

to be consistent with the response in both the pre— and post—October 1979

periods. Two key elements of this explanation involve the persistence of

money demand shocks along with the Federal Reserve's desire to eventually

offset money surprises. Nevertheless, the expected inflation hypothesis was

also shown to be consistent with the term structure's response. Under this

hypothesis, it follows that the Federal Reserve increases both the level and

growth rate of their monetary target in response to positive money surprises.

      Second, in examining the effects of past money surprises on the level of

the money stock, the empirical evidence suggested that their effects diminish

to zero within one year. This result is inconsistent with the expected infla-

tion hypothesis, which posits an increasing effect of money surprises on the

level of the money stock. Further empirical work would, nevertheless, be

useful in distinguishing between the competing hypotheses.

 1. InitIal research on this topic also includes unpublished studies
 Sivesarid (1978) and Conrad (1978).                                 by

 2. Both of these studies
                           are, of course, based on pre—October 1979 data.
 Using post—October 1979 data, Makin (1982) finds that movements in nominal
 interest rates have been influenced
                                     more by changes in expected real rates
 than by expected inflation.

 3. However, Cornell (1982) does not attribute these results to the
 anticipations effect. Also, Urich and Wachtel (1982) and Roley and policy
                                                                     Troll
 (1983) exanine the impact of
                              unanticipated announced changes in the con-
sumer (CPI) and producer (FF1) price indices on Treasury bill yields. Both
studies find statistically Insignificant responses in the pre—October 1979
period, and Urich and Wachtel (1982) estimate
                                               a response to FF1 surprises
which is significant at the 5 percent level in the October i979—June 1981
period. By extending the sample to October 1982, however, Roley and Troll
(1983) fincf That the estimated
                                response is again insignificant at the 10
percent level.

4. The excluded observations
                              correspond to announcements of the CPI, the
FF1, the unemployment rate, and industrial production. In the pre—October
1979 sample, 43 observations were excluded, while 22 were excluded in the
post—October 1979 sample.

5. Announced changes in Mi—B are analyzed here because of the emphasis
placed on Mi—B by Federal Reserve polIcyrnakers
                                                and market participants. It
should also be noted that the Mi—B data for 1981 are not the shift—adjusted
MI—B figures which reflect the introduction of nationwide NOW accounts.
While the Federal Reserve's target range was in terms of shift—adjusted Mi—B,
weekly announced changes were not shift adjusted.

6. As reported by Roley (1983) in the context of the response of Treasury
bill yields, specifying the surprise in terms of levels rather than changes
has virtually no effect on the empirical results. For this paper, specifi-
cations were estimated with changes in the levels of interest rates,
changes in the log of interest rates, and with money surprises in terms of
announced changes, announced levels, and the log of announced levels.
Again these alternative specifications
                                       yielded virtually the same results.
We are Indebted to Raul A. Nicho, vice
                                       president with Money Market Services,
for making the survey data available for this project.
7. In forming the revised expectation, the change in the 3—month bill yield
from Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. to Friday at 3:30 p.m. is taken as a proxy for the
receipt of all new information from the time of the survey to just before
the money announcement. Regressing the announced change in money on the
survey measure and this change in the bill yield indicates that this proxy
is statistically significant at the 5 percent level [see Roley (1983)]. The
rationality of the survey data is examined by Grossman (1981) for the pre—
October 1979 period and by Roley (1983) for the post—October 1979 period.
These studies indicate that except for an additive bias in the pre—October
1979 period, usual hypotheses concerning the rationality of the expected
money data used here cannot be rejected at low significance levels. For
further analysis of these data, see Urich and Wachtel (1983).

8.  In contrast to the other yield data used here,   eral funds rate data
provided by the Federal Reserve are in terms of daily averages. These data,
however, predominately reflect federal funds trading before 3:30 p.m.

9. Following Urich and Wachtel (1981) and Roley (1983), more complicated
specifications which disaggregated money surprises according to the rela-
tionship of money growth to its long—run policy ranges were also estimated.
However, because of the larger standard errors of the equations estimated
here due to the longer time interval over which the changes in rates were
measured, the effects of policy ranges were not statistically significant
for any of the yields in the post—October 1979 period. In the pre—October
1979 period, however, the effects of policy ranges were statistically
significant in two instances, but only because of statistically significant
coefficients with perverse signs. Also, the presence of statistically
significant constant terms in some of the estimated equations in Table 1
may reflect measurement error in either the expected money data or the
change in interest rates. Alternatively, they may reflect day—of—the—week
effects [Gibbons and Hess (1981)).

10. To avoid potential problems associated with heteroscedasticitY, the
equations in each of the periods are weighted by the reciprocals of their
estimated standard errors in the tests.

11. The role of the announcement in providing information on past money
demand shifts is emphasized by Urich (1982) and Nichols, Small, and lebster
(1983).

12. Equation (2) is similar to the policy rule used by Tinsley, von zur
                                                  = 0.

13. McCallum and Hoehn (1983) analyze the optimal instrument choice in the
context of lagged reserve accounting. For empirical evidence, see Sivesand
and Hurley (1980).

14. In a similar specification of a biweekly money demand equation, Urich
(1982) assumes u is serially uncorrelated.
15. Equation (10) can be compared with the results of other authors. Urich
(1982) assumes ct2 provides no information on     and that 6-j    0. His
expression for the announcement effect corresponds, therefore, only to the
first term in (10). Nichols, Small, and Webster (1983) rely on an expected
interest rate change in the money demand equation to motivate future expec-
tations affecting current interest rates. They also assume m is the policy
instrument of the Federal Reserve and that ni2 — E(m           reveals informa-
tion on the net shock to both money supply and money emand during week
t—2. However, under lagged reserve accounting, the major shocks generating
week—to—week fluctuations in the money stock arise from the demand for money
as modeled here.

16. In the empirical work, interest rates are measured in basis points at
annual rates. This makes it necessary to multiply an n—week rate of change
such as t+n —
               Pt by 5200.
17. For computational convenience, certain limitations were placed on the
number of digits taken by the parameters. In particular, A, , and p were
restricted to three decimal points, and three nonzero digits were found for
  and 62. All parameters were restricted to take values between zero and
one.

18. The increased interest—rate volatility in the post—October 1979 period
coinciding with the change in operating procedures is capable of explaining
this fall in interest elasticity in the model presented by Walsh (1982,
1983). In addition, this elasticity may have declined due to increased
financial innovation and deregulation, which may not be totally independent
of the rise in volatility. See, for example, Lindsey (1977) and Niehans (1982).

19. Note that a proxy for           is not needed in (24') since the money
surprises t—j—2 (j=0,...,k—1) are, under rational expectations, uncorrelated
with this variable. The proxy was instead included to reduce heteroscedasticity
and serial correlation. In this model, as is common in many rational expecta-
tions models, standard serial correlation correction procedures would result
in inconsistent coefficient estimates. In contrast, OLS estimation yields
consistent coefficient estimates in this case, but potentially inconsistent
estimated standard errors.

20. Polynomial lags were also estimated, and they yielded virtually the same
qualitative results.

21. Extending both lags beyond the lengths reported in Table 4 suggested that
the estimated coefficients do not once again increase. Furthermore, lagged
money surprises were entered separately on the right—hand side of (24 )  (i.e.,
c1 = 0 (ij), c 0) and the estimation results were comparable to those
reported in the table.

Policy Anticipations Model

      From the term structure relationship equation (5),

           =
               (l/n)i +     (1/n) E E(i+.J)                                  (A.1)


since, from (7), E(i+.lt) =              E(i+).          Using the fact that (l/n)ZE(i÷1k) =

               — (1/n) E(i+I), equation (A.l) can be manipulated to
eliminate the future federal funds rates, yielding


      rt =   (l/n)i + j!O E(r÷+i '÷+' + ((n_l)/n)E(rI) (A.2)
where it   is assumed that E(+c,jt) = E(r÷1). The target values of r÷.

are found by using the money demand equation (3):

From   (A.6) and (A.7), equation (A.9) can be rewritten as

              -
                  R
                      =    (1/m)(r      —

                          + [(1—m)/in] a1_2.
This is equation (12).
       For the post—October 1979 operating procedures, i                  does   not necessarily
remain       constant in response to the announcement. From (A.4), this implies

that a term, (1/n) [E(il) —                      E(ik)} must be added to (A.5). From (15),
       E(iI) —              E(iI)           =
                                                81(m2

adding       (1/n)'c_2 to the response coefficient found in (10) yields (17).

The solution equation for p, given by (21),                    implies that

This    is equation (22).

        To find the response of long—term interest rates, start with equation

(A.8). From the Fisher equation,


        E(r+kj) —                 E(r+1) = (y/n)[E(pt+kI) - E(p++t)].                                       (A.16)

Using (A.13), (A.15), and (A.7), equation (A.8) under the inflation expectations

model   yields equation (23):
