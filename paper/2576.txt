                 A NON-COMPETITIVE, EQUILIBRIUM
                       MODEL OF FLUCTUATIONS


                                ABSTRACT



An equilibrium model of fluctuations has two components: an elastic
labor supply schedule and a source of shifts of the labor demand schedule.
In the real business cycle model, shifts of labor demand follow from
vibrations in the production function. In the model of this paper, shifts of
labor demand are the result of changes in preferences. Total real GNP
falls when demand shifts away from goods produced by sectors with
market power and toward competitive sectors. The observed cyclical
stability of relative prices is consistent with such demand shifts.

          At   a
             very general level, macroeconomists have a common view
about the basic elements of a model of fluctuations in aggregate output
and employment. First, labor supply is effectively highly elastic. Real
business cycle theorists posit sufficiently high intertemporal substitution in
leisure that the labor supply schedule for temporary movements of the real
wage is very elastic.         Others, who question high intertemporal
substitution, embrace theories of efficiency wages or other theories where
large movements in hours of work can occur without significant changes in
real wages.
        The second area of basic agreement is that shifts labor demand are
the basic driving force of fluctuations. In the real business cycle model,
vibrations of the production function are responsible for movements of
labor demand. Critics have pointed out that technical regress is not a
convincing explanation of recessions. But within a one-sector model, the
sources  of shifts of labor demand are closely circumscribed. Any inward
shift of the marginal product of labor schedule is interpretable as technical
regress. Hence a two-sector model seems a more natural one to generate
upward and downward shifts in labor demand. Net demand will fluctuate
only if there are important asymmetries between the sectors.
          The basic idea of this paper is to explore the asymmetry that
results from the coexistence of monopoly and competitive sectors. The
monopoly sector might be manufacturing and the competitive sector the
rest of the economy. Shifts of demand generate fluctuations in total
output because resources are not usually fully utilized in the monopoly
sector whereas the competitive sector always produces at capacity.
         The principal objective of this paper is to develop a model in the
equilibrium style that combines elastic labor supply with the driving force
of shifts in the composition of demand. IL the model, contractions in
aggregate output are inefficient, because they are the result of
inappropriately low levels of output of the monopoly good. However,
there is much more to the analysis than just the simple point that the
social cost of reductions in output is higher in a non-competitive economy.
'That point has already been made effectively by Akerlof aud Yelien (1985)
and Maukiw (1985). The point here is that a competitive economy has a
strong drive to full resource utilisation, whereas that drive is much
attenuated in a non-competitive economy. The competitor puts all his
output on the market; the price-maker always has to worry about the
effect of more output on the price he gets for his existing output. The
analysis has some points in corncnon with Oliver Hart's (1982) important
paper.
         The model in this paper relies entirely on the equilibrium mode of
analysis. The preferences of the actors are clearly stated, the technology is
spelled out, and the restrictions on the interactions of the actors are made
plain. Subject to those restrictions, there are no opportunities for Pareto
improvements. The central departure from most other equilibrium models
is non-competitive behavior on the part of some sellers. These sellers
perceive the true demand schedule for their products and maximize profit
subject to that schedule. Of course, the resulting equilibrium is
inefficient—Pareto-preferableallocations are available. However, I assume
that no collective action on the part of consumers is possible to achieve

                                     2
those improved allocations.
        As usual in equilibrium models, clarity and precision are achieved
at considerable cost in realism. There is no more than an analogy between
the recession state in this model and what actually happens in the U.S.
economy in recession. But the essential elements are there, in my view. A
recession involves unused resources and it is a time when no actor can

improve his well-being by making a simple deal.



The question of driving forces


         Any model of fluctuations has to take a stand on the sources of
those fluctuations. Some commentators have made a distinction between
aggregate demand and supply disturbances as driving forces in
fluctuations,         in general equilibrium, the distinction between
                However,
demand and supply is not fundamental. A better distinction is among
shifts in preferences, in technology, and in policy.
        Recent equilibrium models, such as Prescott's (1986), have
stressed technology shifts as the basic driving force of fluctuations. In
models with only       a  single produced good, preference shocks are
unattractive as a     driving force because they amount to explaining
recessions as periods of epidemic laziness, when the public prefers to

languish at home rather than work.
         The model in this paper contains shifts in both preferences and
technology. The two shifts are incorporated in the model in such a way
that   only   their product influences real allocations.   In the basic

                                       3
development of the model, I will talk about the "driving variable," which
is the product of the two shift variables. Later I will discuss how
preference shifts differ from technology shifts in their effects on relative
prices. It tnrns out that preference shifts generate fluctuations that look
like the ones discussed in the traditional account of variations in aggregate
demand, whereas technology shifts look more like the fluctuations
generated by real business cycle models.




1. The model



    The economy has two sectors. In the first, there are worker-producers
who make a good, x1, and consume both x1 and the other good, x2. There
are a great many of them and they are always price-takers. They have an
endowment, z, of good 1. Their preferences are stated in an indirect
utility function,


                             i [    1c1

                                                 + log   ()

Here Pi and P2 are the two prices and y is income. The variable S
influences the allocation of income between the two goods; it will be

considered one of the two driving forces of fluctuations.1 The parameter e
controls the elasticity of demand for good 2 and is assumed to exceed one.
These preferences were proposed by Burtless and Hausman (1978) in the
context of labor supply. The demand for good 2 is


                                            9V

                                              J Pi


I will take good I as numeraire and note that y =                so   the demand
schedule for good 2 is:



                          =
                               [   ]


        I assume the following about the technology:         Sector 2 produces 9
units of x2 by using    1   unit of good 1   as raw material. The variable 9 is


       1Readers of the earlier version of the paper should note that 6
does not shift the elasticity of demand for good 2, only the level. The

paper does not rest on any cyclical changes in the elasticity of demand.

the other driving force of fluctuations. Sector 2 has a physical capacity
limit, z, The owners of sector 2 consume only x1, so their objective is to
maximize their profit or consumption of good 1. The workers in sector 2
are incapable of working in sector 1 and they do not value their own time.
        The variables S and 8 are specified so that for both, higher values
are associated with greater output of good 2. 1 will also consider the
product,      8 8, to measure their combined effect.




Competition




        To find the competitive equilibrium in the model, I will examine
the excess demand function for good 2:



(L4)            E(p2)   =   D(p2)                      if P2 <


(1.5)                   =           -                 if   P2   =
                            [D()        z2,
                                              D()j

(1.6)                   =   D(p2)   -   z2            if P2 >




In 1.4 , price is below cost in sector 2, so supply is zero and excess demand

                                        6
is positive. In 1.5, price is at the point where supply from sector 2 is
perfectly elastic. Excess demand is a correspondence, but there is a
possibility that it includes only positive values. Finally, in 1.6, price is
sufficiently high that producers in sector 2 operate at capacity, z2. If there
was no equilibrium in 1.5 in the perfectly elastic part of the supply
schedule, at price    9,
                    there will be one at a higher price in 1.6. That price




                 P2   =
                                  [ij
                                  r z1

Because   this price exceeds £11, sector 2 operates at capacity:


                x2    =      z2


The critical point at which sector 2 just reaches capacity is described by


                D() =             Z2



or


                 (60)
                       —C
                            z1    =      z2




Note that this depends just on the product, q. The critical point is




                                              7
(LII)                 =    [j
The real allocations in the economy are controlled by the composite
variable  .    If times are sufficiently bad that < 4" , then the
equilibrium occurs at a level of output below capacity and price is equal to
marginal materials cost:


(1.12)           P2


(1.13)                =

If   times are good and    >   ,   then x2 is   at its capacity   level z2,

                                                                              The


Sector 2 operates at capacity except in the most unfavorable conditions.
In those conditions, price falls all the way to the marginal cost of raw
materials; workers earn no wages and owners earn no rents in sector 2.


Monopoly


     The demandschedule facing sector 2 is


(1.14)            D(p9)    =
                               [   ]
In the monopoly case, sector 2 maximizes its consumption of good 1:

Again, the real allocation depends just on the composite, th. A comparison
of i17 to 1.10 shows that the critical value of the driving variable where
the monopoly reaches full capacity output is



Comparison    of competition and monopoly


       In the model, the capacity of sector 2 is a given value, not chosen
by the economy's actors, I will compare competition and monopoly for

                                         10
the case where the capacity is the same. Of course, if the monopolist has
an exclusive license for selling the second product, he would choose less
than the competitive level of capacity. By the competitive level, I mean
the level that would result from free entry. In comparison to the exclusive
license case, my results will overstate the tendency for a monopolist to
have excess capacity. On the other hand, if the monopolist does not have
an exclusive license and must defend a profitable position, that defense
might well involve holding at least the competitive level of capacity.
Hence the comparison at equal levels of capacity is a reasonable one.

         Figure 2 compares the relations between the driving variable
and the level of output for the cases of monopoly and competition. There
is a range of values of under which the competitive economy operates at
capacity but the monopolistic economy has unused capacity. That range



                              /1*

The width of the interval is controlled in proportional terms by the
markup ratio, p. If that ratio is 1.5, for example, then the monopolistic
economy has idle resources at values of up to 1.5 times as high as the
ones where the competitive economy begins to operate at capacity.

               there is no capital, the model can serve as a fluctuations

model without further elaboration. In each period, there is a drawing
from    a
        probability distribution F(.) for the driving variable. The
determination of output, as derived in the previous section, can be
summarized for the competitive case as


(2.1)              xt = i,bc(t) =            z1        if     <

                                        z2              otherwise




variable is (z2/zi)1; whenever         >          , ,
I have dropped the subscript 2 from xt because the output of sector 1
never departs from its capacity, z1. The critical value,   for the driving
                                                 the competitive economy
reaches capacity output in sector 2.
        Output for the monopolistic case is simply


(2.2)                  = ,bm(t)          c(
            In both cases, the price of good 2 can be obtained from the inverse
of the demand function:


(2.3)              t   =   6
                               r z1

                                        13
Again, I have dropped the subscript 2.
        The foflowing disussion will make t:he assumption that there is
some chance that     will be below the level,      p,
                                                  and so in the region
where sector 2 operates below capacity and monopely power affects the
allocation. That assumption can be expressed as        > 0 Then
there are four ways to express the general conclusion that the monopolictic
economy is more vulnerable to episodes & unmed rapacity:


1.   The expected value of     x   ic lewer under monoxoly        than under

2. The monopolistic economy has unused eapait: a iargrr fraction of the
time; the probability of slack nuder monopoly is F(ic    which exceeds

the probability of slack under competition. F(ç55).

bad times. The reason for this is simple. Once sector 2 reaches its
capacity, monopoly power has no effect on its output or price. The
adverse effects of monopoly occur only when output is below capacity; this
happens only in bad times.




Aggregate output




        The output of sector 1 is always equal to its endowment z1.
Excess capacity cannot occur as long as good 1 is valued positively; that
is, p is finite. Only the output of sector 2 changes over time.          Aggregate
output could be measured as real GNP,


(2.4)          y =         -   x2    +   p0 x2


The quantity z1 -    x2 is deliveries of good      1           and p0x is
                                                       to final demand
deliveries of good 2 to final demand, valued at a base year price Po Real
GNP can also be expressed as the sum of value added in the two sectors:


(2.5)         y =     z1   +   (Po
                                     -
                                         )    X2



As long as the base-year price,   p, exceeds marginal materials, cost,
GNP will be positively related to sector 2 output.
                                                                            ,   real


      The preference shift, 5, which only changes the composition of

                                         15
demand at the level of the individual, affects the level of output in the
aggregate. The influence is much greater in the case of monopoly, because
Po will exceed   0' by a wider margin in that case.
                                                  The technology shift, 9,
operates in the same way by influencing the level of x2 and also increases
real GNTP by reduciugthe input requirement, 9' x2, which is a charge
against real GNP.
         I conclude that the variations in the output of sector 2 will give
rise to fluctuations in real GNP. To put it a different way, fluctuations in
real GNP will he seen as fluctuations in the sum of the value added in            a
cyclically stable sector (sector 1) and cyclically sensitive sector (sector 2).



3. Comparison of shifts in preferences and in technology



        One of the salient characteristics of fluctuations in modern
economies is the insensitivity of relative prices and wages to slack
conditions,   Traditional macroeconomic thinking has made price-wage
rigidity a starting point for explanations of fluctuations, Other models,
including this one, derive price rigidity from assumptions about the
underlying characteristics of the economy, In this model, there is no
distinction between workers and owaers, so there is no way to measure
wage rigidity. However, it is possible to examine the cyclical movements
of the relative price.
         The movements of the relative price are quite different under
preference st1nts from those under technology shifts.        Co-movements of

                                       16
relative price and relative quantity are one of the ways to determine the
relative importance of the two driving forces In competition, a slnft of
preferences toward good 2 will raise its relative price. On the other hand.

In monopoly, the second statement remains true. but the first may fail. to
the region of constant marginal cost, with outpnt below capacity in sector
2, the behavior of the monopolist's price depends on the behavior of the
elasticity of demand. nile relative price can ri,c or fail when preferencm

capacity, price is negatively related to the productivity variable and
negative y related to output.

Conclusions from relative price movements




           I believe that it is a reasonable stylized fact of business cycles that
there are no robust and important fluctuations in relative prices over the
cycle. Cyclcally-sensitive" prices are hard to find and are limited to
quantitatively unimportant sectors such as scrap metal. There evidence
that in deep. prolonged contractions, thc prices of conipetitively-supplicd
goods tend to fall more than those of monopoly or oligopoly goods (Stigler
(1947)).
        The stylized fact of roughly constant relative prices is consistent
with the preference-shift story of Fignre 3, where the relative price of
sector 2 is roughly independent of ontpnt. It is inconsistent with the
technoiogy-slnft story of Figure 4, which would call for a declining price
for an expanding sector.




4. Is a recession in the model anythinglike a   recession   in a modern economy?




           The remarks  in the previous section make it clear that the nodel
fits the stylized fact of relative price stability when fluctuations are driven
by preference shifts, not by technology shifts, Is it plausible that shifts of

                                        21
preferences among categories of goods are an important driving force in a
modern economy? In the model as stated, a shift favoring a competitive
good  as against a monopoly good causes a recession. More generally, a
shift away from a sector which has excess capacity toward one that is
operating at full capacity will cause    a   recession,   Market power is
important in the general case because it is unlikely that a competitive
sector would ever operate below capacity.
        In addition to pure shifts in underlying preferences, it is
appropriate to include changes in household technology in the
interpretation of the driving variable, .      Under one interpretation, ,
could be a time cost of purchasing good 1 in relation to good 2. An
increase in the inconvenience or effort required to make a purchase of good
2 would be equivalent to a decline in 5 and would set       in motion the
decline in total output described by the model.
        In a more general model, ö could include other costs. In
particular, if the monopoly good is a durable good frequently purchased on
credit, the could include the influence of credit rationing (Stiglitz and
              ö

Weiss (1981)).   Or, again for durables, could capture the benefits to
delaying durables purchases in times of increased uncertainty as discussed
by Bernanke (1983).
         The model as stated contains no explanation for monetary non-
neutralities. However, if monetary events can generate changes in 11
through credit rationing, uncertainty, or other mechanisms, then the
model of this paper can explain the propagation of monetary shocks into
fluctuations in real GNP.



                                   22
Labor supply assumptions




         A second important question is whether the labor supply
assumptions for sector 2 in the model have any analogy in a real economy.
There is no contribution to marginal cost from the value of workers' time.
Or, to put it a different way, labor supply is perfectly elastic. The model
rests on elastic labor supply just as the real business cycle and uage-
rigidity models do. The question is whether this form of the lnstic labor
supply assumption is more realistic than the other forms.
       The nypothesls of perfectly-elastic labor supply at zero wage has
hecr wiuely accepted as part of the theory of labor hoarding. In tirr±es of
weak demand, the firm retains workers on tile payroll who are not fully
occupied. Their services are available t, be Itrm fur free. The firm, not
the worker has the perfectly' elastic inbor supply, hut the resulting
aliocatiju of labo is as descrined in the nuodel, Ciarher (1986) has founu
empirical support 1or the labor-hoarding proposition. TIe tests and accepts
the hypothesis that prices, output, and eniploynient are unaffected by
changes in wages paid to workers during periods of labor hoarding. In
other words, the wage does not allocate labor during downturns, according
to Garber's evidence. Firms buy a block of their workers' time and then
allocate it as they piease The implicit cost of labor up to the timm
commitment is zero, and the assumption of this paper is appropriate.
        A related defense   of the assumption is that workers have the
standard textbook labor supply schedule—a vertical line at full-time work,

                                    23
connected to the origin by a perfectly elastic segment at wage zero. In
addition, the possibility of supplying labor to a different sector, which
would make   the labor supply schedule for sector 2 be different from the
labor supply schedule to the market, is foreclosed. High mobility costs
would be the best explanation for the irrelevance of alternative

employment opportunities. Hall (1987) shows that workers will be
inhibited from moving to other sectors during temporary downturns under
reasonable assumptions about costs and preferences
         The conclusions of the model would not be changed if workers put
a value on their time, as long as the marginal value did not vary with the
amount of work. That is, it is the property of highly elastic supply, not
the zero marginal value of time, that is critical in this and other
equilibrium models of employment fluctuations. As Rogerson (1988) and
Hansen (1985) have noted, highly elastic labor supply can be the result of

aggregation over individuals who are indifferent between working full days
and not working at all. The indifference could arise from fixed costs of
going to work. In Hall (1987), I show that it is extremely unlikely that
workers could be on the horizontal parts of their labor supply schedules a
large fraction of the time. However, fixed costs can contribute a perfectly
elastic segment to the labor supply schedule, where the flat part of the
schedule begins for hours of work somewhat below normal.
        If the perfectly elastic part of the labor supply schedule occurs at a
positive wage, the model of this paper can easily be modified to
accommodate that feature by absorbing the level of the wage into 1i.
         Figure 5 compares the labor supply assumptions of the four types
of fluctuations models. The real business cycle model makes the explicit

assumption that labor suppiy is highly elastic. A temporary reduction in
the real wage brings a large reduction in work effort because the worker is
virtually indifferent to the scheduling of work. The shadow value of the
worker's time is set by the total amount of work performed over the
lifetime. Whenever the wage drops below that shadow value, it is a good
time to stop working and use time for other purposes. The work can be
made up later, when the real wage is back to normal.
       In the wage rigidity model, the worker agrees to work as much as
asked by the employer (up to some limit) at a predetermined wage. The
agreement supplants the underlying labor supply schedule of the worker.
The allocation of work proceeds as if the labor supply schedule were
perfectly elastic.
        The labor supply of this model is a reverse L. The level of
employment is frequently along the flat, perfectly elastic portion because
the firm frequently has a marginal revenue product of labor equal to zero.
Obviously, this would rarely happen in competition. The point of this
paper is that it can frequently happen with market power.
       The labor supply schedule in a model with fixed costs of going to
work has a flat segment at a positive wage. Again, a firm with market
power facing fluctuations in demand may have extensive periods when the
marginal revenue product of labor schedule intersects the flat segment.

5. Concluding remarks


        One of the unique responsibilities of    the macroeconomist is to
identify the driving forces of economic fluctuations. The real business
cycle model considers economy-wide fluctuations in productivity as the
major driving force. Critics have pointed out that technical regress is a
qnestionahle came of recessions, hut have not been active in identifying
alternative driving forces. In a one-seetor model, preference shifts are not
a plausible driving force, because the only preference shift that could cause
a recession would be a sluft away from goods consumption and toward
leisure consuxnpt ion. Labeling a recession a period of epidemic laziness is
unattractive to all schools of niacroeconoinics.
        A two-sector model enriches tbe  set of possible driving forces.
Productivity could shift in favor of one sector from time to time, for
example.   Flowever, such shifts must be accompanied by corresponding
changes in relative prices. Because cyclical changes in relative prices are
weak, productivity shifts again seem unattractive as an important driving
force at business-cycle frequencies. On the other hand, shifts in preferences
from one sector to another are a more promising type of driving force, if
there is enough asymmetry between the two sectors, Monopoly in one
sector and competition in the other provides the necessary asymmetry. If
the competitive sector always operates at capacity, but the monopoly
sector sometimes operates below capacity, preference shifts will cause
changes in aggregate real GNP but not in the relative price.
