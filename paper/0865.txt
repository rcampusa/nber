             A Reexamination of Purchasing Power Parity:
               A Multi—Country and Multi—Period Study



                                ABSTRACT


This paper presents a systematic analysis of the purchasing power parity

hypothesis (PPP). This hypothesis states that the exchange rate is equal

to the ratio of the domestic price level to the foreign price level. It has

recently been argued that PPP performs poorly in the 1970s. This paper exam-

ines several possible explanations for this poor performance. We examine PPP

in. the l920s and the 1970s, using monthly and quarterly data, to see if the

relationship has changed over time. We also examine PPP in a multi—exchange

rate world, allowing a quite general error process so as to allow deviations

from PpP to be autocorrelated and correlated across currencies. We are then

able to examine the degree to which the world has become more interdependent.

We also provide evidence that deviations from PPP may follow a random walk.

Finally, the role of the U.S. dollar as base currency is examined. We find,

in general, that PPP holds quite well as a long run proposition, but the

deviations from PPP tend to persist.

  I.   Introduction

        This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of the purchasing

  power parity hypothesis (PPp). This hypothesis states that
                                                                 the exchange rate
  is equal to the ratio of the domestic price level to the foreign price

  level. A major puzzle is why PPP appears to perform poorly in the l97Os, yet

 performs well in the 1920s.

       Purchasing power parity is a major building block of monetary models of

 exchange rate determination (see, for example, the essays in Frenkel and

 Johnson (1978)). The poor performance of PPP has led Dornbusch to conclude

 that there is "little doubt that the
                                         monetary approach to exchange rate
 determination ...is an unsatisfactory theory of exchange rate determination"

 (Dornbusch (1980), p. 151). In this paper, it will be argued that this

 assertion is misleading. It is true that conventional estimation of monetary

 models may be unsatisfactory, but estimation based on a slightly more general

 statement of PPP may be satisfactory.

       There are several possible explanations for the failure of PPP in the

l970s that should be considered.
                                   First, to examine exchange rate behavior in
a multi—exchange rate world, we should use multilateral exchange rate models

rather than bilateral models. We shall compare the PPP relation in the 1970s

to that in the 1920s. To the extent that the world economy is more

interdependent in the l970s than in the 1920s, this should improve our ability

to explain exchange rate behavior. In addition, we have a method for

determining the degree to which the world has become
                                                        more Interdependent: what
has happened to the correlation between exchange rate movements? Second, it

can be shom that a greater degree of
                                         capital mobility will imply that
deviations from PPp approximately follow a random walk. We find that all

exchange rates examined in the 1970s follow a random walk, while some exchange
                                      3




rates in the 1920s do not. This observation also supports the hypothesis of

greater interdependence.

     Several recent studies have found deviations from PPP to be large and

persistent. For example, Frenkel (1981) finds that he cannot reject the

hypothesis that deviations from PPP are a random walk. Darby (1981, p.9)

finds that deviations from PPP follow "a random walk with perhaps a moving—

average adjustment process added." Dornbusch (1980, p.46) states that "the

short term exchange rate deviate(s) from a PPP path, but there are also

cumulatve deviatIons from that path that show substantial peristence."

However, all these studies examine exchange rates in a bilateral world, rather

than a multilateral world.

     tn trying to document and explain this puzzle, we shall focus on several

aspects of the PPP relationship. In particular, we shall examine PPP along 3

dimensions. First, we shall look at the PPP relationship in two time periods:

the 1970s and the l920s. Second, we shall use two time intervals: monthly and

quarterly data in the 1970s (and monthly data in the 1920s). Third, we shall

examine PPP country by country and several countries jointly. Such a

procedure will enable us to examine exchange rate behavior in a multicountry

foreign exchange market.

     In section II we look at some simple, single country estimation

results. This section provides the evidence for the observation that PPP

fails in the 1970s. In section III, we estimate the PPP relationship for

several countries simultaneously, assuming a quite general error process.

This section allows us to document the degree of interdependence in the 1920s

and the 1970s. In Section IV, we consider the extent to which increased

capital mobility has led to deviations from PPP following a random walk.

Section V inquires into the role played by the U.S. dollar as the base
                                            4




 currency. Finally, section VI will discuss and summarize the main results to

 be drawn from this study.

      The PPP relationship to be studied can be written as:



          £nS =     a.   +            +                       (1)

           S1 = domestic       (U.S.) price of currency i




                =    U.S. price level
                =    price   level in country i




Most studies of equation (1) focus on bilateral estimation, regressing the

U.S. price of the DM on the ratio of U.S. to German price levels. In this

paper, we shall estimate equation (1) for several exchange rates (relative to

the dollar) simultaneously. That is, we shall examine equation (1) in a time

series—cross section framework. The greater cross—sectional variation in the

data will allow for more precise estimation of a. and 3.

     As stated earlier, we shall use monthly and quarterly data for the 1970s

(June 1973 to December 1979) and the 1920s (January 1921 to May 1925). For

the 1970s, we begin with seven countries: the United Kingdom (ENG), France

(FRA), Germany (GER), Italy (ITA), Sweden (SWE), Canada (CAN) and Japan (JPN).

(See the Data Appendix for more details.) For the 1920s, we focus on five

countries: the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Sweden and Japan. We leave

Germany out of this sample due to the hyperinflation. To compare the results

from the l920s to the 1970s, we restrict our attention, for monthly J=t, Lu

the same five countries. For quarterly data, we examine a different subset of

countries: the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Canada. For future refer—

ence, the three subsets of countries used are:

                            January 1921 to May 1925



II. Single Country Estimation of PPP.

     This section examines the PPP relationship in a bilateral world. That

is, we look at equation (1), for, say, the U.K. and Germany, but ignore any

interaction between these two exchange rates. This is the approach generally

used in the literature, and will serve as a summary of the bilateral evidence

on PPP. We first estimate, for each of several countries, the following

regression equation by OLSQ:



     nS =             +    ln(P/P.) + u                                        (1)




Next, we

assume u. is AR(1):
           it
                 =
                     u1 +     c                                          (2)




We then estimate (1) and (2) by a Cochrane—Orcutt (CORC) procedure. Finally,

we recognize that prices and exchange rates may be simultaneously determined,

and so we estimate (1) and (2) using instrumental variables (FAIR). For

instruments, we use a constant, time, time squared, lagged prices and lagged
                                        6




 exchange rates. The results are reported in Table 1. For quarterly data in

 the 1970s, we see that the OLSQ results indicate that PPP does not hold very

 well — the estimates of 8 range from —0.162 (France) to 2.489 (Canada). The

 use of an AR(1) correction (CORC) leads to some improvement, but the results

 are still negative. Finally, estimating (1) and (2) using instrumental

 variables (FAIR) yields slightly better results, 8 ranges from —1.9 (France)

 to 2.13 (Germany). In all cases, the estimates of p are significantly

 positive. The estimate of p    ranges from about .46 (Germany and Sweden) to

 1.001 (Canada). We now see the reason for Dornbusch (1980, p.151) to state

 that the "key link between the exchange rate and PPP fails to hold."

      We next examine the PPP relationship in the 1970s using monthly data.

The evidence is again weak, and independent of the estimation procedure

 (OLSQ,CORC,FAIR). If we adopt an asset view of exchange rates, then

                   The exchange is never ascertained
                   by estimating the comparative value of
                   money in corn, cloth or any commodity
                   whatever but by estimating the value of
                   the currency of one country, in the currency
                   of another (Ricardo (1821), p. 128 as quoted
                   in Frenkel and Johnson (1978), p. 5).


That is, aggregate price levels act as a proxy for monetary condition in the

two countries. Since evidence on money demand functions indicates that the

relation between prices and money may not be stable for monthly data, the fact

that the PPP relation does not hold well for monthly data may not be

surprising.

     Finally, we estimated equation (1) for the 1920s, using monthly data.

The results (using FAIR's method) indicate that PPP held reasonabily well

during the 1920s. The exceptions are Italy, Sweden and Japan. The result for

Italy is unusual, in that the point estimates of c, 8 and p are quite

different (although maybe not significantly so) when the estimates by OLSQ or
                                        7




 CORC are compared to the estimates by FAIR. Einzig (1937) indicates that the

 financial market in Italy was not very well developed (p. 295) and that "While

 there was excessive optimism about the prospects of the Italian exchange,

 there was excessive pessimism about the internal political and economic

 conditions" (p. 297). Japan may be explained by its relative isolation during

 the 1920s. Also the l920s were a period of rapid growth for Japan: between

 1919 (a peak year) and 1931 (a tough year), GD? grew 2.3% per year, exports

 grew 5.8% per year and world trade grew 2.7% per year (Shionoya and Yamozawa

 (1973), p. 517). Most of Japans trade was with Asia (41% of its 1919

 exports), North America (44% of its 1919 exports) and little of its trade was

with Europe (10% of its 1919 exports) (Ohkawa and
                                                    Rosovsky (1973), p. 191).
 In addition, there was also a large earthquake on September 1, 1923 (Tinbergen

 (1934), P. 127 and Einzig (1937), P. 208), that may have led to "unusually"

large deviations from PPP.

     In conclusion, we find that PPP holds reasonably ye.l'l in the 1920s (even

for monthly data) and not so well for the l970s. In the next three sections

we will examine various hypotheses to explain these results.



Eli Multicountry Estimation of PPP.

A. Description of the General Estimating Equation.

     In this section, we consider again equation (1), but consider estimation

procedures for a multicountry foreign exchange market. That is, we use a time

series—cross section estimation procedure. We assume equations (1) and (2)

hold for each country, but we allow the errors to be correlated across

countries. The general idea is that if there is a shock to the German—U.S.

exchange rate (so as to cause a positive deviation from PPP) then there will

likely be a (positive) shock to the French—U.S. exchange rate. This
                                                 8



 correlation may arise for any of seveal reasons. First, there may be a world

 shock that effects all exchange rates, such as a world—wide recession.

 Alternatively, there could be a shock in Germany that is then transmitted to

France and so effects both exchange rates. Finally, since all exchange rates

are relative to the dollar, any shock in the U.S. will affect all exchange

rates. Consider, for example, an unexpected increase in German real income.

This will tend to appreciate the Deutsche Mark. If German and Swiss real

income innovations are positively correlated, then we should also see an

appreciation of the Swiss franc. Alternatively, suppose an increase in German

real income leads to an increase in demand for Deutsche Marks and Swiss

francs. Then we would expect to observe both the Deutsche Mark and Swiss

franc appreciate. That is, an (unexpected) increase in the dollar/Deutsche

Mark exchange rate conveys useful information about the dollar/Swiss franc

exchange rate that is ignored in single exchange rate estimation procedures,

 Equation (3a) allows the variances of the residuals to differ between

 countries; (3b) allows the residuals to be correlated across countries;     (3c)

allows the residuals to be autocorrelated for each country.       The estimation

of equations (1) and (3) is described in Kmenta (1971, pp. 512—514). The

Equation (4) can then be estimated as a system of N equations (N=4, 5 or 7).

B. Estimation of PPP with a Monetary Model

     We first estimate (4) using quarterly data from the l970s, under the

assumption that prices are exogenous. For the sample of all seven currencies,

relative to the U.S. dollar, the results are given in Table 2. We see that

the estimate of       is close to 1 and significant (the t—statistic is 9.6, and

  is 1.080, which is only .7 standard deviations from 1.0). The correlation

matrix indicates that the residuals for the European currencies are large and

positive, negative for Canada, and small and positive for Japan. Although the

assumption of exogenous prices is strong, these results are indicative of

those to follow when we relax the assumption of exogenous prices.

     The previous estimation procedure assumed that the price ratio,

ln(Pt/Pjt), was exogenous. If this assumption is false, then there is a

simultaneous equation bias. To allow for this situation, we can expand the

model, to allow prices to be endogenous. From monetary theory, the price
                                                     10



 level is determined so as to equate real money demand to real money supply.

 Assuming that the demand for money is a function of income and the interest

 rate and that income and interest rates are exogenous (exogenous interest

 rates will be relaxed) we can express the price level as a function of

 exogenous variables. The expanded model we will consider consists of

 equations (3) and a set of money demand functions; the model we consider can

be written as



                      =
                           a1(i—p.)                                      (5a)

                             —                   +              —

                =   interest     rate in country i

            i =     5 denotes the U.S.

In this formulation, there are 29 parameters to estimate

                                         (j1,...,5)). Equations (5a) and (5b) can

be estimated using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML). The results

are given in Table 3. The estimate of the PPP slope parameter, ,        is   1.101,

with a standard error of .108 (t—statistic is 10.19). The money demand Income

elasticity (b1) is positive (and significant) for the U.K., Germany and

Sweden, but is negative, and insignificant, for Canada and the U.S. The money
                                              11




demand interest semi—elasticity (cj) is negative for Germany, Canada and the

U.S., but insignificantly positive for the U.K. and Sweden. One difficulty is

that p(U.K.) was (insignificantly) greater than 1.0, which indicates non—

stationarity. Also, except for the U.K., the money demand autoregressive

parameter (v.)     is   small, being insignificantly different from 0.0. One

possible explanation is that the serial correlation in money demand functions

is being "picked up" by the autregressive error structure of the PPP equation

(see Rakkio (1982)).

    The assumption that interest rates are exogenous will now be relaxed,

since both exchange rates and interest rates are determined in a financial

market. To allow for this possibility, we estimate the PPP equation (1) using

three stage lest squares (3SLS). The instruments are money, money lagged

once, income, income lagged once, lagged exchange rates and lagged prices.

One can think of this as substituting out interest rates in a rational

expectations model. The model that was estimated can be written as




            LnS. =                        +                         (6)
                          c+2.n               u1

              u1 =                 +
                          P1u,.1

     A difficulty arose in estimating equation (6), When estimating equation

(6) as specified, the system did not converge. All parameters converged,

except the constant for Canada (c4); p(Canada) appreared to converge to 1,

which indicates nonstationarity. To overcome this lack of convergence,
                                                12




 p(Canada) was constrained to be 0.999. With this constraint, the system

 converged. The estimates of the parameters did not seem to be seriously

 affected by this constraint, however a4 has a low t—statistic. The results

 are:

We see that the estimate of             is again close to one, 0.951 with a standard

error of 0.141. The estimates of p are all significantly greater than 0.

From the correlation matrix we see that the deviations from PPP are highly

correlated (positive for Europe and negative for Canada).

C. Comparison of PPP across Time Intervals and Time Periods.

        To compare the performance of PPP across time intervals (monthly versus

quarterly data) and across time periods (the 1970s and the 1920s), we now

reestimate equations (1) and (3). To facilitate comparison, we estimate (1)

using 3SLS with instruments being a constant, time, time squared and lagged

prices and exchange rates for each model. We also allow a to be different

across countries. The results are given in Table 4 (again, p(Canada) was

constrained to be 0.999).

        For quarterly data, all estimates of p are less than 1.0, and                is

precisely estimated to be .951 with a standard error of .149 (for a t—

statistic of 6.4). However, when we look at the monthly data for the l970s

(and a different set of countries), the estimate of                 is low (.409 with a

standard error of.l83). This would seem to indicate that the relationship
                                          13




between prices and exchanges is not very close with monthly data, but does

conform to PPP predictions with quarterly data. (This result is similar to

the single equation results.)

     This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that PPP is a medium to

long run condition. Since the PPP relationship may be viewed as a proxy for

the monetary conditions in a country and, in general, monthly money demand

functions are not stable, one would not expect PPP to hold well using monthly

data. Also, price levels are extremely autocorrelated using monthly data,

while exchange rates, being "auction" prices, are much more volatile. It is

only when we move to quarterly data that we pick up a relation between

exchange rates and prices. One possible method of testing such a possibility

would be to use a band spectrum estimation procedure which would "block out"

short run movements (this is not done due to the simultaneity problem).

     The results for the 1920s appear surprising. The estimate of          is .578,

with a standard error of .072, significantly different from both 0 and 1. As

stated in section II, this result may be due to the special circumstances of

Italy, Sweden and Japan. If we estimate the PPP relation with only the U.K.

and France,      equals 1.075 (standard error =.091). If we then include

Sweden (exclude Italy and Japan),         equals 1.064 (standard error.080).

Hence, it appears that the poor result         (
                                                   = .578) is due to the inclusion

of Italy and Japan. A possible explanation was given in Section II.

     We are now in a position to examine the degree of interdependence. As

stated earlier, our measure of interdependence is the correlation of the

country error terms (CORR(          )).   The correlation matrices corresponding

to Table 4 are given in Table 5. This definition of interdependence reflects

the view that a large correlation implies that deviations from PPP for

different exchange rates arise for the same reason or are transmitted very
                                       15



 1970s than in the 1920s. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that

 shocks in one country are more likely to occur simultaneously in several

 countries (or be rapidly transmitted to other countries) in the 1970s than in

 the l920s. Second, Japan appears to be more isolated from the rest of Europe

 in the 1920s than in the 1970s, in that the deviations from PPP for Japan were

 approximately uncorrelated with the PPP deviations for the other European

 countries, whereas the correlation became positive In the l970s. That is,

 since the 1920s, the interdependence of Japan and Western Europe has incresed

dramatically.

     To summarize this section, by using a time series —   cross section
estimation procedure, with quarterly data, we found that the PPP relation

holds quite well (   8 is statistically close to 1), although the deviations

from PPP tend to be persistent (   p is close to 1). This is in contrast to

the results reported in Section II (using single exchange rate methods)

where 8 ranges from —1.9 to 2.1. The increased precision in estimation

arises from exploiting the cross—sectional variation in the data. The

correlation of the disturbances is quite large and so improves the estimation

of 8. However, the results for the monthly data (in the l970s) indicate that

PPP does not hold, even though the correlation matrix of the disturbances is

quite large. This seems to indicate that PPP is a long run condition and does

not hold for monthly data. If the relation between money and prices is not

stable using monthly data (perhaps real Income is not exogenous in the short

run), and PPP reflects the underlying monetary conditions, then this result

should not be surprising.

quickly. In section IV we will consider further evidence concerning

interdependence.

     In examining the correlation matrix for Q—1970, we find the correlations

are quite large. The correlation for Sweden and Germany is 85%; this,

however, may only reflect the fact that Sweden and Germany belong to the

snake. However, Germany and the U.K. have a correlation of 66%. It is

interesting to note that the correlation between Canada and the other

countries is negative, and approximately —36%. In addition, the correlations.

are greatest for Germany, indicating Germany's major role in world affairs.

The evidence suggests that a positive PPP deviation for any one of the U.S.—

European exchange rates is likely to be coincident with a positive PPP

deviation for the other European countries, but with a negative PPP deviation

for Canada. It appears, then, that the Canadian exchange rate behavior is

different, in this fundamental way, from European exchange rate behavior. One

possible explanation is that Canada and the U.S. are close, both economically

and geographically, while physically separated from Western Europe. However,

no convincing explanation for Canada's anomalous exchange rate behavior has

yet been found.

     In looking at the monthly data for the 1970s, we find the correlations

are still quite large. The correlations with France are the largest (recall

that Germany was not included), while the correlations with Japan are the

smallest (although positive). If we compare these results with the results

from the 1920s, for the same set of countries, we find several interesting

results. First, and most important, is the observation that the correlations

are all much smaller for the 1920s.   I interpret this to mean that the degree

of interdependence has increased from the 1920s to the 1970s. That is,

unexpected PPP deviations were much more correlated across countries in the

  IV. Alternative Representations of PPP.

         Roll (1979) argues that under certain conditions, deviations from PPP

 should follow a random walk. In terms of equations (1) and (2), if a=O, 3=1

 and p=1, then the deviations from PPP (I.nS —                               will   follow a

 random walk. The estimates La section III (estimates of p close to 1)

 indicate that the assumption of deviations from PPP being a random walk must

 be considered.

         To see under what conditions the deviations will be a random walk (or

 some more complex process (Darby, 1981)), assume that Interest rate parIty

 holds:




                   = —s                                                              (7)



where t is the log of the forward rate, St                 is   the log of the spot rate and

     is the foreign interest rate. If the foreign exchange market Is

efficient, so that we can write                 =          where         is the rational
                                                    s.,1
expectation of            based on information at time t, we can rewrite (7) as



              —    *      e
                       = s1—   s

If the Fisher relationship holds in both countries, then



                          =
                               r   + lTe
                                                                           (8a)
                                           *e

where rt is the real rate of interest and                   is the expected rate of

inflation (between t and t+1).             Substituting (8) into (71) and rearranging

yields

                                                                              )           (10)


Equation (10) implies that if capital markets adjust instantaneously, such

that real interest rates are equalized across countries (except, perhaps, for

a random term), then deviations from PPP will follow a random walk.

     Let us define                    as the deviation from PPP for country i,

it = lnS1 —                                To test if it follows a random walk, consider

the following regression:



                        =                       +
                            a     + b                          (i=1, ... N)                (11)

If the deviations from PPP follow a random walk, then we should find a                            0 and

b = 1.   Testing this hypothesis requires care, since for b =                     1   we are on the

boundary of the permissable (stationary) parameter space. Dickey and Fuller

(1981) give test statistics for a = 0 and b                     1 and the empirical distribution

function for these test statistics. Table 6 gives the estimates of a and b

and the relevant test statistic for the null hypothesis that a = 0 and b = 1.

For the 1970s (quarterly and monthly), for all countries, we can not reject

the null hypothesis that deviations from PPP follow a random walk. Note that

if one examined the estimate of f3, and its standard error, one would be

tempted to reject the hypotheses of a random walk for Sweden. However, the
                                             18



  probability that b < 1, given b        1, approaches 68% as the sample size gets

  large (Fuller (1976), P. 370, for the case a       0 ).   It   is interesting to note
  that In the 1920s, the hypothesis that the deviations from PPP are a random

 walk can be rejected for both France and Italy. This observation, that PPP

 deviations move from a non—random walk to a random walk from the 1920's to the

 l970's, indicates a structural change in French and Italian exchange rate

 behavior. The explanation for Italy may be a move towards greater capital

 market integration (recall Einzig's (1937, p. 295) observation). An

 explanation for France is less clear.

         At the beginning of this section, we stated that under certain conditions

 (Interest rate parity, foreign exchange market efficiency, the Fisher

 relationship and rapid capital mobility) we would expect the deviations from

 PPP to follow a random walk. The hypothesis of simple market efficiency

 (s+j =    t   )   may be suspect; see, for example, Hakkio (1981a) and Hansen and

 Hodrick (1980). MIshkin (1981) presents evidence that Indicates that real

 interest rates are not equalized across countries, while the evidence

presented here is consistent with real rates being equalized.         One possible
explanation is that the test presented here is not very powerful (In fact, the

power is unknown).

     If the deviations from PPP follow a random walk, then it may be

appropriate to estimate equation (1) in first difference form:



                     —           =
                         £nS11       T+{In(Pt/Pjt)_inPt_l/Pjtl)J+3.1      (12)



     There are several interpretations of equation (12) and i             If   we

assume         is white noise, then (12) is a regression of the rate of

depreciation on the differential rate of inflation: the relative version of
                                                            19




PPP. Equations (11) and (12) are the same, only if                             =   b =   1   .   If    one first

differences equation (1), one obtains equatIon (12), with                                =   0   and

 1.'.
          =   u.it   — u           .     Therefore, if one assumes uit         can be written as
   it                      lit—i
                +            (P        1), one can write it as

 (p—i)u.              +    c...        If p < 1 ,   estimating     equation (12) by OLSQ is

inappropriate since u

                                            1 and ln(P —i I P. t—i are correlated (if
                                                             1,

 p0 then                    is MA(i), with a unit root). If p'4, estimation of (12) by

OSLQ is appropriate. Hence, one can view the results in section III as

estimating , given p < 1, while equation (12) estImates , given                                        p   1

         Table 7 gives estimates of y and                        using OLSQ; we assume the rates of

inflation can be treated as exogenous. In all cases, the estimate of I is

insignificantly different from zero. The estimates of                              for the quarterly

1970s data are insignificantly different from 1.0, but also insignificantly

different from zero, except for the United Kingdom. The same results hold for

the other subsets of countries and time periods. The results are similar to

the results in Table 1. In Table 8, we assume that inflation is endogenous

and we estimate the N—equation system (12) using 3SLS, with instruments being

a constant, time, time squared and lagged inflation and rates of

depreciation. In this case, we allow the                            to be different, but constrain the

        to be equal. As can be seen from comparing Tables 6 and 7, the results are

not very different:                    is imprecisely estimated, often insignificantly

different from both 0 and 1.

         The right hand side of equation (12) is the inflation rate differential,

which we know to be highly autocorrelated, while the left hand side variable,

the rate of exchange depreciation, shows little autocorrelation. In other

words, equation (12) is trying to "explain" a temporally uncorrelated variable

with a temporally correlated variable; a finding of                           between 0 and 1 should
                                       20



 not be surprising.

      In Table 9, the correlation matrix of residuals from equation (12) are

 given. As in Table 5, the correlations are quite large, and negative for

 Canada relative to Western Europe, for Q—1970. The correlations are quite

 large for monthly data, although the PPP relation does not hold well. For the

 1920s, the correlations are smaller, and insignificant for Japan.



V. The DM as the Base Currency.

     The last topic to be examined is the role of the U.S. dollar as the base

currency in the exchange rate equation. It may be that most of the deviations

from PPP are a result of movements in the U.S. dollar. If deviations from PPP

arise due to transportation costs, then the deviations would be less among the

European countries. In addition, the structure of tariff barriers may be more

stable among European countries than between the U.S. and European

countries. Finally, the behavior of U.S. prices during the 1970s has been

influenced by the existence of U.S. price controls ( and their removal).

     To examine these possibilities, we reestimate the PPP equation using

Germany as the base currency. We calculated the DM price of, say, the French

franc by using triangular arbitrage: S(DM/fr) =   S($/fr)/S($/DM).   Denoting the

DM price of currency i by S1 and the German price level by P, we can

consider the following regression equation:



        lnS. = + ln(P/P.) + u                                         (13a)

           uj =          +                                               (13b)




Table 10 reports the results of estimating equation (13), equation by

equation, using 2SLS (FAIRs method). Notice that the results for the U.S.

need not be the same as for Germany in Table 1, due to the simultaneity and
                                          21




autoregressive correction (the OLSQ results are, of course, the same).

     Several results of interest emerge from Table 19. First, the estimates

of   are close to one, with "small" standard errors. However, the results for

Canada indicate a value of       too large ( = 2.693, standard error = 0.354)

and the estimate of     for Japan is —3.340, but with a standard error of 3.392,

so that a two standard deviation confidence interval would be (—10.1, 3.4)

(in addition, the R2 for Japan was 0.18). Both these countries are

geographically isolated from Western Europe, and so the transport cost

argument may be able to explain these two results. In addition, the results

when using the U.S. dollar as the base currency were also poor. These results

indicate that part of the explanation for the "failure" of PPP (seen in Table

1) may be due to the use of the U.S. as the base currency. The case of Japan

and Canada would seem to indicate something peculiar to their country, rather

than the foreign exchange market.

     In the previous section (Table 4) we estimated the PPP equation jointly

for the U.K., Germany, Sweden and Canada, relative to the U.S. We can

estimate a similar equation (for the U.S., the U.K., Sweden and Canada) using

the DM as the base currency. The result is:



ct(USA) =    .763     c(Eng) = 1.638     ct(Swe) =   —.656      c(Can) —11.028
            (.220)              (.032)               (.396)              (11.978)

 p(USA) =    .951      p(Eng)= .682       p(Swe) =    .980      p(Can)      .999
            (.036)              (.116)               (.077)

                            =    .886
                                (.108)


Instruments were a constant, time, time squared,, lagged exchange rates and

lagged price ratios. Recall that the estimate of         ,    when the U.S. was the

base currency, was 0.951, with a standard error of 0.149 (see Table 4). The
                                      22



results are close (within one—half standard deviation). This should not be

surprising, since by estimating all equations jointly we should be reducing

the role played by the dollar. In fact, since the equations with the DM as

the base currency are just a linear combination of the equations with the U.S.

dollar as the base currency, the joint estimation should produce similar

results (the    and p. need not be similar due to different base currencies).

     We now estimate a PPP equation for Western Europe (   the U.K., France,
Italy, and Sweden) and the U.S., relative to Germany. The results are given

in Table 11, section 1. The estimate of     ,   1.189 (standard error of 0.060),

is significantly greater than 1.0, but precisely estimated. To see the role

played by the US, dollar, we next estimated the same equation for Western

Europe (excluding the dollar). The results are given in Table 11, section

II. The results are virtually indistinguishable. Part of the explanation is

that the starting values were equal to the final value when the U.S. was

excluded. This result tends to indicate that the increased precision is due

to the joint estimation, as opposed to the choice of base currency.



VI. Summary and Conclusions.



     Using monthly and quarterly data from the 1970s and the 1920s we were

able to examine several explanations for the oft—cited failure of PPP to hold

empirically. The foreign exchange market is a well—functioning market

involved in setting exchange rates for several currencies simultaneously. If

one examines PPP in such a setting, one finds that PPP holds quite well as a

long run proposition. Part of the "failuret' of PPP in the 1970s involved the

finding that the relation between exchange rates and prices was very

imprecise, cross—sectional estimates of    range from 0.301 (for Canada) to
                                          23



2.087 (for Germany).

      By employing a time series—cross section estimation procedure we were

able to precisely estimate       (between 0.9 and 1.1, depending on the exact

estimation procedure). The extra precision came from the cross—sectional

variation in the data, but also from exploiting the correlation of errors

between countries. One can view this as a seemingly unrelated regression

procedure in that the regression equations appear unrelated, but are, in fact,

closely related due to the correlation of the disturbances (deviations from

PPP). As is well—known, taking into account such correlation should improve

the efficiency of the estimates — as was the case in this paper. In fact,

the correlation between country disturbances was quite large.

     A precise estimate of   ,   close   to 1.0, implies that as a long run

proposition, PPP is valid. However, the autoregressive parameters, p , were

large, which indicates that deviations will tend to persist for a long period

of time. Hence, the conclusion that deviations from PPP are persistent is

correct. However, the conclusion that PPP does not hold well, as a long run

proposition, is incorrect. Further evidence that PPP should be viewed as a

long run proposition arises when estimating a PPP equation with monthly data:

the results indicate that PPP does not hold in the long run ( < 1). When one

allows for deviations from PPP to be correlated and takes this into account in

the estimation procedure, the evidence (using quarterly data) supports

purchasing power parity.

     The implication of this observation is that estimation of a monetary

model of exchange rate determination must allow for short run deviations from

PPP to persist, but in the long run PPP holds (see Hakkio (1981b)). For

efficient estimation, one should estimate several exchange rate equations

simultaneously. An efficient estimation procedure would be as follows.

Specify money demand functions for all N currencies:
                                                24




    (M/p)D =        Lj(yt,ijt,zjt) + v                   (14)




where z is a vector of additional explanatory variables and                  is a serially

correlated error term C
                              v    =
                                       O.(L)1.ij).   Next, specify a long run—short run

PPP relation:




                    +
    inS =               ln(P/P.)        u1                         (15a)

        uit = pu
               1 i,t—1
                          +   •
                              it                                   (15b)


where   we allow the error terms to be correlated.

Letting et =    it'"'         Nt' C1tCN_1            we can specify that



    Eee =           = (c..)                                                (16)

Then, simultaneous estimation of equations (14) and (15) will allow for

deviations to persist in the short run, but to disappear in the long run.

That is, the conclusion reached by Dornbusch that there is "little doubt that

the monetary approach [to exchange rate determination] ...         is   an

unsatisfactory theory of exchange rate determination" (Dornbusch (1980), p.

151) appears to be unwarranted.

     In   section   IV we found that deviations from PPP may     follow    a random

walk. In terms of section III, this would occur if a 0,              1 and p =1. We

can also derive this observation from the assumptions of an efficient foreign

exchange market, real interest rates being equalized across countries and

interest rate parity. The implication of this finding is that one should

consider estimating exchange rate deprectiation models as opposed to exchange
                                      25



rate level models.

     Finally, in section V we examined the extent to which using the U.S.

dollar as a base currency affect the results. From the single equation

results, the dollar appeared to play a significant role. However, from the

multi—exchange rate model, the impact of the dollar was not great, as one

might have expected. When PPP is examined for only the European countries,

with the DM s the base currency, the PPP relation holds well.

     To conclude, the major finding is that when examining exchange rate

behavior, much more precise statements can be made when models are estimated

using all exchange rates and information simultaneously. Much information is

lost when one ignores the fact that exchange rates are determined in a world

market where exchange rates for several currencies are set simultaneously, so

that movements in the dollar/pound rate contain information for the dollar/DM

rate. When such additional information is used, the relation between prices

and exchange rates is very strong, and conforms to the purchasing power parity

prediction. However, deviations from PPP do tend to persist for long periods

of time, and, in fact, may follow a random walk (and so never return).

Notes: Each equation was estimated by OLS. The coefficients and standard errors are
        reported. Ô' is the maximum likelihood estimate of var(u),. under the null
        hypothesis that (a., ) = (0,].).  S. is the variance of u under the al-
        ternative hypothesis that (a ,b)   (01).       is the usual regression "F—
        test." Notation is from Dickey and Fuller (1981). The 95% critical value
        for n 25 is 5.18, n = 50 is 4.86 and n = 75 is 4.71, where ri = number of
        observations ( n = 25 for Q—1970, n = 79 for M—l970 and n   53 for M—l920.)
