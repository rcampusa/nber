The Effect of Nicotine Replacement Therapy Advertising on Youth Smoking

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) advertising on youth smoking.
NRT advertising could decrease smoking by informing smokers that the product can make quitting
easier and thus inducing more smokers to try and quit. However, a moral hazard is created because
NRT advertising increases the expectation that cessation is relatively easy. NRT advertising could
thus induce youth to smoke, to smoke more and/or to delay quit attempts. Data from Nielsen Media
Research (Nielsen) and the Monitoring the Future Surveys (MTF) have been used in the empirical
work. The Nielsen data are matched to the MTF data by month, year and market. The availability
of lagged advertising data allow for calculation of an advertising stock variable. The Nielsen data
also measure exposure to national advertising on a local level which allows for use of national advertising
data. An exogenous shock allows for bypassing problems of endogeneity. The results indicate that
NRT advertising has no effect on participation but increases smoking by youth who do smoke. The
elasticity of smoking with respect to NRT advertising is about .10 and the elasticity of smoking with
respect to price is about -1.03. Since average youth smoking is about 5.77 cigarettes per day, an increase
of 10 percent in NRT advertising would increase this average to about 5.82 cigarettes per day. It is
also estimated that a ban on NRT advertising would be equivalent to a 10 percent increase in cigarette
prices.

                    The Effect of Nicotine Replacement Therapy Advertising
                                        on Youth Smoking


1. Introduction

        Over the past 11 years there have been major changes in the availability of

smoking cessation products and in the regulations affecting the marketing of these

products directly to consumers. The main class of products delivers nicotine through a

variety of methods, excluding smoking, and are known as nicotine replacement therapy

(NRT).1 The nicotine delivery systems include inhalers, patches, nasal sprays and

gums. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approves drugs for prescription sale or

for sale over-the-counter (OTC). Prior to 1996, all NRT products were available only by

prescription and the advertising of all prescription drugs was subject to onerous

disclosure requirements. However, in 1996, nicotine gum and nicotine patches were

approved by the FDA for OTC sale. This change made advertising nicotine gum and

patches possible. Another important change began in 1995 when the FDA initiated a

public comment period on lowering the disclosure requirements for advertising

prescription drugs. It was widely accepted that the change would go into effect and in

the interim the FDA would not pursue violators of the existing law. Prescription drug

makers began to increase their advertising in 1996 in anticipation of the FDA changes.

In 1997, the FDA formally reduced the disclosure requirements for direct to consumer

advertising of prescription drugs.

        Although NRT advertising has increased dramatically since 1996, little is known

about its effect on smoking. This paper examines the effect of NRT advertising on

 A prescription antidepressant called Zyban was approved in 1997 for smoking cessation therapy. To simplify the
exposition, NRT advertising refers to both Zyban advertising and NRT advertising.

youth smoking. Over the past 10 years youth smoking has been generally declining.

According to the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey (Johnston et al., 2006) smoking in

the past 30 days by 12th graders dropped from 33.5 percent in 1995 to 21.6 percent in

2006 paralleling similar declines in smoking among 8th and 10th graders. These

declined are in part due to public policy efforts to reduce the level of smoking. A special

emphasis of these policies has been on youth since few individuals initiate smoking

after age 20. The policies to reduce smoking include the restrictions on advertising and

promotion of tobacco products contained in the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement,

tobacco counteradvertising and large price increase for tobacco. Also, state and local

governments have enacted a variety of clean indoor air regulations, and laws restricting

youth access to tobacco. States have also increased tobacco taxes which reduces the

demand for tobacco especially for youth and have funded a variety of tobacco

counteradvertising programs. A number of studies have examined the effects of these

policies. However, there have been few studies which examine the effect of NRT

advertising on smoking by youth.



2. Prior studies

       NRT has been shown to be effective in increasing success in smoking cessation

in experimental settings. An experimental study by Shiffman et al. (2002) examined

smoking cessation rates achieved with NRT in simulated OTC and actual prescription

settings. A sample of over 6,000 smokers were given either OTC gum, OTC patch,

prescription gum or prescription patch. In the OTC setting no intervention was provided.

In the prescription setting, smokers were prescribed gum or patch by their physician.

Biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence (for the past 28 days) was

                                             2
assessed at six weeks and at six months. OTC success rates were consistently higher

than prescription rates. They conclude that smoking cessation rates achieved with OTC

NRT were as good as those under real-world prescribing conditions. Hughes et al.

(2003) provide a meta-analysis of eight additional studies of the efficacy of OTC NRT.

They also conclude that OTC NRT is effective.

       A time series analysis by Hu et al. (2000) examined the effect of NRT sales on

cigarette consumption. They use a national time series of quarterly per capita cigarette

consumption, sales of nicotine gums and patches between 1976 and 1998 and estimate

an autoregressive moving average intervention model. The model indicates that a

0.076% reduction in cigarette consumption is associated with the availability of nicotine

patches after 1992. However, the 1996 shift variable, which was included to account for

OTC availability, is not significant. They argue that there may not have been enough

post 1996 data to have a significant effect.

       Cummings and Hyland (2005) present a less optimistic picture of OTC NRT.

They study the effect of NRT on altering population trends in smoking behavior. They

find that fewer than one in five smokers making a quit attempt do so with the benefit of

NRT. Because not enough smokers are using NRT, they conclude that NRT has not

had a measurable impact on influencing population trends in smoking behavior. The

reasons smokers provide for not wanting to use NRT is the cost of NRT and concerns

that it will not work. Cummings and Hyland (2005) argue that the OTC versions of NRT

may have too little nicotine to be effective and that is why Hu et al. found no post 1996

effect and why people may think that OTC NRT is not effective. However, they also

present data from an NRT give-away program in New York City. Over 400,000 people

were called to get free nicotine patches and a follow-up survey six months later found

                                               3
that 33 percent of the patch recipients reported that they were not smoking. Cummings

and Hyland’s findings suggest that NRT sales may have only a limited effect on

smoking behavior. Since advertising, in general, has only a limited effect on sales it is

not certain that NRT advertising will have sufficient power to influence smoking.

         Iizuka and Jin (2005) examine the effects of NRT advertising on smoking

participation, use and quit attempts. They merge NRT advertising data with data from

the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The NRT data is the prior

year’s cumulative expenditure which is linked to the current year smoking data for 73

markets over five years including 1997 to 2001. The use of annual advertising data is

not desirable because of temporal aggregation bias (Leone, 1995). In addition, they

use only spot TV advertising, spot radio and outdoor as the measure of NRT

advertising. This is only approximately three percent of total advertising expenditures.2

In the 12 regressions presented by Iizuka and Jin, NRT advertising is negative and

significant in only two. They conclude that there is no effect of NRT advertising on

smoking. However, they only find that price is negative and significant in three

equations which suggests that there may be specification problems in these

regressions.

         Both Cummings and Hyland (2005) and Iizuka and Jin (2005) note the moral

hazard problem associated with NRT advertising. The moral hazard is created since

NRT advertising can increase the expectation that cessation is relatively easy with the

use of NRT. According to Fong (2001) many youth underestimate the addictive power

of smoking. Among high school smokers, only five percent expect to be smoking five


2
 According to Avery et al. (2006) in 1999, NRT advertising on TV was about $170 million and in magazines was
about $20 million. Iizuka and Jin (2005) report that local radio, local TV and outdoor NRT advertising in 1999 was
about $5.3 million.


                                                          4
years after graduation, however, follow-up data shows that 75 percent will still be

smoking. The moral hazard problem occurs if NRT advertising, which suggests that

quitting can be easy, results in more youth choosing to smoke, to smoke more and to

delay quit attempts.



3. Empirical Model and Data

       To develop the empirical model assume that the choice to smoke by adolescents

can be viewed as a multi-period utility maximization problem subject to a cost

constraint. Smoking provides utility but has immediate pecuniary, social and health

costs. Health costs also increase over time. The importance of these future health

costs depend on the youth’s rate of time preference and assessment of the addictive

power of cigarettes. The probability of smoking increases with utility and with

discounting of the future and decreases as the expected difficulty of future cessation

increases. Knowledge about NRT reduces the expected difficulty of future cessation.

This could increase current smoking. Knowledge about NRT would lead to increased

use of NRT and decrease future smoking. Thus knowledge about NRT has no a priori

expectation in general. A demand for cigarettes, Cij, can be derived from this theoretical

utility maximization model. Knowledge about NRT is measured by NRT advertising.

Let i stand for the individual, j stand for the local area and t stand for time. This demand

function is:

Cijt = f(NRT Advertisingjt, Cigarette Pricejt, Incomeijt, Demographicsij,)

       The data set employed to estimate this equation was created by merging data

obtained through the Youth Smoking and the Media study (supported by the National

Cancer Institute) from Nielsen Media Research (Nielsen), data from ImpacTeen

                                               5
(supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation), and data from the Monitoring the

Future (MTF) Surveys (supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse). Nielsen

provided the NRT advertising data and ImpacTeen provided the data on tobacco prices.

The MTF data include variables measuring smoking, demographics and certain youth

characteristics. The data are a pool of cross sections of 8th graders, 10th graders and

12th graders from 1994 to 2003. This pool is a nationally representative sample of over

200,000 high school students. Pooling these years increases the variance in

advertising and tobacco policy variables.

        The advertising data measures potential audience exposure to all NRT

advertising on network and cable television for the largest 50 media markets in the US.3

These 50 markets accounted for about 60% of American viewing households (Nielsen

Media Research, 2002). Data for each commercial occurrence were aggregated by

market and month. Nielsen data are based on individual ratings of television programs,

obtained by monitoring household audiences across media markets. Ratings provide

an estimate of the percentage of households with televisions watching a program or

advertisement in a media market over a specified time interval. Advertising is measured

by Gross Ratings Points (GRP), which is an estimate of the reach times the frequency

of advertising. Reach is defined as the percent of the potential market which has

viewed an ad and frequency is the number of times an average viewer has seen the ad.

For example, if a market has 80 GRPs for a given month it can be interpreted to mean

that 80% of the market has seen one ad or that 40 percent of the market has seen two

ads, etc. GRPs represent a probability of individual exposure to an advertisement.4


3
 Only 50 markets were available for the entire sample period.
4
 Teenage Targeted Rating Points (TRP) were also available but produced the same results in the regressions as
GRPs. GPRs were used in the reported results since teens can also view ads that are not targeted to them.


                                                       6
The GRPs for all NRT advertising, by market and by month, are aggregated to create

the advertising data.

       As a measure of advertising, GRPs have an advantage over advertising

expenditures. The advantage of GRPs is that they measure the impact of national TV

advertising on the local level. The local level is a designated market area (DMA) which

is defined by Nielsen and is similar to the concept of a metropolitan statistical area used

by the US government. National TV expenditures have no reported local variation.

Local variation in expenditures are limited to spot TV advertising, spot radio and

outdoor. National TV NRT advertising expenditures represent about 80 percent of total

NRT advertising while spot media represent about five percent of total NRT advertising

expenditures. In this paper, the use of GRPs to measure NRT advertising improves on

expenditures since GRPs measure the impact of 80 percent of total advertising on the

DMA level.

       The ImpacTeen data on cigarette prices is the real price (using the 1982-1984

Consumer Price Index) of a pack of cigarettes which is the state average for the first six

months of each year excluding generics.

       Since the MTF data include many youth who do not smoke, the smoking

equation is estimated using a two-part specification. The demand for cigarettes is

divided into a decision to smoke, which is defined as participation, and a decision on

how much to smoke, given participation, which is defined as use. Participation may be

more accurate since it is easier for a respondent to recall whether or not they smoked

rather than how much they smoked. Participation is measured with an indicator variable

and use, given participation, is measured by a continuous variable. The participation

equation is estimated with probit and the use given participation is estimated with OLS.

                                             7
The use variable is converted to its natural log. Both participation and use equations

are non-linear specifications which allow for a diminishing marginal product of NRT

advertising.

       The MTF data allows for definition of a set of demographic and other

independent variables. Several dichotomous independent variables were constructed.

These variables are defined as equal to one if the individual is a member of the group

defined by the variable name. These variables are male, white, African American,

Hispanic, 10th grade and 12th grade. An additional dichotomous variable, lives with both

parents, is equal to one if the condition is true. Additional continuous variables from the

MTF are student’s real earned income (using 1982-1984 Consumer Price Index) and

years of parent education, averaged for both parents, if available. The regressions also

include dichotomous year variables, month variables and some regressions include

either state, or DMA dichotomous variables.

       The advertising data and ImpacTeen data were merged with individual level data

from the MTF. The individual data is coded by month, year and school zip code in the

MTF. Similarly the Nielsen advertising data is available by month, year and DMA, which

can be matched to zip codes. In addition, advertising data for a number of prior months

is also available by month, year and DMA. The individual data and advertising data can

thus be matched by month, year and DMA along with several months of prior

advertising data.

       Measuring advertising by month is important since it minimizes temporal

aggregation bias. This bias results from the length of the time interval used to measure

the advertising data. Aggregation over a long interval will obscure important variance in

the advertising variable. A review paper by Leone (1995) finds the effects of advertising

                                            8
do not linger more than six to nine months which makes aggregation over intervals of

more than nine months likely to create bias. Advertising data used in this paper is

measured in monthly intervals which minimizes this bias.

        A related issue in estimating the effects of advertising is accounting for the

lagged effects of advertising. These lagged effects result in a stock of advertising. The

advertising variable used in this study is defined as a weighted sum of current and

lagged advertising data. The lag period is one month. The weights used depend on the

carryover effect. The carryover effect is the ratio of the effect of last month’s advertising

on consumption to the effect of this month’s advertising on consumption. The carryover

effect is assumed to be constant and is referred to as λ. This assumption creates an

exponential decay process. The weights are thus λt where t is the number of months

since the advertisement was aired. Pollay et al. (1996) conclude that for tobacco a

carryover effect of .3 is a reasonable value.5 The advertising variable used in this study

was created by summing the current month and three prior months advertising,

weighted by .3t . That is, the advertising stock variable is equal to the current month

advertising and the weighted GRPs for the past three months. The current month is the

month of the MTF survey data. The mean values for all of the variables used in the

regressions are presented in table 1.

        An important issue in advertising research is endogeneity between consumption

and advertising. NRT advertisers might spend more in DMA’s with more smokers. The

number of smokers of all ages is positively correlated with the number of youth

smokers. Therefore, it is possible that youth smoking is a causal factor on NRT


5
 Other decay rates were tested and produced very similar regression results. With a decay rate of .3, after three
months the weight is only .027 which make a negligible contribution to the advertising stock.

advertising. However, there was an exogenous shock in NRT advertising in 1996. This

shock, described in the introduction, was the result of the shift to OTC and the lowering

of the disclosure requirements for DTC advertising of all prescription drugs. The

monthly data on NRT advertising for all 50 DMAs are shown in figure 1. As seen in

figure 1, there is a dramatic change in NRT advertising beginning in March 1996. Since

this change is exogenous to smoking, endogeneity is not a problem in the immediate

pre-shock and post-shock periods. However, the greater the elapse of time before or

after the shock increases the probability of endogeneity. There was no NRT advertising

pre-shock, but endogeneity can still occur in the post-shock period. To limit advertising

variance primarily to the 1996 exogenous shock, models using only 1994 through 1997

data were also estimated.

       Figure 1 also shows a seasonal pattern of increased NRT advertising around

January of each year. For this reason, month level dichotomous variables are also

included in the regressions. The MTF surveys are all done from February to June so

month variables for March through June were included.

       It is possible that within geographical groups there exists unobservable factors

which are correlated across all individuals. This creates a potential correlation in the

error terms for individuals in the same geographical group. To correct this clustered

standard errors are used. The cluster is defined at the DMA level.

       The regression models also control for a series of alternative fixed effects. All

models include time fixed effects that capture unobserved national trends and time-

varying factors common to states or DMAs. Cross sectional fixed effects models are

also important since the correlation between NRT advertising and smoking may simply




                                            10
reflect the contemporaneous effects of some other unobserved factors such as local

sentiment towards smoking.

4. Results

       Table 2 presents the estimation results for both smoking participation and use.

The participation regressions are estimated using probit and the use regressions are

estimated with OLS using the natural log of use. Equations 1, 2 and 3, respectively,

include no fixed effects, state fixed effects variables and DMA fixed effects variables.

All equations include year fixed effects variables. The coefficients of the fixed effects

variables are not presented in table 2 in order to simplify the table. All of these

equations use DMA level clustered standard errors to compute the significance tests.

       The alternative fixed effects models show how the estimates for NRT advertising

and cigarette price are affected by the inclusion of controls for geographic

unobservables. The NRT advertising variable and the price variable may have a

component which varies systematically with location making these variables, in part,

proxies for local level unobservables. If this is the case, the exclusion of the fixed

effects variables would bias the coefficients of the NRT advertising and price variables.

However, the inclusion of locational fixed effects variables could create colinearity with

the NRT advertising variable or the price variable. This colinearity can bias the

standard errors. When a variable is significant in both regressions with and without

locational fixed effects it is less likely to be the result of colinearity between the NRT

advertising and the locational fixed effects variables or between price and the locational

fixed effects variables. If this is the case then the coefficients from the fixed effects

models are preferred since locational effects are controlled.




                                              11
       The inclusion of locational fixed effects variables is equivalent to aggregation of

the data to the level of the fixed effects variables. The DMA locational fixed effects

variables aggregate the data to the DMA level. The results for NRT advertising from the

models with DMA locational fixed effects variables are preferred since NRT is measured

at the DMA level. However, the cigarette price variable will have the same value for

several values of the dependent variable. This will create a lower t-value for the price

coefficient in the DMA regression than price would have in the state level fixed effects

regression. Thus the results for price from models with state level fixed effects are

preferred to the results from the DMA level fixed effects models.

       In table 2 the results for NRT advertising differ between the participation

regressions and the use regressions. The NRT advertising variable is insignificant in

each participation regression. For use, NRT advertising is significant in the model with

no locational fixed effects and the state fixed effects model. NRT advertising in the

DMA level fixed effects model is positive but not significant. The magnitude of the

coefficients declines in the fixed effects model suggesting that the NRT advertising

variable is picking up some locational variation. These results provide evidence that

NRT advertising does not affect smoking participation by youth. However, there is

evidence that NRT advertising does increase the amount of smoking by youth who

already smoke.

       The cigarette price variable is negative and generally significant. The state

cigarette price is negative in all regressions and significant in five of six regressions in

table 2. The insignificant coefficient is in the DMA level fixed effects regression which is

unimportant since the price varies at the state level. The evidence suggests a negative

effect of price on both participation and use.

                                              12
       Endogeneity was limited by an exogenous shock in NRT advertising. However,

in the post-shock period endogeneity can again become a concern. Once NRT

advertising was allowed, advertisers may target advertising to smokers which would

create endogeneity in the post-shock period. The further away from the shock, the

greater the concern over endogeneity. The least amount of endogeneity occurs when

using data very close to the shock since the variation in advertising is primarily related

to the shock. In order to examine the results presented in table 2 for endogeneity in the

post-shock period, an additional set of models have been estimated for a limited time

period. This time period includes the two years before and two years after the

exogenous shock in 1996. That is, the data are limited to 1994 through 1997. Any

endogeneity between NRT advertising and smoking would be minimized in this

relatively small period around the shock. There are five months of data in each year

and 50 DMAs resulting in approximately 1000 NRT advertising data points in this

experiment. Results from the limited time period models are presented in table 3.

       The results in table 3 again show that there is no effect of NRT advertising on

participation but NRT advertising is again found to have positive and significant effect

on use. The magnitude of the NRT advertising coefficients increase in the limited time

period models while the coefficients of the individual characteristics do not change

significantly between the sample periods. This is what would occur if NRT advertising

were correlated with the error term but the other independent variables were not. The

implication is that there is endogeneity between NRT advertising and smoking in the

post-shock period. The NRT advertising coefficients from the limited period presented




                                             13
in table 3 are thus preferred to those of table 2.6

           The demographic variables in both table 2 and 3 follow patterns that are familiar

from prior research. These individual level variables are generally not affected by

alternative fixed effects specifications. This shows no location aspect to the individual

level variables. Student income has a positive effect on both participation and use.

Males have lower participation but a higher level of use than females. African

Americans and Hispanics have both lower participation and use relative to the omitted

group. However, whites have higher participation and use relative to the omitted group.

Parental education has a negative effect on use. Finally, participation and use

increases as the student advances to higher grades. The month variables are mixed,

with some significant and some insignificant coefficients.

           Table 4 presents the NRT advertising coefficients from a series of regressions

which were limited to data for specific demographic groups. These results are based on

data from 1994 to 1997. The table presents only the NRT advertising coefficients since

other variables where substantially the same as table 3. The demographic group is

listed in the first column. Again, the evidence of an effect is stronger when at least two

specifications have significant coefficients. The results suggest that NRT advertising

has a greater impact on 12th graders, whites and the “other” race category. Younger

students, African Americans and Hispanics appear to be unaffected by NRT advertising.

Use by males and females are increased equally by NRT advertising.



5. Conclusions



6
    It is also possible that the difference in NRT coefficients may be due to some phenomena other than endogeneity.


                                                           14
               The purpose of this project was to determine the effect that NRT advertising

has on youth smoking. NRT advertising could decrease smoking by informing smokers

that the product can make quitting easier and thus inducing more smokers to try and

quit. However, a moral hazard is created because NRT advertising increases the

expectation that cessation is relatively easy. NRT advertising, therefore, could induce

individuals to initiate smoking, to smoke more and to delay quit attempts.

         There is no theoretical reason that NRT advertising would have a different effect

on participation and use. Yet the results show that NRT advertising has no effect on

participation but increases use. Participation is affected by both initiation and cessation.

Possibly, NRT advertising increases initiation but also increases cessation. This could

result in no overall effect on participation. Alternatively, NRT advertising may simply

have no effect on participation.

         Both NRT advertising elasticities and price elasticities can be computed. Using

the results for the DMA fixed effects model of use in table 3 an elasticity of smoking with

respect to NRT advertising can be computed. This elasticity is computed to be .10,

which means that an increase of 10 percent in NRT advertising would increase smoking

by about 1.0 percent.7 Since average youth smoking is about 5.77 cigarettes per day,

an increase of 10 percent in NRT advertising would increase this average to about 5.82

cigarettes per day.

         The NRT advertising elasticity can also be used to estimate the effect on youth

smoking of banning all NRT advertising. The relationship between NRT advertising and

youth smoking is likely to be non-linear with the elasticity decreasing as NRT advertising


7
  The NRT advertising variable is a weighted sum of the current and past three months of advertising. It can easily
be shown that if advertising in all four months changes by 10 percent, then the weighted sum also changes by 10
percent.

increase. The estimated elasticity thus underestimates the effect of eliminating NRT

advertising entirely. A 100 percent decrease in NRT advertising is estimated to reduce

youth smoking by at least 10 percent. This would reduce youth smoking from 5.77

cigarettes per day to about 5.27, or less, cigarettes per day.

       As a comparison the price elasticity is also computed from the four relevant price

coefficients in tables 2 and 3. The four price coefficients for participation average to

about -.0014 which results in an elasticity of about -.68. The four price coefficients for

use from average to -.0035 which results in an elasticity of about -.45. The overall

price elasticity is -1.03, while somewhat high, is the price elasticity for youth rather than

adults. The elasticity indicates that a 10 percent increase in price would reduce youth

smoking by about 10 percent. This is the same as a complete elimination of NRT

advertising.

       Further research on the effects of NRT advertising on older smokers is important

before any definitive conclusions about NRT advertising are made. NRT advertising

may be important in helping older smokers to quit. If this is the case, to limit the

damage to younger smokers, NRT advertising could be targeted at older smokers by

limiting the type of programming that show NRT ads and by the content of the ads

themselves.
