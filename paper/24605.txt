                                         ABSTRACT

We use a resume audit study to better understand the role of employment and unemployment
histories in affecting callbacks to job applications. We focus on how the effect of career history
varies by age, partly in an attempt to reconcile disparate findings in prior studies. While we
cannot reconcile earlier findings on the effect of unemployment duration, the findings solidify an
emerging consensus on the role of age and employment on callback. First, among applicants
across a broad age range, we find that applicants with 52 weeks of unemployment have a lower
callback rate than do applicants with shorter unemployment spells. However, regardless of an
applicant's age, there is no relationship between spell length and callback among applicants with
shorter spells. Second, we find a hump-shaped relationship between age and callback, with both
younger and older applicants having a lower probability of callback relative to prime-aged
applicants. Finally, we find that those applicants who are employed at the time of application
have a lower callback rate than do unemployed applicants, regardless of whether the interim job
is of lower or comparable quality relative to the applied-for job. This may reflect a perception
among employers that it is harder or more expensive to attract an applicant who is currently
employed.

1         Introduction
The Great Recession led to a dramatic rise both in the unemployment rate and in dura-
tions of unemployment. Over the subsequent seven plus years of economic expansion, the
unemployment rate has declined sharply but the long-term unemployment rate and the
share of long-term unemployment among the unemployed remain at unusually high lev-
els.1 Moreover, there was a sharp decline in the labor force participation rate and in the
employment-population ratio during the Great Recession, with little recovery since.2 These
patterns point to the continued difficulty job losers have in finding a job. Along with the
difficulty the unemployed have in finding a new job, the quality of job matches formed in
recessions tends to be lower (e.g., Bowlus 1995, Farber 1999), and job losers often need
to pass through a long series of job moves towards higher-paying jobs (e.g., Stevens 1997,
von Wachter, Manchester, and Song 2009). Finally, there is mounting evidence that this
job search and matching process is particularly challenging for those just entering the labor
market (e.g., Kahn 2010, Schwandt and von Wachter 2017) and for older workers who are
unlucky enough to lose a job in a recession (e.g., Chan and Stevens 2001, Farber 2017).
        The elevated long-term unemployment rate, the substantial fraction of unemployment
that is long term, and the protracted job instability and low job quality that job losers
experience reinforce the importance of understanding the determinants of successful job
search. In particular, given the job losses associated with a major recession, it is important to
understand better the roles played by specific features of employment history in determining
the employment process.
        To better understand the determinants of job search outcomes, our work uses an audit
study approach. The approach introduces random variation in the characteristics of fictitious
résumés sent to job applications, and examines the effects of these characteristics on callback

    1
     The long-term unemployment rate has fallen substantially since its peak of 4.2 percent in 2010, but it
remains (at about 1.1 percent in 2017) above its rate in earlier strong labor markets. Perhaps more striking,
the long-term share of unemployment, which peaked at 44 percent in 2011, remains very high by historical
standards at 24 percent in 2017. The long-term share of unemployment was 18 percent in 2007, prior to
the Great Recession. These statistics are based on the authors’ calculations using data from the Current
Population Survey.
    2
     The labor force participation rate fell from 66 percent in 2007 to 64 percent in 2012 and fell further to
63 percent in 2017. Over the same period, the employment-population ratio fell from 63 percent in 2007 to
59 percent in 2011 before recovering slightly to 60 percent in 2017. These statistics are based on the authors’
calculations using data from the Current Population Survey.

rates.3 Recent audit studies have focused on unemployment duration, the role of age, and,
to a lesser degree, on the presence and quality of a current (often interim) job. We provide
an integrated assessment of the effect of unemployment duration, age, and interim job status
on callbacks by randomly varying applicant characteristics in these dimensions on résumés
submitted in response to a large number of job postings.
       In doing so, the current study seeks to reconcile contrasting results in the existing lit-
erature (reviewed below) and to integrate results on age and recent employment history.
Although our earlier work (Farber, et al., 2016; 2017) is methodologically similar to Kroft,
et al., (2013), they find a strong negative relationship between the callback rate and unem-
ployment duration while we find no such relationship. In Farber et al. (2017), we attempt
a detailed reconciliation with Kroft, et al. (2013), focusing on potential differences between
the two analyses with respect to the measure of callback, type of job, applicant education,
applicant age, and the particular cities included. Age was the the primary dimension that
we could not rule out as the source of the different findings because of a lack of overlap in
age between the two studies.4 Hence, an important goal for this study is to return to the
field with a design that varies unemployment durations and includes applicants covering a
broad range of ages.
       In pursuit of both an integrated assessment of several obstacles to job search after job
loss, and important missing pieces in the literature, we fielded an audit study in 2017 varying
treatments of unemployment duration, age, and the current employment status of the appli-
cant. We kept all other aspects of the résumés as similar as possible to those in our earlier
work. We visited the same eight cities with female applicants of similar education (college
graduates) applying for the same type of jobs (white collar office jobs such as administrative
or executive assistants, receptionists, secretaries, and the like). Of course we could not hold
fixed the state of the labor market. The labor markets in our cities are uniformly stronger
in 2017 than they were when we fielded our earlier experiment (2012-2014).
       We obtain several key findings. First, our results for the currently employed are clear.
Average callback rates are significantly lower for those applicants with an interim job, re-

   3
     An important early example of an audit study in labor economics is Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004),
who study the effect of African-American sounding names on callback rates. Jarosch and Pilossoph (2016)
present a clear analysis illustrating the limitations of résumé audit studies in measuring variation in hiring
that highlights the distinction between a callback and the eventual hiring decision.
   4
       Kroft, et al. (2013) analysis focused on young applicants, aged 21-33, while Farber, et al., (2016, 2017)
focused on older applicants, aged 35-58.


                                                        2
gardless of the quality than for those who are unemployed. The unemployed had an average
callback rate of 12.6 percent, while the rate was 10.8 percent and 10.2 percent for those
holding a high and low quality interim job, respectively. Interestingly, this negative effect
of holding an interim job obtains only when applying to a relatively high-skilled position.
Callbacks for clerical, data entry, office assistant, and other lower-skilled positions are not
higher for the unemployed. Those without a job receive callbacks at a higher rate only for
administrative or executive assistant, office manager, or other relatively high skilled posi-
tions, which also tend to have higher education requirements. These results suggest that
the path back to career work may be more challenging for many workers than is typically
understood because, perhaps surprisingly, on-the-job search can be significantly less fruitful
when employed than when searching from unemployment.
   Second, there are substantial effects of age, but these cut two ways; both the youngest
(age 22-23) and the oldest (age 60-61) applicants have significantly lower callback rates than
do prime-age applicants. Hence, we confirm the negative effects for older workers reported
in other audit studies. The negative effects for younger workers is partly accounted for
by the fact that very young job applicants often have less relevant work experience than
recommended or required for the job. Any remaining deficit for younger workers dovetails
with a longstanding literature on adverse consequences of early employment shocks.
   Third, we find a limited effect of unemployment duration on the likelihood of callbacks.
There are no distinctions in callback rates among applicants with unemployment durations
of 24 weeks or less, but applicants who have been unemployed for a year have a lower callback
rate. The callback rate was 11.6 percent for applicants with 24 weeks of unemployment, while
applicants with 52 weeks of unemployment had a callback rate of 9.1 percent. This find-
ing adds further complexity to the already contrasting findings on unemployment duration
dependence from prior audit studies.
   Finally, we find little evidence of differences in the effect of unemployment duration by
age. Hence, there is little reason to think that differences in the ages of the applicants can
explain the differences in results across previous studies. We find average callback rates are,
for all age categories, at their lowest after a year of unemployment.
   One broad conclusion is that, while résumé audit studies may be useful in shedding light
on the process of job search and hiring, not enough is known how, why, and when employers
respond to résumé characteristics when making their callback decisions. Clearly, employers
respond to features of the résumé in their callback decision in a way that can be replicated


                                              3
across studies, such as age or current employment status. However, it unclear why this
is not true for unemployment duration. These uncertainties suggest additional caution in
interpreting the results from audit studies and limits to their external validity, especially in
the case of the relationship between callbacks and unemployment duration.


1.1    Related Audit Study Literature
An increasing number of studies implement résumé audit studies to assess the impact of
resume characteristics on the likelihood of callback. One especially relevant subset of the
literature focuses on the effect of the duration of an applicant’s unemployment spell on
callback rates. These studies have obtained mixed results. Some find a negative effect of
unemployment duration on the probability of callback concentrated in the first six months
of the unemployment spell (Kroft et al., 2013; Ghayad, 2014). In contrast, Nunley et al.
(2017) and Farber et al. (2016; 2017) find no effect of unemployment duration on callback
rates in U.S. markets. Focusing on Sweden, Eriksson and Rooth (2014) find no effect for
highly educated workers and a negative effect for spells lasting more than 6 months for low
educated workers. One difficulty in comparing and assessing the different outcomes of these
studies is that they focus on workers of different ages and levels of education. Kroft et al.,
(2013) and Ghayad (2014) focus on younger workers for a range of education groups, Nunley
et al. (2017) focus on younger college graduates, and Farber et al. (2016; 2017) focus on
older college graduates.
   Motivated by the difficulties unemployed older workers face in the labor market, another
group of audit studies addresses how applicant age affects callback rates. The results gen-
erally show a negative relationship between age and callbacks for older and middle-aged
workers. Lahey (2008) finds large negative effects of age on callbacks for women seeking
entry-level positions in the U.S. Neumark et al. (2015; 2016), in a large scale audit study,
find significantly lower callback rates for older women but weaker evidence for men in sev-
eral occupations. Bendick, et al. (1997) find evidence that both older men and older women
had lower callback rates than their younger counterparts. Farber, et.al. (2016; 2017) find
that older females have lower callback rates than middle-aged females. So far, no study has
compared callback rates by age for younger vs. middle aged vs. older workers. This open
question, which we address here, takes on greater importance given the increasing evidence
that younger workers are particularly hurt by adverse labor market conditions as well (e.g.,
Kahn 2010, Oreopoulos, et al. 2012, Schwandt and von Wachter 2017).

                                               4
        Last, a smaller number of studies assess the effect of holding a job at the time of appli-
cation on the probability of a callback. Farber, et al. (2016; 2017) find that workers who
are currently employed in an interim job at a lower level than the one for which they are
applying have a lower callback rate than those who are unemployed. This finding is similar
to that in Nunley et al. (2017), who found that recent college graduates in the U.S. had
substantially lower callbacks if they were currently employed in jobs that did not require a
college education and were not suited to the job for which they were applying. A related
but distinct finding of Kroft, et al. (2013) is that individuals who are currently employed in
a job similar to the one for which they are applying are significantly less likely to receive a
callback. These findings are consistent with the idea that employers believe employed job
seekers are more difficult to hire because they are likely to have a higher reservation wage
and be more expensive to recruit. An open question that we address here is whether the job
type at which workers are employed matters, or whether employment, per se, lowers callback
rates.


2         A Simple Theoretical Framework
To guide interpretation of the experimental design and results, we offer a simple theory
of employer learning about worker quality from resume characteristics. A straightforward
implication of the theory is that employers, when evaluating older applicants, will place less
weight on the duration of a recent unemployment spell because there is more information
available about their labor market performance through previous experience.5
        We assume a profit-maximizing, risk-neutral firm with a single worker. The output (Y )
of the firm is equal to the quality of the worker (µ). We assume all hired workers will be paid
the same wage so that the firm is interested in the most able worker among applicants for its
opening. The model captures the employer’s process of integrating available information to
form an expectation of applicant quality. While we do not develop a formal sequential search
model, the standard model has the property that the employer will set a reservation worker
quality level (µ∗ ) as part of the search process and call back those applicants whose expected
quality exceeds this threshold (E(µi ) > µ∗ )), so that applicants with higher expected quality
will be more likely to receive a callback.

    5
        A more detailed presentation of this model is available in Farber, et al. (2017).



                                                         5
   Consider applicant i. The firm has incomplete information about µi and makes an in-
ference based on a set of k noisy signals. For the purposes of our study, these signals
include, among other background information, the applicant’s employment experience, age,
and whether the applicant holds an interim job of a given type. Let sij represent the j th
noisy signal of µi . We assume this j th signal satisfies
                                                  1
                                          sij =      µi + γij ,                                  (1)
                                                  αj
where γij is a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and variance σj2 . The
parameters αj are normalizations that account for the fact that some signals are positive and
some are negative as well as for differential scaling of the signals. For example, unemployment
duration would have αj < 0, but a high-quality interim job might have αj > 0. The
employer’s inference problem is to combine the available information on sij , j = 1, ..., k
optimally in order to derive an expected value for applicant quality (E(µi |si1 , ..., sik )).
   Posterior beliefs about applicant quality can be derived using a standard Bayesian proce-
dure. Given the distributional assumption regarding the γij , each signal sij about applicant
quality is normally distributed with mean µi /αj and variance σj2 . To describe how informa-
tion about sij is combined to form the employer’s posterior distribution on applicant quality,
it is convenient to use the precisions of the random variables rather than the variances. The
precision (h) of a random variable is the inverse of the variance, so that sij with variance σj2
has precision hj ≡ 1/σj2 . In this Normal Bayesian updating model, the posterior distribution
of the employer’s beliefs about µi is normal with a mean that is a precision-weighted average
of the k signals. The posterior expectation is
                                                           Pk
                                                            j=1   hj αj sij
                                E(µi |si1 , ..., sik ) =    Pk                .                  (2)
                                                                j=1   hj
   The model has a clear implication for the effect of any particular factor (signal m) on
the likelihood of a callback. The marginal effect of a change in sim is
                                                "           #
                                  ∂E(µi )            hm
                                          = αm Pk                                                (3)
                                   ∂sim              j=1 hj

which takes the sign of αm . If, for example, signal m is unemployment duration then,
presumably, αm ≤ 0, and the marginal effect of unemployment duration is negative. Thus,
workers with longer unemployment duration have lower posterior mean worker quality. This
makes their posterior expected quality less likely to exceed the necessary threshold (µ∗ ),
which implies a lower likelihood of callback.

                                                    6
    We found in our earlier work that holding a low-quality interim job reduced the likelihood
of receiving a callback, but we do not have a strong prior on the effect of holding interim
jobs of differing quality on the likelihood of a callback. On the one hand, holding an interim
job of any quality could indicate that the applicant is energetic and ambitious. On the other
hand, the holding of a low-level interim job could indicate to the employer (particularly on
a cursory reading of the résumé) that the worker is ill-suited for the job. Additionally, the
employer might feel that currently-employed applicants, regardless of job quality, are more
difficult or expensive to recruit. This implies ambiguity about the sign of αm associated with
the holding of an interim job of a given type.
    In our discussion of the existing literature, we highlighted the potential for age to explain
the mixed results on the relationship between unemployment duration and callback rates.
Prior analyses that find duration dependence in callbacks, especially Kroft, et al. (2013),
focused on younger applicants. Indeed, there are good theoretical reasons that unemployment
duration would be more important for young workers.
    The key prediction of the model for understanding how the relationship between unem-
ployment duration and the likelihood of callback is mediated by age is that when there are
more signals of worker quality, the marginal effect of any one signal will be smaller in abso-
lute value. An older worker has more prior work experience and, as a result, more signals
of worker quality. This comes in the form of more and perhaps longer-lasting prior jobs. In
the context of the model, longer experience and more information increase the number of
signals (k). The marginal effect of a particular signal is given in equation 3. On inspection
of this relationship, an increase in k increases the denominator in the term in brackets (an
increase in the precision of the prior belief regarding µ). The result is a reduction in the
absolute value of the marginal effect of any particular signal.
    Thus, the model predicts that the marginal effect of unemployment duration on the
likelihood of receiving a callback will be smaller for older workers. Our current analysis,
which covers the full age spectrum allows us to investigate whether any relationship between
unemployment duration the callback rate varies systematically with age.

job advertisements. We then recorded whether each résumé received a positive response.
The setting for the experiment consists of two large on-line job boards in the U.S. We used
these websites to search for jobs in 8 cities: Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Omaha, Pittsburgh,
Portland (ME), Sacramento, and Tampa. These cities were originally selected by Farber
et al. (2017) to allow for treatment effect differences by local-area unemployment rates.
Therefore, half of the cities studied had relatively low unemployment rates in 2012 (Dallas,
Omaha, Pittsburgh, and Portland) while the other half had relatively high unemployment
rates in 2012 (Charlotte, Chicago, Sacramento, and Tampa).
      Table 1 presents city-level unemployment rates for the 8 cities in 2012 (early in the
Farber, et al. (2017) study period) and 2014 (late in the Farber, et al. (2017) study period),
and in 2017 (the period covered in this study). The table illustrates the improvement in
the labor market during the extended recovery from the Great Recession. Unemployment
rates have fallen sharply in both the low- and the high-unemployment cities, and the relative
ordering of cities by unemployment rate was largely preserved across the groups. Given
the general strengthening of labor markets over the past 7 years, the distinction between
the low- and high-unemployment cities is less salient than it was at the time we designed
our previous study, and we will not evaluate the low-high unemployment distinction in the
present analysis.
      To reduce idiosyncratic variation in interview requests, we made design choices aimed at
ensuring that the résumés and job openings were well-matched. Applications were limited to
white collar office positions, including administrative or executive assistants, receptionists,
secretaries, and office associates. Our procedure for finding positions to which résumés
would be submitted entailed searching for particular keywords in the position description.6

      These terms included Administrative Assistant (90.5 percent), Receptionist (6 percent), Office Assistant

          Note: Job Category is a classification based on the posted job title. Skill classification
          is subjective. Education Category indicates the highest education level recommended or
          required for posted position.



Importantly, there were more than 1,200 different job titles associated with the jobs openings
to which we applied. We then did a textual analysis of the job titles associated with the
selected positions in our sample and subjectively assigned the job titles to the 8 categories
listed in the left panel of Table 2. Most jobs fall in the 2 categories Administrative Assistant
and Receptionist. We further collapse these 8 job categories into 2 groups: 1) “low skill”
(Receptionist, Office Assistant, Clerical / Data Entry, and Other – Low), comprising 34.1
percent of postings, and 2) “high skill” (Administrative Assistant, Executive Assistant, Office
Manager, and Other – High), comprising 65.9 percent of postings. We will utilize this low-
high skill distinction in our analysis.
       Given that these jobs are disproportionately held by women, all applicants are assigned
female names. Each applicant has a four-year bachelor degree from a non-elite public uni-
versity or college whose admission rate exceeds 65 percent. The distribution of required or
recommended educational attainment in the job postings is listed in the right column of
Table 2. Fully 52 percent of postings do not list an education level. A high school degree is
specified in 28.3 percent of postings, an associate’s degree in 8.6 percent, and a bachelor’s
degree in 11.1 percent. The posted education level is correlated with the skill level of the job
category as we define it.7 Among postings specifying a bachelors degree, 84.4 percent are
high skill. Among postings specifying an associates degree, 79.4 percent are high skill. The
fraction high-skill falls to 62.6 percent among postings specifying a high school degree. The

fraction high-skill is 61.5 percent among postings with no specified education level, suggest-
ing that these postings are more likely to be open to applicants with less education. Given
that all our applicants have a four-year bachelor’s degree, they may be over-qualified for
some of the low-skilled job postings. For this reason, we present some analyses making a
distinction between the postings we classify as low-skill and those we classify as high skill.
      Many of our applicants have substantial work histories, which are perforce longer for
older applicants. The work histories generally consist of three to six white collar jobs. Prior
to the current unemployment spell, these work histories had no employment gaps longer
than a month in the previous five years. Age and birth year are not listed on the résumés
but are instead inferred from information on year of college completion and work experience.
      The fictitious résumés were modeled on real résumés posted publicly on a website that
was not used for the purposes of data collection for this study. These “source” résumés
were used by individuals to apply for positions similar to the target occupations we study
but were in cities that were not included in the study. We migrated the characteristics of
these source résumés to our fictitious résumés, modified suitably so that, city-by-city, the
residential addresses, employers, and post-secondary education institutions are geographi-
cally appropriate. We did not migrate the names listed on the source résumés, but instead
selected common, cohort-specific names from lists maintained by the Social Security Admin-
istration. These résumé names are racially and ethnically neutral in that they are not held
disproportionately by a particular racial or ethnic group.8
      Fieldwork began in March 2017 and ended in August 2017. A group of research assis-
tants regularly searched both websites for job advertisements that had been posted within
the past 7 days and that were located within a 25-mile radius of a given city. The 7-day
criterion increased the odds that our résumés were evaluated by employers, while the 25-mile
radius ensured that the pool of openings included a sufficiently large number of jobs. We
sent 4 résumés in response to each job advertisement. Each résumé was accompanied by
a cover letter that provided a broad summary of the applicant’s credentials listed on the
résumé.9 On one of the job websites résumés were submitted directly to employers via email
addresses provided by the website host. Résumés on the other website were forwarded to

Nelson, Heather Adams, Jennifer Smith, Shannon Robinson, Janice Evans, Linda Carter, Mary Wilcox, and

employers through the job board’s on-line submission portal. To minimize suspicion that the
four résumés were “connected,” we let several hours elapse between each submission. The
research assistants collected information about each job advertisement and firm, including
the job title, name and location of the firm, contact information, industry code, and any ex-
perience or education requirements. Altogether our analysis data-set includes 8,488 résumés
submitted in response to 2,122 job advertisements.10
       The essence of the experiment was to manipulate three variables: length of contempo-
raneous unemployment spell, presence and nature of contemporaneous “interim jobs,” and
age of applicant. Regarding the first source experimental variation, the work histories were
designed such that a base set of résumés indicated that the applicant was just entering unem-
ployment at the time of résumé submission, while other résumés indicated a specific number
of weeks of unemployment from the set {4, 12, 24, 52}. The start of the unemployment
spell was indicated on the résumé by the end date of the applicant’s most recently held job.
Therefore, those in the base group listed on her résumé that her most recent job had ended
in the month immediately preceding the month in which the application was submitted.
The unemployment spells were drawn with replacement from the set {0, 4, 12, 24, 52} and
were intended to be assigned with equal probability. There was, however, a glitch in the
implementation of the sampling during May, June, and July 2017, and the probabilities were
not equal for applications during that period.11
       The second source of experimental variation assigned applicants to one of three interim-
job categories: a low-skilled interim job, a high-skilled interim job, and no interim job. The
low-skilled interim job was shown to begin the month in which a given résumé was submitted
(following whatever length unemployment spell was assigned to that résumé), and included
employment at a chain restaurant, a big box retail store, or a grocery store. These jobs
generally involved serving food, stocking shelves, or assisting customers at a register or on a
retail floor. Thus this job experience was designed to appear quite different from the career
work outlined on the rest of the résumé and is generally of lower skill and responsibility than

  10
     The complete data set contains 8,899 résumés submitted in response to 2,304 job postings. A small
number of job postings (182) inadvertently received less than four submissions and we delete all the submis-
sions to these 182 postings from our analysis. None of our results are affected by omitting the 411 completed
submissions to these 182 postings.
  11
     During these three months, most of the resumes that should have had a 24 week unemployment duration
actually had a zero unemployment duration. The actual fractions with each unemployment treatment ranged,
over the entire period, from 0.128 with 24 weeks duration to 0.279 with 0 weeks duration. The other three
durations (4, 12, and 52 weeks) had fractions very close to 0.20.


                                                     11
the posted jobs. The high-skilled interim jobs also began in the month of résumé submission
(following whatever length unemployment spell was assigned to that résumé). However, this
category included jobs in industries and occupations that matched applicants’ broader work
history. While the responsibilities on these interim jobs were somewhat downgraded relative
to the responsibilities listed for the most recently held job, these were more comparable
to the posted jobs and particularly to the lower-skill posted jobs as described above. The
third group of résumés did not list an interim job so that these applicants appeared to be
currently unemployed along with some unemployment duration as described above. These
three treatments were assigned with replacement and with equal probability.
   The third source of experimental variation assigned each applicant an age from the set
{22-23, 27-28, 33-34, 42-43, 51-52, 60-61}. Although age was not stated on the résumés, it
could be inferred by employers from the college graduation dates as well as the start (and
end) dates of the jobs listed throughout the employment history. At the beginning of every
month we adjusted the employment dates accordingly so that our fictitious applicant did
not “age” throughout the study. Age categories were assigned without replacement within
a job posting and with equal probability.
   The experiment was designed so each dimension of variation (unemployment duration,
interim job, and age) was assigned independently. This facilitates the examination of in-
teractions across these dimensions. For example, there might be a differential impact of
unemployment duration or interim job by age.
   To enable communication between employers and our fictitious applicants, we created a
telephone number for each city-name combination in the study, for a total of 96 numbers
(8 cities * 12 names). An email address was also established for our applicants according
to the same rules. The research assistants regularly monitored these accounts and recorded
whether résumés received a message from an employer. In particular, they coded three cat-
egories of responses: interview requests, a request for more information, and rejections. An
interview request is defined as the receipt of either an explicit interview request or an invi-
tation to discuss the résumé and/or position in more detail. A request for more information
was coded if the applicant was asked to fill out an application, answer clarifying questions,
provide additional information, or interview for a different position. A rejection was coded
if the applicant received a message from the employer saying that the résumé was not se-
lected to move to the next round of the hiring/interview process. Résumés that received no
correspondence from an employer were ultimately coded as a rejection. Potential employers


                                              12
who did respond were promptly informed that the applicant was no longer available.


4     Results
We begin by analyzing the effect of unemployment duration and age on the likelihood of a
callback. In an attempt to reconcile our earlier findings (Farber, et al, 2016, 2017) with find-
ings of Kroft, et al. (2013), we then investigate how the relationship between unemployment
duration and the likelihood of callback varies with age. Next, we consider how the presence
of an interim job affects the likelihood of callback. Finally, we consider the extent to which
holding an interim job of different types (low skill vs. high skill) has differential effects on
callback rates and how these effects are related to the skill level of the applied-for job (also
low skill vs. high skill).
    We provide three measures of what constitutes a callback: 1) any callback, 2) a callback
asking for more information, and 3) a callback requesting an interview. Overall, the any-
callback rate is 11.2 percent, the information-callback rate is 3.0 percent, and the interview-
callback rate is 8.2 percent. One plausibility check that our resumes work as intended is that
the any-callback rate was significantly (p-value < 0.0005) higher in our low-unemployment
cities (at 12.6 percent) than in our high-unemployment cities (at 10.1 percent). The same
relationship holds considering information callbacks and interview callbacks separately. In
what follows, we present some first-order results that consider different types of callbacks
separately, but we largely emphasize any-callbacks.


4.1     Duration of Unemployment
A primary focus of this study is to examine the effect of unemployment duration on the
likelihood of receiving callback to a job application. Table 3 contains mean callback rates for
each of the three callback measures and each of the five values for unemployment duration.
The table also contains the results of Pearson χ2 tests of the independence of callbacks and
unemployment duration. Independence can be rejected for any-callback and for each category
of, callback, but there is not a progressive relationship between callbacks and unemployment
duration. The callback rate is lower for those with the highest unemployment duration (52
weeks) than for those with shorter unemployment spells, but there does not seem to be a
distinction in callback rates for those with unemployment spells between 0 and 24 weeks.

omitting the 52-week category fails to reject independence (all p-values > 0.4). Hence, the
overall rejection of independence is entirely driven by the lower callback rates for applicants
with 52 weeks of unemployment.
   The variation in unemployment duration treatment within job posting in each round of-
fers the opportunity to examine within-posting variation in callback rates by unemployment
treatment. The fixed-effect conditional logit analysis due to Chamberlain (1980) is a natu-
ral way to estimate this within-posting effect. Intuitively, the fixed-effect conditional logit
conditions on the number of successes (callbacks) within each job posting and asks whether
the applicants with longer unemployment durations were less likely to be among those who
received the fixed number of callbacks. This approach ignores the job postings for which
there was no variation in the outcome. Each of our 2122 job postings received 4 applications.
1601 (75.5 percent) postings had no callbacks and 37 postings (1.7 percent) had 4 callbacks.
This leaves 246 postings with 1 callback, 161 postings with 2 callbacks, and 77 postings with
3 callbacks. We postpone estimation of the full Chamberlain fixed-effect logit model until
Section 4.5 and, for now, present just the average callback rates by unemployment treatment
conditional on the number of callbacks received for the job posting. For concision, we present

only analysis of only the any-callback rate, and do not distinguish information requests from
requests for interviews.
   Table 4 contains these any-callback rates conditional on the number of callbacks received.
Column 1 of the table contains average callback rates by unemployment treatment for job
postings with 1-3 callbacks. The Pearson χ2 statistic implies rejection of independence of
callback and unemployment duration. Again, this is driven entirely by a significantly lower
callback rate for applications showing 52 weeks of unemployment and no differences among
applications showing shorter unemployment spells. Column 2 shows average callback rates
for job postings with 1 callback. These show that same pattern as in column 1, with a sig-
nificantly lower callback rate for applications showing 52 weeks of unemployment. Columns
3 and 4 of table 4 show the same statistics for job postings with 2 and 3 callbacks respec-
tively. While the general pattern is the same, with a lower callback rate for the highest
unemployment category, independence cannot be rejected and there are no significant differ-
ences by unemployment duration. The relative imprecision of the within-posting estimates
for postings with 2 and 3 callbacks is likely a result of the relatively small sample sizes.
   We will revisit the relationship between the callback rate and unemployment duration
in more detail later with particular focus on how the relationship varies with age. The

simple comparison of means suggests that, while there are lower callback rates for very long
unemployment spells (52 weeks), there is no systematic relationship between callback rates
and unemployment duration for spells of one-half year or less.


4.2    Age
Table 5 contains mean callback rates for each of the three callback measures and each of the
six age groups. The table also contains the results of Pearson χ2 tests of independence of
callbacks and age category. While independence can be rejected for any-callbacks, there is
not a monotone relationship between callbacks and age. It is clear that the callback rate is
lower for the youngest (22-23 year old) and oldest (60-61 year old) applicants. The highest
callback rate was received by 33-34 and 42-43 year old applicants. This inverted U-shape
suggests that employers are most interested in hiring prime-age applicants for these jobs.
The same general patters hold for information-callbacks and interview-callbacks, but the
differences are not statistically significant.

   As with unemployment duration, variation in age of applicant within job posting offers
the opportunity to examine the relationship between callback rates and age. We focus again
on the job postings for which there was variation in the outcome. We ignore the 1638 of 2122
job postings for which there was no variation in the outcome, and study the 484 postings
with 1 to 3 callbacks. Again, for concision, we present results only for any-callback.
   Table 6 contains mean any-callback rates by age for postings that received 1 to 3 callbacks
conditioning on the number of callbacks. The inverted U-shaped pattern we found in the
overall data is apparent in the callback rates conditional on the number of callbacks for
postings with 1 and 2 callbacks. Callback rates are lowest for the youngest and oldest
applicants. The pattern is strongest for applications to postings that received two callbacks.
Among applications to postings that received 3 callbacks, the youngest applicants (age 22-
23) have substantially lower callback rates than older applicants, but there is no drop off in
callback rates among the oldest applicants.
   Overall, the estimates in table 6 conditioning on number of callbacks to a posting confirm
the overall inverse U-shaped relationship between age and the callback rate. It appears that
employers are less interested in hiring the youngest workers, perhaps because they have less

experience.12 Employers also appear to be less interested in hiring the oldest job applicants
(despite their having more experience).


4.2.1      The Role of Experience for Young Applicants

Interestingly, while existing audit studies on age (including our earlier work) have mainly
focused on older applicants, our point estimates indicate that the youngest applicants have
significantly lower callback rates relative to older applicants. As noted by Neumark, et al.
(2015), when varying age, prior work experience must vary as well. Younger workers simply
cannot have as much experience as older workers. To the extent that employers value prior
work experience, the lower callback rates for the youngest applicants could be due to their
having insufficient experience.
       We investigate this directly using information in the posted job descriptions on recom-
mended/required experience for the posted jobs. Of the 2,122 job postings that make up our
analysis sample, 820 postings (38.6 percent) did not mention work experience, and 164 post-
ings (7.7 percent) explicitly stated that no experience was required. Among the remaining
53.6 percent of postings that required at least some experience, 570 (26.9 percent of all post-
ings) recommended/required one year or less experience, 491 (23.1 percent of all postings)
recommended/required more than one year to 4 years experience, and 77 (3.6 percent of all
postings) recommended/required more than 4 years experience (maximum 10). All of our
applicants held a BA degree, implying that our youngest applicants (22-23 years old) could
not have had more than a year or so of work experience at the time of application and, as a
result, may be deemed unqualified for jobs requiring more experience.
       Table 7 contains an analysis of overall callback rates by age category and the posted
experience requirement. One obvious pattern is that callback rates are generally higher for
applications to postings with no explicit mention of experience (first row of the table) for
applicants 22-43. More generally, the table provides support for a strong interaction between
age and posting experience recommendations/requirements in the relationship of callback
rates with age. It is only for the youngest two age groups (22-23 and 27-28, estimates in
columns 1 and 2 of table 7) that there is a statistically significant relationship between
posted experience and the callback rate. These two age groups show very high callback

  12
     Fully 48 percent of 22-23 year old applicants have at least 12 weeks unemployment. This unemployment
could be more salient (get a higher weight in the employer’s inference process) for young workers due to their
relative lack of experience and result in a lower callback rate. We address this directly in Section 4.2.2.

rates to postings either with no statement of recommended/required experience or with an
explicit statement of no experience required. It appears that employers posting jobs where
experience is not important prefer younger applicants. Callback rates fall off sharply for
younger applicants as recommended/required experience increases. There are not significant
differences in callback rates by recommended/required experience for applicants 33 and older
(columns 3-6 of table 7).


4.2.2   Does the Effect of Unemployment Duration vary with Age?

Recall that Kroft, et al. (2013) found a strong negative relationship between the likelihood
of receiving a callback and unemployment duration among younger workers that was con-
centrated early in the unemployment spell. In contrast, Farber, et al. (2016, 2017) found
no such relationship when considering older workers. Our current analysis (table 3), using a
full spectrum of ages, suggests no relationship between the callback rate and unemployment
duration for spells of unemployment up to 24 weeks but a lower likelihood of callback for
very long unemployment spells (52 weeks). In this subsection, we examine the relationship
between unemployment duration and the likelihood of callback separately by age group.

   Our experimental design included six age groups. We showed in the previous subsection
that there is virtually no difference in callback rates among the middle four age groups (27-
28, 33-34, 42-43, and 51-52). While we do not show the detailed results here, we verified
that there are no significant patterns or differences in the relationship between callback rates
and unemployment duration across these four age groups. To simplify the exposition, we
proceed showing separately the relationships across 3 age groups (22-23, 27-52, and 60-61).
We can think of these as young, prime-aged, and older applicants.
   Table 8 presents the mean callback rates by unemployment duration both overall and
for each of the three age categories. The first column of table repeats the means reported
in column 1 of table 3 and shows the lower callback rate for applicants with 52 weeks
unemployment. The callback rates in column 2 of the table are for the youngest applicants
(22-23 years of age), and they show and inverted U-shape. Callback rates for young applicants
with zero unemployment duration and with 52 weeks of unemployment are significantly and
substantially lower than for those with 4-24 weeks of unemployment. The callback rates in
column 4 of the table are for the oldest applicants (60-61 years of age), and they show a
significantly lower callback rate for older applicants with 52 weeks unemployment. There are
no significant distinctions in callback rates by weeks of unemployment for older applicants



                                                   20
with 24 weeks or less unemployment. There are are no significant differences in callback
rates by unemployment duration for the prime-aged applicants (column 3 of the table).
    This analysis indicates that the difference in estimated duration dependence between
Farber, et al. (2016, 2017) and Kroft et al. (2013) is likely not due to the fact that the two
studies focused on different age groups. While we find a significantly lower callback rate
at 52 weeks unemployment for the younger applicants in our study, there is not a general
declining pattern of callback rates at lower durations of unemployment. In contrast, Kroft,
et al. (2013) found a consistent negative relationship between the callback rate and duration
for durations of 24 weeks or less. The contrast in results remains a puzzle.


4.3     Interim Jobs
Our experimental treatment of interim-job status included three values: 1) no interim job,
2) a lower quality interim job, and 3) a higher quality interim job. We do not have a
clear expectation regarding the effect of holding an interim job of either type at the time of
application on the likelihood of a callback. One question is whether an interim job is a good
signal or a bad signal of worker quality. On the one hand, holding an interim job of any kind
could be a positive signal of the applicant’s drive or ambition and result in a higher likelihood
of callback. On the other hand, a lower quality interim job could indicate that the applicant
is lower quality and result in a lower likelihood of callback. If this channel is important we
would expect that holding a lower quality interim job would reduce the likelihood of callback
relative to otherwise-equivalent holders of a higher quality interim job.13
    Another possibility is that employers find it easier to attract applicants (get them to
accept a job offer) if the applicant is not employed. The fact that an applicant is employed
might signal to an employer that the applicant’s reservation wage is higher. As such, employ-
ers may prefer applicants who are not employed (no interim job). Alternatively, employers
may be particularly concerned about pursuing applicants who are working in a higher-quality
interim job but less concerned about pursuing applicants with no job or a lower-quality in-
terim job.
    Given our three-category treatment of interim jobs, almost any pattern of results can
be understood in the context of these ideas. To summarize, define three probabilities of

  13
     Note that, if employers update substantially based on an interim job, a natural inference is that employ-
ers weight current employment more heavily than past experience (all of which is in relatively high quality
jobs) when forming an expectation of worker quality.

callback: 1) Pn = probability of callback if no interim job, 2) Pb = probability of callback if
lower-quality (bad) interim job, and 3) Pg = probability of callback if higher-quality (good)
interim job. Consider the following potential orderings:

   • Pg > Pb > Pn – Holding an interim job is a positive signal of workers quality, with a
     good interim job a better signal than a bad interim job.

   • Pg > Pn > Pb – Holding a good interim job is a positive signal of worker quality while
     holding a bad interim job is a negative signal.

   • Pg = Pn > Pb – Holding a good interim job is no particular signal of worker quality
     while holding a bad interim job is a negative signal.

   • Pn > Pg > Pb or Pn > Pg = Pb – Holding any interim job is a signal to the employer
     that the applicant will be difficult/expensive to recruit.

   Table 9 contains mean callback rates for each of the three callback measures and three
interim job treatments. The table also contains the results of a Pearson χ2 test of indepen-
dence of callbacks and interim job status. Independence can be rejected for any-callbacks
and interview-callbacks, and the pattern is clear. The highest callback rates are for those
applicants who hold no interim job. There is no statistically significant difference between

callback rates for lower- and higher-quality interim job holders. The same general pattern
holds for information-callbacks, but the differences are not statistically significant.
   Table 10 contains mean any-callback rates by interim job status for postings that received
1 to 3 callbacks conditioning on the number of callbacks. The general pattern is the same as
the unconditional results in table 9. In every case, the highest callback rate is associated with
holding no interim job. However, independence of the callback rate and interim job status
is rejected only for the combined postings receiving 1-3 callbacks and the set of applications
to postings with 2 callbacks. There is no consistent distinction between the callback rates
for applications with lower- and higher-quality interim jobs.


4.4    Interim Jobs and the Skill Level of the Position
As we noted earlier, we classified the job posting to which we submitted résumés as “low-
skill” and “high-skill.” Given that our applicants’ interim jobs also were “low” or “high”
quality, it may be that the effect of holding an interim job of a given type could have differing
relationships with the callback rate depending on the type of job for which the application
is made.
   We start by validating our categorization of job postings as low-skill or high-skill using
information we collected on any stated education requirements or preferences in the job
description. The distributions of these characteristics are summarized in table 2. Table 11

contains a cross-tabulation of the skill level of the 8,488 job postings with information in
the job description regarding preferences for or requirements of a specific education level.
Over half the postings did not list an education level, but among those that did list an
education level, the high-skill postings were more likely to list a bachelor’s or associate’s
degree (48.5 percent of the high-skill listings with a stated education level) relative to the
low-skill postings (25.7 percent of the low-skill listings with a stated education level). This
lends some support to our assignment of postings to the low- and high-skill categories.
   Table 12 contains mean any-callback rates by interim job status and skill level of the
posted position. There is no significant relationship between callbacks and interim job sta-
tus for the applications to the lower quality positions (mostly receptionists, office assistants,
and clerical/data entry positions). However, among applications for higher quality positions
(mostly administrative and executive assistants and office managers), there is a strong pat-
tern. Holding an interim job of either lower or higher quality results in a significantly lower
callback rate relative to those applicants who are unemployed at the time of application.


                                                   24
       Overall, the analysis of interim-job status supports the view that employers, particularly
those hiring into relatively high-skilled positions, prefer to hire those applicants who are not
employed. As we noted earlier, this is consistent with findings in the literature by Kroft, et al.
(2013), Farber, et al. (2016, 2017), and Nunley, et al. (2017), and it suggests that employers
seeking to fill at least the type of jobs we consider here prefer to hire the unemployed, perhaps
because of a perception that they will be easier/cheaper to recruit.14 The evidence in table
12, that the preference for the unemployed exists only for applications to the more highly
skilled positions is weakly consistent with this argument since costs of recruitment are likely
higher for higher quality jobs.


4.5       Multivariate Analysis
We now turn to a multivariate logit analysis that models the probability of a callback as a
function of unemployment duration, age, and interim job status as well as posting-specific
characteristics including skill level and education preference/requirement. This analysis first
uses both within- and between-posting variation in application characteristics. We choose
the logit model for several reasons. In principle, it should provide a better approximation of
the functional form for binary choice probabilities with a relative low incidence.15 Given the
canonical sample design of recent audit studies that provide random variation within post-
ings, a particular advantage of the logit model is that it provides a consistent approach that
allows us to obtain estimates for that rely on within-posting variation via the Chamberlain
(1980) fixed-effects logit model. Finally, the logit model allow us to contrast the fixed-effect
estimator with a random-effects logit estimator, which is our preferred specification.
       The random-effects model accounts for the fact that job postings are randomly drawn
from the underlying population and may differ in their mean callback rate. This model is
appropriate (yields consistent estimates) where the baseline variation across job postings
in their callback rates is uncorrelated with the observed applicant characteristics of inter-
est. Given our approach in sending resumes to job listings with key characteristics varying

  14
     While the findings in the literature pertain to a broader groups of job applicants, a particular note of
caution regarding the external validity of this interpretation is warranted. Employers for other more skilled
jobs may prefer to hire workers who are employed and so be willing to go through the difficulty and bear
the expense of attracting the employed.
  15
     We have reproduced the logit findings with linear probability and probit models, and the results are
not affected by the choice of functional form.



                                                     25
randomly, we would not expect the job-specific callback rate to be correlated with resume
characteristics so that estimates derived using the random-effects model should be consis-
tent. More generally, since the treatments were assigned independently to resumes, there is
no reason to expect that the multivariate analysis in general, and the conditional logit in
particular, will affect our main results.
       Table 13 presents the main results of our multivariate analysis of the probability of any-
callback. We report our findings in terms of odds ratios, which for small probabilities are
approximately the ratio of probabilities of callback given a treatment vs. a base condition.16
An odds ratio greater than one implies that the associated factor increases the likelihood of
a callback relative to the base group. Similarly, an odds ratio less than one implies that the
associated factor decreases the likelihood of a callback relative to the base group. The base
group in the table consists of applicants aged 27-52 with zero weeks unemployment and no
interim job.17
       The first column of table 13 presents results for the basic logit model with controls
for weeks of unemployment, age, and interim job status. These results confirm our earlier
univariate findings. Applicants with 52 weeks of unemployment have a significantly lower,
by about 19 percent, probability of a callback (odds ratio significantly less than one) than
applicants with less unemployment. There are no significant differences in callback rates
among the unemployment durations shorter than 52 weeks. Both the youngest (22-23 years
old) and oldest (60-61 years old) applicants have callback rates about 75-80 percent as large
as prime age applicants.18 Finally, holders of a lower-quality interim job have a 20 percent
lower probability of a callback while holders of a higher-quality interim job have about a 15
percent lower probability of callback.
       The logit model whose results are presented in column 2 of the table additionally includes
controls for characteristics of the job posting. These include indicators for the skill level of

  16
     Let p(1) ≡ P r{Callback = 1|X, D = 1} and p(0) ≡ P r{Callback = 1|X, D = 0}, where D represents
one of our right hand side dummy variables, and X represents the remaining variables in the model. Then
                                      p(1)/(1−p(1))
the odds ratio R is defined as R ≡ p(0)/(1−p(0))    = exp{βD }, where βD is the coefficient on D. Where the
                                                                                                 
probabilities involved are small, the odds ratio is approximately the ratio of probabilities p(1)
                                                                                              p(0) .

  17
     Given the earlier results on age, we simplified the estimation by combining the 27-28, 33-34, 42-43, and
51-52 year old applicants. There were no distinctions in callback rates among these groups. See tables 5 and
6.
  18
     As we noted earlier (see table 7 and supporting discussion), the lower callback rate for the youngest
applicants is due to the fact that these applicants have very low callback rates to jobs that require prior
experience. We explore this further below.

Note: Numbers in parentheses are asymptotic standard errors (clustered at the job-posting
level in columns 1 and 2). The base group consists of applicants with zero weeks unemploy-
ment, aged 27-52, and no interim job. The base group in columns 2 and 4 additionally is
characterized as a low-skill posting with high school education recommended/required and
zero experience recommended/required or no statement regarding experience.

the posted job, the stated educational recommendation/requirement, and the stated expe-
rience recommendation/requirement. Unlike the characteristics of the applicants, these are
characteristics of the job posting and, thus, have no within-posting variation. As expected,
none of the estimated odds ratios for our treatment variables (unemployment, age, interim
job) are affected in any meaningful way by inclusion of the job posting characteristics. The
likelihood of callback is not significantly related to the skill level of the posting or the stated
education level.19 However, the likelihood of callback is clearly higher for job postings with
a zero experience recommendation/requirement or no statement regarding experience.
       It is worth noting that the lower callback rate for the youngest applicants is unaffected
by controlling for the stated experience recommendation/requirement (column 2). However,
this specification constrains the effect of posted experience to be the same across applicant
age groups. We relax this constraint below in order to examine whether the lower callback
rate for very young applicants is due to the fact, noted above, that these applicants cannot
have much prior experience.
       Columns 3 and 4 of table 13 contain estimates of the random-effects logit versions of
the specifications in the first two columns of the table. The estimated within-posting cross-
observation correlation in the error (ρ̂ = 0.65, s.e. = 0.021) along with the substantial
improvement in the log-likelihood when accounting for the random effect strongly implies
that there are important posting-specific factors affecting callback rates. Given the similar
correlation of the unobserved posting-specific factors in column 4 of the table, it is clear
that these posting-specific factors go beyond the skill level of the posted job and the stated
required/recommended education and experience levels. This reflects the reality that differ-
ent employers have different callback rates. This is corroborated by the fact that fully 75
percent of our postings gave no callback to any of the 4 résumés submitted.
       The random-effects estimates of the parameters of interest are very similar to the standard
logit estimates and show the same patterns. This is to be expected given that the treatments
were assigned randomly to job postings. One small contrast is that the random-effects
estimates suggest that the youngest applicants are at an even larger disadvantage, with 22-
23 year old applicants having a callback rate about 40 percent lower than prime age workers.
Similarly, the interim job penalty in callback rates is larger in the random-effects model.

  19
      Note that statistical tests of signficance here use p-values based on a test of the hypothesis that the
estimated coefficient of the logit model is zero and not the test that the odds-ratio transformation of this
coefficient is significantly different from one.


                                                     28
       Finally, column 5 of table 13 contains the estimates of the Chamberlain fixed-effects logit
model. The sample is limited to the 1,936 applications to the 484 job posting where there
was variation in the outcome (1 to 3 callbacks). The 6,404 applications to the 1,601 postings
that received no callbacks and the 148 applications to the 37 postings that received four
callbacks are not included. As expected, given random assignment, the fixed-effect estimates
of the odds ratios are virtually identical to the random-effects estimates in column 3.
       Overall, the results in Table 13 confirm our main findings. First, there is no difference in
callback rates by weeks of unemployment for those unemployed 24 weeks or less. However,
applicants who were unemployed for 52 weeks did have a lower callback rate. Second, the
youngest (22-23) and oldest applicants (60-61) have lower callback rates than prime-age
applicants. Finally, holding an interim job, regardless of quality, at the time of application
results in lower callback rates.
       Next, we estimate the random-effects logit model of the probability of any-callback allow-
ing the effects of unemployment duration, and employment status at the time of application
to vary with age. We also take this opportunity to allow age differences in callback rates to
vary with the stated experience recommendations/requirements. This model is a less con-
strained version of the random-effects logit model in column 4 of table 13, and its estimates
are presented in table 14. The interpretation of this table requires a bit of explanation. All
estimates in the table are from the same logistic regression model. The first column of table
14 contains the odds ratios for the indicated category relative to a baseline consisting of ap-
plicants aged 27-52 with zero weeks unemployment and no interim job who have applied for
a low-skill posting with a high school education recommended/required and zero experience
recommend/required or no statement regarding experience. The estimates show that, at
baseline relative to prime age applicants (27-52), the youngest applicants (age 22-23) have a
marginally significantly lower likelihood of callback, and postings that recommend/require
a 4-year college degree have marginally significantly higher callback rates.
       The estimates in columns 2-4 of table 14 show the odds ratios separately by age category
for weeks of unemployment, interim job status, and the recommended/required experience
level relative to applicants at the baseline with zero weeks unemployment, no interim job,
and relative to postings zero experience recommended/required or no statement regarding
experience.20 These estimates allow us to examine whether the patterns we found earlier in

  20
     Note that the odds ratios in columns 2-4 are derived from underlying coefficient estmates that capture
the difference in the marginal effect for the interaction relative to the baseline group in column 1.

the relationships between the likelihood of callback and these treatments varies by age.
   A likelihood-ratio test, based on a comparison of the estimates of the relevant constrained
and unconstrained models, of the hypothesis that the effect of unemployment duration on
callback does not vary by age is marginally rejected at conventional levels (p-value = 0.048).
The estimates reported in table 3 and table 13 showed that applicants with 52 weeks un-
employment had lower callback rates than applicants with shorter unemployment spells but
that there were no differences in callback rates across the shorter spells. The estimates in
columns 2-4 of table 14 allow us to examine further whether this pattern varies by age of
applicant. These are the multivariate analog of the simple tabulations in table 8, and they
show a similar pattern. In every age group, those applicants with 52 weeks unemployment
have significantly lower callback rates than workers with shorter spells of unemployment, but

                                               30
there are no significant distinctions by duration of unemployment among applicants with less
than 52 weeks of unemployment. Hence, while our data does not reject that there are slght
variations in the effect of unemployment duration by age, there is no evidence here that
variation in the relationship between unemployment duration and callback rates by age can
account for the differences in results found in previous studies.
    The analogous likelihood-ratio test of the hypothesis that the effect of interim job status
on callback does not vary by age is not rejected (p-value = 0.84). The estimates reported
in table 9 and table 13 showed a negative relationship between the likelihood of callback
and holding an interim job of either lower or higher quality. The estimates in columns 2-4
of table 14 allow us to examine further whether this pattern varies by age of applicant.
These estimates confirm the negative relationship we reported earlier for the youngest and
prime-age applicants. However, there appears to be no relationship between the likelihood
of callback and interim job status for the oldest applicants.
    The multivariate analyses presented in table 13 constrained the effect of applicant age to
be constant across postings with different experience recommendations/requirements. This
is not consistent with our finding (table 7) that the youngest applicants had high callback
rates to jobs with little or no experience recommended/required and low callback rates to
jobs with more experience recommended/required. Table 14 contains the estimates of the
random-effects logit model without this constraint. Not surprisingly, a likelihood-ratio test
of the hypothesis that the effect of the stated experience recommendation/requirement on
callbacks does not vary by age is easily rejected at conventional levels (p-value = 0.004).
The estimates clearly show that odds of a callback are sharply lower as the experience
recommendation/requirement increases. This is not surprising, and it accounts for at least
part of the deficit in callback rates for the youngest applicants that we found in table 13.


5     Final Remarks
The rise and stubborn persistence of long-term unemployment after the Great Recession
has motivated a series of audit studies to investigate the determinants of successful job
applications. Those studies have generated a variety of results, some of which indicate that
age, duration of unemployment, and recent employment history might interact in important
ways to influence job application outcomes. To explore those interactions, we fielded a new
audit study varying treatments of unemployment duration, age, and the current employment


                                              31
status of the applicant.
   The results indicate duration dependence in callbacks only after very long spells of unem-
ployment. This contrasts our own previous findings (Farber et al. 2016, 2017) of no duration
dependence, and also contrasts with the results of Kroft et al. (2013) who found duration
dependence only in the first few months of unemployment. The results reported here are
closest to those in Eriksson and Rooth (2014), who found duration dependence of callback
rates only after nine months of unemployment.
   A simple model of employer learning suggests that older applicants may be at least
partially immunized against any stigmatizing effects of long unemployment spells due to
having a more substantial work history relative to younger applicants. This immunizing
effect of age has the potential to help explain the differing results among prior audit studies.
While we do find significant effects of age on callback rates, there is little evidence of an
important interaction between age and unemployment duration in the effect on the likelihood
of callback; we cannot reject a null hypothesis of no differences by age in the relationship
between unemployment duration and the callback rate. Thus, there is little reason to think
that differences in the age of applicants can explain the different results in previous studies.
   Our findings do, however, offer insight into a variety of prior results regarding callback
rates for the currently employed. Echoing elements of our prior study, Kroft et al. (2013),
and Nunley et al. (2017), we find that average callback rates are significantly higher for
the unemployed than for those holding an interim job. Importantly we show here that this
negative effect of employment holds regardless of the quality of the interim job, but obtains
only when applying to a relatively high-skilled position. These results, which indicate some
unappreciated challenges of on-the-job search, merit further investigation.
   More generally, the variation we observe in some of the qualitative conclusions of audit
studies with very similar designs suggests caution in interpreting their results as being gen-
erally applicable to other settings. It appears that seemingly small differences in markets,
occupations, résumé designs, and other factors can cause substantial differences in how call-
back rates vary in important dimensions. In this way, inference from audit studies would
seem to require more than the usual attention to replication and assessment of external
validity.

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing in response to your request for an Office Assistant / Business Administrator. The qualities,
education and experience I possess are perfectly suited for the position described, and I am sure I would
