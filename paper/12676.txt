EU countries closely regulate pharmaceutical prices whereas the U.S. does not. This paper shows how
price constraints affect the profitability, stock returns, and R&D spending of EU and U.S. firms. Compared
to EU firms, U.S. firms are more profitable, earn higher stock returns, and spend more on research
and development (R&D). Some differences have increased over time. In 1986, EU pharmaceutical
R&D exceeded U.S. R&D by about 24 percent, but by 2004, EU R&D trailed U.S. R&D by about
15 percent. During these 19 years, U.S. R&D spending grew at a real annual compound rate of 8.8
percent, while EU R&D spending grew at a real 5.4 percent rate. Results show that EU consumers
enjoyed much lower pharmaceutical price inflation, however, at a cost of 46 fewer new medicines
introduced by EU firms and 1680 fewer EU research jobs.

1. Introduction

       European Union (EU) countries closely regulate pharmaceutical prices in various

ways, while the United States (U.S.) does not. EU consumers clearly benefit because they

often pay lower prices than U.S. consumers for the same medicines. But few government

agencies or academic studies examine the less apparent costs of price regulation. One

exception is Campa and Hernando (2004), who show that EU mergers of regulated firms

produce significantly less value than mergers of unregulated firms. The EU also regulates

the conditions for acceptable mergers and acquisitions. Aktas, de Bondt, Levasseur, and

Schmitt (2001) and Aktas, de Bondt, and Roll (2004) show that these conditions

negatively affect the firms involved.

       Our paper studies how EU pharmaceutical price regulation affects EU firms

compared to U.S. firms, and the indirect costs to the EU. Although many pharmaceuticals

are sold worldwide, EU (U.S.) firms typically sell proportionately more in the EU (U.S.)

(see Vernon, 2005). The direct consequence of EU price regulation is that firms selling

more in the EU could be less profitable. An indirect consequence could be reduced

research and development (R&D) spending, fewer research jobs, and fewer new

medicines introduced by EU firms.

       The first part of this paper illustrates the average effects of EU price regulation on

EU firms compared to U.S. firms. We show that EU pharmaceutical firms are less

profitable, spend less on R&D, and earn smaller stock returns than U.S. firms. The EU

firms’ relatively poor profitability and stock returns are consistent with Doukas and

Switzer (1992), who show that profitability and stock prices are positively associated

with R&D spending. Reduced EU R&D spending and lower stock returns are costs borne




                                             3
by EU citizens because they imply fewer well-paid research jobs and lower wealth for

EU stockholders.

       The strength of this analysis is that it illustrates the costs and potential policy

implications of EU price regulation. Although policymakers may care little about

pharmaceutical stockholders’ low returns, they may be interested in the negative effects

that lower EU R&D spending has on high-tech employment and innovation. One

weakness of this analysis is that it compares average or aggregate figures for EU and U.S.

firms. This obscures some of the effects of EU price regulations. For example, some U.S.

(EU) firms could actually be more (less) affected by EU price regulations because they

happen to sell more (less) in the EU than in the U.S. Indeed, all firms selling

pharmaceuticals in the EU are somewhat affected by EU price regulation.

       The second part of the paper examines the general effects that EU regulation has

on pharmaceutical R&D spending by U.S. or EU firms. This issue could be studied easily

if most firms reported sales and R&D spending by geographic area. Unfortunately,

relatively few firms publicly report sales by geographic area, and almost none report

R&D expenses by geographic area. Our alternative approach relates each firm’s

standardized sales to pharmaceutical price indexes. These indexes capture the level of

price regulation in each geographic area over time. The relations between a firm’s sales

and these indexes capture the relative sensitivity of its sales to changes in the indexes.

Firm sensitivities are then cross-sectionally related to their average R&D spending. Firms

with greater sales sensitivity to the EU (U.S.) price index are expected to spend less

(more) on R&D.




                                            4
         The notion that firms subject to greater price controls would spend less on R&D

seems straightforward; however, few have studied this relation. One recent study by

Giaccotto, Santere, and Vernon (2005) shows that real U.S. pharmaceutical prices and

industry-level U.S. pharmaceutical R&D growth are positively related. Our results

support theirs using firm-level data from both U.S. and EU firms.

         The last part of the paper estimates the costs to the EU of price controls over the

last 19 years. We also project potential future costs for the EU, assuming that it retains its

current regulatory environment, and for the U.S., assuming that it adopts EU-type

regulation over time. Costs are estimated in terms of slower growth in R&D spending,

fewer research jobs, and fewer new medicines. We estimate these costs with a variety of

growth models. We acknowledge that price controls provide benefits to current

consumers, but focus on costs because they have received less attention from researchers

and policymakers.

         We project costs for the U.S. because EU-type price regulations are gaining

popular support. For example, many in the U.S. have called for large-scale reimportation

of pharmaceuticals from price-regulated countries like Canada (e.g., Dorgan-Snow U.S.

Senate Bill, S.334). Reimportation is an indirect method of price control which is similar

to European parallel trade.1 Other more direct forms of EU-type price regulation have

been proposed in the U.S., including several provisions in President Clinton’s Health

Security Act. In August 2006, California legislators passed the Prescription Drug



1
 Parallel trade is a more general term than reimportation because it refers to any product trade that occurs
after the original manufacturer sells the product. For example, product manufactured in Germany, sold to
an agent in Spain, and then resold by the agent in Spain to an agent in England is parallel trade.
Reimportation fits the more common situation in the U.S. where a U.S. manufacturer sells to a Canadian
agent, who then resells to another agent in the U.S.

Initiative, requiring manufacturers to discount pharmaceuticals by between 40 and 60

percent for low-income state residents.

       Our results show that EU policy has kept pharmaceutical price inflation equal to

average consumer price inflation over the last 19 years, with real costs of about $5 billion

in foregone R&D spending, 1680 fewer research jobs and 46 foregone new medicines.

Prospective long-horizon costs for the EU are estimated at between ten and 20 times

these costs, with potential U.S. costs about twice the EU’s long-horizon costs.

       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the difference between

U.S. and EU pharmaceutical price inflation. Section 3 compares U.S. and EU firms’

profitability, stock return performance, and R&D spending. Section 4 illustrates the

differences in U.S. and EU R&D spending growth over the 1986-2004 period using data

on U.S.-only and EU-only R&D spending. Section 5 tests the relation between

pharmaceutical pricing in the EU and U.S. and R&D spending. Section 6 translates the

observed slower growth of R&D spending into foregone R&D spending, fewer research

jobs, and fewer new medicines. Section 7 concludes the paper.



2.European and U.S. Pharmaceutical Prices



       EU pharmaceutical price regulations take various forms, and many countries use

more than one. Vernon (2003) describes the different forms adopted by each EU-

member. Most European countries have stated that their pharmaceutical policy goal is to

keep pharmaceutical price increases at or below the general rate of consumer price

inflation. Although this goal is politically attractive, economic efficiency could easily




                                             6
justify real pharmaceutical price increases because pharmaceutical demand rises more

than proportionately with income.

        U.S. pharmaceutical prices are relatively unregulated, but have not been immune

to political pressures. In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed a Health Security Act

that included regulations with the stated purpose of keeping pharmaceutical price

increases at or below average consumer price inflation. In response, 21 large

pharmaceutical firms pledged to keep price increases below average consumer price

inflation, perhaps as a way to preempt direct regulation.2

        One way to assess the degree to which European regulation or U.S. political

pressure have affected pharmaceutical prices is to compare real pharmaceutical price

indexes for the EU and U.S. Figure 1 illustrates real growth of pharmaceutical prices for

the U.S. and Europe from 1986 to 2004. For each year, the pharmaceutical price index is

divided by the consumer price index for all items, and these real index numbers are

compounded year to year, with 1986 as the base year.3

        Clearly, European regulations have effectively kept pharmaceutical prices from

rising faster than general consumer prices. Over the 19 year period, they never rose more

than a few percentage points faster than general consumer prices. In contrast, U.S. real

pharmaceutical prices increased in almost every year. Real price increases moderated

starting in 1993, around Clinton’s proposed price regulations (see Ellison and Mullin,

2001). Prices also moderated in 2000 and 2004, just before the presidential elections.

Tessoriero (2004) suggests that these price moderations reflect firms’ efforts to limit

political support for campaign platforms that include pharmaceutical price regulations.

The relative growth of U.S. pharmaceutical prices continues to be a political flashpoint,

however, much like high oil or utility prices.4

  A search of the Wall Street Journal for articles that discussed average pharmaceutical price inflation
compared to consumer price inflation produces only three articles from 1984 until 1992. Between 1992 and
1993, 12 such articles appeared, and from 1994 through 2005, 42 articles appeared.



                                                                                              8
3. EU versus U.S. Pharmaceutical Firms’ Profitability, Stock Returns, and R&D



         Given the EU’s restrictive price regulations, one would expect EU firms to be

more negatively affected than U.S. firms because proportionately more of their revenue is

likely to come from the EU. Unfortunately, few firms report comprehensive data on the

geographic distribution of firm sales. Compustat Segments database includes sales by

geographic area for firms that report it in their financial statements after 1997. Between

1998 and 2004, 43 (13) U.S. (EU) firms report separate U.S. and EU sales. These data

cover only about 40 percent of the firms in our sample. Nevertheless, they show that on

average U.S. (EU) firms generated 76 (53) percent of combined U.S. plus EU sales from

the U.S. This proportion is stable across years for the U.S. firms, with 76 percent in both

1998 and 2004, and only slight variations in other years. But the proportion for EU firms

increases consistently from 43 percent in 1998, to 57 percent in 2004. This illustrates how

EU firms’ sales have recently shifted toward the U.S., perhaps because the U.S. offered

better pricing than the EU during the period.

         Table 1 shows how EU firms’ profitability and R&D spending compares with that

of U.S. firms. To be included in this analysis, a firm had to have at least five years of data

in the Compustat Global Industrial/Commercial database between 1993 and 2004 (1993

is the first year available on the database). In addition, the firm must have sales equal to

at least ten percent of its assets. Because this study focuses on the effects of price

regulation on firm sales and R&D spending, we require that a firm has a minimal amount

of product sales.5 This condition is also important because each firm’s sales sensitivity to


5
  These filters tend to eliminate small and young firms with few sales. Because the following results are
size-weighted, including these firms has little effect on the results.


                                                     9
EU and U.S. price indexes must be estimated. All figures are translated into dollar

amounts using Compustat’s Currency database.

        Profitability is measured by operating income standardized by total firm assets

and the intensity of firm R&D is measured by R&D spending divided by total firm

assets.6 For each year, each firm’s profitability and R&D intensity is computed, and a

weighted average is calculated for U.S. and EU firms, respectively. The weight placed on

each U.S. (EU) firm’s profitability or R&D intensity equals the ratio of its total assets to

the total assets of all U.S. (EU) firms with data in the particular year.

        Table 1 shows that U.S. firms are more profitable than EU firms in each year

except 2003 and 2004. For the 1993-2004 period, U.S. firms averaged 17.1 percent

  We follow Eberhart, Maxwell, and Siddique (2004) who use assets to standardize R&D. Using sales to
standardize does not materially change the results.

profitability compared to 12.2 percent for EU firms. The 4.9 percentage point difference

is highly significant using a two-tailed t-test (t-stat = 6.85). U.S. firms have greater R&D

intensity in all years except 1995, 2003 and 2004. For the 1993-2004 period, U.S. firms

averaged 9.6 percent R&D intensity compared to 8.9 percent for EU firms. The 0.7

percent difference is significantly different from zero using a two-tailed t-test (t-stat =

2.07).

         These results show that U.S. firms surpass EU firms in average profitability and

R&D intensity, although this changed in 2003-2004. U.S. firms’ profitability has dropped

while that of EU firms has increased, perhaps because U.S. firms suppressed price

increases leading up to the 2004 elections, or because they faced increasing price

pressures from generic medicines and increased reimportation. This is consistent with

Figure 1 that shows that real pharmaceutical prices were flat in the U.S. during 2003-

2004, but increased in the EU.

         These measures are standardized by size (total assets). How do U.S. and EU firms

compare in terms of aggregate figures? Table 2 shows that U.S. firms have grown assets

and R&D spending faster than EU firms. Between 1993 and 2004, EU firms’ assets more

than doubled but U.S. firms’ more than quadrupled. U.S. R&D spending has grown 3.7

times over, while EU R&D has increased about 3.3 times.

         The U.S. and EU samples change year-to-year as new public firms enter the

industry and others liquidate or merge.7 To the extent that other sample firms purchase

these firms, the totals remain reasonable measures of total assets and R&D spending. Of

course, the geographic location of assets and R&D are not necessarily consistent with

these figures if there has been a relative switch from EU to U.S. for EU firms or vise

versa. We will consider this issue in the next section.




7
  The Compustat Global Industrial/Commercial data used for this table contains some errors that we have
corrected. The errors were contained in the EU firms’ data, perhaps because Compustat’s U.S. database has
been available for many years (since 1950) and its foreign portion of the Global database is relatively new
(since 1993). Figures for Aventis between 1999 and 2003 needed to be multiplied by 1000, as did
AstraZeneca’s figures for 1997. R&D figures for GlaxoSmithkline between 1993 and 1995 and Novo-
Nordisk in 1993 were incorrect due to typographical errors. All of these were changed based upon figures
found in the firms’ annual reports. Finally, the very large merger between Sanofi and Aventis in 2004
posed a unique problem. Instead of Compustat figures , which reflected merger-related accounting, we
simply used the firms’ combined 2003 figures for the combined firm in 2004. This likely understates the
true figures somewhat, but because the firm book a very large intangible asset to reflect the premium paid
for the merger, the reported figures are large enough to cause the EU totals to be substantially overstated.


                                                    12
       Another way to consider the effects of EU price regulation is to examine stock

return performance for EU firms compared to U.S. firms. Doukas and Switzer (1992)

show that stock prices respond favorably to R&D spending. If EU firms are not

comparatively disadvantaged by price regulation, then EU and U.S. pharmaceutical

stocks should perform comparably over time. Performance is measured by cumulative

total and risk-adjusted returns between 1993 and 2004 for market-value-weighed

portfolios of EU and U.S. stocks (for the same samples used in Tables 1 and 2). For each

full year of data available for a firm, its annual return is computed using prices and

dividends taken from Compustat’s Global Issues database. All prices and dividends are

translated into dollars using Compustat’s Global Currency database. Then for each year,

each EU firm’s return is weighted by its equity market value divided by the total equity

market value of all EU firms with returns in that year. These weighted returns are

summed for each year, and then the weighted-average returns are cumulated over the

1993 to 2004 period. Cumulative total returns for the portfolio of U.S. firms are

computed in the same way.

       Because the risk of EU and U.S. pharmaceutical stocks could differ, differences in

total returns could be due to risk differences. Therefore, we consider risk-adjusted returns

as well. The following single factor market model is used to estimate the annual risk-

adjusted returns for each firm.


       Rit =   i   + iRmt +   it   ,                                                (1)


where Rit is firm i’s stock return in year t, Rmt is the market return in year t represented

by the value-weighted Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (dollar return),




                                            13
 i   and                         i   are ordinary least squares coefficients for firm i, and        it   is the error term for firm

i in year t.

                                 Model 1 is estimated for each firm using its available annual returns. Then its

risk-adjusted return (RARi,t) in year t is computed using estimates of                                          i    and   i,t   from (1)

as;



                                 RARi ,t = αˆ i + εˆi ,t .                                                                       (2)



Like total returns, risk-adjusted returns are value-weighted and cumulated over 1993 to

2004 for portfolios of EU and U.S. firms’ stocks, respectively. The cumulative total and

risk adjusted returns series for EU and U.S. portfolios are plotted together in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. Total Dollar-Denominated Returns and Risk-Adjusted Returns for Market-Value

Weighted Portfolios of U.S. and EU Pharmaceutical Stocks for 1993-2004



        Figure 2 helps illustrate the effects of price controls on pharmaceutical stock

prices. Between 1993 and 1997, U.S. and EU pharmaceutical stocks performed

comparably. This is consistent with the pattern in the price indexes, which was flat for

both the U.S. and the EU. U.S. prices rise in 1998 and 1999, while EU price remain flat.

This is also when U.S. stocks start to outperform EU stocks on a total return and risk-

adjusted return basis. U.S. stocks maintain or expand their performance lead up until

2004, when EU stocks narrow the gap. Note that 2004 is also when the EU price index

increases substantially more than the U.S. index.

        Looking back at Table 2, one can see a similar pattern in R&D spending, where

U.S. firms substantially increase R&D spending compared to EU firms in 1998, but the

reverse occurs in 2004. After computing the difference in the U.S. and EU price indexes,

we related these figures to the differences between U.S. and EU stock returns. The

correlation over 1993-2004 between the U.S.-EU price index differences and the total

return (risk-adjusted) differences is 0.93 (0.94), highly statistically significant. The

correlation between U.S.-EU pharmaceutical price change differences and U.S.-EU R&D

intensity differences is 0.64, also statistically significant. U.S.-EU R&D intensity

differences are also significantly related to U.S.-EU profitability differences (correlation

is 0.82).

        Although attributing causality is always difficult, these correlations support an

association between pharmaceutical price control differences and R&D spending




                                            15
differences. And these R&D spending differences appear to lead to stock return

differences, consistent with Doukas and Switzer (1992) findings. Indeed, the levels of

returns are high for both U.S. and EU pharmaceutical stock, perhaps because they both

spend heavily on R&D. But when pharmaceutical prices expand faster for one geographic

area, firms in that area tend to spend more on R&D, and their stocks benefit.



4. U.S.-EU R&D Growth Differences



        A weakness of the Compustat Global data is that it includes only publicly

reported data. Another problem is that firms report total R&D spending, not spending by

geographic area. Finally, total R&D spending can include R&D spent by non-

pharmaceutical divisions of the firm (although most produce primarily pharmaceuticals).

        Two other data sources avoid these potential problems. The European Federation

of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) has collected European R&D

spending data from its members since 1986.8 The Pharmaceutical Research and

Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) has collected U.S. R&D spending data from its

members since 1970.

        These two associations include most major pharmaceutical firms (both U.S. and

EU firms), hence, their data provides a reasonable picture of pharmaceutical R&D

spending in the U.S. and EU. They provide aggregate data only. For privacy reasons, they

do not release firm-level data. The advantage of the data is that EFPIA’s (PhRMA’s)

members report not only their total R&D, but also their EU-specific (U.S.-specific) R&D.


8
 EFPIA member association include those in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and U.K.


                                                16
Furthermore, EFPIA translates R&D figures reported by its members from their domestic

currencies into Euros. We convert the Euro figures to dollars.

       Figure 3 illustrates the magnitude and the timing of changes in pharmaceutical

R&D spending in Europe and the U.S. R&D spending in Europe exceeded U.S. spending

by about 24 percent in 1986 ($4790 vs $3875), but by 2004, European spending trailed

U.S. spending by about 15 percent ($26725 vs. $30644). U.S. R&D spending does not

outgrow European spending in every year, however. For example, in 1994 and 1995,

European R&D growth exceeds U.S. growth (perhaps due to the Clinton administration’s

proposed pharmaceutical price constraints).

          Like Table 2, Figure 3 shows that EU R&D spending stalls in 1997 and 2001.

U.S. R&D spending grows throughout the period including in 2004. Table 2 shows a

decline in 2004 U.S. R&D spending. At least part of the explanation for the differences

between figures in Table 2 and Figure 3 is that there are shifts in R&D spending from the

EU to the U.S., or vice versa.

          There is anecdotal evidence that EU firms have recently shifted some R&D

spending from the EU to the U.S. Consider that in 1990, European firms spent 73 percent

of their R&D in Europe and 26 percent in the U.S. By 2002, they spent 58 percent in

Europe and 34 percent in the U.S.9 Major European firms have moved their research or

operational headquarters to the U.S., including Pharmacia in 1995, Aventis in 1999,

GlaxoSmithKline in 2000, and Novartis in 2002. Reasons given for these moves include

growing U.S. sales compared to EU sales, and requirements that they perform clinical

trials in the U.S., particularly FDA phase three trials. U.S.-based trials also establish

relationships with top U.S. physicians who set prescription guidelines for other

          Firms may be affected in different ways and at different times, but we argue that

EU price regulations have had substantial cumulative effects. One case where public data

is available illustrates the direct connection between regulation and EU R&D spending.

Spain and France set a price for Bayer’s second best-selling drug (Adalat) 40 percent

below its price in England. When Bayer restricted supply to French and Spanish

wholesalers who were reselling their supplies in England, the European Commission

fined Bayer 3 million Euros in 1996, and ordered them to stop restricting supply. World-

wide sales of Adalat, which had been growing strongly, subsequently fell by four (three)

percent in 1998 (1999), mostly due to French and Spanish wholesalers reselling Adalat at

relatively low prices. As a consequence, Bayer cut its European R&D spending by one

percent in 1998 and by 14 percent in 1999. Conversely, Bayer increased its U.S. R&D

spending by eight percent in 1998 and by 31 percent in 1999.10 Bayer may have expected

the U.S. legal system to better protect their rights to control product distribution.

        Some U.S. government data on foreign firms’ pharmaceutical R&D spending in

the U.S. shows that their spending grew from $6.2 billion in 1999 to $7.9 billion in 2003.

Conversely, U.S. firms foreign pharmaceutical R&D grew from only $2.8 billion in 1999

to $3.2 billion in 2002.11 The R&D data are not broken down by country but the Bureau

of Economic Analysis reports U.S. pharmaceutical assets held by foreign firms broken

down by country. European nations accounted for between 80 and 90 percent of these

assets during 1999-2003.

        These data show that foreign firms do much more pharmaceutical R&D spending

in the U.S. than U.S. firms do abroad. Furthermore, foreign firms’ U.S. R&D is growing

faster. Therefore, Table 2 shows a smaller difference between U.S. and EU R&D than

Figure 3 because the table does not pick up the fact that EU firms spend a much larger

portion of their R&D in the U.S. than U.S. firms spend in the EU.

        One problem with comparing figures adjusted for exchange rates is that exchange

rates can change significantly year-to-year, distorting the relative growth in R&D in

  The data on foreign firms’ U.S. pharmaceutical R&D spending comes from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. See “Selected Data by Industry” under Foreign Direst Investment in the U.S.: Financial and
Operating Data for U.S. Affiliates of Foreign Multinational Companies
(www.bea.gov/bea/di/di1fdiop.htm). The data on assets can be found at the same place under “Assets by
Industry and Country. These data are available starting in 1999. The data on U.S. firms’ foreign
pharmaceutical R&D spending comes from tables titled “Company R&D Performed Outside the United
States by Industry” at www.nsf.gov/statistics/iris. Data for 2002 is the latest available.

particular years. Perhaps a better way to compare the relative progress of U.S. and

European R&D spending is to construct real growth rates for each series in dollars and

Euros, respectively, and ignore exchange rates. Over a long period, relative changes in

exchange rates will appear in relative inflation rates so that adjusting nominal R&D

growth rates for domestic inflation provides smoother, more comparable series.

       Figure 4 shows the smoothed time paths of R&D growth, making trends and

average differences clearer. It plots the average annual compound real R&D spending

growth rates for the U.S. and Europe. The growth rates are based on the same PhRMA

and EFPIA data, except that EU figures remain in Euros. Real growth is nominal growth

deflated by the CPI percent change for the same year. Each year’s observation is the

average annual real R&D growth for the years up to and including that year. The figure

highlights two significant features of the data. First, both U.S. and EU R&D spending

growth rates are trending down. The average real growth rates for the first five years of

the period compared to the last five years were 9.9% versus 7.6% for the U.S., and 6.6%

versus 2.8% for Europe. This could be due to the effects of increasing political pressures

in the U.S. and regulatory pressures in the EU.

percentage points per year over the full 1987 to 2004 period. Over long periods of time

such as this, there can be considerable cumulative effects of spending differences on the

number of new pharmaceutical products developed in the EU versus the U. S. Indeed,

EFPIA reports that between 1987 and 1991, European firms introduced 101 new

medicines while U.S. firms introduced 54. But between 2000 and 2004, European firms

introduced 57 new medicines while U.S. firms introduced 70.12

5. Linking Real Pharmaceutical Price Inflation to Firms’ R&D Spending



       We wish to test the cross-sectional relation between EU price regulations and

R&D spending at the firm-level. Real pharmaceutical prices are used as a proxy for the

effects of price regulations and political pressure in the U.S. and EU over time. Giaccotto,

Santere, and Vernon (2005) find a statistically significant positive relation between U.S.

industry-level R&D spending and real U.S. pharmaceutical prices. We implement our test

using a two-stage process. In the first stage, we estimate the following regression for each

firm in our samples of U.S. and EU firms.



(Sales/Assets)i,t = b0 + bi,1(U.S. Price index)t + bi,2(EU Price Index)t +      i,t   ,     (3)



where (Sales/Assets)i,t is the ratio of sales to total assets for firm i in year t, (U.S. Price

index)t and (EU Price Index)t are the U.S. and EU real pharmaceutical price indexes in

year t, respectively,   i,t   is an error term for firm i in year t, and b0, b1, and b2 are ordinary

least squares regression coefficients.

       The regression coefficients bi,1 and bi,2 are used to measure the sensitivity of a

firm’s sales to U.S. and EU price indexes, respectively. Firm sales are standardized by

assets to account for firm size and currency differences. All else equal, faster real prices

increases should increase sales faster than assets, assuming that real pharmaceutical price

changes do not affect the real cost of production facilities. We expect firms whose sales

are more sensitive to U.S. (EU) pharmaceutical prices to spend more (less) on R&D. To

test this hypothesis, we use the following regression.




                                                   22
(mean R&D/Assets)i = β0 + β1( bˆi ,1 ) + β2( bˆi , 2 ) +           i,                                            (4)




where (mean R&D/Assets)i is the mean of firm i’s ratio of R&D spending to total assets

over the years for which it has Compustat data between 1993 to 2004, bˆi ,1 and bˆi , 2 are

coefficient estimates from (3) that measure firm i’s sales sensitivity to U.S. and EU price

indexes, respectively, β0, β1, and β2 are coefficients, and                            i   is an error term. The

hypothesis implies that β1> 0 and β2 < 0. That is, the more sensitive a firm’s sales are to

the U.S. (EU) price index, the greater its R&D spending.13

            Table 3 reports the regression results. Note that both U.S. and EU firms are

pooled for this analysis. As predicted, β̂1 > 0 and β̂ 2 < 0. These estimates support a

significant positive (negative) relation between a firm’s sales sensitivity to U.S. (EU) real

prices and mean R&D spending intensity.




13
     Because the independent variables ( bˆi ,1 and   bˆi , 2 ) are measured with error, the estimates of   1   and    2

could be biased. Greene (1990) shows that when one independent variable is measured with error, its
estimate is biased toward zero, but when more than one independent variable is measured with error, the
bias depends on a number of parameters. To the extent that the estimates are biased toward zero, the tests
for statistical significance are conservative.

6. EU Price Regulation and the Long-term Costs of Slower R&D Spending



       In this section we estimate the potential costs of European-style pharmaceutical

price regulations in terms of foregone new medicines and research jobs. We rely on the

R&D growth figures observed in Figure 4. Both U.S. and EU R&D spending are growing

slower, with EU spending growing comparatively slower than U.S. spending.

Consequently, the total of U.S. and EU new medicines introduced fell from 155 between

1987 and 1991, to 127 between 2000 and 2004. This illustrates that while EU firms are

most affected by EU regulations, U.S. firms are also affected. U.S. political pressure

probably affects both groups as well. Indeed, six of the 21 firms that agreed to constrain

their prices in response to Clinton’s proposed Health Security Act were EU firms.

       Vernon (2005) provides a detailed quasi-structural model and robust empirical

model of pharmaceutical R&D investment that shows that European-like pharmaceutical

regulation in the U.S. would lead to a one-time R&D decline of between 23.4 and 32.7




                                             24
percent. Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon (2005) found similar one-time effects using a

very different estimation method. But rather than a one-time decline, R&D spending

would likely grow slower as stricter regulations are adopted over time. Even at low

prices, some relatively-promising new R&D projects and late-stage projects would

continue to be funded.

       We analyze the impact of R&D growth declines with three related models. The

models are used to compute the present value of R&D expenditures under different R&D

growth assumptions. They provide estimates of cumulative effects on R&D spending

over various time periods. The first is used to model an R&D growth drop from its

current fixed long-term rate, to a new lower long-term rate. The model is:



           RDt +1
PVRDt =            ,                                                          (5)
          (k − g )



where RDt+1 is pharmaceutical R&D spending in year t+1, PVRDt is the present value of

future pharmaceutical R&D spending, k is the discount rate associated with R&D

spending flows, and g is the constant future growth of R&D spending.

       The second model is used to evaluate and compare R&D spending over shorter

periods of time. The model is:



                       (1 + g s ) n
          RDt +1 1 −
                        (1 + k ) n
PVRDt =                               ,                                       (6)
                 (k − g s )




                                            25
where gs is the short-term growth in R&D spending from year t through year n,

       The third model covers a long time period but assumes that growth falls to a

moderate rate for n years and then falls again to a new long-term rate. The model is:



                       (1 + g s ) n
           RDt +1   1−
                        (1 + k ) n            RDn +t +1
PVRDt =                               +                          ,                 (7)
                    (k − g s )            (k − g L )(1 + k ) n



where RDn+t+1 is R&D spending in year n+t+1, and gL is the long-term growth in R&D

spending starting in year n+t+1 and continuing forever.

       We use the real growth rates observed in the data above for these models. The

Appendix shows how Vernon’s (2005) one-time R&D spending decline relates to R&D

growth declines. Estimates of the real discount rate (k) for pharmaceutical industry cash

flows are found in DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski (2003), Myers and Shyam-Sunder

(1996), and Grabowski and Vernon (1990) and range from nine to 11 percent. We will

use a ten percent rate in the following analysis.

       We estimate the costs of slower real R&D spending growth in terms of the present

value of real R&D spending foregone, and then translate real R&D foregone into fewer

new medicines and scientists employed. To translate real R&D spending foregone into

new medicines foregone, we use two estimates of the present value of R&D cost per new

medicine. The first estimate reported in DiMasi, Hansen, Grabowski, and Lasagna (1991)

of about $114 million in 1987 dollars ($108.6 in 1985 dollars) is used to estimate new

medicines foregone by the EU during our sample period of 1986-2004. The second

estimate reported in DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski (2003) of about $403 million in



                                                       26
2000 dollars ($439 million in 2004 dollars) is used to estimate new medicines foregone

by the EU and the U.S. for all future years.

        To translate real R&D spending foregone into pharmaceutical scientist jobs

foregone, we use National Science Foundation figures that show R&D expenditures per

R&D employee in the Pharmaceuticals and Medicine Manufacturing industry (NAICS

3254) was $225,693 in 2001 (in constant 1996 dollars).14 The Bureau of Labor Statistics

reports that medical scientists in the industry earned about $77,000 in wages ($36.92 per

hour median wage).15 Given that other compensation is likely to be at least half the cost

of wages, then total employee compensation is about half of the $225,693 spent on R&D

per R&D employee. We use $112,846 (in 1996 dollars) in the computations below.16

        Table 4 presents estimated costs of EU-type regulation under three different

scenarios. First are the costs to the EU of price regulation already incurred during the

1986-2004 period. Model (6) is used in this case. The second and third are the

prospective costs to the EU and the U.S. of price regulation in the future. Models (5) and

(7) are used to estimate prospective costs for the EU and the U.S., respectively

   Data on the distribution of R&D expenditures in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries across
labor and non-labor inputs is not typically available in firms’ financial statements. We searched the
financial statements filed on the SEC’s EDGAR database for those that discussed their labor inputs, and
labor was mentioned as at least a majority of R&D expenses. We conducted a limited analysis of “pure
play” biotechnology firms with R&D expenditure and labor expense data listed on Compustat. These firms
had little or no revenue from marketed products so they were solely research firms. Under reasonable
assumptions about the distribution of labor expense between R&D and non-R&D employees, labor
represents close to 90 percent of their R&D expenses.

       For the first scenario, foregone European R&D spending is estimated by

comparing PVRD calculated using Europe’s actual 1987-2004 annual real R&D growth

(5.4%), to PVRD assuming that EU growth of 6.6% between 1987 and 1991 could have

been maintained if regulations were more comparable to the U.S. Note that U.S. annual

real R&D growth during the period averaged considerably more; about 8.8 percent. Some

of that growth probably reflects a shift of R&D spending by EU firms from the EU to the




                                          28
U.S. Given this, a 6.6 percent EU growth under U.S.-type pricing condition seems

reasonable.

       The costs for this scenario are $4.96 billion EU R&D foregone during 1986-2004,

which would have produced 46 new medicines and 31,925 job years. This is equivalent to

1680 EU research jobs for the 19 years. These figures are reasonable in light of the fact

that EU firms actually introduced 101 new medicines between 1987 and 1991, but 44 less

between 2000 and 2004. Of course, one could argue that some of the EU R&D spending

foregone was partly reallocated and spent in the U.S. Indeed, for the same comparison

periods, the U.S. experienced an increase of 16 new products. Assuming that these were

derived from R&D spending transferred from Europe still leaves 28 foregone medicines

on net for the five years. Extrapolating over the 19 year period, this is equivalent to about

106 foregone new medicines. Hence 46 new medicines foregone could be an

underestimate.

       The second scenario estimates future long-term foregone European R&D

spending by comparing PVRD calculated using Europe’s most recent five-year (2000-

2004) average annual real R&D growth (2.8%), to PVRD assuming average EU growth

over 1986-2004 (5.4%). Costs for this scenario, of course, are much larger because the

growth difference is larger and all future years are covered. Forgone future R&D is

estimated at $280.78 billion in 2004 dollars. This is equivalent to 526 new medicines

foregone and 1,035,953 lost job years.

       The third scenario estimates future long-term foregone U.S. R&D spending.

Assuming that the U.S. adopts EU-type price regulation gradually over the 19 years

starting in 2005, we project that U.S. real growth will be comparable to the EU’s 5.4




                                             29
percent average real growth rate during 1986-2004. After 19 years, the same long-term

real growth rate assumed for the EU (2.8%) is adopted for the U.S. PVRD based upon

this two-stage growth decline is compared to PVRD estimated using a constant 6.6

percent future growth rate. Forgone future R&D is estimated at $427.40 billion in 2004

dollars. This is equivalent to 974 new medicines foregone and 1,578,081 lost job years.

       Costs estimated in scenarios two and three may seem large, but they represent

annual R&D growth rate declines of only a few percentage points at most. The gradual

accumulation of costs may not produce the political response that a large one-time drop

of 20-30 percent would cause. But the growing gap between EU and U.S. pharmaceutical

R&D, and the movement of R&D facilities to the U.S. by EU firms, should be a signal to

EU policymakers that low pharmaceutical prices through regulation has its costs.



7. Conclusion



       This paper illustrates how the gap between U.S. and European pharmaceutical

R&D spending has changed over the 19 years from 1986 through 2004. Europe outspent

the U.S. by about 24 percent in 1986, but by 2004, the U.S. was outspending Europe by

about 15 percent. From 2000 to 2004, U.S. spending grew at a 6.6% rate compared to

2.8% for Europe. If this growth difference persists for another five years, U.S. R&D

spending will exceed Europe’s by 37%.

       The implicit cost in terms of new medicines foregone is large. If European R&D

spending had grown at 6.6% over the last 19 years instead of its actual 5.4% rate, about

46 new medicines would have been produced. R&D growth has trended down for both




                                           30
the U.S. and Europe, but the gap in growth rates between the U.S. and Europe has

remained quite stable at about 3.4 percent. The general downward trend could reflect

weaker real price increases in the U.S. since 1992 and no real price increase in Europe

throughout. Threatened or actual pharmaceutical price regulation could account for this

weaker price growth and, consequently, weaker R&D growth.

       Slower R&D growth as a consequence of price regulation and reimportation may

be politically acceptable because current consumer benefit, but we show that the cost to

future generations is substantial. European-type policies adopted in the U.S. could lead to

974 fewer new medicines and 1,578,081 lost job years in the future. Because new

medicines improve health and extend lives (see Lichtenberg 1996, 2003), these policies

essentially trade off the health and employment opportunities of future generations for

cost savings for current pharmaceutical consumers.

        Vernon’s (2005) one-time decline of between 23.4 and 32.7 percent in R&D

spending due to European-like regulation might seem large, but model (5) can be used to

show that a relatively small R&D growth rate decline can produce the same result. To see

this, use (5) assuming a one-time drop in R&D spending of          and equate it to (5)

assuming a decrease in R&D spending growth of .



(1 − α ) RDt +1       RDt +1
                =                                                               (1A)
   (k − g )       (k − (1 − λ ) g )



This implies that



     α (k − g )
λ=                                                                              (2A)
     (1 − α ) g



We compute        from (2A) using expected future U.S. R&D real growth rates between 8%

and 6%.

       Assuming a one-time R&D spending decrease of 30%, Table 1A shows that the

equivalent change in R&D spending growth is proportionately smaller in all cases except

for one. The average value of   is 18 percent. For example, this means that if expected

real R&D spending growth is 7% and the real discount rate is 10%, then European-like

price regulation would decrease growth from 7% to 5.7%. Given that European real R&D

spending growth fell from 6.6% to 2.8% during 1987 to 2004, Vernon’s predicted one-

time decrease for U.S. spending could be an underestimate.
