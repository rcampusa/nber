Options-Pricing Formula with Disaster Risk

JEL No. E44,G12,G13

                                              ABSTRACT

A new options-pricing formula applies to far-out-of-the money put options on the overall stock market
when disaster risk is the dominant force, the size distribution of disasters follows a power law, and
the economy has a representative agent with Epstein-Zin utility. In the applicable region, the elasticity
of the put-options price with respect to maturity is close to one. The elasticity with respect to exercise
price is greater than one, roughly constant, and depends on the difference between the power-law tail
parameter and the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥. The options-pricing formula conforms with
data from 1983 to 2015 on far-out-of-the-money put options on the U.S. S&P 500 and analogous indices
for other countries. The analysis uses two types of data‚Äîindicative prices on OTC contracts offered
by a large financial firm and market data provided by OptionMetrics, Bloomberg, and Berkeley Options
Data Base. The options-pricing formula involves a multiplicative term that is proportional to the disaster
probability, p. If Œ≥ and the size distribution of disasters are fixed, time variations in p can be inferred
from time fixed effects. The estimated disaster probability peaks particularly during the recent financial
crisis of 2008-09 and the stock-market crash of October 1987.

       We derive a new options-pricing formula that applies when disaster risk is the dominant

force, when the size distribution of disasters is characterized by a power law, and when the

economy has a representative agent with Epstein-Zin utility with a constant coefficient of

relative risk aversion. Specifically, we consider far-out-of-the-money put options on the overall

stock market, corresponding empirically to the S&P 500 in the United States and analogous

indices for other countries. The pricing formula applies when the option is sufficiently far out of

the money (operationally, a relative exercise price or moneyness of 0.9 or less) and when the

maturity length is not too long (operationally, up to 6 months).

       In the prescribed region, the elasticity of the put-options price with respect to maturity is

close to one. The elasticity with respect to the exercise price is greater than one, roughly

constant, and depends on the difference between the power-law tail parameter, denoted Œ±, and

the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥. (This difference has to be positive for various rates of

return not to blow up.)

       The options-pricing formula involves a multiplicative term that is proportional to the

disaster probability, p, measured per year. This term depends also on three other parameters: Œ≥,

Œ±, and the threshold disaster size, z0. If these three parameters are fixed, the variations over time

in the multiplicative term reveal the time variations in p. The estimation of the time series for p

can then be carried out through standard fixed effects for calendar time. However, a full analysis

requires amendments to the options-pricing formula to allow for time-varying p.

       We show that the theoretical formula conforms with data from 1983 to 2015 on far-out-

of-the-money put options on the U.S. S&P 500 and analogous indices over shorter periods for

other countries. Our analysis relies on two types of data‚Äîindicative prices on over-the-counter

(OTC) contracts offered to clients by a large financial firm and market data provided by




                                                                                                       2
OptionMetrics, Bloomberg, and Berkeley Options Data Base. A key advantage of the OTC

source is its provision of a rich array of contracts by exercise price and maturity. In particular,

the relative exercise price goes down to 0.5, and the maturity can be 12 months or more. A

downside of these data is that the reported prices do not necessarily correspond to actual trades.

An advantage of the market data is the correspondence with actual trades, but there are problems

with stale prices and sizes of bid-ask spreads. The most serious disadvantage of these data is the

limited information on far-out-of-the-money options, which rarely trade. The market data (and

trades) are also concentrated on short maturities; for example, about half of the OptionMetrics

contracts have maturity of two months or less. In any event, we find that the main results are

similar from the two types of data sources.

       Extensions of the empirical analysis would allow for second-order terms. These terms

involve the possibility of multiple disasters, the presence of a diffusion term, allowances for

discounting and expected growth, and the potential for default on options contracts. We think

that the most important extension, stressed in Seo and Wachter (2015), involves the effects on

stock-options prices from potentially changing disaster probabilities.


I. Baseline Disaster Model and Previous Results

       We use a familiar setup based on rare-macroeconomic disasters, as developed in Rietz

(1988) and Barro (2006, 2009). The model is set up for convenience in discrete time. Real

GDP, Y, is generated from


       (1)             log(Yt+1) = log(Yt) + g + ut+1 + vt+1,


where, g‚â•0 is the deterministic part of growth, ut+1 (the diffusion term) is an i.i.d. normal shock

with mean 0 and variance œÉ2, and vt+1 (the jump term) is a disaster shock. Disasters arise from a




                                                                                                      3
Poisson process with probability of occurrence p per period. When a disaster occurs, GDP falls

by the fraction b, where 0<b‚â§1. The distribution of disaster sizes is time invariant. (The

baseline model includes disasters but not bonanzas.) This jump-diffusion process for GDP is

analogous to the one posited for stock prices in Merton (1976, equations [1]-[3]). 1

           In the underlying Lucas (1978)-tree model, which assumes a closed economy, no

investment, and no government purchases, consumption, Ct, equals GDP, Yt. The implied

expected growth rate of C and Y is given, if the period length is very short, by


           (2)              g* = g + (1/2)‚àô œÉ2 ‚Äìp‚àôEb,


where Eb is the mean of b. In this and subsequent formulas, we use an equal sign, rather than

approximately equal, when the equality holds as the period length shrinks to zero.

           The representative agent has Epstein-Zin/Weil utility, 2 as in Barro (2009):

                                           1‚àíùúÉ                                   1‚àíùúÉ
                                          (      )             1                (      )
           (3)              [(1 ‚àí ùõæ)ùëàùë° ] 1‚àíùõæ = ùê∂ùë°1‚àíùúÉ + ÔøΩ1+ùúåÔøΩ ‚àô [(1 ‚àí ùõæ)ùê∏ùë° ùëàùë°+1 ] 1‚àíùõæ ,


where Œ≥>0 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ∏>0 is the reciprocal of the intertemporal-

elasticity-of-substitution (IES) for consumption, and œÅ>0 is the rate of time preference. As

shown in Barro (2009) (based on Giovannini and Weil [1989] and Obstfeld [1994]), with i.i.d.

shocks and a representative agent, the attained utility ends up satisfying the form:

                                         1‚àíùõæ
           (4)              ùëàùë° = ùõ∑ ‚àô ùê∂ùë°        /(1 ‚àí ùõæ),

where the constant ùõ∑>0 depends on the parameters of the model. Using equations (3) and (4),

the first-order condition for optimal consumption over time follows from a perturbation

argument as

                                    ùë°                                     ùê∂ùë°



where Rt+1 is the gross rate of return on any available asset from time t to time t+1. When Œ≥=Œ∏‚Äî

the familiar setting with time-separable power utility‚Äîthe term on the left-hand side of

equation (5) equals one.

        The process for C and Y in equation (1) implies, if the period length is very short:

                        ùê∂ùë°+1 1‚àíùõæ                                                           1
        (6)      ùê∏ùë° (       )      = 1 + (1 ‚àí ùõæ)ùëî ‚àí ùëù + ùëù ‚àô ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)1‚àíùõæ + (2)(1 ‚àí ùõæ)2 ùúé 2 .
                         ùê∂ùë°



This condition can be used along with equation (5) to price various assets, including a risk-free

bond and an equity claim on a perpetual flow of consumption (that is, the Lucas tree). The

constant risk-free interest rate is, if the period length is short:

                                                       ùõæ‚àíùúÉ                                     1‚àíùúÉ   1

        Let Pt be the price at the start of period t of an unlevered equity claim on the Lucas tree.

Let Vt be the dividend-price ratio; that is, the ratio of Pt to consumption, Ct. In the present model

with i.i.d. shocks, Vt equals a constant, V. (This condition implies that the growth rate of Pt

equals the growth rate of Ct.) The reciprocal of V equals the constant dividend-price ratio and

can be determined from equations (5) and (6), if the period length is short, to be:

       1                                   1‚àíùúÉ                                                 1‚àíùúÉ   1

                                                                                                         5
            The constant expected rate of return on equity, re, is the sum of the dividend yield, 1/V,

and the expected rate of capital gain on equity, which equals g*, the expected growth rate of the

dividend (consumption). Therefore, re is the same as equation (8) except for the elimination of

the term -g*. 3 The constant equity premium is given from equations (8) and (9) by:


            (9)                ùëü ùëí ‚àí ùëü ùëì = ùõæùúé 2 + ùëù ‚àô [ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)‚àíùõæ ‚àí ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)1‚àíùõæ ‚àí ùê∏ùëè].


In equation (9), we can think of the rates of return; the variance, œÉ2, of the diffusion process; and

the disaster (jump) probability, p, as all measured per year.

            The diffusion term, Œ≥œÉ2, in equation (9) is analogous to the expression for the equity

premium in Mehra and Prescott (1985) and is negligible compared to the observed average

equity premium if Œ≥ and œÉ2 take on empirically reasonable values. For many purposes‚Äî

including the pricing of far-out-of-the-money stock options‚Äîthis term can be ignored.

            The disaster or jump term in equation (9) is proportional to the disaster probability, p.

The expression in brackets that multiplies p depends on the size distribution of disasters, b, and

the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥. The overall disaster term was calibrated in

Barro (2006) and Barro and Ursua (2012) by using the long-term history of macroeconomic

disasters for up to 40 countries to pin down p and the distribution of b. The resulting term

accords roughly with an observed average (unlevered) equity premium of 0.04-0.05 per year if Œ≥

is around 3-4.

II. Pricing Stock Options

       A. Setup for pricing options

       We now discuss the pricing of stock options within our model, which fits into the class of

jump-diffusion models. Options pricing within this general class goes back to Merton (1976)

and Cox and Ross (1976). The use of prices of far-out-of-the-money put options to infer disaster

probabilities was pioneered by Bates (1991). This idea has been applied recently by, among

others, Bollerslev and Todorov (2011); Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011); Seo and Wachter

(2015); and Siriwardane (2015).

       We derive a pricing solution for far-out-of-the-money put options under the assumption

that disaster events (i.e. jumps) are the dominant force to consider. Key underlying conditions

for the validity of the solution are that the option be sufficiently far out of the money and that the

maturity not be too long. Under these conditions, we derive a simple pricing formula that

reflects the underlying Poisson nature of disaster events, combined with the assumed power-law

distribution for the sizes of disasters. This formula generates testable hypotheses‚Äîwhich we

subsequently test‚Äîon the relation of put-options prices to maturity and exercise price. The

formula also allows, if some key parameters can be treated as constants, for a straightforward

time-fixed-effects procedure to back out a time series for disaster probability.

       Consider a put option on equity in the Lucas tree. To begin, suppose that the option has a

maturity of one period and can be exercised only at the end of the period (a European option).

The exercise price or strike on the put option (that is, the price at which one can sell) is


       (10)                    exercise price = Œµ‚àôPt,


where we assume 0<Œµ‚â§1. We refer to Œµ, the ratio of the exercise price to the stock price, as the

relative exercise price (also described as ‚Äúmoneyness‚Äù).


                                                                                                     7
        The payoff on the put option at the start of period t+1 is zero if Pt+1‚â• Œµ‚àôPt. If Pt+1<Œµ‚àôPt,

the payoff is ŒµPt-Pt+1. If Œµ<1, the put option is initially out of the money. We focus empirically

on options that are sufficiently far out of the money (Œµ sufficiently below one) so that the

diffusion term, u, in equation (1) has a negligible effect on the chance of getting into the money

over one period. The value of the put option then hinges on the disaster term, v, in equation (1).

More specifically, the value of the put option will depend on the probability, p, of experiencing

disasters and the distribution of disaster sizes, b. Further, what will mostly matter is the

likelihood of experiencing one disaster. As long as the period (the maturity of the option) is not

too long, the chance of two or more disasters has a second-order pricing impact that can be

ignored as a good approximation.

        Let the price of the put option at the start of period t be Œ©‚àôPt. (For convenience, we omit

a time subscript on Œ©.) We refer to Œ©, the ratio of the options price to the stock price, as the
                                                   ùëú
relative options price. The gross rate of return, ùëÖùë°+1 , on the put option is given by


                                    ùëú              ùëÉùë°+1
        (11)                       ùëÖùë°+1 = 0 if            ‚â•ùúÄ
                                                    ùëÉùë°


                                    ùëú        1            ùëÉùë°+1          ùëÉùë°+1
                                   ùëÖùë°+1 =    ùõ∫
                                                 ‚àô ÔøΩùúÄ ‚àí          ÔøΩ ùëñùëì          <ùúÄ.
                                                           ùëÉùë°            ùëÉùë°



        Suppose that we neglect the diffusion term, u, in equation (1) and also neglect the

possibility of two or more disasters during a period. In that case, if there is one disaster of size b,

the put option is in the money at the start of period t+1 if 4

                                   ùëÉùë°+1
                                          = (1 + ùëî) ‚àô (1 ‚àí ùëè) < ùúÄ .

 This condition would be modified if the underlying stock pays out dividends and if the stock-options contract does
not adjust for this payout.


                                                                                                                      8
In most cases, the length of the period (maturity of the put option) will be short enough so that,

for reasonable growth rates, we can ignore the term g.

       Let œÄ be the probability of the put option getting into the money, conditional on

experiencing one disaster over the period. Given g and Œµ, œÄ depends on the distribution of

disaster sizes, b. In Barro and Jin (2011), this size distribution was found empirically to conform

well to a power-law density for the transformed variable z‚â°1/(1-b), which can be viewed as the

ratio of normal to disaster consumption. The condition 0<b‚â§1 translates into z>1, with z tending

to infinity as b tends to 1. The probability of getting into the money on the put option,

conditional on having one disaster, is:

Since p is the probability of having a disaster in a period, the overall probability of getting into

the money over one period is pœÄ, where œÄ is given in equation (12). (Again, we are neglecting

the chance of two or more disasters.)

       When expressed in terms of z, the gross rate of return on the put option is modified from

equation (11) to:

To determine Œ©, we use the first-order condition from equation (5), with Rt+1 given by ùëÖùë°+1 from

equation (13). The results depend on the form of the distribution for z, to which we now turn.




                                                                                                       9
         B. Power-law distribution of disaster sizes

         Based on the findings for the distribution of observed macroeconomic disaster sizes in

Barro and Jin (2011), we assume that the density function for z conforms to a power law: 5


         (14)              ùëì(ùëß) = ùê¥ùëß ‚àí(1+ùõº) , ùë§‚Ñéùëíùëüùëí ùê¥ > 0, ùõº > 0, ùëéùëõùëë ùëß ‚â• ùëß0 > 1 .


The general notion of this type of power law was applied by Pareto (1897) to the distribution of

high incomes. The power-law distribution has since been applied widely in physics, economics,

computer science, and other fields. For surveys, see Mitzenmacher (2003) and Gabaix (2009),

who discusses underlying growth forces that can generate power laws. Examples of applications

include sizes of cities (Gabaix and Ioannides [2004]), stock-market activity (Gabaix, et al. [2003,

2006]), CEO compensation (Gabaix and Landier [2008]), and firm size (Luttmer [2007]). The

power-law distribution has been given many names, including heavy-tail distribution, Pareto

distribution, Zipfian distribution, and fractal distribution.

         The parameter z0>1 in equation (14) is the threshold beyond which the power-law density

applies. For example, in Barro and Ursua (2012), the floor disaster size of b0=0.095 corresponds

to z0=1.105. We treat z0 as a constant. The condition that f(z) integrate to one from z0 to infinity

implies ùê¥ = ùõºùëß0ùõº . Therefore, the power-law density function in equation (14) becomes


         (15)              ùëì(ùëß) = ùõºùëß0ùõº ‚àô ùëß ‚àí(1+ùõº) , ùëß ‚â• ùëß0 > 1 .


The key parameter in the power-law distribution is Œ±, which governs the thickness of the right

tail. A smaller Œ± implies a thicker tail.


5
 In Kou (2002, p. 1090), a power-law distribution is ruled out because the expectation of next period‚Äôs asset price is
infinite. This property applies because Kou allows for favorable jumps (bonanzas) and, more importantly, he
assumes that the power-law shock enters directly into the log of the stock price. This problem does not arise in our
context because we consider disasters and not bonanzas, and, more basically, because our power-law shock
multiplies the level of GDP (and consumption and the stock price), rather than adding to the log of GDP.


                                                                                                                    10
        The probability of drawing a transformed disaster size above z is given by

                                                ùëß
        (16)                    1 ‚àí ùêπ(ùëß) = (ùëß )‚àíùõº .
                                                0




Thus, the probability of seeing an extremely large transformed disaster size, z (expressed as a

ratio to the threshold, z0), declines with z in accordance with the tail exponent Œ±>0.

        We can use equation (15) to compute œÄ, the probability of getting into the money on the

put option, conditional on experiencing one disaster:


        (17)                    ùúã = ùëß0ùõº (1 + ùëî)‚àíùõº ùúÄ ùõº .


We assumed here Œµ<(1+g)/z0, meaning that the put option is sufficiently far out of the money so

that one disaster of threshold size is not enough to get the option into the money. (Otherwise, we

would have œÄ=1.) Equation (17) implies that œÄ rises with Œµ in accordance with the exponent Œ±.

The overall effect of Œ± on œÄ is negative (given the condition Œµ<[1+g]/z0); that is, a thinner tail

makes getting into the money less likely.

        One issue about the power-law density is that some moments related to the transformed

disaster size, z, might be unbounded. For example, in equation (7), the risk-free rate of return, rf,

depends negatively on the term ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)‚àíùõæ . Heuristically (or exactly with time-separable power

utility), we can think of this term as representing the expected marginal utility of consumption in

a disaster state relative to that in a normal state. When z‚â°1/(1-b) is distributed according to f(z)

from equation (15), we can compute

                                                      ùõº      ùõæ
        (18)            ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)‚àíùõæ = ùê∏(ùëß ùõæ ) = ÔøΩùõº‚àíùõæÔøΩ ‚àô ùëß0 if Œ±>Œ≥.


        The term in equation (18) is larger when Œ≥ is larger (more risk aversion) or Œ± is smaller

(fatter tail for disasters). But, if Œ±‚â§Œ≥, the tail is fat enough, relative to the degree of risk aversion,


                                                                                                       11
so that the term blows up. In this case, rf heads toward minus infinity in equation (7), and the

equity premium heads toward plus infinity in equation (9). Of course, in the data, proxies for the

risk-free rate are not minus infinity, and measures of the equity premium are not plus infinity.

Therefore, the empirical application of the power-law density in Barro and Jin (2011) confined Œ≥

to a range that avoided unbounded outcomes, given the value of Œ± that was estimated from the

observed distribution of disaster sizes. That is, the estimate of the unknown Œ≥ had to satisfy Œ≥<Œ±

in order for the model to have any chance to accord with observed average rates of return. 6 In

this range, the values of rf, 1/V, and re-rf given in equations (7)-(9) are well defined. The same

condition turns out to enter into our analysis of far-out-of-the-money put-options prices.

         Barro and Jin (2011, Table 1) estimated the power-law tail parameter, Œ±, in single power-

law specifications (and also considered double power laws). The estimation was based on

macroeconomic disaster events of size 10% or more computed from the long history for many

countries of per capita personal consumer expenditure (the available proxy for consumption, C)

and per capita GDP, Y. The estimated values of Œ± in the single power laws were 6.3, with a 95%

confidence interval of (5.0, 8.1), for C and 6.9, with a 95% confidence interval of (5.6, 8.5),

for Y. 7 Thus, the observed macroeconomic disaster sizes suggest a range for Œ± of roughly 5-8.

         Some results depend on another term, ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)1‚àíùõæ . Heuristically, this term corresponds

to the expectation of the product of the proportionate decline in GDP (and consumption and




6
  With constant absolute risk aversion and a power-law distribution of disaster sizes, the relevant term has to blow
up. The natural complement to constant absolute risk aversion is an exponential distribution of disaster sizes. In
this case, the relevant term is bounded if the parameter in the exponential distribution is larger than the coefficient of
absolute risk aversion. With an exponential size distribution and constant relative risk aversion, the relevant term is
always finite.
7
  Barro and Jin (2011, Table 1) found that the data could be fit better with a double power law. In these
specifications, with a threshold of z0=1.105, the tail parameter, Œ±, was smaller in the part of the distribution with the
largest disasters than in the part with the smaller disasters. The cutoff value for the two parts was at a value of z
around 1.4.


                                                                                                                       12
stock price) during a disaster and the ratio of disaster to normal marginal utility. With the

power-law density for z in equation (15), we can derive

                                                              ùõº           ùõæ‚àí1

The condition Œ≥<Œ±, mentioned before, guarantees that the term in equation (19) is well defined. 8


           C. Options-pricing formula

           To get the formula for Œ©, the relative options price, we use the first-order condition from
                                                                                         ùëú
equations (5) and (6), with the gross rate of return, Rt+1, corresponding to the return ùëÖùë°+1 from

put options in equation (13). We can rewrite the first-order condition in this context as

                                                           ùëú

where z‚â°1/(1-b) is the transformed disaster size and 1 + ùúåÔøΩ is an overall discount term, given

from equations (5) and (6) (when the period length is short and the diffusion term is negligible)

by

                                                                    ùõæ‚àíùúÉ
           (21)              1 + ùúåÔøΩ = 1 + ùúå ‚àí (ùõæ ‚àí ùúÉ)ùëî + ùëù ‚àô ÔøΩùõæ‚àí1ÔøΩ ‚àô [ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)1‚àíùõæ ‚àí 1] .


We could substitute out for the term ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)1‚àíùõæ on the right-hand side of equation (21) from

equation (19).

           We can evaluate the right-hand side of equation (20) using the density f(z) from
                                             ùëú
equation (15) along with the expression for ùëÖùë°+1 from equation (13). The result involves

integration over the interval z‚â•(1+g)/Œµ where, conditional on having a disaster, the disaster size is

p, of having a disaster. Specifically, we have:

Evaluating the integral (assuming Œ≥<Œ± and Œµ<[1+g]/z0) leads to a closed-form formula for the

           The result in equation (23) applies when the maturity of the put option is one ‚Äúperiod.‚Äù

We now take account of the maturity of the option. In continuous time, the parameter p,

measured per year, is the Poisson hazard rate for the occurrence of a disaster. Let T, in years, be

the maturity of the (European) put option. The density, h, for the number of hits (disasters) over

T is given by 9

           If pT is much less than 1, the contribution to the options price from two or more disasters

will be second-order, relative to that from one disaster. For given p, this condition requires a

consideration of maturities, T, that are not ‚Äútoo long.‚Äù In this range, we can proceed as in our

previous analysis to consider just the probability and size of one disaster. Then, in equation (23),

p will be replaced as a good approximation by pT.

            The discount rate, ùúåÔøΩ, and growth rate, g, in equation (23) will be replaced

(approximately) by ùúåÔøΩT and gT, where ùúåÔøΩ and g are measured per year. For given ùúåÔøΩ and g, if T is

not ‚Äútoo long,‚Äù we can neglect these discounting and growth terms in equation (23). (Under

similar conditions, effects from dividend payouts can also be ignored.) Basically, the impacts of

these terms are of the same order as the effect from two or more disasters, which we have

already neglected.

            When T is short enough to neglect multiple disasters and the discounting and growth

terms, the formula for the relative options price changes from equation (23) to: 10

     The possibility of two disasters turns out to introduce into equation (25) the multiplicative term:

The full term inside the large brackets has to be positive, so that this multiplicative term is increasing in T. The
effects from the discount rate and growth rate add multiplicative terms that look like (1-positive constant‚àôùúåÔøΩT) and
(1-positive constant‚àôgT). Hence, these multiplicative terms are decreasing in T. The overall effect of T implied by
the combination of the three multiplicative terms is unclear. That is, it is unclear how the full result for Œ© would
deviate from unit elasticity with respect to T.

       ‚Ä¢   The exponent on maturity, T, equals 1.

       ‚Ä¢   The exponent on the relative exercise price, Œµ, equals 1+Œ±-Œ≥, which is constant

           and greater than 1 because Œ±>Œ≥. We noted before that Œ± ranged empirically

           between 5 and 8. The corresponding range for Œ≥ (needed to replicate an

           average unlevered equity premium of 0.04-0.05 per year) is between 2.5 and

           5.5, with lower Œ≥ associating with lower Œ±. The implied range for Œ±-Œ≥ (taking

           account of the association between Œ≥ and Œ±) is between 2.5 and 4.5, implying a

           range for the exponent on Œµ between 3.5 and 5.5.

       ‚Ä¢   For given T and Œµ, Œ© depends on the disaster probability, p; the shape of the

           power-law density, as defined by the tail coefficient, Œ±, and the threshold, z0;

           and the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥. If we maintain the assumptions

           that Œ±, z0, and Œ≥ are fixed, we can think of the whole expression for Œ© as

           having a multiplier proportional to p. That is, a multiplicative fixed effect for

           calendar time would reveal the proportionate variations over time in p. (An

           important caveat is that our derivation of the options-pricing formula in

           equation [25] ignored the possibility of changing p.)


       We can look at the results in terms of the ‚Äúrisk-neutral probability,‚Äù pn, defined as the

value of p that would generate a specified relative options price, Œ©, when Œ≥=0. The formula for

the ratio of the risk-neutral to the objective probability, pn/p, implied by equation (25) is:


                                       ùëùùëõ          ùõº(1+ùõº)
       (26)                                 =                  ‚àô ùúÄ ‚àíùõæ .
                                        ùëù       (ùõº‚àíùõæ)(1+ùõº‚àíùõæ)


Note that pn/p depends on the relative exercise price, Œµ, but not on the maturity, T. If we assume

parameter values consistent with the previous discussion‚Äîfor example, Œ±=7 and Œ≥=3.5‚Äîthe


                                                                                                   16
implied pn/p is 5.1 when Œµ=0.9, 7.8 when Œµ=0.8, 12.4 when Œµ=0.7, 21.3 when Œµ=0.6, and 40.3

when Œµ=0.5. Hence, the relative risk-neutral probability associated with far-out-of-the-money

put options is sharply above one.

       To view it another way, the relative options price, Œ©, may seem far too high at low Œµ,

when assessed in terms of the (risk-neutral) probability needed to justify this price. Thus, people

who are paying these prices to insure against the risk of an enormous disaster may appear to be

irrational. In contrast, the people writing these far-out-of-the-money puts may seem to be getting

free money by insuring against something that is virtually impossible. Yet the pricing is

reasonable if people have roughly constant relative risk aversion with Œ≥ around 3.5 (assuming a

tail parameter, Œ±, for disaster size around 7). The people writing these options will have a

comfortable income almost all the time, but will suffer tremendously during the largest rare

disasters (when the marginal utility of consumption is extremely high).


       E. Diffusion term

       Recall that the derivation of the formula for Œ©, the relative options price, in equation (25)

neglected the diffusion term, u, in the process for GDP (and consumption and the stock price) in

equation (1). This omission is satisfactory if the put option is sufficiently far out of the money so

that, given a reasonable variance œÉ2 in the diffusion term, the chance of getting into the money

over the maturity T is negligible. In other words, the tail for the normal process is not fat enough

to account by itself for, say, 10% or greater declines in stock prices over periods up to, say, a few

months. Operationally, our main empirical analysis applies the options-pricing formula in

equation (25) to options that are at least 10% out of the money (Œµ‚â§0.9) and to maturities, T, that

range up to 6 months.




                                                                                                   17
       If we consider put options at or close to the money, the diffusion term would have a first-

order impact on the value of the option. If we neglect the disaster (jump) term‚Äîwhich will be

satisfactory here‚Äîwe would be in the standard Black-Scholes world. In this setting (with i.i.d.

shocks), a key property of the normal distribution is that the variance of the stock price over

interval T is proportional to T, so that the standard deviation is proportional to the square root

of T. This property led to the result in Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988) that the value of an

at-the-money put option would be roughly proportional to the square root of the maturity.

       We, therefore, have two results concerning the impact of maturity, T, on the relative

options price, Œ©. For put options far out of the money (operationally for Œµ‚â§0.9), the exponent on

T is close to 1. For put options close to the money (operationally for Œµ=1), the exponent on T is

close to one-half. These predictions turn out to hold empirically for put options on the S&P 500

and on analogous market indices for eight other countries.

       We could carry out a more general analysis that includes simultaneously diffusion and

jump (disaster) risks, though the simplicity of equation (25) would be lost. We can anticipate

that, in a range for the relative exercise price, Œµ, between 0.9 and 1.0, the exponent on T in the

formula for Œ© would range between 1.0 and 0.5, with values closer to 0.5 applying when the

sample was weighted toward options that were close to the money.

       For some purposes, we are mainly interested in isolating time-varying disaster

probabilities, p, that apply over the short term to large disasters, such as 10% or more declines in

per capita GDP. In this context, the main information would likely come from far-out-of-the-

money put options, such as where Œµ‚â§0.9. In this range, the diffusion term would likely have a

minor impact, and the formula in equation (25) would provide a satisfactory approximation for




                                                                                                     18
the relative options price, Œ©. Therefore, the fixed-effects estimates corresponding to this formula

should be informative about the time-varying p associated with large disasters.


        F. Variations in the disaster probability

        The asset-pricing formulas were derived under the assumption that the disaster

probability, p, and other parameters were fixed. 11 However, we can get some idea of how

persistent changes in p affect stock prices and, thereby, relative stock-options prices by

considering the effect from a once-and-for-all (permanent) change in p on the price-dividend

ratio, V, given in equation (8). This equation implies (if we hold fixed g, rather than g*, in

equation [2]):

                             1 ùúïùëâ           1‚àíùúÉ
        (27)                 ùëâ ùúïùëù
                                    = ‚àíÔøΩ
                                            ùõæ‚àí1
                                                  ÔøΩ ‚àô ùëâ ‚àô [ùê∏(1 ‚àí ùëè)1‚àíùõæ ‚àí 1].


We assume Œ≥>1, which is needed to have any chance of explaining the average equity premium.

In this case, as stressed by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Barro (2009), the sign of the effect of p

on V in equation (27) depends on whether Œ∏ (the reciprocal of the IES) is less than or greater than

one. 12 The ‚Äúnormal result,‚Äù whereby more uncertainty reduces stock prices, requires Œ∏<1.

Bansal and Yaron (2004) assume IES=1/Œ∏=1.5, whereas Barro (2009) focuses on IES=1/Œ∏=2.

        If we assume Œ∏=0.5 and use ranges for the tail parameter, Œ±, and coefficient of relative

risk aversion, Œ≥, discussed before, we can get an idea of the magnitude of the right-hand side of




11
   Kelly and Jiang (2014, p. 2842) assume a power-law density for returns on individual securities. Their power law
depends on a cross-sectional parameter and also on aggregate parameters that shift over time. In the latter part of
their analysis, they assume time dependence in the economy-wide values of the tail parameter, analogous to our Œ±,
and the threshold, analogous to our z0. (Their threshold corresponds to the fifth percentile of observed monthly
returns.)
12
   This condition on Œ∏ also determines the effect on the stock price from a change in œÉ or in the power-law tail
parameter, Œ±, which determines the size distribution of disasters, b.


                                                                                                                 19
equation (27). 13 It turns out that a reasonable range is between 5 and 7; that is, an increase in p

by 0.01 would generate a proportionate decline in the stock price by between 5% and 7%.

However, the conclusions are sensitive to the parameter Œ∏. If Œ∏ were close to 1, the effect of a

change in p on the stock price would be minor.

        A change in p by 0.01 should be viewed in relation to the average p of around 0.04 per

year, gauged by the macroeconomic disaster data (Barro and Ursua [2008]). That is, a change in

p by 0.01 is large in the sense of constituting 25% of the average p. Moreover, the effects

inferred from equation (27) correspond to permanent shifts in p. Nevertheless, it is clear that

effects from changing p might contribute substantially to pricing of far-out-of-the-money put

options. A further consideration is that the volatility of p (that is, the chance of p rising or

falling) is likely to move around. Hence, the effects from potentially shifting p on prices of far-

out-of-the-money put-options prices may be substantially higher at some points in time (when

volatility is greater) than others.


III. Empirical Analysis

        The model in the previous section delivers some testable predictions. First, the elasticity

of the price of far out-of-the-money put options with respect to maturity, T‚Äîdenoted Œ≤T‚Äîis

close to one. This result applies in the region where diffusion risk is negligible compared to

disaster risk and when the effects from multiple disasters can be ignored. Second, in the same

region, the elasticity of the price of far-out-of-the-money put options with respect to the relative

exercise price, Œµ‚Äîdenoted Œ≤Œµ‚Äîis greater than one and constant if the coefficient of relative risk

aversion, ùõæ, and the disaster-size-distribution parameters, ùõº and z0, are fixed. Moreover, the

estimated elasticity can be compared with that implied by estimated parameter values from the

13
 This analysis requires an estimate of the price-dividend ratio, V, determined by equation (8). We assume here,
based on the analysis in Barro and Ursua (2008), that the rate of time preference, œÅ, is 0.04 per year.


                                                                                                                  20
rare-disasters literature. Finally, if Œ≥, Œ±, and z0 are fixed, time variations in the full menu of

prices of far-out-of-the-money put prices reflect fluctuations in disaster probability, pt, which we

recover with our model. We test these theoretical predictions empirically by analyzing prices of

far-out-of-the-money put options on the U.S. S&P 500 and analogous broad indices for other

countries.


         A. Data and methodology

         Our primary data source is a broker-dealer with a sizable market-making operation in

global equities. We utilize over-the-counter (OTC) options prices for nine equity-market indices

for developed and emerging markets‚ÄîS&P 500 (U.S.), FTSE (U.K.), DAX (Germany), Euro

Stoxx 50 (Euro zone), Nikkei (Japan), OMX (Sweden), SMI (Switzerland), Nifty (India), and

Bovespa (Brazil). We check the results with OTC data against those with market-based

information from Option Metrics for the United States and from Bloomberg for the United States

and other countries. This check is useful because, as mentioned, the OTC data do not necessarily

correspond to actual trades.

         Our primary data derive from implied-volatility surfaces generated by the broker-dealer

for the purpose of analysis, pricing, and marking-to-market. 14 These surfaces are constructed

from transactions prices of options and OTC derivative contracts. 15 The dealer interpolates these

observed values to obtain implied volatilities for strikes ranging from 50% to 150% of spot and

for a range of maturities from 15 days to 2 years and more. Even at very low strikes, for which

the associated options seldom trade, the estimated implied volatilities need to be accurate for the

14
   A common practice in OTC trading is for executable quotes to be given in terms of implied volatility instead of the
actual price of an option. Once the implied volatility is agreed on, the options price is determined from the Black-
Scholes formula based on the readily observable price of the underlying security. Since the Black-Scholes formula
provides a one-to-one link between price and volatility, quotes can be given equivalently in terms of implied
volatility or price.
15
   Dealers observe prices through own trades and from indications by inter-dealer brokers. It is also a common
practice for dealers to ask clients how their prices compare to other market makers in OTC transactions.


                                                                                                                   21
correct pricing of OTC derivatives such as variance swaps and structured retail products.

Therefore, sell-side dealers have strong incentives to maintain the accuracy of their implied-

volatility surfaces.

         As mentioned, the OTC data source is superior to market-based alternatives in the

breadth of coverage for exercise prices and maturities. Notably, the market data tend to be

unreliable or entirely unavailable for options that are far out of the money and for long

maturities. For example, OptionMetrics has very limited information on far out-of-the-money

put options prices due to the lack of market transactions and methodological challenges.

Specifically, their volatility surface is mainly limited to 20-delta options volatilities at the

extreme, which correspond to options that are close to the money, 16 whereas the OTC data

contain implied volatilities for 5-delta and even 1-delta options.

         The broad range of strikes in the broker-dealer data is important for our analysis because

it is the prices of far-out-of-the-money put options that will mainly reflect disaster risk. In

practice, we focus on put options with exercise prices of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% of spot;

that is, we exclude options within 10% of spot.

         For maturities, we focus on a range between 30 days and 6 months; specifically, for 30

days, 60 days, 90 days, and 6 months. 17 Our main analysis excludes options with maturities

greater than six months because the prices in this range may be influenced significantly by the

possibility of multiple disaster realizations and also by dividend payouts and discounting.



16
   A 20-delta option has a price that changes by 0.20% for a 1% change in the underlying security price.
OptionMetrics Volatility Surface uses interpolation to generate the implied volatility for each security on each day,
based on a kernel-smoothing algorithm. The lower bound of this volatility surface is 20-delta. In our use of the
OptionMetrics data, we expand on the range of option strikes by applying linear interpolation whenever there are
two or more observations for a single trading date. This procedure enlarges the volatility surface.
17
   We omit 15-day options because we think measurement error is particularly serious in this region in pinning down
the precise maturity. Even the VIX index, which measures short-dated implied volatility, does not track options
with maturity less than 23 days.


                                                                                                                  22
However, in practice, the results for 1-year maturity accord reasonably well with those for

shorter maturities.

        Using the data on implied volatilities, we re-construct options prices from the standard

Black-Scholes formula, assuming a zero discount rate and no dividend payouts. We should

emphasize that the use of the Black-Scholes formula to translate implied volatilities into options

prices does not bind us to the Black-Scholes model of options prices. The formula is used only

to convert the available data expressed as implied volatilities into options prices. Our calculated

options prices are comparable to directly quoted prices (subject to approximations related to

discounting and dividend payouts).


        B. Basic model fit

        We estimate the model based on equation (25) with non-linear least-squares regression.

In this form, we think of the error term as additive with a constant variance. Log-linearization

with a constant-variance error term (that is, a shock proportional to price) is problematic because

it understates the typical error in extremely far-out-of-the-money put prices, which are close to

zero. That is, this specification gives undue weight to puts with extremely low exercise prices.

        In the non-linear regression, we allow for multiplicative time fixed effects to capture

time-varying probabilities of disasters. The deterministic part of the regression setup is:

                                                       ùõΩ      ùõΩ
      (28)                               ùõ∫ùëñùë° = ùõ∑ùë° ‚àô ùëáùëñùë° ùëá ‚àô ùúÄùëñùë°ùúÄ ,

where i denotes a security (a put option on a broad market index) and t is time, ùõ∫ùëñùë° is the ratio of

options price to stock price, Œ¶t is the time fixed effect, Tit is the maturity, and Œµit is the ratio of

exercise price to stock price. In the model, the time fixed effect, Œ¶t , corresponds to the term:

        (29)                    ùõ∑ùë° = ùëùùë° ùõºùëß0ùõº /[(ùõº ‚àí ùõæ)ÔøΩ1 + ùõº-ùõæÔøΩ].




                                                                                                          23
We think of Œ≥ (coefficient of relative risk aversion), Œ± (thickness of the disaster tail), and z0

(threshold size for disasters) as fixed over time. However, we allow pt to vary over time; that is,

we view the time-varying fixed effect as reflecting solely changes in disaster probability. In our

implementation, we also allow the time series of pt and, hence, Œ¶t, to differ across countries.

        The missing element in the analysis is that variations in pt, if persisting, affect stock

prices and, therefore, ùõ∫ùëñùë° . We return later to this consideration. With respect to the exponents in

equation (29), the model implies Œ≤T=1 and ùõΩùúñ =1 + ùõº ‚àí ùõæ, which is constant (over time and

across securities) and greater than one.

         We sample the data at monthly frequency, selecting only month-end dates, to allow for

ease of computation with a non-linear solver. The selection of mid-month dates yields similar

results. The sample period for the United States in our main analysis is August 1994-June 2015.

Because of lesser data availability, the samples for the other countries are shorter. We expand

the sample period for the U.S. back to 1983 as a robustness check, although we do not emphasize

this longer-term sample because the data quality before 1994 are considerably poorer. Table 1

shows the model estimation using non-linear least-squares regression. The specification allows

for different time fixed effects for each country.

        The estimated elasticities with respect to maturity, ùõΩùëá , are close to one. For example, the

estimated coefficient for the United States is 0.978 (s.e.=0.036) and that for all nine countries

jointly is 0.938 (s.e.=0.038). 18 These results indicate that far-out-of-the-money prices of put

options on broad market indices are roughly proportional to maturity, in accordance with our

rare-disasters model. This nearly proportional relationship between options price and maturity

for far-out-of-the-money put options is a newly documented fact that cannot be explained under


18
 However, the joint estimates correspond to an unbalanced panel that gives greater weight to later periods (which
have more data available).


                                                                                                                    24
the Black-Scholes model. To our knowledge, other theoretical models of options prices also do

not predict this behavior.

       The results with respect to maturity can be visualized in Figure 1, Panel A, which plots

ratios of put prices to spot prices against maturity, assuming an exercise price of 80% of spot.

The blue curve corresponds to the historical data that underlie Table 1. The red curve shows

values generated by the Black-Scholes model, assuming a log-normal distribution of shocks and

a constant volatility of 30% (chosen to accord with the average observed level of put prices).

Most importantly, the Black-Scholes model predicts that these far-out-of-the-money put prices

will have a convex relationship with maturity. This pattern deviates from the nearly linear

relationship shown by the historical data.

       In contrast, as discussed in Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988), prices of at-the-money

put options in the Black-Scholes model are roughly proportional to the square root of the

maturity. This result arises because, with a diffusion process driven by i.i.d. normal shocks, the

variance of the log of the stock price is proportional to time and, therefore, the standard deviation

is proportional to the square root of time. This pattern implies the concave relation between put

price and maturity as shown by the red curve in Figure 1, Panel B. In this case, the Black-

Scholes prediction accords with the historical data, shown by the blue curve in Panel B.

       Table 2 provides detailed regression estimates for the nine countries for at-the-money put

prices. The estimated coefficient on maturity is 0.518 (s.e.=0.007) for the United States and

0.495 (0.007) for the nine countries jointly. Hence, as predicted by Black-Scholes, these

coefficients are very close to 0.5.

       If one considers exercise prices between 80% and 100% of spot, the Black-Scholes

prediction for the relation between put price and maturity shifts from convex to concave at




                                                                                                   25
around 90% of spot (with the exact shift point depending on the underlying volatility). The

predicted relation turns out to be nearly linear for an exercise price around 90% of spot. In

contrast, as implied by Table 1 and Figure 1, Panel A, the relation in the data is roughly linear in

maturity for a broad range of exercise prices below 90%‚Äîdown to at least 50%. These results

accord with the rare-disasters model but not with Black-Scholes.

            To summarize, the fit of the Black-Scholes model is good for at-the-money put options

but poor for put options with exercise prices below 90% of spot. These patterns arise because the

diffusion component of shocks dominates pricing of at-the-money put options, whereas disaster

risk, not captured in Black-Scholes, dominates the pricing of far-out-of-the-money put options.

As discussed earlier in the modeling section, the roughly proportional relationship between far-

out-of-the-money put prices and maturity arises because, in a Poisson context, the probability of

a disaster is proportional to maturity. The resulting formula is only approximate because it

neglects the potential for multiple disasters within the time frame of an option‚Äôs maturity, omits a

diffusion term entirely, and also ignores discounting and dividend payouts. However, for options

that are not ‚Äútoo long,‚Äù these approximations will be reasonably accurate.

            Table 1 also shows estimates of the elasticity with respect to the relative exercise price,

ùõΩùúñ . This coefficient corresponds in the model to 1 + ùõº ‚àí ùõæ, where Œ± is the tail coefficient and Œ≥

is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The estimates are all positive and greater than one, as

predicted by the model. The estimated coefficients are similar across countries, falling in a range

from 5.16 (s.e.=0.39) for Brazil to 6.06 (0.23) for Switzerland. 19 The joint estimate across the

nine countries is 5.83 (0.24).

            Rare-disasters research with macroeconomic data, such as Barro and Ursua (2008) and

Barro and Jin (2011), suggested that a Œ≥ of 3-4 would accord with observed average (unlevered)

     However, statistical tests reject the hypothesis of equal coefficients at less than the 1% critical level.


                                                                                                                  26
equity premia. With this range for Œ≥, the estimated values of Œ≤Œµ=1-Œ±-Œ≥ from Table 1 imply tail

coefficients, Œ±, between 7 and 9. This finding compares with a direct estimate for Œ± based on

macroeconomic data on consumption in Barro and Jin (2011, Table 1) of 6.3 (s.e.=0.8). That is,

the estimates from Table 1 suggest a thinner tail (higher Œ±) than those found from observation of

the size distribution of macroeconomic disasters (based on GDP or consumption). As discussed

later, the thinner tail goes along with an implied average probability of disaster that is higher

than that inferred from the macroeconomic data.


        C. Estimated disaster probabilities

        We can use the estimated time fixed effects for each country from the regressions in

Table 1, along with equation (29), to construct time series of (objective) disaster probabilities, pjt,

where j now denotes the country. The critical assumption here is that, aside from pjt, the other

parameters on the right-hand side of equation (29) are constant over time for country j. In that

case, the estimated pjt will be proportional to the time fixed effect, Œ¶jt, for country j.

        To get a ballpark idea of the level of pjt, we assume that, in each country, the threshold

for disaster sizes is fixed at z0 =1.1 (as in Barro and Jin [2011]) and that the coefficient of

relative risk aversion is Œ≥=3. We allow the tail coefficient, Œ±j, to differ across countries; that is,

we allow countries to differ with respect to the size distribution of potential disasters. We use

the estimated coefficients from Table 1 for Œ≤Œµ (which equals 1+Œ±-Œ≥ in the model) to back out the

implied tail coefficient, Œ±j, for country j. (These values range from 7.2 to 8.1.) Figure 2 presents

the resulting time series of disaster probabilities for each country, and Table 3 provides summary

statistics for these probabilities. Note that the levels of the series, but not the time patterns,

depend on our assumed parameter values.




                                                                                                     27
       The disaster probabilities shown in Figure 2 have high correlations across the countries,

with an average pair-wide correlation of 0.88. This property indicates that a large part of the

inferred disaster probability can be attributed to the chance of a common (global) disaster. The

median disaster probability is high, around 13% per year for the S&P 500. Similar medians

apply to the other countries. These high probabilities are much greater than that‚Äî3-4% per

year‚Äîestimated from macroeconomic data on rare disasters (see, for example, Barro and Ursua

[2008]). We think that this overstatement of average disaster probability goes along with the

understatement of tail risk in disaster sizes, as noted before. That is, the estimated probabilities

are too high, and the estimated sizes are too low.

       The disaster probabilities in Figure 2 are volatile and right-skewed with spikes during

crisis periods. The U.S. disaster probability hit a peak of 70% per year in November 2008.

Other countries had their highest disaster probabilities in the range of 60% to 70% in October

and November 2008. Japan had the highest peak disaster probability‚Äî93% in October 2008.

The overall patterns mirror the options-derived U.S. equity premia in Martin (2015) and the U.S.

disaster probabilities found by Siriwardane (2015).

       Figure 2 suggests a lower bound on disaster probability around 3% per year. This value

is close to the (constant) disaster probability of 3.6-3.7% per year found in macroeconomic data

by Barro and Ursua (2008).

       A first-order AR(1) coefficient for the U.S. disaster probability in Figure 2 is 0.88

(applying at a monthly frequency). This coefficient implies that rare-disaster shocks have an

average half-life of 5.4 months. The persistence of disaster probabilities for the other countries

is similar to that for the United States, with the AR(1) coefficients ranging from 0.81 for Japan to

0.89 for Sweden.




                                                                                                   28
         Although we attributed the time pattern shown in Figure 2 to variable disaster probability,

pjt, the variations in the multiplicative time fixed effects may also reflect changes in the other

parameters contained in the model‚Äôs multiplicative disaster term, ùëùùõºùëç0ùõº /[(ùõº ‚àí ùõæ)(1 + ùõº ‚àí ùõæ)]. 20

For example, outward shifts in the size distribution of disasters, generated by reductions in the

tail parameter, Œ±, or increases in the threshold disaster size, z0, work like increases in p.

Similarly, increases in the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥, would raise the overall

multiplicative term. This kind of change in risk preference, possibly due to habit formation, has

been stressed by Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Separation of changes in the parameters of the

disaster distribution from those in risk aversion require simultaneous consideration of asset-

pricing effects (reflected in Figure 2) with information on the actual incidence and size of

disasters (based, for example, on movements of macroeconomic variables).

         Another issue is that the underlying asset-pricing theory assumed that the multiplicative

term ùëùùõºùëß0ùõº /[(ùõº ‚àí ùõæ)(1 + ùõº ‚àí ùõæ)] in equation (25) was constant because each parameter in this

expression, including p, was constant. Therefore, there is a disconnect from the theory in using

the empirically estimated model to gauge the time variations in the multiplicative term and then

attribute the changes to shifting pjt. Surprisingly, although the empirical estimates strongly reject

the hypothesis that the multiplicative term is constant over time for each country (as is clear from

Figure 2), the estimated coefficients Œ≤T and Œ≤Œµ in Table 1 conformed well in major respects with

the underlying theory (which assumed a fixed p).

         The missing element in the asset-pricing theory is that potential changes in pjt have

effects on options prices that combine with those from potential realizations of disasters.

Specifically, an increase in pjt ‚Äîto the extent that it has persistence‚Äîtypically lowers the spot


20
  Note that, in this model with i.i.d. shocks, the multiplicative term does not depend on the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution for consumption, 1/Œ∏, or the rate of time preference, œÅ,


                                                                                                                     29
stock price 21 (and, thereby, raises the ratio of exercise to spot price for an existing option). From

a pricing perspective, put prices on options on the overall stock market tend to be higher if future

changes in pjt are more likely, if the distribution of the sizes of these changes has a bigger right

tail, and if a change in pjt has a larger magnitude of effect on stock prices (possibly because the

changes are more persistent). 22 This effect is likely to be of first-order importance and,

therefore, should be brought into the analysis.

         We think the reason that the empirical model in Table 1 works well in some respects

despite the neglect of price effects from potentially changing disaster probabilities is that the

time pattern of these probabilities (Figure 2) looks like a rare-disaster process. That is, on rare

occasions, pjt moves sharply (and temporarily) higher, and the form of the distribution of the

sizes of these changes may resemble a power law. However, even if this interpretation is correct,

the problem is that the inferred pjt are actually combinations of levels of disaster probability with

effects from potentially changing pjt. This perspective may explain why the inferred pjt are too

high on average (compared to the incidence of macroeconomic disasters), whereas the estimated

disaster tails are too thin (that is, the estimated coefficients Œ±j are too high). The underestimation

of disaster sizes is effectively a compensation for the overestimation of disaster probabilities.


         D. Model robustness

         Tables 4-9 explore the robustness of the baseline model from Table 1 under various

scenarios. Table 4 presents estimates of different elasticities Œ≤Œµ over the four ranges of exercise

price ratios, Œµ, used in the baseline model: 0.5 to 0.6, 0.6 to 0.7, 0.7 to 0.8, and 0.8 to 0.9. The


21
   In the theory, this sign applies if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, 1/Œ∏, exceeds one. See Bansal and
Yaron (2004) and Barro (2009).
22
   Seo and Wachter (2015) argue that time-varying disaster probability is central for the pricing of options. They also
argue that a failure to incorporate this changing disaster probability accounts for some puzzling findings in Backus,
Chernov, and Martin (2011). Specifically, for a given level of disaster probability, the model underestimates the
prices of options. An analogous force operates in our model.


                                                                                                                    30
estimates fall into a fairly narrow range over the first three intervals; for example, for the United

States, the estimated coefficients are 5.5 (s.e.=0.1), 5.3 (0.2), and 5.7 (0.2). However, in the

highest range, the estimated coefficients tend to be larger, 6.3 (0.2) for the United States. For all

countries jointly, the estimated values are 4.7 (0.2), 5.0 (0.2), 5.5 (0.2), and 6.2 (0.2). Possibly

the higher Œ≤Œµ coefficients in the range for Œµ between 0.8 and 0.9 arises because the diffusion term

is non-negligible in this range.

       Table 5 applies the analogous methodology to examine elasticities Œ≤T over the three

ranges of maturity, T, used in the baseline model: 30 to 60 days, 60 to 90 days, and 90 days to 6

months. There is a tendency for Œ≤T to fall with T, particularly in the highest range. For example,

for the United States, the estimates in the three ranges are 1.19 (s.e.=0.05), 1.03 (0.04), and 0.92

(0.03). Similarly, for all countries jointly, the results are 1.14 (0.05), 0.99 (0.04), and 0.88

(0.04). These effects might relate to possibilities for multiple disasters and to discounting.

       Table 6 carries out a related analysis in which the structure of included maturities goes

out to one year. In this case, the single estimated elasticity, Œ≤T, for each country is lower than the

corresponding value in Table 1. This result reflects the tendency found in Table 5 of Œ≤T to fall

with T. For example, for the United States, the estimated Œ≤T in Table 6 is 0.93 (s.e.=0.03),

compared with 0.98 (0.04) in Table 1. Similarly, for all countries jointly, the estimate in Table 6

is 0.89 (0.03), compared with 0.94 (0.04) in Table 1. Note that, even with the inclusion of

maturities as long as one year, the estimated Œ≤T coefficients are close to the unit elasticity

predicted by the baseline model.

       Table 7 takes a different view of maturity elasticities, Œ≤T, by allowing for variation with

respect to exercise price, Œµ, rather than T. As noted before, prices of at-the-money put options

(dominated by diffusion risk) are proportional to the square root of maturity, whereas prices of




                                                                                                       31
far-out-of-the-money put options (dominated by disaster risk) are roughly linear in maturity.

Thus, in a broad sense, the maturity elasticity, Œ≤T, is declining in relative exercise price, Œµ.

Table 7 shows that this inverse pattern applies throughout the range of Œµ from 0.5 to 0.9. For

example, for the United States, the estimated ùõΩùëá is 1.97 (s.e.=0.11) when Œµ=0.5, 1.65 (0.09) when

Œµ=0.6, 1.43 (0.07) when Œµ=0.7, 1.20 (0.05) when Œµ=0.8, and 0.91 (0.03) when Œµ=0.9. Similarly,

for all countries jointly, the respective estimates are 1.81 (0.16), 1.62 (0.13), 1.40 (0.09), 1.15

(0.06), and 0.86 (0.03). Therefore, the results suggest that the values close to 1.0 for the

estimated Œ≤T in Table 1 are averages of values that are actually declining with Œµ. We think it

important to extend the baseline model to account for this richer pattern of Œ≤T.

        Table 8 explores the stability of the baseline results from Table 1 with regard to sample

period. Results apply to the pre-financial-crisis period before 2008 (1994-2007 for the United

States), the crisis period of 2008-2010, and the post-crisis period of 2011-2015. The estimated

coefficients Œ≤T and Œ≤Œµ are similar in the three periods, although the values are somewhat lower in

the crisis interval of 2008-2010. For example, for the United States, the estimates of Œ≤T are 1.03

(s.e.=0.04), 0.88 (0.05), and 1.12 (0.08), respectively, for the three periods. For all countries

jointly, the corresponding estimates are 0.98 (0.03), 0.85 (0.06), and 1.10 (0.05). Possibly the

low estimated Œ≤T during the crisis period can be explained by a disaster probability, pjt, that was

unusually high in the very short term but projected to fall in the near future.

        The estimates of Œ≤Œµ for the three samples for the United States are 6.78 (s.e.=0.26),

5.25 (0.28), and 6.34 (0.36), whereas those for all countries jointly are 6.39 (0.20), 5.06 (0.33),

and 6.70 (0.29). Possibly the low values of Œ≤Œµ during the crisis interval can be explained by the

unusually high volatility of stock prices‚Äîif we think of this high volatility as accompanied by a




                                                                                                      32
perceived fatter tail for bad outcomes (represented by a low tail exponent Œ± and a

correspondingly low value of Œ≤Œµ, which equals 1+Œ±-Œ≥).

         Table 9 shows how the results from Table 1 change with the use of alternative data

sources. Panel A uses U.S. data for October 2010-July 2014, over which market data are

available from OptionMetrics and Bloomberg. The main finding is that the estimated

coefficients Œ≤T and Œ≤Œµ from these two alternative data sources are similar to those for the OTC

data. Panel B considers longer samples, although the sample available from Bloomberg is

shorter than those for the other two sources. Again, the conclusion is that the main results are

similar for the different data sources. Panel C shows results with OTC and Bloomberg data for

eight countries over the common sample period October 2010-June 2015. (Data from

Bloomberg are unavailable for Brazil.) Most of the results are similar for the OTC and

Bloomberg sources, except for some puzzling results for the estimated Œ≤Œµ coefficients for Japan

and India.

         A lot of analysis of options pricing, going back to Bates (1991), suggests that the nature

of this pricing changed in character following the 1987 stock-market crash. In particular, a

‚Äúsmile‚Äù in graphs of implied volatility against exercise price is thought to apply only post-1987.

To assess this idea, we expanded our analysis to the period June 1983 to December 1995, using

quotes on S&P 500 index options from the Berkeley Options Data Base. 23 These data derive

from CBOE's Market Data Retrieval tapes. Because of the limited number of quotes on far-out-

of-the-money options in this data base, we form our monthly panel by aggregating quotes from

the last five trading days of each month.

                                                                                                                  33
       Table 10, Panel A presents the regression estimates for 1983-1995 in the context of our

baseline model. The estimate for ùõΩùëá is 1.01 (s.e. =0.086) and that for ùõΩùúñ is 6.79 (0.354). These

results are close to those obtained in Table 1 with U.S. OTC data on the S&P 500 for 1994-2015.

Therefore, the basic structure for pricing of far-out-of-the-money put prices on the S&P 500

seems similar for 1983-1995 and 1994-2015.

       As before, we back out a time series for disaster probability, pt, based on time fixed

effects, assuming that parameters other than pt in the multiplicative term for options prices are

fixed. We also use levels for these other parameters as specified before. Figure 3 graphs the

time series of estimated disaster probability. Readily apparent is the dramatic jump in pt at the

time of the October 1987 crash (in which the S&P 500 declined by 20.5% in a single day). The

estimated pt reached 259% but fell rapidly thereafter. The Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991

caused another rise in disaster probability to a high of 42%.

       Table 10, Panel B shows statistics associated with the time series in Figure 3. A

comparison pre-crash (June 1983-Sept 1987) and post-crash (Oct 1988-Dec 1995) shows a long-

run increase in the typical size of the estimated disaster probability, pt. For example, the pre-

crash mean and median are 0.064 and 0.062, respectively, whereas the post-crash values are

0.108 and 0.085. Moreover, the minimum value pre-crash, 0.021, is substantially lower than

that, 0.037, post-crash. Thus, the overall pattern is that the October 1987 crash raised the

average disaster probability and also increased the minimum level to which the disaster

probability tended to revert. These changes likely account for the introduction of a smile into the

graph of implied volatility versus exercise price following the October 1987 stock-market crash.




                                                                                                    34
IV. Conclusions

       Options prices contain rich information on market perceptions of rare disaster risks. We

develop a new options-pricing formula that applies when disaster risk is the dominant force, the

size distribution of disasters follows a power law, and the economy has a representative agent

with Epstein-Zin utility. The formula is simple but its main implications about maturity and

exercise price accord with U.S. and other data from 1983 to 2015 on far-out-of-the-money put

options on overall stock markets. If the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the size

distribution of disasters are fixed, the regression estimates of time fixed effects provide

information on the evolution of disaster probability. The estimated disaster probability peaks

during the recent financial crisis of 2008-09 and in the stock-market crash of October 1987. This

market-based assessment of disaster risk is a valuable indicator of aggregate economic shocks

that can be used by practitioners, macroeconomists, and policymakers.

       One important future extension would allow for effects of time-varying disaster

probability in the options-pricing formula. Other extensions involve variation in risk aversion

and the size distribution of disasters. We plan also to allow for the usual diffusion risk.

Figure 1: Comparison of prices with Black-Scholes predicted prices
This figure compares the mean of observed put prices across maturities with predicted prices
from the Black-Scholes model. Black-Scholes prices are generated assuming flat volatility
across maturities (30% for out-of-the-money options and 19% for at-the-money options). For
ease of comparison, the volatilities are chosen so that the prices scale appropriately to historical
prices. Panel A graphs relative put prices on the S&P 500 with strike of 80% of spot. Panel B
graphs relative put prices with strike of 100% of spot.

Figure 2: Disaster probabilities
This figure graphs the estimated disaster probabilities associated with the regressions in Table 1. The annualized disaster probability,
pjt for country j, is calculated from the multiplicative time fixed-effect coefficients in equation (29), assuming ùëß0 = 1.1 and Œ≥=3. With
ùõæ pinned down, the estimates of Œ≤Œµ=1+Œ±j-Œ≥ imply that the tail coefficients, Œ±j, range from 7.16 to 8.06.

Table 1: Baseline regression estimates
This table presents non-linear least square regression estimates of our main model. We use put option prices with maturity ranging
from one month to six months and strike ranging from 50% to 90% of spot price. We apply time-fixed effects to capture variations in
disaster probability, which are shown in Figure 2. Time-clustered standard errors are provided in parentheses. The p-value associated
with the hypothesis that ùõΩùúñ and ùõΩùëá are the same for all countries is less than 0.01.

Table 9: Comparison of alternative data sources
This table corresponds to Table 1 but with different data sources. Panels A and B are for U.S. data. Panel A uses a common sample
(October 2010-July 2014) for three data sources: the broker-dealer (OTC) data, OptionMetrics, and Bloomberg. Column 1 uses the
broker-dealer source. Column 2 uses OptionMetrics data, applying a bivariate linear interpolation on the implied volatility surface to
obtain put prices with the same maturities and strikes as in column 1. Column 3 uses OptionMetrics data with more granular strikes
at every 5% moneyness interval. Column 4 uses Bloomberg data constructed from Bloomberg‚Äôs implied volatility surface with the
same strikes and maturities as the broker-dealer. Panel C compares the broker-dealer results with those from Bloomberg for all
countries except Brazil (which lacks Bloomberg data). The sample is October 2010-June 2015. Time-clustered standard errors are in
parentheses.

Table 10: Regression estimates for early sample period
This table presents baseline regression estimates of our main model and summary statics on the associated disaster probabilities for the
period June 1983 to December 1995. The data are from the Berkeley Option Database. We form monthly panels of put-options prices
by aggregating quotes from the last five trading days of each month. Consistent with the methodology used to analyze OptionMetrics
data, we apply a bivariate linear interpolation on the implied volatility surface to obtain put prices with granular strikes at every 5%
moneyness interval and maturities ranging from one to six months. The time-fixed effects capture the variations in disaster probability,
which are shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Panel B. Time-clustered standard errors are provided in parentheses.
