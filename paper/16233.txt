                                             ABSTRACT

I study the positive relationship between prices of tradable goods and per-capita income. I develop
a highly tractable general equilibrium model of international trade with heterogeneous firms and non-
homothetic consumer preferences that positively links prices of tradables to consumer income. Guided
by the model’s testable prediction, I estimate the elasticity of price with respect to per- capita income
from a unique dataset that I construct, which features prices of 245 identical goods sold in 29 European,
Asian, and North American markets via the Internet by Spain’s second largest apparel manufacture—
Mango. I find that doubling a destination’s per-capita income results in an 18% increase in the price
of identical items sold there. Per-capita income differences account for a third, while shipping cost
differences can explain up to a third of the cross-country price variations of identical items purchased
via the Internet by consumers who do not take advantage of quantity discounts. The price elasticity
estimates compare favorably to estimates that I obtain from a standard dataset that features prices across
retail locations around the world, suggesting that variable mark-ups play a key role in accounting for
observed cross-country differences in prices of tradables.

1         Introduction
International trade has grown considerably in the post-war period (see Hummels (2007)). In addi-
tion, goods exports continue to account for eighty percent of world exports.1 Since tradable goods
constitute a high share of consumption bundles of individuals, their prices directly affect consumer
welfare. Consequently, studying the underlying mechanisms that shape the behavior of tradable
consumption-good prices across countries has been a major focus of research in international trade.
    One of the most robust empirical findings in the literature is that prices of tradable consump-
tion goods are higher in countries that are richer in per-capita terms (see Alessandria and Kaboski
(2011)). In this paper, I argue that variable mark-ups make a key contribution toward this relation-
ship between prices of tradables and per-capita income. To that end, I develop a tractable general
equilibrium model of international trade with heterogeneous firms and non-homothetic consumer
preferences over varieties that positively links prices of tradables to consumer income. Guided
by the model’s testable prediction, I estimate the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita
income from a unique dataset that I construct, which features prices of 245 identical goods sold
in 29 European, Asian, and North American markets via the Internet by Spain’s second largest
apparel manufacturer—Mango. I find that doubling a destination’s per-capita income results in
an 18% increase in the price of identical items sold there. Per-capita income differences account
for a third, while shipping cost differences can explain up to a third of the cross-country price
variations of identical items purchased via the Internet by consumers who do not take advantage
of quantity discounts. The price elasticity estimates compare favorably to estimates that I obtain
from a standard dataset that features prices across retail locations around the world, suggesting
that variable mark-ups play a key role in accounting for observed cross-country differences in prices
of tradables.
   I develop the theory in Section 2. According to the model, trade barriers enable monopolistically-
competitive firms with varying productivities to supply their products at destination-specific prices.
Due to non-homothetic preferences, different per-capita income levels result in different consump-
tion sets across countries. Non-constant expenditure shares yield varying price elasticities of de-
mand for a given positively-consumed variety across destinations. In particular, rich countries’
consumers are less responsive to price changes than those of poor ones, so firms optimally price
identical varieties higher in more affluent markets. Moreover, firms suffer competitive pressures in
more populated markets and extract lower mark-ups there.
    In Section 3, I derive a new testable prediction from the model that relates prices to measurable
variables. For a pair of countries, the model predicts that the relative price of an identical item
varies with the destinations’ relative per-capita incomes, trade barriers, and import shares that
reflect competition that exporters face across markets. Guided by the prediction, I estimate the
elasticity of price with respect to per-capita income from micro-level data in Section 4.

    Specifically, I construct a unique price database for the second largest Spanish apparel manu-
facturer — Mango. The dataset features prices of 245 identical apparel products sold exclusively
via the Internet in year 2012 in 29 European, Asian, and North American countries. The empirical
focus on “online-only” products in apparel is not accidental. According to a Eurostat survey, in
2012, 75% of adults in the EU28 used the Internet in the 12 months to the date, of which 60%
indicated that they had shopped online in the same period. The most commonly purchased goods
online were clothes and sports goods (32% in 2012 compared to 21% in 2008).
   Since consumers increasingly acquire apparel via the Internet rather than in physical stores,
web prices are particularly relevant for consumer welfare. More importantly, having obtained an
in-depth understanding of Mango’s online store from the company’s website as well as case studies
by Kordecka and Ricart (2009) and Pinilla (2007), I am able to identify the sources of cross-
country variations in prices charged by a typical online retailer. First, tracking identical goods
enables me to directly measure price discrimination on the basis of varying demand elasticities in
the absence of product-quality or production-cost differences. Second, focusing on prices of goods
sold exclusively online allows me to suppress destination-specific non-tradable price contributions.
Third, since all “online-only” Mango products are stored and dispatched from a single warehouse
via DHL Express to every destination, I am able to control for shipping costs in the analysis and
hence infer mark-up variations.
   Disentangling market-specific costs from mark-ups is the main challenge in studies of price
discrimination. In the case of cross-country online sales, there are two distinct problems. First,
web-listed prices do not necessarily correspond to actual transaction prices paid by consumers
in the presence of shipping and handling charges. Second, shipping and handling charges reflect
shipping costs incurred by the retailer as well as mark-ups passed onto consumers, both of which
may be destination-specific.
     The nature of Mango’s online store allows me to tackle both of these issues. To address the
first issue, I rely on Mango’s shipping and handling policy, which is explicitly described on the
company website. Like most online retailers, Mango offers quantity discounts. In particular,
Mango’s shipping and handling policy is as follows: (i) if a purchase is below a minimum value,
then the customer pays an explicit flat shipping fee; (ii) if a purchase is above a minimum value,
then the customer pays a lower explicit flat fee (often zero). Both the fees and the minimum value
vary by country.
   Since the transacted price depends on the type of purchase, I consider three specifications.
First, I assume that consumers in each country purchase a single item. In this case, I add the
appropriate flat shipping fee depending on whether the item’s price is above or below the minimum
threshold for each destination. Second, I assume that consumers in each country purchase barely
enough products so as to satisfy the respective minimum threshold. Thus, I spread the flat shipping
fee for purchases above the threshold over the bundle of goods—namely, I scale the prices of goods
by the ad valorem shipping fee. Third, I examine items’ prices as listed in the online catalogue.

                                                 2
    To address the second issue, which entails approximating Mango’s actual shipping costs, I
collect DHL Express shipping prices across destinations. I obtain ‘soft evidence’ directly from
DHL and verify that the company offers percentage discounts to the quoted prices to corporations
that carry out multiple shipments. Crucially, these discounts are not destination specific, so they
do not affect the relative price that a client pays to ship to different destinations. For example, a
client who ships $1500 worth of merchandise per month receives a 32% discount on all shipments
regardless of the destination. With this information in mind, I use the collected DHL shipping
quotes as proxies for Mango’s shipping and handling costs.
   Focusing on customers who purchase a single item in each country, after controlling for product-
specific fixed effects, DHL shipping costs and return policies by Mango, as well as destination-
specific Spanish market shares (measured in three distinct ways), sales taxes, and tariffs in the
apparel and footwear industries, currency-area membership, and income inequality, I find that
doubling a destination’s per-capita income results in a 14% increase in the price of identical items
sold there. The corresponding statistic is 19% for web-listed prices and 20% for prices paid by
customers who bundle goods in order to minimize shipping costs.
   Across the three specifications, identical items are on average 13% cheaper in export markets
that share a common currency with the manufacturer’s country of origin (Spain) and 13% cheaper
in countries where customers enjoy the flexibility to return items in a local physical store. Web-
listed prices and prices paid by shipping-cost minimizers do not vary with the cost of shipping, but
doubling the DHL shipping cost results in up to a 37% increase in the price paid by consumers
who purchase a single item. This stark difference reflects the fact that shipping charges for a single
purchase amount to over a third of a typical item’s price. A variance decomposition exercise tells
a similar story. Per-capita income differences account for about a third of price variations across
the three specifications, while shipping costs account for another third for customers who purchase
a single item only. In turn, differences in Mango’s return policy across markets and nations’
Eurozone membership contribute to less than 15% and 17% of the price variation, respectively.
    For robustness, I repeat the estimation using five different measures of per-capita income and
I add standard geographical and trade-policy proxies for trade barriers employed by the gravity
literature. Across 162 different specifications, the median estimated elasticity of price with respect
to per-capita income amounts to 0.18. The 5th and 95th percentiles for the estimate are 0.12 and
0.24, respectively. Among the estimates that lie between these two percentiles, having clustered
standard errors by destination, all coefficients are statistically significant.
    The empirical exercises described above demonstrate that mark-up variations are crucial in ac-
counting for observed differences in prices charged by online retailers across countries. How do price
discrimination practices of online retailers compare to those of standard physical retailers? This is
a difficult question to answer since prices of identical products from physical outlets are not avail-
able for a large set of countries. Alessandria and Kaboski (2011) employ retail prices of aggregate
good categories from the International Comparison Program (ICP) database, Crucini and Shintani

                                                  3
(2008) and Crucini and Yilmazkuday (2014) use retail prices of products with identical charac-
teristics from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) database, while Crucini et al. (2005a) and
Crucini et al. (2005b) rely on a similar database for the EU countries for the 1975-1990 period,
Goldberg and Verboven (2001) and Goldberg and Verboven (2005) track car prices in Europe, and
Ghosh and Wolf (1994) and Haskel and Wolf (2001) examine prices of the Economist magazine and
IKEA products, respectively. However, as Burstein et al. (2003) and Crucini and Yilmazkuday
(2014) argue, retail data reflect the contributions of non-tradable inputs, whose prices vary sys-
tematically with countries’ per-capita income levels. Consequently, retail prices of tradables may
be linked to countries’ per-capita income levels through the contributions of non-tradable channels,
making it difficult to separately identify mark-up from local cost components.2
    In Section 5.1, I compare the estimates of the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita
income for Mango products to estimates that I obtain using the ICP database. In the first exercise,
I use prices for all tradables as well as for apparel and footwear separately from the ICP database,
which spans all the countries that appear in the Mango dataset. I find that the same key variables
account for price variations in both the Mango and the ICP data. Turning to magnitudes, similar
regression exercises to the ones described above yield median elasticity estimates of 0.26 and 0.12
for tradable goods and apparel products, respectively. The estimates bound the ones obtained
for Mango products sold via the Internet, although the statistics reflect different mechanisms.
The price elasticity in ICP data may reflect differences in product quality, retail margins, and
producers’ mark-ups, while the one in the Mango data accounts for producers’ mark-ups alone.
   Finally, in Section 5.2, I examine whether the patterns documented for the 29 countries above
hold more generally around the world. In particular, I rely on the empirical model described above
to study sources of price differences across 54 countries in the ICP dataset for which all variables
are available, and I expand the analysis to as many as 107 countries for which only sales tax data
are lacking. For the set of 54 countries, the median elasticity estimates fall within a very narrow
range of 0.18 to 0.21 for tradable goods and apparel products, respectively; for the larger and very
diverse set of 107 countries, I find median elasticity estimates of 0.13 and 0.19 for tradables and
apparel, respectively. These statistics are remarkably close to the one that I obtain for apparel
products sold by Mango via the Internet. Overall, the robustness of the magnitude of the elasticity
of price with respect to income across different sets of countries yields strong support toward the
role that variable mark-ups play in generating a positive relationship between income and prices

     To suppress retail components, Hummels and Klenow (2005), Hummels and Lugovskyy (2009),
Bastos and Silva (2010), Gorg et al. (2010), Alessandria and Kaboski (2011), Baldwin and Harrigan (2011),
Harrigan et al. (2011), Johnson (2012), and Manova and Zhang (2012) use free-on-board unit values to show that
importers with high per-capita income levels pay high prices for imports from a given source. The observation
may reflect two distinct mechanisms: (i) rich importers demand goods of high quality, as postulated by Verhoogen
(2008) and Fajgelbaum et al. (2011); and (ii) exporters extract high mark-ups for identical goods from rich
importers with low demand elasticities, as argued in the present paper. While the empirical literature has verified
the varying-quality hypothesis, it has been unable to test the presence of variable mark-ups across countries due
to the lack of price data of identical goods. In this paper, I aim to fill this gap.

of tradables around the world.
    The empirical results that I obtain provide support for a theory of varying demand elasticities,
and therefore variable mark-ups. To derive the testable predictions that guide the empirical anal-
ysis, I develop a monopolistic competition model with firms that differ in productivity levels and
consumers whose preferences and non-homothetic. In particular, I employ a utility function that
belongs to the hierarchic-demand class studied by Jackson (1984). Two additional utility func-
tions of this class have been recently introduced to the international-trade literature that features
firm heterogeneity. The first is the linear demand system used by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008)
and the second is the exponential (CARA) utility used by Behrens et al. (2014). Both frame-
works yield identical qualitative predictions as the present model regarding the behavior of prices
within a country. An advantage of the utility parametrization that I introduce is that it maintains
tractability in general equilibrium and it is especially useful for cross-country empirical analysis.
With this in mind, I begin by describing the model.


2         Model
2.1         Consumer Problem
I consider a world that is made up of a finite number of countries, I, engaged in trade of varieties
of a final good. Let i represent an exporter and j an importer.
    I assume that country j is populated by identical consumers of measure Lj who have preferences
over varieties of a good. Varieties originating from different countries enter symmetrically in a
consumer’s utility function according to the following rule

                                                 I Z
                                                 X

                                                 i=1   ω∈Ωij


where qijc (ω) is individual consumption of variety ω from country i in j and q̄ > 0 is a (non-
country-specific) constant. To ensure that the utility function is well defined, I assume that, for
           P
all j, Ωj ≡ Ii=1 Ωij ⊆ Ω̄, where Ω̄ is a compact set containing all potentially-produced varieties.
    The demand for variety ω originating from i that is consumed in a positive amount in j,
qij (ω) > 0, is given by3

                                         qij (ω) = Lj                     − q̄ .                 (1)

In expression (1), yj is consumer income and Nj is the total measure of varieties consumed in j,

                                                     i=1


where Nij is the measure of the set Ωij , which contains varieties originating from i. Furthermore,
Pj is an aggregate price statistic summarized by

                                              I Z
                                              X
                                       Pj =                 pij (ω) dω.                                 (3)
                                              i=1   ω∈Ωij


Several properties of consumer demand are worth noting. The preference relation described above is
non-homothetic. Moreover, the marginal utility from consuming a variety, (qijc (ω)+q̄)−1 , is bounded
from above at any level of consumption. Hence, a consumer does not have positive demand for
all varieties. From the consumer demand in equation (1), let pj max ≡ (yj + q̄Pj )/q̄Nj be the price
at which demand for a variety in country j is driven to 0. This reservation price is lower in more
competitive environments where the aggregate price statistic Pj is lower or the measure of available
varieties Nj is higher. In addition, all else equal, an increase in income yj raises the reservation
price, so consumers are willing to expand their consumption sets. Finally, the (absolute value of
the) price elasticity of demand for variety (ω, i) in j, ǫij (ω) = [1 − (pij (ω)/pj max )]−1 , is falling in
the reservation price. Thus, higher consumer income and lower competition make consumers less
sensitive to price changes, which has implications about the price-setting behavior of firms in such
markets. With this in mind, I turn to describe the firm’s problem next.


2.2    Firm Problem
The environment is static. Each variety is produced by a single firm using constant-returns-to-scale
technology. Labor is the only factor of production. Following Melitz (2003), I assume that firms
differ in their productivity, φ, and country of origin, i.
   In every country i, there exists a pool of potential entrants who pay a one-time cost, fe > 0,
which entitles them to a single productivity draw from a distribution, Gi (φ), with support [bi , ∞).
A measure Ji of firms that are able to cover their marginal cost of production enter. However, only
a subset of productive entrants, Nij , produce and sell to market j. These firms are able to charge
a low enough price so as to generate non-negative demand in expression (1), while making non-
negative profits. Thus, a subset of entrants immediately exit. Hence, in equilibrium, the expected
profit of an entrant is zero. Aggregate profit rebates to each consumer are therefore also zero.
Assuming that each consumer has a unit labor endowment—which, when supplied (inelastically)
to the local labor market earns a wage rate of wj —per-capita income necessarily equals wj .
    Having described the market structure, I proceed to set up an operating firm’s maximization


                                                     6
problem. Let the production function of a firm with productivity draw φ be x(φ) = φl, where l
is the amount of labor used toward the production of final output. Moreover, assume that each
firm from country i wishing to sell to destination j faces an iceberg transportation cost incurred
in terms of labor units, τij ≥ 1, with τii = 1 (∀i). An operating firm must choose the price of its
variety p, accounting for the demand for its product q. I consider a symmetric equilibrium where
all firms of type φ from i choose identical optimal pricing rules. Thus, I can index each variety by
the productivity and the country of origin of its producer, which allows me to rewrite individual
consumer and country demand as follows

                                                        wj + q̄Pj
                                              qijc (φ) =           − q̄,                                             (4)
                                                        Nj pij (φ)
                                                                            
                                                             wj + q̄Pj
                                              qij (φ) = Lj               − q̄ .                                      (5)

Using demand from (5), the profit maximization problem of a firm with productivity φ from
country i that is considering to sell to destination j becomes

To solve this problem, each firm takes as given the measure of competitors Nj and the aggregate
price statistic Pj . Taking first-order conditions, the resulting optimal price that a firm charges for
its variety which is supplied in a positive amount is given by
                                                                                   12
                                                                τij wi wj + q̄Pj

2.3       Productivity Thresholds and Firm-Level Mark-Ups
As noted earlier, in this model, not all firms serve all destinations. In particular, for any pair of
source and destination countries, i and j, only firms originating from country i with productivity
draws φ ≥ φ∗ij sell to market j, where φ∗ij is a productivity threshold defined by4

                                                   φ∗ij = sup {πij (φ) = 0}.
                                                            φ≥bi


Thus, a productivity threshold is the productivity draw of a firm that is indifferent between
serving a market or not, namely one whose variety’s price barely covers the firm’s marginal cost
of production and delivery,
                                                                 τij wi

                                                                   φij

      I restrict fe to ensure that bi ≤ φ∗ij (∀i, j).

The price that a firm would charge for its variety, however, is limited by the variety’s demand, which
diminishes as the variety’s price rises. In particular, it is the case that consumers in destination
j are indifferent between buying the variety of type φ∗ij or not. To see this, from (5), notice that
consumers’ demand is exactly zero for the variety whose price satisfies

                                                 wj + q̄Pj
                                        pij φ∗ij =          .                                     (9)
                                                    Nj q̄

Combining expressions (8) and (9) yields a simple characterization of the threshold

                                                        τij wi Nj q̄
                                              φ∗ij =                 .                           (10)
                                                        wj + q̄Pj

Substituting (10) in (7), the optimal pricing rule of a firm with productivity draw φ ≥ φ∗ij becomes

                                               mark-up marginal cost

 Expression (11) shows that mark-ups vary along two dimensions in this model. First, more produc-
tive firms charge higher mark-ups over marginal cost. This prediction is in line with the behavior
of Slovenian manufacturers, as documented by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). Second, firms’
prices and mark-ups vary systematically with market characteristics, which are summarized by
the threshold that firms must surpass in order to serve a destination. The thresholds are, in turn,
equilibrium objects. Consequently, I proceed to characterize the equilibrium of the model.


2.4    Equilibrium of the World Economy
The subset of entrants from i who surpass the productivity threshold φ∗ij serve destination j. These
firms, denoted by Nij , satisfy

                                        Nij = Ji [1 − Gi (φ∗ij )].                               (12)

Let gi (φ) be the pdf corresponding to the productivity cdf Gi (φ). Then, the conditional density of
firms operating in j is
                                              

                                  µij (φ) =                                                      (13)

With these definitions in mind, the aggregate price statistic in (3) can be rewritten as

                                                  I
                                                  X             Z   ∞

Using the above objects, total sales to country j by firms originating from country i become
                                                    Z      ∞
                                       Tij = Nij                pij (φ)xij (φ)µij (φ)dφ.                             (15)

Furthermore, individual firm profits are the sum of profit flows from each destination that a firm
sells to. Hence, the average profits of firms originating from country i are

                                          I
                                          X                             Z   ∞

where potential profits from destination j are weighted by the probability that they are realized,
1 − Gi (φ∗ij ). Due to free entry, the average profit, in turn, barely covers the fixed cost of entry

                                            I
                                            X                            Z      ∞

3      Model Predictions
In this section, I describe the model’s predictions regarding the behavior of firms within and across
countries. First, I discuss the entry decisions of firms across markets, which sets the stage for the
discussion on price discrimination. Second, I derive novel predictions regarding the firms’ pricing
decisions across countries. Third, I discuss supplementary predictions on the sales of exporters,
which help place the model in an empirical context.
   In order to analytically solve the model and to derive stark predictions at the firm and aggre-
gate levels, I follow Chaney (2008) and assume that firm productivities are drawn from a Pareto
distribution with cdf Gi (φ) = 1 − bθi /φθ , pdf gi (φ) = θbθi /φθ+1, and shape parameter θ > 1. The
support of the distribution is [bi , ∞), where bi summarizes the level of technology in country i.5
Moreover, varying levels of technology are related to per-capita income differences across coun-
tries. In particular, a relatively high bi represents a more technologically-advanced country. Such
a country is characterized by relatively more productive firms, whose marginal costs of production
are low, and by richer consumers, who enjoy higher wages.6


3.1     Firm Entry
In this model, only the most productive subset of domestic entrants serves the foreign destinations,
as long as trade barriers are sufficiently high. From expression (12), under the assumption that
firm productivities are Pareto-distributed, the subset of entrants from country i who serve market
j is inversely related to the productivity threshold φ∗ij and given by Li bθi [(θ + 1)fe (φ∗ij )θ ]−1 , where7

                                                                      (                         1

                            φ∗ij =                                1                                  .            (18)

The productivity threshold for firms from source i to sell to destination j depends on three sets of
parameters: (i) economy-wide parameters (fe , θ, q̄); (ii) trade costs and per-capita income levels of
                                                                          P
the pair of countries (τij , wi , wj ); (iii) general equilibrium object ( Iυ=1 Lυ bθυ (τυj wυ )−θ ). Looking
at comparative statics, the last term suggests that the larger and the more productive any country
is, the higher is the productivity threshold to access a given destination j. For a given entry cost,
larger markets allow for more domestic entrants, thus raising the total number of firms in the
world economy and generating tougher competition for any firm in any market. Similarly, higher
expected productivities of average entrants in any country give rise to tougher competition in the
   5
     Since the unconditional mean of the Pareto distribution is bi θ/(θ − 1), a ratio of bi ’s reflects the relative
(unconditional) mean productivities of two countries. All predictions derived in the remainder of the paper are
identical if instead I set bi = bj = b for all i 6= j and let firms’ production functions be xi (φ) = Ai φl, where Ai is
country-specific total factor productivity.
   6
     In Appendix A.2, I show that, in general equilibrium, a relative increase in bi increases the relative wage in i.

world economy for any firm.
   Unlike market size and productivity, trade costs and per-capita income levels of different coun-
tries have differing effects on productivity thresholds. For exporter i and importer j, a relative
increase in the exporter’s wage rate or trade cost to destination j raises the productivity threshold
that firms from i need in order to access market j. The intuition for this result is simple: the
higher is the relative wage rate or trade barrier of an exporting country, the higher is the marginal
cost that the firms originating from that country face, relative to other exporters. Consequently,
firms from i need a higher productivity level in order to reach destination j. Increases in the
marginal cost of production of any other potential exporter to market j on the other hand lower
the productivity threshold for firms from i.
   Finally, a key characteristic that determines firm access to a destination is the market’s per-
capita income level. A rise in wj lowers the threshold in (18), thus raising the measure of entrants
there. The result is an artifact of the “bounded marginal utility” property of consumer prefer-
ences. Since the marginal utility of any variety is bounded from above at any level of consumption,
the consumer spends her limited income on the subset of potentially-produced items whose prices
do not exceed the reservation price. An increase in an individual’s income raises the reserva-
tion price making new varieties desriable and the consumer expands her consumption bundle.
Hence, the model yields a positive link between countries’ per-capita incomes and the set of pur-
chased, including imported, varieties, which is in line with empirical findings by Jackson (1984),
Hunter and Markusen (1988), Hunter (1991), Movshuk (2004), and Hummels and Klenow (2005).
   Overall, country characteristics systematically affect productivity thresholds and consequently
the measure of competitors in each destination. These pro-competitive effects directly translate
into varieties’ prices, which I examine next.


3.2    Price Discrimination
In this section, I discuss the predictions of the model regarding the variation of relative prices of
identical items with respect to key country characteristics. Appendix A.3 contains the proofs.
    Expression (11) showed that firm mark-ups across markets depend inversely on the productivity
thresholds of the destinations. Moreover, the previous section demonstrates that the threshold is
a decreasing function of the per-capita income of the destination. Hence, a rise in the per-capita
income in a market raises the price of a variety sold there.
    The intuition behind the result lies in the relationship between the elasticity of substitution
across varieties and consumer income. Recall that agents expand their consumption bundles when
their income rises, as discussed above. However, a rise in consumer income also increases the
consumption of each positively-consumed variety. To see this, substitute (10) and (11) into (4) to




                                                 11
obtain the following expression for an individual’s consumption of an item
                                                               "           12     #
                                                                     φ

The right-hand side of expression (19) falls in the cutoff productivity, so the quantity consumed rises
in individual income. But, variations in consumption change elasticities of substitution and con-
sequently affect prices of varieties. The elasticity of substitution for any two positively-consumed
varieties in j, that are produced by firms with productivities φ1 and φ2 , which originate from
countries i and i′ respectively, is
                                                               "                      #

As the consumer becomes richer, she consumes more of each variety, which drives down the elastic-
ity of substitution between positively-consumed varieties. Prices of these varieties rise in response.
    Another intuitive explanation of the price increase due to higher income involves ordering
varieties according to their “importance” to the consumer. As consumer income rises, new varieties
produced by less productive firms are added to the consumption set. Conversely, if individual
income were to fall, the new varieties are the first to be dropped from a consumer’s bundle. Thus,
the preference relation is “hierarchic”—a term introduced to the consumer-choice literature by
Jackson (1984). The newly-added varieties are less important than the previously-consumed ones,
which results in a fall in the demand elasticities of the latter. Hence, as income rises, prices of all
previously-consumed varieties also rise.
    To see this, from (11) and (19), note that the (absolute value of the) price elasticity of demand
for variety (φ, i) in j is
                                                           "                − 12 #−1

If the per-capita income in market j rises, the productivity threshold falls. According to expression
(20), the demand for a variety becomes less elastic. However, the elasticity of demand is reflected
in the price of the item, which can be seen by combining expressions (11) and (20) to obtain

                                                               τij wi ǫij (φ)

As consumer income rises, demand becomes less elastic, which allows firms to raise their prices.
   Having described the behavior of prices within a country, it is easy to understand how prices
of identical items vary across countries. Consider a firm with productivity φ, originating from i

 The relative per-capita income levels of the two countries have opposing effects on the relative price
of an identical item across destinations. The first term in expression (22) suggests that a relative
increase in country j’s per-capita income (keeping country k’s per-capita income unchanged) raises
the relative price of the variety there. This direct effect of per-capita income on prices is due to the
assumed non-homotheticity in consumer preferences discussed above. However, the relative rise of
country j’s per-capita income affects prices via the general equilibrium object in expression (22)
as well. To get intuition on this object, it is useful to derive the bilateral trade or market shares.
First, multiply (19) by the destination’s size Lj to obtain the quantity sold in j by a firm with
productivity φ from i. To derive i’s total sales in j, substitute this quantity, as well as the price
from (11), the conditional density from (13) under the Pareto parametrization, and the measure of
exporters from the previous subsection into expression (15). Then, using expression (18) and the
fact that τij wi /φ∗ij = τjj wj /φ∗jj (∀i 6= j) (which is apparent in expression (10)), the import share
of i-goods in j can be defined as

                                               Tij                 Li bθi (τij wi )−θ

Finally, substitute (23) into (22) to obtain the following testable prediction that links relative
prices to measurable variables

 The third object above suggests that the relative price of a given variety from source i in two
countries is increasing in the relative market shares of firms from i in the two destinations. The
per-capita income levels of the countries in turn affect these market shares. An increase in country
j’s per-capita income (keeping country k’s per-capita income unchanged) raises the marginal cost
of production of firms from country j making them less competitive on the world market. As a
result, firms from other countries gain world market shares. In particular, firms originating from
country i increase their market shares in both destinations j and k. If the increase in market share

                                                            13
in j is at least as large as in k, then the effect of relative per-capita income increases on relative
prices via market shares is non-negative. A sufficient condition to ensure that relative market
shares are non-decreasing in relative per-capita incomes of destinations is that trade barriers obey
the triangle inequality. Proposition 1 below summarizes the result.

Proposition 1. If trade barriers obey the triangle inequality, (∀j, k, υ)τυj τjk ≥ τυk , then the relative
price of a variety sold in two markets is strictly rising in the markets’ relative per-capita incomes.

       Intuitively, for a given variety that is sold in two markets, the consumers in the rich country
are less responsive to price changes than the consumers in the poor one. A firm exploits this
opportunity, amid trade barriers that segment the markets, and charges a high mark-up in the
affluent destination.
    Before engaging in empirical analysis, it is important to note from expression (23) that des-
tinations’ population sizes affect market shares. Consider an increase in the population size of
country j, while keeping k’s characteristics fixed. Then, the measure of entrants from j increases,
which strengthens competition, thus reducing the market shares of other countries. In particular,
firms originating from country i experience a fall in their market shares in both destinations j and
k. If the fall in market share in j is at least as large as in k, then the effect of relative population
size increases on relative prices via market shares is non-positive. A sufficient condition to ensure
that relative market shares are non-increasing (strictly decreasing) in relative population sizes of
destinations is that trade barriers obey the triangle inequality (strictly for at least one source
country). Proposition 2 below summarizes the result.

Proposition 2. Given relative per-capita income levels, for any two countries, j and k, j 6= k, if
trade barriers obey the triangle inequality, (∀υ)τυj τjk ≥ τυk , and if the inequality for at least one
υ 6= j is strict, then the relative price of a variety sold in markets j and k is strictly decreasing in
the relative population sizes of the markets.

    To summarize, in this model, trade barriers, per-capita income levels, and market shares shape
prices across countries. In particular, the relative price of a given variety in a pair of countries
is increasing in the relative trade barriers and per-capita income levels of the two destinations.
Furthermore, the relative price is increasing in the relative market shares of the exporting country
in the two destinations. Destination per-capita income and population size, in turn, affect relative
prices indirectly via market shares. If trade barriers obey the (strict) triangle inequality, relative
market shares, and therefore relative prices, are (strictly) increasing in relative per-capita incomes
and (strictly) decreasing in relative population sizes of the two destinations.8
    Finally, since mark-ups are destination-specific in this model, it is worth pointing out the
differences between prices that are inclusive of trade costs, such as the ones described above, and
   8
    Note that, since per-capita income also directly affects prices, a weak triangle inequality is in fact sufficient to
ensure that relative prices are strictly rising in relative per-capita incomes.

(24) by τik /τij arrives at relative FOB prices between destinations j and k,

Clearly, the predictions regarding the effect of relative per-capita incomes and population sizes on
relative prices are unchanged. Moreover, it is straightforward to verify that relative FOB prices
are decreasing in relative trade barriers. This prediction of the model, however, is not tested in
the empirical analysis due to data limitations; in the present dataset, observed prices are inclusive
of trade costs and an exact ad valorem measure of trade costs is not available.


3.3       Firm Sales
As discussed in Section 3.1, according to this model, only the most productive domestic entrants
export. Moreover, ranking export destinations according to their accessibility, which is summarized
by the productivity thresholds, implies that more productive firms export to more destinations.
To study the sales behavior of each firm, multiply consumer demand in (19) by the destination’s
size Lj to obtain the quantity sold in j by a firm with productivity φ from i, denoted by xij (φ).
Firm sales per destination are the product of the quantity and the price and are given by
                                                                    "    ∗  12 #
                                                             τij wi      φij

According to expression (26), firm sales in a destination are falling in the productivity threshold
that characterizes the market. From the discussion in Section 3.1, it follows that a firm realizes
higher sales in a richer (in per-capita terms) market. However, the effect of country size on firm
sales is ambiguous. On the one hand, a more populated market yields more sales. On the other
hand, larger markets are more competitive and therefore the productivity thresholds associated
with them are higher. Hence, from (26), it follows that only the very productive firms will be able
to overcome the pro-competitive effects in larger markets and enjoy the benefits of selling to more
consumers. Appendix A.3 characterizes the productivity thresholds for the latter firms.


3.4       Relation to Existing Literature
The utility function that I employ in the model described above represents a preference relation
that is non-homothetic.9 In particular, it yields hierarchic demand due to bounded marginal
  9
      Non-homothetic preferences have made a come-back in international trade (Markusen (2013) and Fieler (2011)).

                                                                15
utility of consumption.10 Two additional functional forms that belong to the class of hierarchic
demand systems have recently been introduced to the international trade literature featuring firm
heterogeneity. First, Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) use linear demand for varieties to study how
mark-ups respond to changes in market size and trade policy. Their framework features a numéraire
good that is produced with identical linear technology across countries and is freely traded. These
assumptions imply wage equalization across countries and thus income effects on prices are absent
from their model. In Supplementary Appendix I, I drop the numéraire good and I characterize
the general equilibrium of the model of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) allowing for income effects.
I then demonstrate that, in the augmented model, the price of a variety responds to changes
in per-capita income and market size in the same qualitative fashion as in the model that I
introduce in the present paper. However, upon inspecting the individual firm’s pricing rule obtained
from Melitz and Ottaviano’s (2008) model, one can verify that the behavior of relative prices
across countries can only be studied numerically. In addition, a testable prediction linking relative
prices to measurable variables across countries cannot be derived since thresholds are not explicit
functions of parameters and wages.
   Second, Behrens et al. (2014) employ exponential (CARA) utility in a general equilibrium
model of international trade with heterogeneous firms. They use the model to quantitatively
assess the effects of the Canada-US trade liberalization on regional market aggregates such as
wages, productivity, mark-ups, the mass of produced and consumed varieties, as well as welfare.
While their model has desirable aggregate properties such as a gravity equation of trade under
Pareto-distributed firm productivities, individual-firm prices and mark-ups are characterized via
the Lambert-W function. Behrens et al. (2014) demonstrate that their model predicts a similar
response of the price of a variety to changes in market characteristics as the framework that I
develop. However, due to lack of tractability, relative prices across countries can only be examined
numerically and a testable prediction that relates them to measurable variables is not available.
In contrast, the non-homothetic preference representation that I employ offers tractability and it
allows me to obtain a testable prediction that links relative prices to measurable variables, one of
which is per-capita income.
   In the model outlined in this paper, the price of a variety reflects the firm’s marginal cost of
production and delivery and the consumer’s demand elasticity in a country, which can be seen from
expression (21). Since the elasticity in expression (20) depends on the productivity threshold, it
falls in the per-capita income and rises in the size of the destination. The effects are a byproduct
  10
    This feature of the utility function gives consumption sets that are expanding in per-capita income. Sauré (2012)
exploits this feature of the utility function in the homogeneous monopolistic-competition framework of Krugman
(1980) and derives a positive relationship between per-capita income and the extensive margin of imports. The
author’s theoretical results are consistent with the empirical findings of Hummels and Klenow (2005) and Feenstra
(2010). Relatedly, Bertoletti and Etro (2013) and Ushchev et al. (2014) provide characterization of monopolistic
competition under more general preferences and discuss implications for trade flows and pricing. Finally, Young
(1991) used the preference relation employed in the present paper in a Ricardian framework to analyze the growth
patterns of countries when firms engage in learning-by-doing.


                                                         16
of the assumed non-homothetic preference relation.
    Before proceeding to the empirical section, it is important to note that alternative explanations
of varying demand elasticities, and therefore varying prices, exist. Hummels and Lugovskyy (2009)
use a Lancaster (1979) model to argue that richer agents consume more per good, which makes
them more finicky and more willing to pay a high price in order to get closer to consuming their
ideal variety. In their model, larger and richer (in per-capita terms) markets attract more firms and
are consequently more competitive, which forces firms to charge lower prices there. Overall, the
pro-competitive effect associated with higher per-capita income dominates the finickiness effect,
so their model predicts that relative prices of identical varieties are lower in relatively richer (in
per-capita terms) markets, after controlling for market population size differences. In contrast,
the present model predicts that relative prices of identical varieties are relatively higher in richer
markets, after controlling for market size differences. In the empirical section that follows, I find
that relative prices are increasing in relative per-capita income levels, after controlling for market
(population) sizes.
   Another strand of literature that studies the interaction between varying demand elasticities
and prices emphasizes the importance of search frictions. Lach (2007) hypothesizes that prices of
consumption goods in Israel fell in the 1990s because there was a flow of immigrants with low search
costs and high demand elasticities into the country during the period. Alessandria and Kaboski
(2011) develop a formal search model where households send out shoppers to browse price quotes
and to buy goods. Shopping takes time away from work. Having obtained price quotes, a shopper
purchases one unit of the good if the lowest price quote is below some reservation level. Each
household is indifferent between raising the reservation price and sending out additional shoppers,
so the reservation price is higher in higher-wage countries. A large number of firms offer the
same good to consumers in two different countries and take the price distribution as well as the
reservation price of consumers as given. If the firm’s price is lower than the reservation price, the
firm sells to customers with one price quote. By increasing its price, the firm increases its revenue
per sale but decreases the likelihood of a sale, since it increases the probability that customers
with two price quotes have a second price quote that is lower than the firm’s price. Any price on
the support of the distribution results in identical firm profits, so firms choose to randomize. The
mean transacted price is higher in the country with a higher wage because consumers search for
price quotes less intensively there.
    While the search framework can account for the observed price variation in household items,
there is considerable room for a complementary explanation of the positive relationship between
prices of tradables and per-capita income that builds on non-homothetic preferences. In the model
of Alessandria and Kaboski (2011), consumers purchase the same set of goods independently of
their income levels. Hence, the model yields no systematic relationship between the extensive
margin of trade and per-capita income. In contrast, Jackson (1984), Hunter and Markusen (1988),
Hunter (1991), Movshuk (2004), and Hummels and Klenow (2005) document a positive link be-

                                                 17
tween the set of (imported and) consumed varieties and consumers’ income. This positive link is
a key prediction of the model that relies on non-homothetic preferences and it is at the heart of
the mechanism that relates prices to per-capita income.
   In sum, although existing models that generate varying demand elasticities can explain the
positive relationship between prices of tradables and per-capita income, a mechanism that combines
monopolistically-competitive firms and consumers with non-homothetic preferences does not only
account for the observed price variation in the data, but is also consistent with broader empirical
regularities in the international trade literature.


4       Empirical Evidence of Price Discrimination
In this section, I present a unique database that features prices of identical goods sold online,
which allows me to establish a link between demand elasticities and mark-ups across countries.
Guided by the model that I develop in previous sections, but also accounting for the particulars
of the dataset, I estimate the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita income.


4.1     Description of Data
4.1.1    Mango Price Data

I collect prices from the online catalogues of a Spanish apparel manufacturer called Mango.

Why Mango? Three unique features of the data allow me to empirically test the price-discrimination
hypothesis. First, products sold in each market are identical, so quality differences are not respon-
sible for the variation in prices across markets. This feature of the data distinguishes the analysis
from studies that employ unit values (see Hummels and Klenow (2005), Hummels and Lugovskyy
(2009), Bastos and Silva (2010), Gorg et al. (2010), Alessandria and Kaboski (2011), Harrigan et al.
(2011), Baldwin and Harrigan (2011), Johnson (2012), and Manova and Zhang (2012)). Second,
the products employed in the analysis are sold exclusively online and they are not available in
Mango’s physical stores ensuring that the items’ prices are not set to match the in-store prices,
which may reflect local wages, rents, and distribution mark-ups, as in Hsieh and Klenow (2007),
Alessandria and Kaboski (2011), Crucini et al. (2005a), Crucini et al. (2005b), Crucini and Shintani
(2008), Crucini and Yilmazkuday (2014), Goldberg and Verboven (2001), Goldberg and Verboven
(2005), Ghosh and Wolf (1994), and Haskel and Wolf (2001). Third, the items used in the study
are produced in, stored in, and shipped from a single location to all destinations via DHL Ex-
press. These circumstances, together with information on Mango’s shipping and handling policy
and DHL’s pricing policy, allow me to first construct measures of transaction prices for Mango
items, and then disentangle destination-specific shipping costs from mark-ups. Below, I describe
the company and the dataset in detail.

Company Profile. “MANGO Fashion for the young, urban woman” is Mango’s tagline. The
company is a leader in fashionable, yet affordable, apparel and footwear products that target
middle-income female consumers. In 2008, Mango established a men’s line, H.E. by Mango; in 2011
the company launched an accessories line, Touch by Mango; and in 2013 it introduced Mango Kids
and Mango Sports&Intimates. Kordecka and Ricart (2009) describe Mango as being sandwiched
between Zara (Inditex)—Spain’s largest textile producer—and Sweden’s H&M on the bottom,
and bridge fashion brands such as USA’s Ralph Lauren Polo and Italy’s Diesel on the top. While
Mango’s main competitors are often quoted to be Zara and H&M, these firms offer cheaper products
aimed for mass consumption (see Mango case studies by Pinilla (2007) and Kordecka and Ricart
(2009)). The company opened its first store in Barcelona in 1984. As of 2013, Mango products
were sold in 2598 physical locations (902 Mango stores and 1696 franchises) in 109 countries as
well as via the company’s website.11 Mango’s financial statement dated December 31, 2012 shows
that total annual sales amounted to 1.691 billion Euro, out of which 84 percent was generated
from exports. Mango is the second largest textile exporter in Spain and employs 12,211 people.

       Mango is a highly-productive exporter when viewed through the lense of the model. First,
Mango serves a very large number of markets. Second, Table 1 shows that Mango exports higher
volumes to richer and bigger markets. These observations are in line with the model’s predictions
discussed in Section 3.3 above.
  Admittedly, Mango is more complex than the typical firm described in the theory. For ex-
ample, Mango does not produce items in house; instead it designs all products and sources the
finished goods from suppliers based predominantly in China, Morocco, and Turkey (Exhibit 2 in
Kordecka and Ricart (2009)). Yet, key elements of Mango’s operations make the company well
suited for an empirical examination of price discrimination. Based on interviews with Mango’s
management, Kordecka and Ricart (2009) document that Mango sources a given product from
a particular supplier, regardless of the market to which the product is ultimately sold. Hence,
marginal costs of production for a given good are identical across markets.12 In addition, all items

  12
     To verify the information, I conducted a controlled experiment whereby I purchased an identical item from
Mango’s online store and had it directly dispatched to a customer in every destination analyzed in this paper.


                                                        19
are stored in a single warehouse located in Palau de Plegamans, Spain, and dispatched via a third
party to all destinations. Thus, prices of Mango items do not reflect destination-specific production
and storage costs. Pinilla (2007) document, however, that prices of items sold in physical Mango
outlets reflect the costs associated with: (i) delivering items from Spain to their final destination,
and (ii) operating the local store (ex. rents and wages). For these reasons, I focus on Mango’s
online store, which I describe next.

Online Store. What makes Mango particularly well suited for a price discrimination study is the
fact that, for a subset of countries, the company operates an online store at http://shop.mango.com.
In my interview with Professor Joan Enric Ricart (IESE), the Mango case study author describes
the online store as “just another Mango store”—the biggest one in fact. The online catalogue con-
stitutes Mango’s entire collection of the season, which features more than one thousand products
offered in all the participating countries. Each item in the catalogue has a unique name and an
8-digit code reported in every country, which ensures accuracy and facilitates data collection.
    Mango is a pioneer and a leader in online apparel retail as it launched its online store as
early as year 2000. According to Kordecka and Ricart (2009), in 2007, the online store had a
million visitors per month and accounted for a mere 0.4% of total sales, with Germany and the
UK accounting for more that half of that statistic. By 2012, Mango’s online sales accounted for
4% of total sales—a number that the company aimed to double in 2013.13 The statistic compares
favorably to Zara’s online sales, which accounted for 2.5% of the company’s turnover in 2012, with
H&M lagging behind as it only serves a handful of markets online.14 Mango strives to create a
virtual shopping experience that mimics customers’ experience in their physical “boutiques” as
much as possible. In addition, Mango is a very active participant in social media outlets and has
launched a Mobile App. To summarize, in the (post-)financial crisis era of falling profit margins
per physical store, the online store is Mango’s growth engine in developed and emerging markets.
   The online store, however, is dynamic in nature as the number of countries that it serves
grows annually. In year 2012—when this study was conducted—Mango’s online store served 39
distinct countries: 2 in North America, 7 in Asia, and the remainder in Europe. A subset of 29
countries shared two key characteristics that deem them suitable for the empirical study of price
discrimination.

1. Online-Only Catalogue. As mentioned above, the online store offers the entire Mango
collection of the season, a portion of which is also sold in the company’s physical stores. Should
the company be matching the prices of the items via the two outlets, the items’ online prices would
reflect local non-tradable contributions per Mango’s pricing policy described above. For this reason,

I restrict the empirical analysis to only those items that are sold exclusively online. The online-
only products include apparel, footwear, and accessories, much like the in-store products, and the
price range of the items in the two outlets is similar.15 According to Kordecka and Ricart (2009),
physical Mango stores are boutiques rather than warehouses—they carry a limited selection of the
collection that customers can try on and buy. In order to maintain the appearance of a boutique
and to minimize storage costs, Mango offers a large fraction of its collection exclusively online.
    I consider products from the Summer 2012 catalogue, which became available online in April
of 2012.16 In this catalogue, there are 245 items in total sold exclusively online to 29 markets in
Europe, North America, and Asia. These items are easily identifiable on the website as they are
given an explicit label: “exclusively online”. In addition, one can manually verify that the items
are not available in any physical store in the 29 markets using Mango’s ”Search In Store” button.17

2. Uniform Shipping & Handling Policy. The online store segments national markets. Each
participating country has a website and customers from one country cannot buy products from
another country’s website due to shipping restrictions. Thus, a customer with a shipping address
in Germany can only have items delivered to her if purchased from the German Mango website. As
described earlier, Mango’s products are stored and dispatched from a single warehouse in Palau de
Plegamans, Spain, to all destinations. Crucially, online-only items are neither shipped to a physical
store first, nor is their price chosen to match the price in a physical outlet. For the 29 markets
included in this study, upon receiving an online order, Mango ships items via DHL Express.18
  15
      One concern is that the price of online-and-in-store products affects the price of online-only items, in which case
local costs that shape in-store product prices may be reflected also in online-only prices. Examining online-only
products minimizes potential biases due to local costs as much as possible; however, the possibility of a bias cannot
be excluded. The direction of the bias, however, is unclear. In order to generate an interaction between the prices
of goods produced by a multi-product firm, one must depart from a monopolistically-competitive environment in
favor of a model where multi-product firms compete à la Bertrand or Cournot (see Eckel and Neary (2009) and
Feenstra and Ma (2007)). In such environments, an increase in the cost and hence price of one good (ex. in-store
good due to a rise in a non-tradable cost component) results in a fall/rise in the price of the other good sold by the
same firm in the same market (ex. online-only good) if the other good is a substitute/complement. This suggests
that, in richer countries, characterized by higher local costs, Mango would price online-only goods at a lower/higher
price than online-and-in-store goods if the former are substitutes/complements; hence, the elasticity of price with
respect to income obtained from online-only data would be underestimated for some products and overestimated
for others. I leave it to future research to explore this theoretical result in a multi-country setting where markets
are characterized by different per-capita income levels and local costs. Bekkers and Simonovska (2015) take a first
step in this direction and study the behavior of single-product firms with market power.
   16
      Summer and Winter 2008 catalogue data yield similar results, which are available upon request. While the
multiple-season data minimizes the possibility of seasonal bias, the number of goods and countries in the 2008 sample
is smaller. Moreover, in 2008, Mango’s website did not distinguish between items that were available exclusively
online versus in physical stores as well. The distinction is very important in order to minimize any biases that arise
due to non-tradable price components.
   17
      As of 2014, it appears that Mango is no longer labeling items as“exclusively online”, although manual verification
is still available. Clearly, this would make new data collection efforts much more difficult. To my knowledge, unlike
its competitors who are listed above, Mango is the only retailer for which one can verify the fact that items are sold
exclusively online and that they are produced, stored, and shipped from a single location to all the destinations.
   18
      I conducted a controlled experiment and collected DHL tracking codes for an identical item sent to all destina-
tions and verified that the shipping and production origin are identical, regardless of destination.

       Mango’s shipping and handling policy is as follows: (i) if a purchase is below a minimum value,
then the customer pays an explicit flat shipping fee; (ii) if a purchase is above a minimum value,
then the customer pays a lower explicit flat fee (often zero). Both the fees and the minimum value
vary by country and are summarized in Table 2.19 Supplementary Appendix VI contains further
details regarding Mango’s shipping and handling charges and provides insights into the magnitudes
of these charges compared to items’ prices.
    The shipping and handling policy of Mango is symptomatic of a quantity-discount pricing
rule typically employed by online retailers who face heterogeneous consumers within and across
markets.20 The results from the empirical analysis that follows suggest that Mango’s shipping and
handling charges primarily reflect the company’s shipping costs to, and back from, each market.
The latter relates to Mango’s return policy. Table 3 documents Mango’s return and exchange policy
for the 29 markets studied in this paper.21 The second (fifth) column states whether an item can
  19
      Note that: (i) Mango’s shipping and handling fees apply to all items purchased online: both online-only items
and items that are available online and in stores; (ii) As of May 2014, Mango has eliminated the positive charge for
purchases above threshold and has reduced the shipping charges for purchases below the threshold.
   20
      To illustrate the pricing rule, consider the simplest two-consumer-type scenario. A firm faces low- and high-
valuation consumers in a given market, where valuation is positively linked to consumer income in preference
specifications that feature income effects (see Chapter 3 in Tirole (1988)). In order to serve both consumer types
(within a country), the firm offers the following price menu: a low per-unit price for purchases above a cutoff (the
quantity discount) and a high per-unit price otherwise. The number of combinations of cutoffs and per-unit prices
increase with the number of consumer types in a market. Across segmented markets (for example countries), the
firm price discriminates as predicted by the model developed in the present paper. In particular, the firm enjoys
higher mark-ups in markets with higher per-consumer income due to the higher average valuation of the good there.
   21
      Note that, like Mango’s shipping and handling fees, the return and exchange policy applies to all items purchased


                                                          22
be returned in a physical store, while the third (sixth) column states whether the shipping address
for returns by mail is in the destination country (local) or in Spain. Destinations differ along
both dimensions. Mango allows customers to return items in physical stores in some countries and
not in others. In addition, there are countries in which Mango allows size exchanges only, which
obviously does not apply to the online-only items analyzed in this paper as physical stores do not
carry them. Hence, these destinations can be grouped with the ones in which no in-store returns
and exchanges are allowed for the purpose of the study. Finally, in certain countries, returns can
only be processed in a single physical store but not in other stores. Differences arise with respect
to returns via mail as well. Customers in one group of countries must mail returns to Spain, while
customers in another group must mail returns to a local address. A third set of customers can
only return items via mail by scheduling a home pick-up by a delivery service.

   According to Ricart, the reasons behind the country-specific return and exchange policy range
from logistical capabilities to government regulations. In addition, it is very likely that the return
and exchange policy will change as Mango’s e-commerce evolves. For the study of price discrimi-
nation, the key concern is that Mango’s costs to process returns, adjusted by the probability of a
return, may be country-specific and may be reflected in the item’s price. For this reason, I control
for Mango’s return policy in the empirical analysis which follows.
    With the shipping and handling policy in mind, the challenge that remains is to construct
per-unit (or transaction) prices for each country accounting for the existence of different types of
online: both online-only items and items that are available online and in stores.

consumers within each country.22 I consider three cases. In the first, and benchmark, specifica-
tion, I construct per-good prices inclusive of shipping costs, assuming that each agent in every
destination purchases a single item only. If the price for item m in destination j is (i) below the
minimum-purchase requirement as listed in Table 2, I add the flat shipping fee listed in the third
(seventh) column to the item’s price; (ii) above the minimum-purchase requirement, I add the flat
shipping fee listed in the fourth (eighth) column to the item’s price. In the second specification,
found in Section 4.2.3, I instead assume that consumers are “shipping-cost minimizers”—they pur-
chase just enough so as to satisfy the minimum threshold listed in Table 2. In this case, I spread
the flat shipping fee for purchases above the threshold over the bundle of goods—namely, I scale
the prices of goods by the ad valorem shipping fee.23 In the third case, contained in Supplementary
Appendix V, I verify that the estimates of the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita income
are robust when analyzing items’ prices as listed on Mango’s website—namely, prices that do not
explicitly account for the shipping and handling charges.

Additional Considerations. Above I describe the two main criteria for featuring 29 markets in
the study. In this section, I discuss the remaining 10 countries that were excluded from the study.
The USA, China (mainland), India, Malaysia, Philippines, Turkey, and Russia were excluded
because of different shipping and handling policies. As Kordecka and Ricart (2009) and Pinilla
(2007) document, Mango rents a warehouse in New Jersey which distributes items within the
USA. The online store, however, serves Canadian consumers directly from Spain, which is not
coincidental. Pinilla (2007) documents that Mango entered Canada prior to entering the USA
for two reasons: (i) Mango’s management perceives the Canadian market as more similar to the
European markets rather than to the US market24 ; (ii) US import quotas on textiles from China
complicated the production process, as Mango had to look for suitable suppliers who also had
a quota for bringing garments into the USA. With these considerations in mind, Mango’s entry
strategy to the USA was delayed and different in nature compared to the Canadian and European
markets. In fact, Mango entered the US market neither via a franchise nor by opening its own
store. Instead, Mango penetrated the US market by partnering up with JC Penny and opening
stands inside their stores.25
    Similarly, India, Malaysia, and the Philippines are excluded from the study because these
markets are served from Mango’s distribution center in Singapore, while China is served from a
  22
     Due to the lack of a time-series dimension to the dataset, one type of consumer that I do not obtain insights
on is the “sale shopper”. Chevalier and Kashyap (2011) document that, due to the existence of such consumers,
the average transacted price over time is a weighted average of a listed price and a sales price. With their findings
in mind, an important extension of the present study would be to examine Mango’s dynamic pricing over time and
across countries.
  23
     For example, in Cyprus, I multiply each item’s price by the fraction 3.95/150.
  24
     In line with this, in the first round of study that I conducted using 2008 data, the US online store featured an
entirely different collection from the European and Canadian counterparts.

local warehouse (see Pinilla (2007)). At the time that I conducted the study, I verified that Hong
Kong, Macao, and Japan were served directly from Spain, which is not coincidental. Pinilla (2007)
documents that Mango’s management views Euro, Yen, and Dollar (broadly defined) zones as
“safe” and the company has traditionally entered these markets predominantly via wholly-owned
shops as opposed to franchises. Similarly, Mango has a common policy across these markets with
respect to the online store.
    Russia was also excluded due to differences in shipping and handling policies. A local carrier,
rather than DHL, operates in Russia and the origin of the shipment could not be verified after
repeated attempts. In addition, Pinilla (2007) quotes Mango’s management that “... it is very
complicated to manage in countries like Russia, where an informal economy abounds. Given the
specific peculiarities of this country, in this case, it is better for a local businessman to do it as
he knows what is going on.... A local businessman is used to working in an unstable environment,
while the company is not used to working in this type of environment. It is easier for the local
businessman to work in this way.”
    Finally, I exclude France, Italy, and Portugal from the study because the online exclusive
collection was not offered there as such.26 In fact, I manually verified that all of the online-only
items are sold in these markets, however, they are not sold exclusively online and are not labelled
as such. I verified that the items are available in physical stores in these markets via the ”Search In
Store” button. What makes these markets different? In 2010, these three markets constituted 15%
of Mango’s total sales, and Pinilla (2007) notes that Mango operates so-called flagship stores in
these countries.27 Flagship stores carry the entire collection, are very large and centrally located,
and are the “face of the company.” So, it is likely that these stores hold a large enough stock
of items to be able to satisfy the (local) demand from online customers as well. In sum, these
markets were dropped from the analysis since Mango appears to be solving a different problem
there compared to the remaining 29 countries.28
   Admittedly, having excluded certain countries from the study, the sample size is not very large.
Nonetheless, the 29 markets that I use in this study account for almost 50% of Mango’s sales in
2010. Hence, these countries are highly representative of Mango’s operations, which makes them
interesting to study. A study that is tailored to the special-case countries discussed above would
  26
     These markets were included in the previous study that featured Summer and Winter 2008 catalogue data and
yielded similar results, which are available upon request. See footnote 16 above for details.
  27
     Mango also operates such stores in the home market, Spain, where the items were also not labelled as online-
only. However, all prices in the empirical exercises that follow are computed relative to prices in Spain and all
regressions include a constant term. Thus, even if Spanish prices reflect a non-traded component, the effect is
captured by the constant term.
  28
     As a multi-product firm, Mango jointly chooses the product mix and the per-product price for each market. If
the product mix is country-specific and prices feature cannibalization effects, as in the models by Eckel and Neary
(2009) and Feenstra and Ma (2007), then there would be systematic differences in prices across countries and
products—a feature that is absent from the model that I develop. Since product-country-specific fixed effects
cannot be identified in the empirical analysis due to the nature of the dataset (M products in N countries in a
given year), I only consider the 29 markets in which Mango’s optimal product mix is identical.

be less general and less informative of the pricing practices of typical online retailers.

4.1.2      Additional Data

As noted above, Mango’s shipping and handling provider in the 29 markets I study is DHL. While,
information on the actual cost of shipping and handling that Mango incurs is not publicly available,
I can proxy the costs by using reported DHL prices. I collect price quotes for one-time identical
shipments to all the destinations in the sample from the Spanish DHL website. I verify that DHL
offers percentage discounts to the quoted prices to corporations that carry out multiple shipments.
Crucially, these discounts are not destination-specific, so they do not affect the relative price that
a client pays to ship to different destinations. For example, a client who ships $1500 worth of
merchandise per month receives a 32% discount on all shipments regardless of the destination.29
I use logged DHL shipping prices, normalized by the price to ship within Spain, to approximate
Mango’s cost to ship to its export markets, relative to the domestic costs of transport. In Section
4.2.3, I demonstrate that the results are robust to controlling for standard gravity variables.
    Prices on Mango’s website are recorded in destination currency. One half of the countries in
the sample were members of the Euro area in 2012. For the remaining countries, I convert prices
into Euro using the European Central Bank’s average exchange rate for April of 2012—the month
when the catalogue was posted online and the data were collected.30 I further control for Eurozone
membership in order to capture the effect that currency areas have on price variations.
   The items’ prices reported on Mango’s website are inclusive of value added taxes (VAT) in the
countries that are members of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association, and
sales taxes and import tariffs in the remaining countries. Therefore, it is important to control for
policy instruments in the pricing analysis. I obtain data on VAT rates on apparel for 2012 from
the European Commission. In addition, I collect data on sales taxes on clothing for the remaining
countries from their respective statistical agencies.31 Finally, I use tariff data on clothing from the
World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database.
       The intensity of competition from rivals surely shapes Mango’s mark-ups in each market.
  29
      Information on DHL prices and policies is available at http://www.dhl.es/en.html. Evidence from personal
correspondence with a DHL representative is available from the author upon request.
   30
      I obtain nearly identical quantitative results using exchange rates for February and March of 2012, which capture
the fact that Mango may have priced its products one or two months prior to posting the catalogue online. These
results are available upon request. Note that it is redundant to repeat the analysis using exchange rates that were
effective three or more months prior to the month when the catalogue was posted online since seasonal catalogues
have a lifespan of three months. Given the short product lifespan, exchange rate volatility is likely not a major
concern for Mango. Hence, the data are useful for a cross-sectional study such as the one undertaken in this paper.
In that respect, the exercise in this paper is very different from, and complementary to, typical empirical pricing-
to-market investigations, which rely on time variation in prices of products with similar characteristics in order
to infer the degree of nominal exchange-rate pass through (see Goldberg and Knetter (1997) for a comprehensive
review of the relevant literature and Fitzgerald and Haller (2014) for a recent pricing-to-market study using very
detailed plant level data for the UK and Ireland).
   31
      For Canada, I compute a population-weighted average tax rate across all of its provinces. In Hong Kong and
Macao, the apparel and footwear sales tax and tariff is zero.


                                                          26
In fact, measuring Mango’s competition in each destination is the most difficult task. Guided
by the model, I begin by approximating market presence by the expenditure share on Spanish
apparel and footwear products in each market, λij . I construct two measures of this variable. In
the benchmark specification, I let the numerator in (23) be country j’s imports from Spain in
commodity codes H0- 61, 62, and 64 in the Comtrade data in year 2010, denominated in current
USD. I let the denominator be the expenditure on apparel and footwear products in each country
in 2010, denominated in current US dollars. To construct expenditure, I multiply GDP (in current
US dollars) by the expenditure share of GDP on basic headings in apparel and footwear from the
2005 ICP database. The three categories corresponding to apparel and footwear are: 1103111
Clothing materials and accessories, 1103121 Garments, and 1103211 Footwear.32
    For robustness, I also present results that use an alternative measure of λij —the trade share.
In that case, the numerator is country j’s imports from Spain in commodity codes H0- 61, 62,
and 64 and the denominator is Gross Output for the same industries, in year 2008, denominated
in current USD. I pool gross output data for the apparel and footwear industry from a variety of
sources including Stats.OECD, Prodcom, as well as individual countries’ statistical agencies.33 A
natural concern is that the trade shares are measured with error as the gross output data are pooled
from a variety of sources, which is why this specification is not my benchmark. A more serious
concern is that the trade share in apparel and footwear may not be the most relevant measure
of destination-specific competition for Mango. For example, Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) argue
that mark-ups vary negatively with market size, measured by the population size of the country.
Prices are also decreasing in market size in the Hummels and Lugovskyy (2009) model. In fact,
Proposition 2 establishes that the model developed in the present paper also predicts that relative
prices are decreasing in relative market sizes, under reasonable parameter restrictions. Hence, I
consider a third measure of competition—destinations’ population size for the year 2010 obtained
from the World Development Indicators (WDI).
   Finally, in the benchmark analysis, I use per-capita GDP (in current US dollars) for the year
2010 from the WDI. In Supplementary Appendix III, I repeat the empirical analysis using five
different measures of per-capita income or expenditure: per-capita nominal consumption, nomi-
nal household consumption, and PPP-adjusted GDP for 2010, and per-capita nominal GNI and
nominal GNI measured according to the Atlas method for 2009, all from WDI.

4.1.3      Summary

I conclude the description with a summary of the price data. Table 4 reports the mean product
price across all 245 items, denominated in Euro and computed relative to Spain, in each of the
twenty-eight export markets used in the analysis. For each country, there are three price statistics
corresponding to the three assumptions about consumers laid out above: (i) single-item purchaser,
 32
      This is the most recent detailed ICP expenditure data available.
 33
      2008 is the most recent year for which data are available for all the countries in the sample.

                                                          27
(ii) shipping-cost minimizer, and (iii) web-listed price. The transacted price differs considerably
between the single-item purchaser and the shipping-cost minimizer, who pays very similar prices
to the web-listed ones since shipping costs are very low (zero for two-thirds of the countries) once
spread over the entire bundle (see Supplementary Appendix VI). Foreign consumers who purchase
one item pay on average 58% more than Spanish ones, with Japanese customers paying as much as
2.2 times more and Dutch ones paying only 10% more than Spanish ones do. In contrast, foreign
consumers who purchase enough items so as to minimize the shipping fee pay on average 34% more
than Spanish ones, with Japanese customers paying 73% more and Romanian ones paying only
3% more than Spanish ones do. Since prices are inclusive of (international) shipping fees, trade
barriers partly account for the price wedge between the domestic country and the export markets.

    The importance of shipping costs in driving price differences across countries is more apparent
in Figure 1, which plots the mean of logged prices, relative to Spain, across all products in each
export market, against the logged relative per-capita income levels. A simple linear regression of
the mean logged price on logged per-capita income suggests that doubling a destination’s per-capita
GDP raises prices paid by cost-minimizers (as well as web-listed prices) by 11%. In contrast, richer

        Figure 1: Per-Capita Income and Geometric Mean Price of Identical Mango Products

single-item purchasers do not appear to pay a higher price than poorer ones do. As I demonstrate
in the next section, this apparent disconnect between prices and per-capita income is due to the fact
that shipping costs, which constitute a large portion of a single item’s price, are systematically
lower for richer destinations. Once I control for shipping costs, the positive link between the
transacted price and per-capita income emerges.


4.2       Empirical Analysis
4.2.1      Econometric Model

I use the theoretical model’s testable prediction in expression (24) as a starting point toward
the econometric specification. With the specific characteristics of Mango in mind, I use Spain as
numéraire, drop country-of-origin subscripts, and discretize the set of varieties to arrive at the
following econometric model

pjm /psm is the Euro-denominated price of item m in country j, relative to Spain—s. yj is desti-
nation j’s per-capita income. Based on the theoretical model’s testable prediction in expression
(24), one can hypothesize that βy = 1/(2(θ + 1)) > 0. dhlj is DHL’s destination-specific shipping
price, which proxies the trade cost in the benchmark specification, so from the model’s testable
prediction in expression (24), it is expected that βdhl > 0. In the robustness analysis, I add stan-
dard gravity variables (which I describe in Section 4.2.3) to further control for the effect of trade
barriers on prices. λj is Mango’s market share in destination j, which reflects the competition the
firm faces there. It is measured by: (i) country j’s import share of apparel and footwear from Spain


                                                                                                                                                                                                                           29
constructed from Comtrade and ICP expenditure data; (ii) the same statistic constructed from
Comtrade and Gross Output data; or (iii) country j’s population size. In cases (i) and (ii), based on
the model’s testable prediction in expression (24), one can hypothesize that βλ = 1/(2(θ + 1)) > 0.
In case (iii), based on the theoretical result in Proposition 2, it is expected that βλ < 0.
   In addition, I control for destination-specific apparel and footwear sales taxes and tariffs on
Spanish imports. I denote the gross sales tax and tariff in country j by κj . In Supplementary
Appendix II, I add to the theoretical model from Section 2 per-unit taxes and tariffs, and I derive a
testable prediction. The augmented model yields identical coefficients on per-capita income, trade
barriers, and market shares as the benchmark model, and a positive coefficient on gross taxes and
tariffs, βκ = (2θ + 1)/(2(θ + 1)) > 0.
    gj is the Gini coefficient of income inequality in country j collected from the CIA World
Factbook. This control is motivated by the fact that Mango’s quantity-discount pricing strategy
described in Section 4.1.1 is optimal in environments in which firms serve consumers with various
income levels within a country. While I do not explicitly derive the optimal pricing rule in an
economy that features consumers with heterogeneous incomes within a country, I refer the reader
to such extensions of this model considered by Bekkers et al. (2012) and Pieters (2014). The
theoretical findings can be summarized as follows: keeping per-capita income fixed, (i) firms find
it optimal to charge lower prices in countries with higher income inequality if they choose to sell
positive amounts to both rich and poor consumers; and (ii) firms charge higher prices in countries
with higher income inequality if they only serve high-income consumers. The former appears to
be the case for Mango, otherwise the firm would not be pursuing the quantity-discount strategy
described above. Hence, it is expected that βg < 0, which has been documented empirically by
Bekkers et al. (2012) and Pieters (2014).
   In addition to the regressors explicitly listed, I include five indicator variables. The first is a
Euro-currency indicator and its coefficient is expected to be negative as currency-union membership
effectively reduces trade barriers (see Rose (1999)).34 The remaining four indicators describe
Mango’s return policy. The first takes the value of one if in-store returns are allowed, the second
if returns are allowed in only one store, the third if returns via mail are sent to a local address
(in the consumer’s country of residence), and the fourth if returns via mail are picked up from the
customer’s home. As discussed in Section 4.1.1, many factors shape Mango’s return policy, so it
is not straightforward to sign the coefficients on these indicators. It is, however, expected that, if
Mango incurs lower costs to process returns (in store or via mail) locally, and if these costs are
passed onto consumers, then lower-cost options should translate into lower prices of items.
   Since the econometric model is tailored to best capture specific characteristics of Mango and
consequently includes additional variables that are outside of the theoretical model, the estimation
  34
     The indicator takes on the value of 1 if the country’s Mango website lists prices denominated in Euro and zero
otherwise. Naturally, all Eurozone countries satisfy this category. Interestingly, Mango also prices its items in Euro
in Romania — a non-Eurozone country.

is not meant to structurally distinguish the model that I develop in this paper from other existing
formulations. Instead, the model can be used as a guide to interpret the signs of the coefficient
estimates. Finally, it remains to note that ψjm is an error term and that all regressions include

                 The regressand is the price of an item sold by Mango in one of 28 destina-
                 tions, measured relative to the price of the same item sold in Spain, in logs.

    I estimate the coefficients in the econometric model above using the OLS estimator and I
cluster all errors by destination. The empirical results are reported in Table 5. Across the three
specifications that differ in the measure of market share, the coefficient estimate on per-capita
income varies between 0.12 and 0.16 and is highly statistically significant. Hence, doubling the
per-capita income of a country is associated with at least a 12% increase in the price of identical

                                                      31
goods sold by Mango there. The coefficient estimates of the DHL shipping costs range between
0.28 and 0.37 and are highly statistically significant. In fact they are at least twice the magnitude
of the coefficient estimates on per-capita income. The finding is driven by the fact that Mango
uses DHL Express to ship items, and the shipping charges for single-item purchases constitute 35%
of the typical item’s web-listed price (see Supplementary Appendix VI).
    The coefficient on trade shares is not statistically different from zero, whether measured using
ICP expenditures or gross output on apparel and footwear in the denominator. Measurement error,
which biases coefficient estimates toward zero, is a likely explanation for this finding. ICP expen-
diture shares for year 2005 are the most recent available observations and are used to construct
expenditures on apparel and footwear in 2010 in the first measure of trade shares. In the second
measure, to maximize country coverage: first, the gross output data are pooled from a variety of
sources; and second, the data are for the year 2008, which is associated with the financial crisis
and documented trade collapse (see Levchenko et al. (2010) and Chor and Manova (2012) among
others). Hence, the constructed trade shares may not be representative for the sample of countries
analyzed here in a typical year. Moreover, Spain’s destination-specific export share may simply
be too aggregate of a measure of Mango’s effective competition in each country.35 Thus, it is
reasonable to argue that there is measurement error with respect to the degree of competition that
Mango faces in different destinations.
  The coefficient estimate on population is negative, as predicted by the model, but it is quan-
titatively small and only statistically significant at the 10%-level.36 The coefficient estimate on
sales taxes and tariffs is not statistically different from zero. Neither is the coefficient estimate of
the Gini measure of income inequality. The latter may be due to the fact that the Gini coefficient
is simply too aggregate of a measure of the differences in income between Mango customers who
purchase one versus a bundle of items.
    The coefficient estimate of the Euro-currency indicator ranges between -0.17 and -0.18 and it
is statistically significant. Hence, denominating prices in the same currency as the source country
(Spain) lowers the relative export-to-domestic price by at least 17%. The result is consistent with a
discussion by Pinilla (2007), based on interviews with Mango’s management, that price dispersion
of Mango products is lower in the Euro zone. Similarly, Cavallo et al. (2014) find that law of one
   35
      One concern may be that Mango has variable market presence across destinations—solves a different problem
across markets—and consequently extracts different mark-ups. The concern is not of first-order importance for
two reasons. First, Mango’s main competitors, Zara and H&M, operate in all 29 markets included in the analysis.
Second, I verify that Mango’s market shares, computed from Mango’s sales per market and destination-specific
expenditure on apparel and footwear, do not have a statistically significant effect on prices in any of the specifications.
These results are available upon request.
   36
      Notice that the results on the link between export prices and destination population size do not contradict the
findings by Manova and Zhang (2012), Bastos and Silva (2010), Gorg et al. (2010), and Harrigan et al. (2011). The
authors demonstrate that export unit values are increasing in destination per-capita income and population, and
they argue that differences in product quality can account for the two observations. First, richer countries demand
higher quality goods, which sell at a higher price. Second, firms increase product quality but reduce mark-ups in
more competitive (larger) markets. Since the present paper examines prices of identical items, all the empirical
finding should be interpreted as conditional on product quality being held fixed.

                                                            32
price deviations are significantly larger outside of currency areas for products sold by large retailers
such as Zara, H&M, Apple, and IKEA.
    Mango’s return and exchange policy also shapes items’ prices. Customers who can return
items in all the stores in their country of residence pay at least 12% less for identical goods, while
customers who can mail their returns to a local address pay at least 8% less than others. Hence,
Mango charges lower prices or lower shipping and handling fees (or both) in countries where returns
are processed locally. The result suggests that, for those countries, Mango incurs lower costs to
process returns locally—presumably, the company would not have pursued this return option if it
had been less cost efficient. The coefficient estimates for the option to return items in a single store
are not statistically different from zero. The same is true for the coefficient estimates associated
with the requirement to schedule home pick-ups for returns via mail.
    Variance decomposition. Given the differences in magnitudes of the coefficient estimates of
several key variables such as per-capita income, DHL costs, Euro-currency indicator, and variables
related to Mango’s return policy, it is of interest to conduct a variance decomposition exercise that
quantifies the contribution of each source to variation in prices. I perform an exercise following
the variance decomposition methodology employed by Crucini and Yilmazkuday (2014). I take
the variance of both sides of the equation in Section 4.2.1, and then I divide both sides by the
variance of the left-hand side, var(log(pjm /psm )). By construction, the variance and covariance
terms on the right-hand side, scaled by var(log(pjm /psm )), will sum to unity. It turns out that the
sum of the covariance terms is small, so that up to three quarters of the variation in the relative
price is explained by the variances of the regressors, and up to a quarter is accounted for by the
variance of the error term. For example, the ratio var(β̂y log(yj /ys ))/var(log(pjm /psm )) measures
the marginal contribution of the explanatory variable, per-capita income, to the total observed
variation in prices across goods and countries.
    Across the three regressions that correspond to different measures of market shares, the con-
tribution of per-capita income differences to price variation ranges between 12% and 23%. DHL
shipping costs account for 15% to 26%, Eurozone membership for 13% to 15%, and the ability
to return items in all local stores for 7% to 8% of the price variation. The remaining regressors
contribute up to 4% each. Per-capita income and DHL shipping costs are key contributors to price
variations for customers who purchase a single item, which reflects the fact that Mango’s shipping
charges constitute a large portion of the items’ prices in this specification. Given the importance
of these costs, in Supplementary Appendix IV, I study the main determinants of DHL’s listed
shipping prices. DHL (Spain) charges lower prices in both richer and larger markets, and higher
prices in markets that are further away from Spain. The facts that DHL prices are lower in richer
countries and prices of Mango items are sharply increasing in DHL shipping quotes can reconcile
the apparent disconnect between the prices of Mango items and per-capita income in the first plot
in Figure 1. After controlling for shipping costs in the empirical analysis, however, the positive
relationship between price and per-capita income becomes obvious in Table 5.

4.2.3    Robustness Analysis

I. Additional measures of trade barriers. In the benchmark analysis, I rely on DHL shipping
prices to isolate the effect that Mango’s shipping costs have on relative prices across countries. One
concern is that DHL shipping prices are an incomplete measure of trade barriers. In particular,
there may be other forces that shape cross-country trade barriers and are correlated with per-capita
GDP, thus biasing the estimated coefficients on income.
   To address this issue, I follow the gravity literature and I assume that trade barriers depend on
trading partners’ geographical and trade-policy attributes. I expand the benchmark specification in
two ways. In the first case, I add the third degree polynomial of logged distance between Spain and
the destination (in km) and indicator variables if the destination is in a regional trade agreement
with Spain, if it is landlocked, or if it is an island. In the second, motivated by Eaton and Kortum
(2002), I replace the continuous measure of distance with four indicator variables that group
countries into distance regions. The distance intervals are (in miles): [0, 750), [750, 1500), [1500,
5000), [5000,∞). I obtain all gravity variables from Head et al. (2010).
   The first three columns in Table 6 report the results from the exercise that uses a continuous
(non-linear) distance measure and the last three refer to the estimates obtained using the distance
regions. The coefficient estimates on per-capita income and DHL shipping costs are higher com-
pared to the benchmark. Euro membership as well as Mango’s return and exchange policy continue
to shape price differences across countries. Population size has a negative effect on prices, but the
coefficient is precisely estimated only in the specification that relies on distance regions. There is
some evidence that countries that share a regional trade agreement with Spain enjoy lower prices.
   Geography also plays a role in shaping prices. Prices are lower in landlocked countries and
higher on islands. The relationship between price and distance is not robust. Taking the derivative
with respect to distance, the coefficient estimates in Table 6 suggest that prices are decreasing in
distance for the European countries that are closer to Spain and increasing for the ones that are
more distant, only to fall again among the Asian destinations. However, the distance effect can
become monotonically increasing by only a slight change in the point estimates.37 One reason for
this sensitivity is that I have already included a number of indicator variables (such as the Eurozone
region or other geographical attributes) as controls in the regression, and these controls make it
difficult to measure an independent distance effect. The specification that uses distance regions
suggests that prices are significantly higher in region 1, but conveys little information about the
remaining distance regions. Given the sensitivity of the results to parameter changes and controls
included, I do not make any inferences about the link between price and distance.
    Variance decomposition exercises for the six specifications in Table 6 suggest that the median
contribution to price variation by per-capita income variation increases to 29%, while the roles of
  37
    For example, focus on the first column and simply increase the coefficient on logged distance to -44.160 or the
coefficient on the square of logged distance to 6.063—well within the bounds of the confidence intervals around the
estimates—and the relationship between price and distance for the sample of 29 countries is strictly increasing.

II. Alternative Measures of Per-Capita Income. The analysis throughout the main body of
the paper relies on nominal per-capita GDP as a measure of per-capita income. In Supplementary
Appendix III, I repeat the empirical analysis using five different measures of per-capita income
or expenditure: per-capita nominal consumption, household consumption, GNI, GNI measured
according to the Atlas method, and PPP-adjusted GDP.
   Tables 12-19 in Supplementary Appendix III report the results from the main specification
as well as the robustness exercise that includes gravity measures of trade barriers under the as-
sumption of single item purchases using the five alternative measures of per-capita income. The
mean and median estimates of the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita income across
the 45 different regressions are 0.18 compared to the mean and median estimate of 0.16 obtained
using per-capita GDP. The minimum estimate is 0.09 and the maximum is 0.30. The majority
of estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. Two of the 45 estimates are statistically
significant at the 10% level and two are not statistically significant. The last four estimates are
obtained from regressions that use PPP-adjusted GDP per-capita as a measure of income. Overall,
the regressions that use PPP-adjusted GDP yield the weakest and least precise estimates.
    DHL shipping costs, Eurozone membership, and the option to return items locally via mail or
in store continue to affect prices. In the majority of the specifications, population has a negative
and statistically significant effect on prices. The coefficients on import shares are positive and
statistically significant in the four benchmark regressions that proxy income by variants of GNI and
consumption expenditure, however, the significance disappears once gravity variables are included.
Finally, landlocked countries enjoy lower prices, and there is weak evidence that prices are lower
for countries that have an RTA with Spain and higher on islands.
   Overall, the results that I obtain using various measures of per-capita income strengthen the
message that per-capita income differences as well as DHL shipping costs, Eurozone membership,
and Mango’s return policy shape prices for one-item purchases across countries.

III. Shipping-Cost Minimizers. As described in Section 4.1.1, Mango offers quantity dis-
counts. Since shipping fees typically constitute a third of the price of a single item, it is reasonable
to assume that there exist a large set of consumers who purchase just enough so as to receive a
shipping discount. Table 2 in Section 4.1.1 shows that consumers in two-thirds of the countries
incur no explicit shipping fee above a certain threshold. Therefore, the per-item price that these
shipping-cost minimizers pay is equivalent to the web-listed price. One-third of shipping-cost min-
imizers, however, incur an explicit positive shipping fee. To approximate their effective transaction
price, I spread the flat shipping fee for purchases above the threshold over the bundle of goods.
    Table 7 repeats the benchmark exercise using transaction prices paid by shipping-cost min-
imizers. The coefficient estimates on per-capita income are noticeably higher compared to the
benchmark exercise that uses transaction prices for single-item purchases. Similar to the bench-
mark exercise, Eurozone membership has a negative effect on prices of identical goods as does

the option to return items in all physical stores. There are two key differences. DHL shipping
costs and the requirement to mail returns to a local address no longer play a role in explaining
price differences. That DHL shipping costs no longer determine prices reflects the fact that, for
purchases above a minimum threshold, the shipping charge constitutes a small fraction of an item’s
price. In addition, Mango’s shipping charges, rather than the items’ web-listed prices, likely reflect
the company’s costs associated with processing returns via mail. This can explain why items that
are returned to a local address, which is likely a cheaper option than mailing the items back to
Spain, does not have an effect on prices paid by cost minimizers, but significantly lowers prices
for single-item purchases. Finally, the R2 of the benchmark regressions is higher, which reflects
the high explanatory power of DHL shipping costs in accounting for differences in prices paid by
customers who purchase a single item over a bundle of goods. Variance decomposition exercises

suggest that per-capita income differences account for 30%-40% of observed price variations; Eu-
rozone membership and the ability to return items at local stores account for up to 8% and 9%,

respectively, while DHL shipping costs contribute to only 4% of the price differences.
    The message is similar from the robustness exercises that include gravity proxies for trade
barriers (Table 8). Per-capita income differences, Eurozone membership, and the option to return
items in physical stores remain the key determinants of price variations across countries. As in
the exercises that used prices for single-item purchases, prices are lower in landlocked countries
and those that share an RTA with Spain. Finally, the coefficients on the island indicator and the
distance variables are closer to zero and much less precisely estimated in the new specification.
    Table 20 in Supplementary Appendix III reports the results from the main specification as well
as the robustness exercise that includes gravity measures of trade barriers under the assumption
that consumers minimize shipping costs using the five alternative measures of per-capita income.38
The mean and median estimates of the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita income across
the 45 different regressions are 0.18 and all estimates are statistically significant. The minimum
estimate is 0.12 and the maximum is 0.28.
    Overall, per-capita income differences, followed by Eurozone membership and Mango’s return
policy, rather than shipping costs, shape prices paid by customers who bundle their purchases so
as to avoid incurring large shipping costs.

IV. Web-Listed Prices. In Supplementary Appendix V, I repeat all the exercises using prices
as listed on Mango’s website. The results are nearly identical to the ones that I obtain using
prices paid by shipping-cost minimizers. The key finding is that the estimates of the elasticity
of price with respect to per-capita income are robust across specifications that explicitly account
for shipping and handling fees and those that do not. The same is true for the estimates of the
coefficients associated with Eurozone membership and the ability to return items in physical stores.

V. Summary The empirical results suggest that Mango customers in the Eurozone and those
who enjoy the flexibility to return items in physical stores pay lower prices for identical goods. In
addition, Mango extracts higher mark-ups from richer consumers and uses its shipping and handling
charge as a vehicle to pass through shipping costs. Across the 162 empirical exercises, whose results
are reported in the text and the appendices, the median and mean estimates of the elasticity of
price with respect to per-capita income are 0.18.39 The 5th and 95th percentile estimates amount
to 0.12 and 0.24, respectively. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that doubling a country’s per-
capita income results in an 18% percent rise in the price level of apparel and footwear products
  38
     Due to space constraints, I only report the estimates and associated standard errors of the elasticity of price
with respect to per-capita income under the five alternative measures as well as the R2 of each regression.The
estimates of the remaining coefficients are similar to the ones in Tables 7 and 8 and are available upon request.
  39
     For robustness, I re-estimate the model using the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator advocated by
Silva and Tenreyro (2006) and I obtain nearly identical results. The finding is due to the fact that the independent
variable—price of item abroad relative to home—rarely takes on values below unity and never below 0.9, since
Mango passes through a portion of its shipping cost (which is considerably lower domestically) even to web-listed
prices. Thus, taking logs of relative prices yields negligent bias even for the poorest set of countries.

sold via the Internet by Mango. Moreover, given the robust estimates of this elasticity across
specifications that reflect different assumptions about transaction prices, it is reasonable to argue
that, aside from the shipping and handling charges which are particular to the online store, Mango
likely price discriminates on the basis of per-capita income in all outlets.


5      Quantitative Importance of Variable Mark-ups
5.1     Variable Mark-ups: Online VS Offline
How do price discrimination practices of retailers that operate both online and offline compare
to those of standard physical retailers?40 This is a difficult question to answer since prices of
identical products from physical outlets are not available for a large set of countries. At present,
two databases are commonly employed by the existing literature in studies of law-of-one-price
deviations: International Comparison Program (ICP) and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). The
first dataset features sampled retail prices of aggregate good categories made up of products with
identical characteristics. The second database features prices of individual goods with identical
characteristics sampled across retail locations in cities around the globe. Given the nature of
the two datasets, the price observations potentially reflect cross-country differences in mark-ups,
product quality, and non-tradable components (such as distribution mark-ups).

   In the left panel of Figure 2, I plot the logged price levels of tradable goods from the ICP
database against the logged per-capita incomes, relative to Spain, for the 29 countries analyzed

    Carlton and Chevalier (2001) provide an answer for the US market in year 1999 using prices of fragrances,
DVD players, and refrigerators. The authors find that manufacturers that offer products in physical outlets charge
higher prices and use various mechanisms to limit distribution online by (competing) Internet retailers who offer
deep discounts.


                                                                                                                                         40
thus far. Following the literature, I compute the price level of tradables as the geometric average of
prices of basic headings that correspond to tradable good categories. I use prices of all 62 tradable
basic headings from the 2003-2005 round of the ICP and GDP per capita for the year 2004—the year
in which the majority of the prices were collected.41 Prices of tradables are higher in countries with
higher per-capita incomes. The line of best fit has a slope coefficient of 0.24, which is statistically
significant at the 1%-level. This result is robust in the literature. Hsieh and Klenow (2007) and
Alessandria and Kaboski (2011) find an elasticity of 0.3 using the 1996 ICP data across a large set
of countries. The observations in the left panel of the figure, however, span across industries, so
it is difficult to relate them to the statistics obtained in this paper. For this reason, in the right
panel of the figure, I plot the logged price level of basic headings corresponding to apparel and
footwear. The slope of the line of best fit amounts to 0.14, which is also statistically significant
at the 1%-level. Prices of apparel and footwear products are higher in richer countries, albeit the
elasticity estimate is less precise, given that these products span only three of the 62 basic headings
that comprise the bundle of tradable goods.
    One simple way to assess the importance of variable mark-ups in accounting for variations
in retail prices is to apply the econometric model from Section 4.2.1 to ICP data and compare
the coefficient estimates to the ones obtained from Mango data. Since Spain is one exporting
country among many, products in the ICP dataset do not necessarily originate from and are not
shipped from Spain to the different markets. Therefore, a regression framework that controls
for Mango’s return policy as well as each country’s import share of Spanish apparel goods, DHL
costs for shipments from Spain, distance from Spain, and free-trade agreement with Spain is not
appropriate. The remaining variables used in the exercises in Table 6 above, however, are specific
to each market and may be responsible for the observed variation in ICP prices. Consequently,
I use these variables for year 2004 to obtain estimates of the elasticity of price with respect to
per-capita income from the 2003-2005 ICP data.42
   Table 9 in Appendix B reports the results using six different measures of per-capita income.
The median estimate of the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita income is 0.26. As in
  41
      ICP prices are commonly used in the international economics literature. The 2003-2005 database is the lat-
est round of disaggregate price data available to researchers. For example, Simonovska and Waugh (2014a) and
Simonovska and Waugh (2014b) use the same set of basic-heading prices to estimate trade elasticities for a large
set of countries. I focus on ICP, rather than EIU, data due to the broader country-level coverage of the former. See
Crucini and Yilmazkuday (2014) for a detailed analysis of the EIU data.
   42
      One notable difference between the ICP and the Mango data analysis is that I separately consider the effect
of sales taxes from tariffs in the former. The reason for this modification is that the set of products examined in
this exercise is much broader than apparel and the set of sources of origin of the products is potentially the entire
world, making it difficult to accurately compute an effective tariff-adjusted tax rate as in the benchmark analysis.
I obtain sales tax data for each country for year 2004 from Ernst & Young. To compute the average tariff for each
importer, I obtain applied tariffs (minimum of MFN and effective tariff) for year 2004 at the SITC-4-digit level for
each country-pair in the dataset from Feenstra and Romalis (2014). Similarly, I obtain trade flows for year 2004
at the SITC-4-digit level for each country-pair in the dataset from an update to Feenstra et al. (2005) using UN
Comtrade data. For each importer, I compute the average tariff as the mean tariff across products and sources,
weighted by source- and product-specific imports.



                                                         41
Table 6, which shows results using Mango price data, ICP prices are lower in landlocked countries
and higher on islands. Prices are also lower in Eurozone countries, although the coefficient is
not precisely estimated. Similarly, prices are lower in countries with higher income inequality, as
predicted by extensions of the model in which firms serve customers from different income brackets
within a country. As in the case of Mango prices, sales taxes and destination population do not
appear to affect ICP prices. A notable difference between the two datasets lies in the fact that
tariffs play a very important role in driving ICP price differences; countries with higher average
import tariffs experience higher prices of tradables. This result is not surprising in light of the fact
that Mango products are exported from Spain to all the destinations, the majority of which do
not impose any duties on Spanish imports, while the exporter in the ICP dataset originates from
a number of possible countries.
   Focusing on apparel and footwear, the signs and magnitudes of the majority of variables are
similar to the entire sample of tradables, however, the coefficients on geographic variables are no
longer precisely estimated. Notably, the effect of tariffs on prices is much smaller in magnitude and
statistically insignificant, which may be due to the fact that the average tariff is not representative
of the apparel industry. The median estimate of the elasticity of price with respect to per-capita
income is 0.12. This magnitude is roughly half of that obtained for all tradable goods and is on the
lower end of the estimates obtained for Mango apparel products sold via the Internet. Naturally,
the statistics in the two datasets reflect different mechanisms: the price elasticity in ICP data may
reflect differences in product quality, retail margins, and producers’ mark-ups, while the one in
the Mango data accounts for producers’ mark-ups alone.43 Given the comparable magnitudes of
the estimate of the price elasticity and the similarities in the behavior of other variables that arise
in the two datasets, I conclude that mark-up variations play an important role in accounting for
observed differences in retail prices of tradables for the set of 29 countries examined in this paper.


5.2     Income Differences and Prices of Tradables Around the World
The empirical exercises in this paper have relied on price data for 29 countries. A natural concern is
whether the forces that shape prices of tradables across these countries also account for the majority
of price variations around the world. While detailed micro-level price data for a larger sample of
countries are not available, ICP prices, shown above to behave similarly to Mango’s micro-level
  43
    Retail margins can be quantitatively large. Crucini and Yilmazkuday (2014) outline a model where retailers in
each city import goods and exert effort to distribute them locally in exchange for a wage. In the model, relative
prices of goods across cities are falling in relative local retailer productivities and rising in relative local retailer
wages and costs of good production and delivery from the factory gate. Assuming that retail wages are uncorrelated
with delivery costs and retail productivity, the authors use EIU price data and estimate a large contribution of
retailer wages to prices. An interesting extension would include modeling final consumers to have non-homothetic
preferences, which would imply that retailers charge mark-ups that vary with city characteristics, most notably
per-capita income. In this case, retailer wages could covary with per-capita income; hence, mark-ups would covary
with retailer wages, and both would affect prices, so their individual contributions to prices could potentially be
evaluated.


                                                           42
prices, do exist. In Table 10 in Appendix B, I repeat the exercise from Table 9 discussed in Section
5.1 above using ICP price data for 54 countries for which sales tax data are available.44 The median
estimate of the elasticity of the price of all tradables with respect to per-capita income across six
different measures of income is 0.18, roughly 70% of that found for the 29 countries that span the
Mango dataset. Similarly to the previous exercise, prices are higher on islands. Notably, sales tax
rather than tariff differences now significantly affect price differences, while the coefficients on the
landlocked indicator variable and the Gini measure of inequality are no longer precisely estimated.
Overall, the fit of the empirical model, as measured by the R-squared statistic, is somewhat poorer
for the larger set of countries.
   The empirical model has higher explanatory power for prices of apparel and footwear. The
median price elasticity estimate of 0.21 is similar to the case of all tradables and sales taxes
continue to play an important role in accounting for price differences. Notable difference can be
seen in the lack of statistical significance of the coefficient on the island indicator variable as well as
the positive and significant coefficient on the Gini measure. Compared to the sample of countries
in the Mango database, in the present and larger sample of countries, the price elasticity estimate
is notably higher and taxes play an important role in driving price differences. The latter outcome
may be due to the fact that variations in sales taxes are simply far smaller in the Mango sample,
where the majority of countries are EU members. The largest difference between the two samples
arises in the sign of the Gini coefficient, which is negative in the small sample and positive, albeit
less than half in magnitude, in the large sample. The finding in the large sample is consistent
with extensions of the model in which firms choose to only serve richer subsets of the population.
Hence the differences in signs of the coefficient are plausible if the ICP sample includes apparel and
footwear products that are affordable for most consumers in the richer countries that appear in the
Mango database, but only to select segments of the population of the notably poorer additional
countries that are included in the larger set. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the
difference may be due to measurement error arising from poor data quality, especially among the
additional countries that are included in the larger sample.
    In a final attempt to assess the empirical model’s ability to account for cross-country variations
in prices, I repeat the exercise for a set of as many as 107 countries for which all variables, except
for sales taxes, are available.45 I report the results in Table 11 in Appendix B. The magnitudes of
the price elasticity fall for the set of all tradables to a median of 0.13, roughly 70% of that found
for the 54 countries examined in Table 10, although their statistical significance remains high.
Notably, prices are lower in larger markets, as predicted by theory. Finally, the R-squared also
falls, which may, among other things, reflect the omission of sales taxes from the specification.46

  46
     Given the documented importance of sales taxes, one may be concerned that biases may arise in the coefficient
estimates of variables that are correlated with sales taxes upon omitting taxes from the specification. To address
this concern, I repeat the exercises for the sets of 54 and 29 countries studied above excluding the sales tax variable.


                                                          43
    Turning to prices of apparel and footwear, the negative link between prices and population
sizes remains. More importantly, the median price elasticity is 0.19—comparable both to that
found in the smaller set of countries examined in Table 10 and to the estimate arising from Mango
data. To conclude, the robustness of the magnitude of the elasticity of price with respect to income
across different sets of countries yields strong support toward the role that variable mark-ups play
in generating a positive relationship between income and prices of tradables around the world.


6     Conclusion
In this paper, I argue that firms’ variable mark-ups represent a key contributor toward the
empirically-documented regularity that tradable consumer goods’ prices are systematically pos-
itively related to countries’ per-capita incomes. On a broader scale, this paper emphasizes the
role that income differences play in shaping cross-country price variations in tradable consumption
goods as well as in determining aggregate consumption patterns. Since tradable goods that are
acquired over the Internet account for an ever increasing portion of consumption bundles of indi-
viduals, their prices directly affect consumer welfare. Hence, having obtained an understanding
of one of the key mechanisms that affect the behavior of prices across countries, we can further
pursue the measurement of welfare of consumers in a world economy linked via the Internet.

I report the results in Tables 27 and 28 in Supplementary Appendix VII. Omitting sales taxes has virtually no
impact on coefficient estimates for the set of 29 countries, which is reassuring. In the case of 54 countries, the only
notable differences arises for apparel and footwear products, where the omission of taxes biases the coefficients on
the Gini variable toward zero.

A.2     Equilibrium: Characterization, Existence, and Uniqueness
In this section, I rely on the Pareto distribution of firm productivities and characterize the equi-
librium objects of the model. I express all objects in terms of wages and I derive a set of equations
that solve for the wage rates of all countries simultaneously. I use υ as a counter throughout.
   Using the optimal price (11), the measure of firms (12), and the conditional density (13) under
the Pareto distribution in (14) yields

In order to solve the model, it is necessary to jointly determine the wages, wi , and the measures
of entrants, Ji , ∀i. The system of equilibrium equations consists of the free entry condition, (16),
and the income/spending equality, (17), for each country.
   Free entry requires that average profits cover the fixed cost of entry, so

Zi (w) is the i-th contribution to the system of I equations that characterizes the equilibrium
wage vector. Equilibrium wages satisfy Zi (w) = 0 (∀i). It is straightforward to show that there
exists a unique equilibrium wage vector that satisfies the system equality, after setting one wi
to be a numéraire (see Alvarez and Lucas (2007)). The idea is to treat the system above as an

                                                            50
aggregate excess demand function of an exchange economy. For existence, it suffices to verify that
the system satisfies properties 1-5 listed in Proposition 17.B.2 of Mas-Colell et al. (1995), p. 581.
Existence follows from Proposition 17.C.1 of Mas-Colell et al. (1995), p. 585, which is essentially a
reference to Kakutani’s fixed point theorem. For uniqueness, notice that the system has the gross
substitution property (differential version of Definition 17.F.2 in Mas-Colell et al. (1995), p. 612),
∀i, k, k 6= i, ∂Zi (w)/∂wk > 0, and the result follows from Proposition 17.F.3 of Mas-Colell et al.
(1995), p. 613.
   When gross substitution holds, comparative static exercises with respect to wages are straight-
forward. Let B ≡ {τij , Lj , bi , θ}i,j=1,...,I denote the set of relevant parameters. Then the equilib-
rium system can be written as Z(w; B). Let w ∗ be the unique wage vector corresponding to B ∗ ;
Z(w ∗ ; B ∗ ) = 0. WLOG, consider a positive productivity shock in country I, namely a rise in bI .
To determine the effect on wages, I need to characterize Dw(B ∗ ). By Implicit Function Theorem,

                            Dw(B ∗ ) = −[Dw Z(w ∗ ; B ∗ )]−1 DB Z(w ∗ ; B ∗ ).

Since the system has the gross substitution property, Proposition 17.G.3 in Mas-Colell et al. (1995),
p. 618, ensures that [Dw Z(w ∗; B ∗ )]−1 has all its entries negative. Moreover, differentiation shows
that DB Z(w ∗ ; B ∗ )dbI << 0 for the first I − 1 countries (and therefore the sign is positive for
country I). Then, Dw(B ∗)dbI << 0 for the first I − 1 countries. Hence, a positive productivity
shock in I lowers the wages of all countries relative to I; or, it raises I’s relative wage. A more
detailed proof is beyond the scope of the paper and is available upon request.


A.3     Proofs
In this section, I prove Propositions 1 and 2 and I derive sufficient conditions such that firm sales
are strictly increasing in destination population size.

Proof of Proposition 1. Consider expression (22), which represents the price of variety φ from i in
destination j relative to k, k 6= j. Since I can always relabel countries, without loss of generality,
consider an increase in wj , keeping wk fixed. The goal is to show that ∂(pij (φ)/pik (φ))/∂wj > 0.
Using (18) in (22), it suffices to show that ∂(φ∗ij /φ∗ik )/∂wj < 0.
    Using expression (18) for destination j and rewriting the sum in (18) for destination k so as to
isolate the j-term yields
                                                                                       1

A sufficient condition for (a.11) to be strictly negative is that the term in the curly bracket is
non-negative. Since, by assumption τjj = 1 (∀j), the term in the curly bracket is non-negative
when trade barriers obey the triangle inequality, (∀j, k, υ)τυj τjk ≥ τυk .

Proof of Proposition 2. Consider expression (22), which represents the price of variety φ from i in
destination j relative to k, k 6= j. Since I can always relabel countries, without loss of generality,
consider an increase in Lj , keeping Lk fixed. The goal is to show that ∂(pij (φ)/pik (φ))/∂Lj < 0.
Using (18) in (22), it suffices to show that ∂(φ∗ij /φ∗ik )/∂Lj > 0.

A sufficient condition for (a.12) to be strictly positive is that the term in the curly bracket is
strictly positive. Since, by assumption τjj = 1 (∀j), the term in the curly bracket is strictly
positive when the trade barriers for j and k obey the triangle inequality, (∀υ)τυj τjk ≥ τυk , and
when the inequality for at least one υ 6= j is strict.

    Finally, I derive a lower bound on firm productivity such that firm sales are strictly increasing
in destination population size. Substituting (18) into (26) and rewriting the sum so as to isolate
the j-term yields
