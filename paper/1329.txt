                Optimal Wage Indexation, Foreign—Exchange
                    Intervention and Monetary Policy
                                   ABSTRACT

         This paper deals with the design of optimal monetary policy and with the
interaction between the optimal degrees of wage indexation and foreign exchange
intervention. The model is governed by the characteristics of the stochastic
shocks which affect the economy and by the information set that individuals possess.
Because of cost of negotiations, nominal wages are assumed to be precontracted and
wage adjustments follow a simple indexation rule that links wage changes to observed
changes in price. The use of the price level as the only indicator for wage adjust-
ments may not permit an efficient use of available information and, may result in
welfare loss. The analysis specifies the optimal st of feedback rules that should
govern policy aiming at the minimization of the welfare loss. These feedback rules
determine the optimal response of monetary policy to changes in exchange rates,
interest rates and foreign prices. The adoption of the optimal set of feedback
rules results in the complete elimination of the welfare cost arising from the
simple indexation rule and from the existence of nominal contracts. Since optimal
policies succeed in the elimination of the distortions, issues concerning the
nature of contracts and the implications of specific assumptions about disequilib—
rium positions become inconsequential. The analysis then proceeds to examine the
interdependence between the optimal feedback rules and the optimal degree of wage
indexation. It is shown that a rise in the degree of exchange rate flexibility
raises the optimal degree of wage indexation. One of the key conclusipns is the
proposition that the number of independent feedback rules that govern a policy must
equal the number of independent sources of information that influence the deter-
mination of the undistorted equilibrium. Thus, it is shown that with a sufficient
number of feedback rules for monetary policy there may be no need to introduce
wage indexation. It is also shown that an economy that is not able to choose freely
an exchange rate regime can still eliminate the welfare loss by supplementing the
(constrained) monetary policy with an optimal rule for wage indexation. The paper
concludes with an examination of the consequences of departures from optimal policy
by comparing the welfare loss resulting from the imposition of alternative con-
straints on the degree of wage indexation, on foreign exchange intervention and on
the magnitudes of other policy feedback coefficients.

I. Introduction

                This paper deals with the design of optimal monetary policy and with the

interaction between the optimal degrees of wage Indexation and foreign exchange

intervention. Recent studies of wage indexation in the closed economy have

established that the optimal degree of wage indexation depends on the character-

istics of the stochastic distrubances that affect the economy. In many of these

studies, specifically in those that have adopted the analytical framework originated

that   result in some stickiness of nominal wages. In these studies indexation is

intended to reduce the undesirable consequences of the stickiness of wages. Sub-

sequent analyses of the optimal degree of wage indexation examined the implications

of alternative assumptions about the determinants of employment in disequilibrium

situations, as well as the rationale for the existence of nominal contracts that

yield sticky wages [e.g., Barro (1977), Fischer (1977a, l977b), Gray (1978),

Cukierman (1980) and Karni (1983)].
                The analysis of the optimal foreign exchange intervention, on the other hand,

focused initially on the choice between a completely fixed and a completely

flexible exchange rate systems. Subsequent examinations of the same question

have shifted the focus from the problem of choice between the two extreme exchange

rate regimes to the problem of the optimal degree of exchange rate flexibility.

Thus, the focus has shifted towards finding the optimal mix of the fixed and the

flexible exchange rate regimes. Consequently, that analysis has attempted to

determine the optimal degree of exchange rate management [e.g., Frenkel and Aizenman

(1982) and the references thereupon].

           More recently it has been recognized that the optimal degree of wage indexa—

tion depends on the prevailing exchange rate regime. Thus, Flood and Marion (1982)

showed that a small open economy with fixed exchange rates should adopt a policy of
                                    —2--




complete wage indexation whereas an economy with flexible exchange rates should

adopt a policy of partial wage indexation. This analysis was extended by Aizenman

(l983a) who showed that, under flexible exchange rates, the optimal degree of wage

indexation rises with the degree of openness of the economy as measured by the

relative size of the traded goods sector. On the other hand some authors have

recognized that the choice between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes depends

on labor market conventions [Bhandari (1982)]. Specifically, it has been argued

that the degree of wage indexation determines the relative efficiency of macro-

economic policies under alternative exchange rate regimes and, therefore, the

choice between the two regimes should depend on whether wages are indexed or not

[e.g., Sachs (1980) and Marston (1982a)].

       Common to these studies is the characteristic that the economy is either

searching for the optimal degree of wage indexation under the assumption that the

exchange rate regime (being fixed or flexible) is exogenously given, or that it

is choosing between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes under the assumption

that the degree of wage indexation is exogenously given. The point of departure

of our paper is the notion that the optimal degrees of wage indexation and exchange

rate intervention are interrelated and are mutually and simultaneously determined.

Therefore, in our analytical framework the choice of the optimal degrees of wage

indexation and exchange rate intervention emerges as the outcome of a joint opti-

mization problem. This joint optimization outcoiqe is shown to be a component of the

solution to the broader problem of the design of optimal monetary policy.

       The interdependence among monetary policy, foreign exchange intervention and

labor market conditions, as characterized by the degree of wage indexation, has been

clearly recognized by policy makers and has been viewed as an important constraint

on the conduct of policy particularly in highly inflationary countries. And yet,

except for few exceptions like Turnovsky (l983a), the question of the formal inter—
                                     —3.-




action between the optimal degrees of indexation and foreign exchange intervention

especially within the context of the design of optimal monetary policy has not

received attention in the theoretical literature. This question is addressed in

the subsequent sections.

       Section II describes the building blocks of the model, including the

determination of output and employment, the specification of wage contracts and

the determination of prices and exchange rates. One of the key characteristics

of the model is the menu of the stochastic shocks. It is assumed that the economy

is subject to stochastic shocks to productivity, to foreign prices, to purchasing

power parities, to the rate of interest and to the money supply. Much of the

analysis depends, therefore, on the relative magnitudes of these shocks, as well as

on the information set that individuals are assumed to possess.

       Our analysis assumes that, due to cost of negotiations, nominal wages are

pre—coritracted and real wages adjust according to a simple indexation formula which

links the change in wages to the observed change in the price level. The level of

employment, in turn is assumed to be determined by firms according to their demand

for labor. This specification of labor market conventions may result in discrepan-

cies between the realized levels of real wages and employment and the equilibrium

levels obtained when labor markets clear continuously without friction, The goal

of policies is to minimize the welfare loss associated with such discrepancies.

       Section III contains an analysis of the objective function which is given

a formal justification in the Appendix. In Section IV we specify the optimal money

supply process and we derive the optimal set of feedback rules that should govern

the conduct of monetary policy. These feedback rules determine the optimal response

of monetary policy to changes in exchange rates, interest rates and foreign prices.

One of the key results is that the adoption of the optimal set of feedback rules

results in the complete elimination of the welfare cost. Thus, optimal policies
                                     —4—



nullify the distortions arising from the simple indexatiori rule and from the existence

of nominal contracts. Since optimal policies succeed in the elimination of the

distortions, critical issues concerning the nature of contracts and the implications

of specific assumptions about disequilibrium positions become inconsequential. We

then proceed to examine in detail the interdependence between the optimal feedback

rules and the optimal degree of wage indexation. The section concludes with the

proposition that the number of independent feedback rules that govern a policy

aiming at the elimination of a distortion, must equal the number of independent

sources of information that influence the determination of the undistorted equili-

brium. Thus, it is shown that with a sufficient number of feedback rules for

monetary policy there may be no need to introduce wage indexation. By the same

token it is also shown that an economy that is not able to choose freely an ex-

change rate regime can still eliminate the welfare loss by supplementing the

(constrained) monetary policy with an optimal rule for wage indexation.

       Section V. examines the implications of the optimal policies on the means

and the variances of money and output. In Section VI we apply our analytical

framework to situations in which some of the policy instruments can not be used

optimally. In this context we determine the optimal indexation coefficient for

an economy that is constrained to follow a given exchange rate regime, and we

determine the optimal degree of exchange rate intervention for an economy that

is constrained to follow a given wage indexation rule. For both of these cases

we show the dependence of t.he (constrained) optimal policies on the details of

the stochastic disturbances that affect the economy, and we compute the values

of the loss function that result from the adoption of various policies. Section

VII contains concluding remarks.

 II. The Model

         The model that we use has several building blocks. These include the

 specification of output and employment, the specification of the wage rule and

 the determination of prices and exchange rates, In this section we outline the

 structure of the model.


11,1 Output and Employment

        Let the production function be


(1)                log Y. =   log B + Blog L +


where                 and       denote respectively the level of output, the input of
             ,
                 Lt
labor and a productivity shock, at time t. The productivity shock,            ,   is   assumed

to be distributed normally with a zero mean and a known variance o .              Within
each period the realized value of the productivity shock is not known and the

expectations concerning the realized value of             are formed on the basis of

the information that is available during the period. Throughout the analysis

we assume that at each point in time all prices and rates of interest are known,

The conditional expectation of        p, as based on the information available at

period t ,    is   denoted by E(u)
         Producers are assumed to maximize the expected value of profits subject

to the available information, Thus, in their demand for labor, producers are

assumed to equate the real wage to the expected marginal product of labor.

Expressed logarithmically, this equality implies that


(2)              log() log B. -        (l-)1og     Lt + E(i)


where W and P denote the nominal wage and the price level, respectively.

From equation (2), the demand for labor is
                                           —6—




 (3)           log L =       -- [_log() + log        B+
                                                          E()J
Where   L designates the demand for labor.1 In order to simplify notations

we suppress from here on the subscript t .            Thus, unless stated otherwise,
the conditional expectation of the productivity shock E(P) will be denoted

by E(P) , which will also be refered to as the perceived productivity shock.

Assuming that employment is determined by the demand for labor, we substitute

equation (3) into (1) and obtain the level of output that corresponds to the

employment of labor:



(4)          log Y =   log   B + I3c [log P       log W + log B + E(p)] + p


where Y


Equation (4) specifies the stochastic supply of output that is obtained when

the value of the productivity shock is p              In the absence of any stochastic

shocks the corresponding deterministic level of output is



(4')         log Y = log       B +   o   (log P     log W + log B)


where P    and W denote the market clearing price level and nominal wage

that are obtained in the absence of stochastic shocks.



         1Formally, the firm facing a given real wage is assumed to demand labor so
as to maximize the expected value of profits conditional on the available informa-
tion. Thus,                  u
                 pax E {BL e t_(W/p) L }
                  L                         tt
                   t
The resulting demand for labor (expressed logarithmically) is
                 d     1                            P
            log Lt = -r--- [log6B_log(-.) + log E(e t)],
and using the approximation log Et(e't)             E(P) we obtain equation (3). The same
approximation, which is valid for small values of the variance of the stochastic
shock, is also used in the derivation of the expected value of the marginal product
of labor in equation (2).
                                           7—



        For the subsequent analysis it is useful to denote by lower case letters

the percentage discrepancy of a variable from the value that it obtains in the

absence of shocks. Thus, x     log X —      log   X   .
                                                          Accordingly,   from equations (4)

and (4') we obtain



(5)          y a[p —    w + E(ld)] +



Equation (5) shows that the percentage deviation of output from its deterministic

level depends on the percentage deviations of the real wage from its deterministic

value, on the perceived productivity shock, E(i.i), as well as on the realized

productivity shock,



11.2 The Wage Rule

        It is assumed that due to costs of negotiations nominal wages are set

according to the following simple, time—invariant, indexation rule:



(6)          log W = log W + b(log P — log P0)


Equation (6) specifies the wage at period t           as a function of W , the wage

that would have prevailed if shocks were zero, and the percentage deviation of

the price from its non—stochastic value.2 In equation (6), b designates an

indexation parameter. When b=l, wages are fully indexed to the rate of infla-

tion and the real wage is rigid. When b=O, nominal wages are rigid. From

equation (6) it follows that w = bp    .
                                                Substituting bp for w in equation
(5) yields


       2 is assumed that the initial nominal wage is set at the level W
This assumption is being justified in the Appendix. The main virtue of the
assumed specification of the indexation rule is its simplicity. Much of our
subsequent analysis aims to demonstrate that with proper monetary policy, which
is governed by time—invariant feedback rules, this simplicity need not yield
sub—optina1 outcomes.
                                               —8—




(7)           y =   a[(l—b)p      + E(i)] + ji



Equation   (7),which may   be    viewed as an aggregate supply function, expresses the

supply of output as a function of the price, p , as well as the perceived and

realized productivity shocks. The dependence of the supply on the price depends

in turn on the coefficient of indexation b ; a higher indexation coefficient

results in a weaker dependence of output on the price.



 11.3 The Price Level and the Exchange Rate

        The domestic price level is assumed to be linked to the foreign price

through purchasing power parity which is assumed to hold subject to random

deviations. Let the foreign price be



(8)            log P = log P' +


where a prime (') denotes a foreign variable and where a bar over a variable

denotes the value of its fixed component. In equation (8), x1 denotes the

stochastic component of the foreign price which is assumed to be distributed

normally with zero mean and a fixed known variance. The domestic price is

linked (stochastically) to the foreign price according to:



(9)           log     =    log          log   F' +
                                 St +



where   S denotes the exchange rate and              the random deviation frrnn purchasing

power parity which is distributed normally with zero mean and a fixed known

variance. Thus,
                                              —9--




(10)          log P =      log   St + log P' +




where xx1+x2

When all shocks are zero, the purchasing power parity relation can be written as



(10')         log P =      log   S + log P'



and subtracting (10') from (10) yields



(11)          p=s+x
where, as before, we suppress the time subscript.

         The formulation in equation (11) links tie domestic price to the exchange

rate and to the stochastic shock X .            In   order to determine the level of prices

we need to incorporate monetary considerations. The equilibrium pice level and

exchange rates can be derived from the conditions of money market equilibrium.

Let the demand for money be



(12)          log      =   log   K +   log   + log      -



where M denotes nominal balances and i denotes the nominal rate of interest.

The nominal rate of interest in turn is linked to the foreign rate of interest,

i' .    Arbitrage   by investors, who are assumed to be risk neutral, assures that

uncovered interest parity holds:3


          3More precisely, when prices are stochastic, uncovered interest parity
holds only as an approximation due to Jensen's inequality. This approximation is
valid for small values of the variance of the stochastic shock to prices; see Frerike].
and Razin (1980).

(13)
              it i + E(log S1 — log S)


where E1ogS÷1 denotes the expected exchange rate for period t+1 based on

the information available at period t .         The foreign rate of interest is also

subject to a random shock, p which is distributed normally with zero mean

and a fixed known variance. Thus,



(14                = -   + n- t
               t                     -




        In specifying the money supply process we assume that the monetary

authority takes account of the relevant information conveyed by a specific set

of independent indicators. Thus, the supply of nominal balances adjusts in

response to the three independent indicators             and x according to


(15)           log       =   log   M +   —




where     (which is assumed to be distributed normally with zero mean and a

fixed known variance) denotes a random shock to the money supply process. In

equation (15) y denotes the elasticity of the money supply with respect to

s—-- the deviation of the exchange rate from its deterministic value, r denotes

the elasticity of the money supply with respect to p—— the stochastic shock to

the rate of interest, and          denotes the elasticity of the money supply with

respect to x—— the sum of the stochastic shocks to foreign prices and to

purchasing power parity. In the subsequent analysis of the money supply rule

we justify the choice of this set of indicators and determine the optimal values

of the time—invariant feedback coefficients y,r and
                                         —11—



         Equilibrium in the money market requires that



 (16)        log K + log      + log      —      = log   M +   —         —
                                                                  TPt

 and, when all shocks are zero, money market equilibrium yields4


 (16')          log K + log P + log Y — cd' = log M


 substracting (16') for (16) and omitting the time subscript yields


 (17)



         Substituting equations (7) and (11) for y and p and using the fact

 that the domestic rate of interest (from equations (13)—(14)) is i' + p         s

we obtain


 (18)          A(s +    x) +oE()      + p — n(p—s) = 6 — ys


where

               A       [l+o(1—b)J


In equation (18), A denotes the elasticity of nominal income (and thereby of

the reduced form demand for money) with respect to prices. As may be seen the

magnitude of A depends on the size of the indexation coefficient b          .   When




      4it is relevant to note that from equations (13)—(14) i—i' p +

E1ogS1_ logS , and the specification of the stochastic shocks implies that
E1ogS1 = log S     .      The implicit assumption underlying this formulation is
that E log S1 is not influenced by the observed price. Our assumption about
the absence of trend enables us to focus on the properties of the stationary equili-
brium for which the current values of the stochastic shocks do not affect the ex-
pectations about future values of the variables. The specification of equation (16')
also embodies the assumption that the equilibrium is unique. The choice of the
unique equilibrium is consistent with the criterion suggested by McCallum (1983).
On the issue of uniqueness see Calvo (1979) and Turnovsky (1983b).

wage indexation is complete (i.e., when b=l), price changes do not alter output

and X=1 .      When    b is less than unity, a rise in the price alters real wages

by (1—b) and, therefore, it also affects money demand through changing real out-

put by c(1—b) .          From equation (18) it follows that the equilibrium percentage

change in the exchange rate is


                      = (ci—T) p
                                   —
                                       (.i—6) —   aE(i.i)   —       (X+)
(19)                                   X+c+y
As is evident from equation (19), when y=0 the exchange rate is fully flexible,

and when y= , s=0 and the exchange rate is fixed. Between these two extremes

there is a wide range of intermediate exchange rate regimes.

         Recalling that p=s+< ,           and using equation (19) we can express the price as

                               P - () — E(u)                    -   (X+) +
                                           X+ct+y


As may   be   seen, the price depends on the stochastic structure of the shocks,

on the perceived value of the real shock, E(p) , on the coefficient of wage

indexation, b , on the coefficient of foreign exchange intervention, '                  , and   on

the other feedback rules which govern monetary policy

          In order to determine the value of E(j) that is consistent with the

information structure and with the requirement of rational expectations we need

to specify the information set that is available to decision makers We assume

that at each point in time individuals observe the current values of the price,

p ,    the exchange rate, s , and the rates of interest, i and 1'            ,
                                                                                 but   they cannot

observe directly the stochastic shocks. Since our analysis does not deal with

issues arising from asymmetric information, we also assume that individuals

know the policy feedback rules. The available information set can be used by

individuals in order to infer the values of some of the shocks. For example,

the observed values of p and s imply the value of x (from equation (11)),
                                       —13—



and the observed value of i' implies the value of p (from equation (14)).

While individuals do not possess knowledge about the values of the real pro-

ductivity shock, p , and the money supply shock,          6 ,   their   knowledge of the

values of p,> and p along with their knowledge of the coefficient of wage

indexation, b , and of the monetary policy feedback rules 6,y,T and ,                implies
from equation (20), a value of (p—6). The value of (i.i—6) may be viewed as the

informational content of the price p          The assumption of rational expectations

implies that the optimal forecast of p        reflects   an efficient use of this

information. Thus, the value of E(p) may be computed form a regression of u

on (p—6) .   The ordinary least squares estimate of the real shock that is

obtained through this procedure is



              E(p) =




 where


                  cov(p,.i—6)
                         a

 and where a2            denotes the variance of (p—S)          When    the   shocks are indepen—

 dent of each other the regression coefficient becomes


                   a2
                         p

                   i-i       6



 where the variance of a variable, x ,        is   denoted by a2


         This procedure for determining E(P) may be viewed as a short cut to
  the more lengthy computation following the undetermined coefficients method.
  An analogous short cut is adopted in Canzoneri, Henderson and Rogoff (1983)
  in the context of an analysis of the informational content of interest rates.
         Finally, substituting the estimates of the real shock E(1.1)   into

 equation (20) we obtain


 (21)              p =
                       (a—t)   + (a+y—)x —   (1+o) (p—a)
                                  X+ct+y

 This solution for p can be substituted into equation (7) to yield an expres-

 sion for the aggregate supply as a function of the stochastic structure of the

 shocks, the coefficient of wage indexation, b (that is embodied in the value

 of X), and the various feedback coefficients which govern policy. In order to

 determine the optimal values of these coefficients we turn next to an analysis

 of the objective function.




 III    The Loss Function

         The foregoing analysis determined the level of output, y (or more pre-

 cisely the percentage deviation of output from the level that would have prevailed

 in the absence of shocks) under the assumption that the level of employment is

 determined exclusively by the demand for labor (equation (3)). The resultant dis-

equilibrium in the labor market induces welfare cost. We will assume that the

policy goal is to minimize this welfare cost by choosing the optimal values of

the coefficient of indexation and the other feedback rules.

        In order to compute the welfare cost, we compute the level of employment

L that would have prevailed under conditions of full clearance of labor markets.

We then compare L with the actual level of employment L , and compute the

welfare cost that is associated with the discrepancy between L and L
                                      —15—




Diagrammatically, in Figure 1, L and L denote respectively the equilibrium and

the actual levels of employment. The shaded area ABC measures the welfare cost.6

We turn now to the computation of the welfare cost

        Let the supply of labor be



(22)         log L = log A ÷ c log



where     denotes the elasticity of labor supply, and workers are assumed to be

risk neutral. Equating the supply of labor, equation (22), with the demand for

labor, equation (3), yields the equilibrium level of employment, log L , where



             log L     log A +   [a(E(u) + log B) log A1
(23)




and subtracting from (23) the equilibrium level of employment that would have

prevailed in the absence of shocks, we obtain



(24)         9. =




        Actual   employment, however, may not adjust to clear labor markets; rather,

it is governed by the assumptions that labor is demand determined and wages are

determined by the indexation rule. Subtracting from the actual supply of output

(equation (1)) the supply that would have obtained in the absence of shocks, yields



(25)        y=

        6A formal derviation of the loss function is presented in the Appendix
in terms of utility maximization. In what follows we provide a somewhat less
formal expOsition in terms of consumer and producer surplus.

and thus, employment (or more precisely the percentage deviation of employment

 from the level that would have prevailed in the absence of shocks) is


 (26)




 By using equation (5) for the value of y, Z can be written as



 (26')




 and, therefore, the discrepancy (in percentage terms) between equilibrium and

 actual employment is



 (27)




         In order to compute the welfare loss associated with this discrepancy we

need to multiply it by one half of the difference    between the demand and the

supply prices at the actual employment leveL From the demand for and the supply

of labor these demand and supply prices (or more precisely the percentage changes

thereof) are, respectively,



(28)         (w—p)
                     d   —   ___
                             ____


(29)         (w—p)S = ____

and the percentage welfare cost of suboptimal employment is therefore


(30)
            — (. +   .) {—(w—p)+

                                     —17—




To obtain the welfare loss in units of output we need to multiply equation (30)

by the equilibrium real wage bill (W/P) L   .   The resulting quantity corresponds

to the area of the triangle ABC in Figure 1.

        As is clear from equation (30), once we omit the irrelevant constants,

minimizing the expected welfare loss on the basis of the information available

at period t—1, amounts to minimizing the loss function H:


(31)          H = E [{— (w—p)
                                +_E(i)}2

where 1tl denotes the information set available at period t—1.7




IV. Optimal Policies

        In order to find the optimal values of the coefficient of indexation and

the other feedback coefficients which govern policy we substitute into equation

(31) the indexation rule, w=bp, the forecasting rule, E(i)=(.i—ô) , and the

solution for p from equation (21) and obtain the loss function (32):


         71t is relevant to note that the formulation of the objective function
in terms of a minimization of the welfare cost of the distortions in the labor
market is equivalent to the more conventional (but somewhat less informative)
formulation of minimizing the expected squared discrepancy of output, y , from
the equilibrium level,     , obtained with full market clearing [see Aizenman,
 (1983b)]. This equivalence becomes evident by noting that since (y—y)=(2—),
E(y—y)2 = 2E(2—)2 .     Our focus on the labor market in the computation of the
welfare cost presumes that other markets are undistorted. An explicit incorpora-
tion of this assumption would require that monetary policies at home and abroad
generate the optimal rate of inflation. With this interpretation, our formulation
of the stochastic shock to the money supply would be viewed as a random deviation
from the deterministic trend reflecting the optimal rate of inflation. Equation
 (31) presumes that the authorities aim to minimize the expectations of the welfare
loss on the basis of the information set available at period t—l. The alternative
specification which minimizes the expected welfare loss on the basis of the currently
available information would yield a feedback rule that is not time—invariant. Since,
as will be seen below the time—invariant feedback rules eliminate the welfare loss,
the choice between the two procedures might reflect the excess costs associated
with state—dependent rule.

In    equation (32), 8 denotes the change in the real wage (1—b)p

         In interpreting the ioss function (32), it is useful to note that the

term (i—S) denotes the private sectors' optimal forecast of the real shock,

p , and its product with a/(c+c) measures therefore the equilibrium change in

real wages that would occur under an optimal use of information. On the other

hand the actual change in real wages that results from the adoption of specific

feedback rules is —                        The squared discrepancy between the two magnitudes,

that is, the variance of the error in the determination of actual real wages,

entails welfare loss which is measured by the loss function H .                       By inspecting

the value of B in equation (33) it is clear that in order to minimize the loss

function (32), we need the set

the values of 1 and                        are set according to equations (34) and (35), the loss

funtion (32) becomes


(32')                  E[{[-(l+Bcy) +            2-           t-l
                                              —19—




 and it is evident that the value of             which equates (32') to zero is:




 (36)
                *_— ________
                     (a-4-€)(l-I-a)

Finally, by equating the value of            with its definition in equation (33), we

solve for the optimal value of y


 ()                  (1 - b)
                                (a)       (1 +        --
and substituting 1 + a(l — b) for the value of A we obtain

                                a   +   E(l+BaP) -
(37)           y*   (1 -   b)                        (1 +   )


        Equations (34),(35) and (37') provide three restrictions on the values of
the four policy coefficients t,,y and b .              As is evident, this set of restrictions

contains one degree of freedom. Since, however, the structure of the model implies

that these restrictions are recursive, it follows that of the four policy coeffi-

cients, r is indispensable. The degree of freedom permits setting an arbitrary

value to one of the coefficients in the triplet (b,,y) while setting the other

two at their optimal values. For example, if the indexation coefficient, b, is

given exogeneously, the restrictions in equations (34),(35) and (37') imply the

optimal values of          .     This provides the rationale for the specification of

the money supply process in equation (15). Adopting this optimal set of feedback

rules for the money supply process results in the elimination of the welfare loss.

        Equation (37') also suggests that the optimal value of y depends on

the structural parameters of the economy (including the semi—elasticity of the

demand for money (a), the elasticity of output with respect to labor input (s),

and the elasticity of the supply of labor (C)); on the stochastic structure
                                           —20—



of the real and the monetary shocks (that govern the value of ij) and on the

indexation coefficient (b). Thus, for example, the higher the elasticity of

the supply of labor, the larger becomes the optimal value of y, that is, the

larger becomes the desirability of greater fixity of exchange rates.

            As is evident by inspection of equation (37'), around the optimum,there

is a negative correlation between the degree of wage indexation and the value
    *
of y    .     Thus, an economy with a higher degree of wage indexation will find it
optimal to increase the flexibility of exchange rates (reduce y*)• As the co-

efficient of wage indexation approaches unity, the degree of real wage rigidity
                                           *                     8
increases, and the optimal value of y         approaches —(1+c).      Furthermore, since
                                       *                        *
from equation (35), the value of           depends linearly on y     it also follows that

a higher degree of wage indexation lowers the optimal degree to which monetary

policy responds to x (the shocks to foreign prices and to purchasing power parities).

             The foregoing analysis also demonstrates that as long as the money supply

responds optimally to s,p, and x           which in the present case are the relevant

sources of independent information that can be used to yield the market clearing

real wage, there is no need to introduce wage indexation. Thus, it was shown

that when the degree of freedom provided by equations (34),(35) and (37) is used
up by setting the irtdexation coefficient at an exogenously given level, the

welfare loss may be eliminated by a proper choice of ,T, and             .   If,   on the

other hand, the value of y was given exogenously, then the welfare loss could

still be eliminated by supplementing the optimal values of T and             in the money
 supply process with an optimal rule of wage indexation. From equation (37') the

optimal value of b for an exogenously given value of y is:


         8At the extreme, with full indexation, the optimal value of y is indeter—
mined. This may be verified by references to the loss function in equations (32)—
(33), where it is seen that when b=l the value of is zero and, as a result the
value of the loss function is independent of y. Intuitively, full indexation intro-
duces real wage rigidity. Consequently, changes in the price level which can be
brought about through changes in the exchange rate and which are influenced by the
exchange rate regime, will be inconsequential since, due to the rigidity of real
wages, they will induce equiproportionate changes in nominal wages.

Accordingly,   a rise in the relative variance of the real shock, a rise in the

elasticity of output with respect to labor input, and a rise in the degree of

fixity of exchange rates result in a lower optimal value of the indexation

coefficient, whereas a rise in the elasticity of labor supply raises the

optimal degree of wage indexation. It is noteworthy that the optimal rela-

tion between b and y is linear. This might reflect the fact that the various

instruments are used optimally and the welfare loss is eliminated. It is also

relevant to note that by setting 'y=O ,                       the   optimal indexation coefficient

becomes

where b      denotes the closed—economy value. This is indeed the optimal indexa—

tion coefficient that is derived in Aizenman's (1983b) closed—economy model.9

         The economic intuition underlying the redundancy of one of the coeffi-

cients in the triplet (y,,b) is implicit in the structure of the model. Since

the rate of interest appears only in the demand for money, the only way of

eliminating the impact of an interest rate shock on the loss function is by
          *
setting T =a as in equation (34). No other feedback rule can eliminate the

impact of an interest rate shock. In contrast, the rest of the shocks manifest

themselves through the price level and, together with the given nominal wage,

they impact on the real wage which is the source of the welfare loss. Since

from equation (21) y and        influence the price level whereas the wage in—

dexation coefficient influences both the price level and the nominal wage,

they all alter the real wage directly. Given the nature of the shocks we need

oniy three independent feedback rules)0Therefore, it is sufficient to use in

addition to T , which is in this model an indispensable feedback rule, any

other pair from the triplet (y,,b)

        The examples analyzed above illustrated the substitutability between

exchange rate flexibility and wage indexation under the assumption that T and

 ——   the instruments that respond to interest rate shocks, p , and       to foreign

price shocks,   x —— are set optimally. Suppose now that the authorities do not
                                                                      *
adopt a feedback rule for x .    Under these circumstances, again T = a         and,


       9The intuition underlying this result is that the optimal coefficients of
the feedback rule for the open—economy ensure that the price level effects arising
from the shocks p, and x (that originate from the openness of the economy) are offset
by setting a and a+y . Thus, at the optimum, policy succeeds in creating an
outcome that is equivalent to the one generated by =x=0 • Since in the closed
economy =xrO, we only need to substitute y=O in equation (38) to obtain the
closed—economy result. Alternatively, b can be obtained directly from the loss
function (32)—(33) by noting that when te economy is closed, p===o, e= —(l+)(—),
and the value of b which eliminates the welfare loss is b* as in (38').

       10An analogous redundancy proposition is developed in Canzoneri, Henderson
and Rogoff (1983) in connection with the usage of the information contained in
nominal interest rates. It is noteworthy that our objective function presumes
that the only policy objective is the elimination of distortions. If, in addition,
the policy maker wishes to reduce the variance of prices then the redundant
coefficient could be employed in the attainment of that target.
                                                —23—


since O ,     it   follows from equation (35) that the optimal value of y is —c#.

Thus, when =O the solution for the optimal exchange rate regime is unique

and, in contrast with the case described by equation (37'), the value of

is independent of the deterministic and the stochastic structure of the economy.

          The optimal value of the indexation coefficient corresponding to that

case can be found from equation (38). Substituting y= —ct      yields:

That is, when in the open economy r,y, and b are set at their optimal values,

the resultant wage indexation coefficient is larger than the corresponding

closed economy optimal indexation coefficient.
          The incorporation of the various shocks as components of the feedback

rules governing the money supply process may serve to supplement Tinbergen's

theorem concerning the relation between targets and instruments of economic

policy.   tn our case the single "target" for economic policy is the elimination

of a distortion to the real.wage. This single target can be attained by means

of a single policy instrument. Our analysis shows that the single policy instru-

ment is capable of attaining the target only if it is triggered by a sufficient

number of independent indicators. This number of independent indicators for the


        This result reflects our specification of the nature of the shocks by
which the openness of the economy does not increase the exposure to foreign real
shocks. In prinicple the relative importance of real shocks may be higher for
the open economy if, for example, it faces shocks to the price of imported raw *
materials. In that case the optimal indexation coefficient may be lower than b

feedback rules must equal the number of independent sources of information that

influence the determination of the undistorted real wage.   This perspective on

the concept of policy instruments was illustrated in our model in terms of the

characteristics of the money supply process. It does, however, have relevance

for a wider range of policies including the characteristics of fiscal spending.

         Finally, we have argued that the optimal policy could follow a sophisti-

cated money supply rule which is triggered by a sufficient number of independent

indicators. Alternatively, the optimal policy could follow a sophisticated wage

indexation formula that is not limited to respond only to changes in the price

level. Following the general principle, such an indexation formula will be

optimal only if it contains a sufficient number of feedback rules and, as was

argued before, the number of such independent feedback rules must equal the

number of the independent sources of information that matter in determining

the market clearing real wage.12 The choice among the alternatives of a

sophisticated money supply rule, a sophisticated wage indexation formula or

any other sophisticated set of policies is likely to be governed by the relative

costs and complexities associated with each alternative. Such costs may reflect

the difficulties of prompt implementations of alternative feedback rules. The

choice among alternative policies is also likely to be influenced by external

constraints (like the rules of the IMF on foreign exchange intervention) and

domestic institutional constraints (like the relative strength of the monetary

authority and labor unions). Therefore, the actual choice of policy is likely

to differ across different countries.

formula in the context of a closed economy, see Fischer (1977a) and Karni (1983).

 V The Optimal Levels and Variability of Money and Output

             In the previous section we derived the optimal values of the feedback

coefficients in the money supply rule along with the optimal coefficient of wage

indexation. We showed that when the various coefficients are set at their optimal

values the welfare loss is eliminated and the real equilibrium replicates the

undistorted situation in which labor markets clear without friction. In this

section we assume that the optimal policies have been adopted and we examine

the implications of these optimal policies on the means and the variances of

the money supply and Output.


V.1. The Optimal Money Supply

            The money supply function was specified in equation (15) that is

repeated here for convenience:


(15)                   m = S—ys—rp—


Substituting the optimal values of r and       E   from equations (34)—(35), and

recalling that p=s+ ,      yields

(40)                   m = 6—yp—a(p+)


Substituting (37) for the optimal value of y , collecting terms and recalling

that p+x—p =    i—i'   yields the optimal money supply:


(40')             m = 6-[(1--b)     O+C(    - 1]p-a(i-i')

           Equation (40') which may be interpreted as a reduced form optimal money
                                        *
supply,   expresses the dependence of m    on the price and on the rate of interest.

As may be seen a rise in the rate of interest triggers a reduction in the money

supply. The optimal reduction in the money supply aims to restore money market
                                         —26—



 equilibrium and thereby to neutralize the effect of the change in the rate of

 interest on the price and. through it, on the real wage. Therefore, the (semi)
                   *                                                         *
 elasticity   of m with respect to i is             —ci, and changes in in       exactly
 match and offset changes in the demand for money.13 The response of the

 optimal money supply to changes in p is more involved since it depends on

 the stochastic structure and on the coefficient of indexation. A change in p

 affects the real wage. For the case in which the change in price results from

 a monetary shock the equilibrium real wage should not be changed. Therefore,
                                              *
 to   restore the initial equilibrium,   in       and p should change equiproportionally,

as indicated by the second term in the bracketed coefficient of p in equation

 (40'). On the other hand, the change in p may reflect the outcome of a real

shock which necessitates a change in the equilibrium real wage. This factor,

which is represented by the first term in the bracketed coefficient of p in
                                                          *14 As
equation (40 ),   requires   a negative response of in .            a result, when both
                                                                      *
factors   are taken into account, the optimal dependence of         in    on     p may be
                                                                                       *
negative or positive. When the coefficient of wage indexation is low, m /p
is likely to be negative; on the other hand, when the coefficient of indexation

is high, changes in p have very little impact on the real wage and, therefore,

in order to facilitate the attainment of an equilibrium change in the real wage
  *
ni /Bp may have to be positive.


         13This property of the optimal money supply reflects the assumption that the
rate of interest does not affect the real equilibrium of the economy. In a more
elaborate framework the rate of interest may affect the real equilibrium through
altering the supply of labor or through its impact on relative conunodity prices.

          1This negative response is needed in order to mitigate the change in
the real wage that results from the change in price. The extent of the needed
mitigation of the change in the real wage depends negatively on 4 and b

                   In order to obtain further understanding of the characteristics of the opti-

mal money supply, it is convenient to express m as a function of the stochastic

shocks. For this purpose we note from equation (21) that with optimal policies

the optimal price is

     equation (40) and collecting terms yields

The economic interpretation of (40'') is facilitated by substituting the

perceived value of the real shock, E(i), for p(p—6) and by rewriting (40'')

as

                               *

               *
Thus,      m —        is   the part of the money supply that is attributed to the optimal

feedback rules. As may be seen, the parameter g is the elasticity of the optimal

  money supply with respect to the perceived value of the real shock. The sign

of this elasticity depends on the coefficient of indexation and on the values

of the structural parameters. Further insight is obtained by noting that from
                                                 —28—




 equations (24) and (21') gE(p)=(y—p)+(1+c)p

                                                               and, therefore,

                             *
                                 =

                         m           y + p — c(P+x*p )


 Equation (40''') shows that the optimal money supply ensures that money market
 equilibrium prevails, that the level of output corresponds to the non—distorted

 level, , and that the resulting price and the rate of interest correspond to
                             *               *
 their   optimal values, p        and p+p
           Using equation (40''), the variance of the optimal money supply can be

 written as


 (41)                            =   [l+g(2+g)ip]c2 +


 From equation (41) it is evident that a rise in the variance of
                                                                 p,x and p
 raises the variance of the optimal money supply while a rise in the variance

 of 6 excerts an ambiguous effect. Specifically, for —2<g<0 ,                    a rise in the
                                                           *
 variance of 6 increases the variance of m                       On the other hand if g>O, as
would be the case when the coefficient of indexation is low and the product 8c

 is high, or if g<—2, as would be the case when the coefficient of indexation

approaches unity, a rise in the variance of 6 reduces the varaince of m*

tiori   given above for the case of a positive dependence of the level of              m

on the price in equation (40').


V.2 Optimal Outp
            The level of output corresponding
                                                          to the optimal policies is   y
which equals the level of output obtained
                                                        with full market clearing. This level
can be found from equation (24) and (25)
                                                    or, alternatively, it can be found by
                                              —29—




substituting the optimal price from equation (21')          into   the aggregate supply in

equation (7). Thus,


(42)
                                =            + p


From equation (42) it follows that the variance of the optimal level of output

can be written as


(43)                       a- =      [1+   iL(2 +


As is evident, the variance of the optimal level of output depends positively on

the variance of the real shock, a2 , and negatively on the variance of the

monetary shock a .              Since a rise in the variance of the real shock raises

the value of   11.'   ,   its   effect on the variance of optimal output is being magni-

fied and the elasticity of a2 with respect to a2 exceeds unity.

VI. Constrained Optimization and Welfare

          The analysis up to this point determined the optimal degrees of wage

indexation and the optimal values of the feedback coefficients thich govern

monetary policy. The optimal values of the feedback coefficients were determined

by minimizing the loss function. In this section we compute the values of the

loss function that result from the adoption of various feedback rules. This

procedure enables us to compare the welfare loss that results from the imposition

of alternative constraints on the degree of wage indexation, exchange rate inter—

venion and other policy instruments. The analysis also yields some more general
                                                       —30—



conclusions concerning the link between the information set and the number of

independent feedback coefficients necessary for welfare maximization.

          Using equations (32)—(33), the loss function can be written as




                                                               ()2 a

where


                = (ct—T)2a2 + (ct+y—)2a2 +




        We first consider the situation in which the only instrument of policy

that can be set at its optimal level is the coefficient of wage indexation, In

order to find the optimal value of the indexation coefficient, we note that in

the loss function (44), b appears only in c ; therefore, minimization of H

with respect to b is equivalent to minimization with respect to                         (holding

y constant). this procedure yields the optimal value of 4


                                            a2
                    =
(45)                     —-- (1+ap) —-


By equating             with the definition of                in (33) we can obtain the optimal

value of the indexation coefficient.

          Substituting                  for           in equation (44) and assuming that =r=O
the loss function becomes

where    H(b ;y) indicates that the loss function is evaluated under the condi-

tion that only the coefficient of wage indexation is set optimally, while the

value of y is set at an arbitrary level. When the exchange rate is fixed

(y-9 the value of the loss function is

and,    when the exchange rate is flexible (y0) the value of the lOSS       function   is

As is evident from comparison of equations (46') and (46").

Thus, except for extreme cases (like, for example, when there are no real shocks),

the welfare loss for an economy for which only the wage indexation coefficient

is set optimally is higher under fixed exchange rates than under flexible ex-

change rates. This result confirms the proposition established by Flood and

Marion (1982).

             The foregoing analysis presumed that the value of y is set at an

arbitrary level which need not correspond to its optimal value. In order to

obtain the optimal value of the coefficient of intervention in the foreign

exchange market, we differentiate the loss function (44) with respect to

and equate the derivative to zero:
                                                         —32—

                          --      - + 2(a+y—)a2          ,2 =0



 The    assumption   that the coefficient of wage indexation has been set at its
                      *
 optimal value b          ,       implies that at this point aH/=0 and, therefore, equation
 (48) implies that the optimal foreign—exchange intervention coefficient is


                              *
 (49)                     y =—ct


Substituting (49) into the loss function (44) and recalling that in the present

stage of the analysis we have assumed that policy is constrained to set 0

yields


                          *       *       cr2pa2   —        a2a2
(50)                                  =
                     H(b '

                                          (c+c)        a a + (l+cyp)


where H(b*, y*) indicates that the loss function is evaluated under the

conditions that both wage indexation and exchange rate intervention are optimal.

           By subtracting equation (50) from (46) we obtain the marginal benefit

from the additional instrument of exchange rate intervention. It can be shown

that this marginal benefit is proportional to (a ÷ y)2a2                Thus,when wages

are optimally indexed, the benefit from exchange rate intervention is proportional

to the squared discrepancy between the actual value of y and the constrained optimal

value (—a), as well as to the variance of prices which arise from the foreign

sector (through x). It follows, therefore, that if o = 0                and wages are optimally

indexed economic welfare is independent of the exchange rate regime. In this case,

however, as is evident from equation (50), there is still welfare loss that is

proportional to a2
                                                   —33—



        Inspection of equation (46) shows that when there are no real shocks,

that is when a=O, H(b;y)=0.                 Thus, in this case, the single instrument of

optimal indexation Is capable of eliminating the welfare loss. Under these

circumstances, of course, the use of exchange rate intervention in addition

to optimal wage indexation would also eliminate the welfare loss (as is seen

from equation (50) with          =   0),    but the marginal gain from the additional

instrument would be zero and the optimal exctange rate regime would be indeter-

minate. In contrast, it can be shown that if the only available instrument

was that of exchange rate intervention, then the optimal use of this instrument

would not eliminate the welfare loss which, in turn, would be proportional to

the squared discrepancy between the actual value of b and unity (its optimal

value). It follows, therefore, that

These inequalities suggest that when there are no real shocks, the instrument

of wage indexation has a comparative advantage in minimizing the welfare cost

of labor market distortions as compared with the instrument of exchange rate

intervention.

        Equation (50) suggests that when              o = 0,      H(b*, .v*)         = 0.   Thus, in this

case, the optimal use of the instruments of wage indexation and exchange rate

intervention eliminate completely the welfare loss even though the value of

was constrained to equal zero. Likewise, inspection of equation (46) suggests

that if both o and a are zero, as would b: the case in a closed economy,

then H(b )=0. In this closed—economy case, b =bc which is defined in equa—

tion(38'). This result corresponds to that in Aizenman (l983b) where it is shown

that, in the context of a closed economy, the optimal use of the single instru—
                                        —34—


ment of wage indexation is capable of eliminating the welfare cost of labor

market distortion 15

          The economic intuition underlying these results can be stated in terms

of the relation between the number of independent sources of information and

the number of independent feedback policy rules. Two of the key assumptions

underlying the model in this paper are that the level of employment is deter-

mined by the demand for labor and that real wages are adjusted according to

an indexation formula that links the real wage only to the observed price

level, The use of the price level in the adjustment of real wages as the only

indicator to which the indexation rule applies may not permit an efficient use

of the information that is available to economic agents. For example, in our

model it is assumed that at each point in time individuals observe (or are

able to infer without error) the shocks to prices, x   ,   the   shocks to the rate

of interest, p, and the difference between the real and the monetary shocks,

  - 5.   Adopting a single feedback rule that links the real wage to the price

level through the indexation coefficient does not use efficiently the more

detailed information that is available in the open economy and that could be

exploited in the adjustment of real wages. This is the reason for the proposi—
                                          *
tion   that, except for special cases, H(b ;y) > 0

          In equation (46), the value of the term in the squared brackets character-

izes the quality of the use of information in the adjustment of real wages.



             comparison between this result and that of Gray (1976) illustrates the
role of the number of sources of information. In Gray's model there are two inde-
pendent sources of information that can be used in determining the equilibrium real
wage. Therefore, the use of wage indexation as the single feedback rule does not
eliminate the welfare loss. In contrast, when the present model is reduced to its
closed—economy counterpart, there is only one independent source of relevant infor-
mation (information about jj—S) and, therefore, the optimal use of the single instru-
ment of wage indexation eliminates the welfare loss. This discussion implies that
if the magnitude of ji was also known along with the knowledge of prices, interest
rates and the exchange rate, then the specification of the optimal money supply,
which aims at eliminating the welfare loss, would include p as an additional
indicator.

When this term is zero, as would for example be the case when a2 = a2 =          0,   then
                                                                        p    x
the information set is used most efficiently in the sense that the observed

price provides all of the relevant information for determining the optimal
adjustment of real wages. Under such circumstances, indeed, the optimal

indexation coefficient b* eliminates the welfare loss, as would be the

case in the closed economy. In general, however, if              or   are positive,
                                                            xp
then the squared bracket in equation (46) would be positive, indicating that

the adoption of a single policy indicator when there are more independent

sources of information does not result in a market clearing real wage and,

therefore,     does not eliminate the welfare loss. Another illustration of

this argument is provided by equation (50) where it is assumed that the policy

uses two independent feedback rules. Under such circumstances, if there are

three Independent sources of information (the observed values of s, p and p),
                                                    *            *
the   optimal values of the two feedback rules b         and y do not eliminate the

welfare loss and H(b*, y*) >   0.   In contrast, if there were no shocks to the

rate of interest, there would only be two independent sources of information

(s and p); in such a case the term in the squared brackets in equation (50)

would be zero indicating that the optimal use of the two feedback rules is

capable of eliminating the welfare loss since it generates the market clearing

real wage. Up to now we have assumed that policy was constrained to set r=0

In that case, as was seen from equation (50) the optimal use of wage indexation

and foreign exchange intervention does not eliminate the welfare cost in the

presence of interest—rate shocks. Inspection of equation (44) reveals that if

policy is free to adopt also a feedback rule in response to the interest rate

indicator,   then T   would be set at T
                                         *
                                          =    .   In   that case the welfare loss would be

                                16

             The foregoing discussion delt with the policies necessary for the

  elimination of the welfare loss arising from suboptimal real wages. The

  fundamental principle, however, is more general. Policies can be designed

  to eliminate the welfare cost of distortions. The general principle developed

  by Tinbergen states that in order to attain n targets, economic policy must

  possess at least n independent instruments. Our application demonstrated

  in   attaining the targets only if the instruments are influenced by a sufficient

  number of independent indicators.17 This sufficient number must equal the

  number of independent sources of information that influence the determination

  of the undistorted level of the targets.



  VII. Concluding Remarks

                  In this paper we have analysed the relation between the optimal degrees

  of wage indexation and foreign exchange intervention. The optimal values of these

  policy instruments were obtained as components of the solution to the broader

  problem of the design of optimal monetary policy. The model used for the analysis

  was governed by the characteristics of the stochastic shocks which affect the

  economy and by the information set that individuals were assumed to possess.


      lôThe marginal benefit from the additional interest rate instrument is computed
in equation (50) where H(b*,y*) measures the welfare loss in the absence of the
additional instrument. As may be seen an increase in the variances of      and p
raises the marginal benefit, whereas an increase in the values of   and , and In
the variance of 6 lowers the marginal benefit. Economically, the explanation for
the negative dependence of H(b*,y*) on the variance of 6 reflects the second
best situation: the welfare loss H(b*,y*) represents a dis-tortion that results
from a sub—optimal policy with respect to p, and the rise in the variance of 6
mitigates the welfare cost of this distortion.

      1'The requirement that the indicators must be independent is reflected in
our case by the exclusion of the price p from the set of indicators governing
the supply of money. Clearly, of the triplet p,s, and x only two contain in-
dependent information that can be usefully exploited. Thus, of the three, we
chose to include s and x in the set of indicators.
                                       —37—


        Throughout the analysis the optimal policies are obtained with reference

to an objective function which has the desirable property of possessing explicit

welfare justification. It represents the welfare loss arising from the assumptions

that employment is governed by the demand for labor, nominal wages are precontracted

and real wages are adjusted according to an indexation formula that links the real

wage to the observed price. The use of the price level in the adjustment of real

wages as the only indicator to which the indexatlon rule applies may not permit

an efficient use of the information that is available to economic agents and that

could be exploited in the adjustment of real wages. The loss function reflects

the welfare cost associated with a discrepancy between the equilibrium change in
real wages that would occur under an optimal use of information and the actual

change in real wages that results from labor market conventions and from the

adoption of specific feedback rules.
        One of the key findings of the paper concerns the conditions under which

the optimal policy, by minimizing the loss function, also eliminates the welfare

cost. It was shown that if the number of independent feedback rules that govern

policy is equal to the number of independent sources of information that are

relevant for the determination of the market clearing real wage, then the adop-

tion of the optimal feedback rules eliminates completely the welfare cost of

labor market distortions. This proposition is important since the elimination

of the welfare cost implies that the optimal policies are capable of reproducing

the equilibrium that would be obtained under the assumption that labor markets

were cleared after the realization of the stochastic shocks. By reproducing that

 equilibrium the optimal policies nullify the distortions that result from the

 assumption that,because of contracts, nominal wages are predetermined.   When such

 an optimum obtains the important issues concerning the implications of the assump-

 tion that employment is determined by the demand for labor, as raised by Cukierman
                                       —38—


(1980), are inconsequential since, at the optimum   ,   there   is an equality between

the demand and the supply of labor. Similarily, when the optimum obtains many of

the critical issues concerning the conceptual difficulties associated with the

existence of suboptimal contracts, as raised by Barro (1977), are also inconse-

quential since, at the optimum, the contracts (along with the optimal policy)

are optimal. In that sense the equilibrium which eliminates the welfare loss

is analogous to the closed economy equilibria that were analysed by Karni (1983)

and Aizenman (1983a),

        The principle underlying the determination of the optimal set of feedback

rules was illustrated in terms of the design of a sophisticated monetary policy.

Alternatively, analogous feedback rules could be incorporated into the design

of a sophisticated wage indexation formula. As long as each independent source

of information that is relevant for the determination of the market clearing

real wage has a corresponding independent feedback rule, which is used optimally,

the resulting equilibrium replicates the distortion free equilibrium.

         Our analysis showed that when wage indexation serves as one. of the

independent feedback rules, then a rise in the variance of the real productivity

shock and a rise in the elasticity of output with respect to labor input lower

the optimal degree of wage indexation. On the other hand a rise in the variance

of the monetary shock and a rise in the elasticity of labor supply raisa the

optimal degree of wage indexation. As for the relation between wage indexation

and foreign exchange intervention, it was shown that, around the optimum, a rise

in the degree of exchange rate flexibility raises the optimal degree of wage indexa—

tion.

        We concluded our discussion with an examination of the consequences of

departures from optimal policies. In this context we compared the welfare loss

that results from the imposition of alternative constraints on the degree of wage
                                        —39—




indexation, on foreign exchange intervention and on the magnitudes of other feed-

back coefficients.


        One of the limitations of the analysis in this paper relates to the level

of aggregation. We have assumed that there is one composite good which is inter-

nationally traded at a (stochastically) given world price. A useful extension

would allow for a richer menu of commodities including those that are internationally

tradable and those which are non—tradable. The presence of non—tradable goods

would then relax some of the constraints that were imposed by the small country

assumption. Owing to its relative size, the economy would still be a price taker

in the world traded goods market,but the relative price of its non—traded goods

would be endogenously determined by market—clearing conditions. Such an exten-

sion should facilitate the distinction between mechanisms and policies that

operate on the price level and those that operate on relative prices. In

analysing the role of relative prices a distinction should also be made between

the relative price of traded goods ——   the   external terms of trade —— and the

relative price of non—traded goods ——   the   internal terms of trade (the, real

exchange rate). The introduction on non—traded goods should also permit an

analysis of the influence of the degree of openness (as measured by the relative

size of the traded goods sector) on the optimal values of the feedback rules that

govern policy. Previous studies suggest that the degree of openness may play a

significant role in influencing optimal policies [e.g., Frenkel and Aizenman (1982)
and Aizenman (l983a)J. The broader menu of goods should also facilitate an

analysis of the optimal indexation rules in the face of supply shocks [as in

Marston and Turnovsky (1983)],as well as an analysis of the proper price index

that should be used in the indexation formula [as in Marston(l982b)].
                                      —40—



        Another limitation of the analysis is the lack of an explicit distinction

between permanent and transitory shocks. In our specifications the stochastic

disturbances were assumed to be independent of each other and to be drawn from

a distribution with a constant variance and a zero mean, A more complete analysis

would distinguish between permanent and transitory shocks and would incorporate

the role of time preference; thereby, it would introduce dynamic considerations

into the analysis of the optimal choice of policies.

        It is relevant to note that the nature of labor contracts assumed in this

paper was motivated by realism. Accordingly, we assumed that contracts specify
the nominal wage whereas the level of output is determined by firms,and that the

indexation formula is simple in that it adjusts wages to changes in the price level

rather than to a complex set of variables. Our analysis does not attempt to

contribute to the theory that explains this conventional form of labor contract

[on this see Barro (1977) and Fischer (1977b)].

        Finally, we define the equilibrium that replicates the performance of

an economy in which labor markets clear without friction, as the social optimum.

Implicit in this definition of the social optimum is the assumption that indivi-

duals and firms are risk neutral since, in general [as shown by Azariadis (1978)],

when attidudes towards risk differ across economic agents, auction markets do not

allocate risk efficiently and individuals find it advantageous to enter into long—

term risk—sharing contracts. Our assumption, therefore, precludes rationalizing

the existence of labor contracts in terms of the insurance function.   Therefore,

in this framework [as in Gray (1978)], the existence of contracts reflects the

cost of continuous renegotiations.

                                     APPENDIX




The Derivation of the Loss Function

          In this Appendix we provide a formal justification for our use of

the loss function.

          Define by ()      the   equilibrium real wage that clears the labor market.

This equilibrium value of the real wage clears the market for any given expected

value of the real shock conditional on the available information. Since in

equilibrium the real wage equals the expected marginal product of labor, the

amount of labor, L ,     that     clears the labor market when the real wage is (wIP)

is defined by




(A—l)             E[YL(L)lIt] =      ()

where     I denotes the information set available at time t, and where YL(L)

denotes the marginal product of labor evaluated at L=L           For subsequent use

 it is convenient to define the function X as the expected value of X condi-

 tional on the available information I. Thus, applying this notation to

 equation (A—i) yields:



 (A—i')           YL(L) =    ()

 General equilibrium requires that the level of employment L is also consistent
 with the supply of labor that is supplied by utility maximizing workers at the

 given real wage (W/P) .        To illustrate, let the utility function be



 (A—2)             u(C,L)    ; u/C>O, u/L<O
                                          —42—




where C denotes the level of consumption and L denotes labor, i.e., negative

leisure. Maximization of the utility function subject to the technological

constraint that production, Y ,      is   governed by the production function, Y           F(L)

and that, from the budget constraint in the absence of asset accumulation, the

valuof production and consumption must coincide, yields the desired supply

of labor. In general equilibrium, with L = L           ,   the   equilibrium level of utility

is denoted by U(L)

        In practice, due to a precontracted nominal wage, the realized real wage

may differ from its full equilibrium level, Since by assumption employment is

demand determined, it follows that the actual level of employemnt, L             ,   when the

real wage differs from (WI?), differs from L and, associated with this level of

employment and production, the level of utility is U(L),

        The welfare cost of suboptimal employment is [U(L) —             U(L)]   where \
measures the marginal utility of income. Using Harberger's formulation for the

analysis of consumer surplus (see Harberger (1971), eq. 15') we expand the utility

function in Taylor's series around the general equilibrium and omit third—order

terms to obtain Harberger's expression for the approximation of the welfare loss:

where AC. denotes the change in the rate of consumption of good i ,

denotes the equilibrium price of good i , and where A?. measures the discrepancy

of the actual price from the full equilibrium price. In applying (A—3) to the

utility function assumed here, it is useful to decompose the expression into

terms involving goods and those involving labor (or leisure). In our case, with
                                                    —43—


a single (composite) commodity which is used as the numeraire, an application

of Harberger's formula yields —C as the welfare change associated with the

change in the consumption of that good. The same procedure is also applied to

labor, which is the second argument In the utility function, u(C,L) , and

whose equilibrium price is (W/P) .                   For that component we obtain

(W/P) L + L(W/P)5 L , where the change in the real wage is measured along
the supply of labor that reflects the utility function. Combining the expres-

sions Measuring the welfare cost of changes in consumption and labor yields (A—4)

a, the welfare loss:



(A—4)                             —   C+      (W/P) iL + (W/P)5L


where LiL =   L   —   L   .       In    computing the value of the expression in (A—4) we

simplify the specification of the intertemporal budget constraint by specifying

a temporal budget constraint according to which C =                    Y   and, therefore, the

value of C can be obtained by calculating Y .                         Expanding the production
function in Taylor's series around the general equilibrium up to second order

terms yield



(A-5)                         =        L   + YLL(L)


Since the expansion is around the equilibrium, we substitute in (A—5) the equili—

brium real wage for                    ,   and then substitute the resulting expression for

xC(Y) into (A—4):

       11n general, the values of expenditure and income need not be equal to
each other as long as there is equality between their discounted present values.
With undistorted capital markets, however, the two formulations are equivalent
as is known from the literature on the Ricardian Equivalence.

where (A—8) corresponds to equation (30) in the text.     Our loss function is

defined as the expected value of the welfare loss from suboptimal employment

during period t resulting from the existence of contracts that were agreed upon
on the basis of information available at period t—l .     Thus, ignoring the
             c21 + 1    and treating the equilibrium wage bill, () L, as
constant T
constant (i.e., ignoring third order terms of Taylor expansion) we obtain

the loss function H:



(A—9)              H = E[{—(w—p)
                                   +_E(ii)}2IIi}


which corresponds to equation (31) in the text.

          Prior to concluding this Appendixwe can now use the loss function in

order to justify our earlier assumption concerning the initial nominal wage,

W0 .     Using the definition of the variance, the loss function (A—9) can be
written as



(A—9')             H = Var
                           [—(w—p) +E(1.1)II_i]+E[{=(wp) +E(.1)}JI_i12


Our assumption that the initial contractual nominal wage is set at the level

that would have prevailed in equilibrium in the absence of shocks, is necessary

in order to ensure that the second term on the right hand side of (A—9')

vanishes; for any other choice of W       this second term would be positive and
