Copyright and the Profitability of Authorship: Evidence from Payments to Writers in the Romantic
Period

                                               ABSTRACT

Proponents of stronger copyright terms have argued that stronger copyright terms encourage creativity
by increasing the profitability of authorship. Empirical evidence, however, is scarce, because data
on the profitability of authorship is typically not available to the public. Moreover at current copyright
lengths of 70 years after the author’s death, further extensions may not have any effects on the profitability
of authorship. To investigate effects of copyright at lower pre-existing levels of protection, this chapter
introduces a new data set of publishers’ payments to authors of British fiction between 1800 and 1830.
These data indicate that payments to authors nearly doubled following an increase in the length of
copyright in 1814. These findings suggest that – starting from low pre-existing levels of protection –
policies that strengthen copyright terms may, in fact, increase the profitability of authorship.

To encourage creativity, copyright creates intellectual property rights for “original works

of authorship” in literature and music, computer software, web content, and many other

important sectors of the digital economy.1 Extensions in the length of copyright have

emerged as a key policy lever by which national governments attempt to strengthen

property rights in ideas. For example, the U.S. Copyright Act of 1998 and the U.K.

Copyright Act of 2011 extended the length of copyright protection for music from “life of

author” plus 50 years to “life of author” plus 70 years. Proponents of longer copyright

argue that such shifts encourage creativity by increasing expected profits from writing

(Liebowitz and Margolis 2005). Scott Turow, President of the American Authors’ Guild

warned that regimes that weaken copyright, such as digital piracy may cause the “slow

death of the American author” (Turow 2013). Empirical analyses of file sharing,

however, reveal no significant effects on the quantity or quality of recorded music

(Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf 2009; Waldfogel 2013), which suggests that the

importance of copyright protection may be overstated.

        Systematic evidence on the effects of stronger copyrights on the profitability of

authors, however, is scarce because data on payments to authors is typically not available

to the public.2 Evidence from a sample of 93 payments between 1746 and 1800 to

authors of the Scottish Enlightenment indicates that payments to authors increased

independently of the establishment of temporary monopoly rights for authors in 1774

(Sher 2010, p. 258). Case studies of European composers Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901)

 For example, a recent study of the movie industry notes, “One of the reasons that IP contracts have not
attracted much academic attention is the lack of adequate data” (Harris, Ravid, and Basuroy 2013, p.2).


                                                                                                           1
and Robert Schumann (1810-1856), however, indicate that composers of operas and

songs benefited financially from the introduction of copyright protection for music.

Scherer (2008, p.11) argues that, after copyright was introduced in parts of Northern Italy

in 1837, Verdi “saw the possibilities of copyright and exploited them to the full” to amass

a fortune and reduce his efforts at the “exhausting drudgery” of composing operas.3 The

most systematic evidence comes from DiCola’s (2013) survey of 5,000 U.S. musicians,

including composers, performers, and teachers. In this survey, the average respondent

reported drawing 12 percent of their revenue from copyright-related sources.

         This chapter adds to existing evidence by introducing a new, systematic data set

on payments that publishers made to writers in Romantic Period Britain. These data

include payments for 208 works of fiction to 105 authors by 19 publishers between 1800

and 1829. We have collected these data from digitized excerpts of ledgers of transaction,

correspondence, and other types of archival materials for 19th-century publishing houses

in Britain made available in the online database British Fiction 1800-1829: A Database

of Production, Circulation, and Reception. Longman & Co. of London, one of the

largest publishing houses in Romantic Period England, published 133 of these titles, by

68 authors. Competing publishers include John Murray, Archibald Constable & Co.,

Cadell & Co., William Blackwood, and Oliver & Boyd.

         This data collection is part of a broader research agenda, which examines the role

of copyright as well as contractual agreements between authors and publishers on the

  Scherer (2008, p.11) reports a reduction in Verdi’s count of operas per decade from 14 in the 1840s, to 7
in the 1850s, 2 in the 1860s, and one in each of the succeeding three decades. Verdi, however, produced
more influential operas later in his career, and may have used his wealth to produce a smaller number of
high-quality works. With the exception of Nabucco (1842), Verdi composed his most influential operas
after 1850, 13 years after the introduction of copyright: Rigoletto (1851), La Traviata (1853), Simon
Boccanegra (1857, second version in 1881)), and Aida (1871).

creation of literary works. Once complete, a new quantitative data set for Romantic

Period writers will include information on counts of physical copies, production costs,

price, revenue, and publishers’ advertising efforts. A complementary data set, which we

collect from the correspondence of publishers and authors, will include information on

contract negotiations and other interactions between publishers and authors.

         In this chapter we examine changes in payments to authors after a substantial

increase in the strength of copyrights in 1814, starting from low levels of protection.

Intended to clarify a requirement to deposit copies of all new books with research

libraries, the U.K. Copyright Act of 1814 also increased the length of copyright from 28

years to the remainder of the author’s life, and from 14 to 28 years for dead authors. Li,

MacGarvie, and Moser (2013) exploit the fact that this change created a differential

increase in the length of copyright for dead authors as a result of the Act to identify the

effects of stronger copyright terms on price.4 Difference-in-differences analyses of a new

data set of book prices between 1790 and 1840 reveal a large and robust increase in price

in response to longer copyright terms. Historical evidence suggests that publishers

exploited the extension in copyright to practice inter-temporal price discrimination,

thereby increasing the average price of books.

         Our research for this chapter exploits the fact that extensions in copyright terms

under the 1814 Act allowed authors to sell a longer stream of expected revenues to

publishers to examine whether – starting from low levels of existing protection - stronger

  Existing empirical analyses have found no effects of copyright on price or documented counter-intuitive
correlations (Khan 2005; Heald 2008). For example, price data for the U.S. publisher Ticknor and Fields
indicate that pirated books by European authors sold for a higher price than copyrighted books by U.S.
authors between 1832 and 1858 Khan (2005, p. 252). Similarly, books that were bestsellers in the United
States between 1913 and 1932 sold for roughly the same price in 2006, regardless of their copyright status,
possibly because books that are in print 74 years after the initial date of publication are a heavily selected
sample (Heald 2008).


                                                                                                             3
copyright terms may in fact increase payments to authors. Data on payments to authors

for 208 titles between 1800 and 1829 confirm that payments to authors increased

significantly after 1814. Payments to the author of the median title increased by nearly

101 percent from 83.93 pounds between 1800 and 1814 (l, converted to 1800 real terms)

to 169.10l between 1815 and 1829. On average, payments to authors almost tripled, with

an increase from 163.74l for 66 titles until 1814 to 494.74l for 142 titles after 1814.

Some of this increase was driven by high payments to the successful poet Sir Walter

Scott, whose first novel was published in 1814. Excluding 16 titles by Scott, payments to

the author of the median title increased by 59 percent from 83.8l to 133.38l after 1814,

and payments to the average author nearly doubled from 155.2l for 65 titles until 1814 to

249.56l for 127 titles after 1814.

       Our data also make it possible to distinguish lump sum payments and income

from profit sharing. These data show that the increase in payments was driven primarily

by an increase in lump sum payments to authors. A total of 112 observations are for

lump sum payments, 16 include both types of payments, and 80 include income from

profit sharing only. Lump sum payments for the median title, including 16 titles with

income from profit sharing, more than tripled from 100.51l to 361.73l after 1814. For the

average author, lump sum payments increased from 160.09l to 661.54l. Excluding Scott,

lump sum payments increased from 100.47l to 304.99l for the median, and from 157.71l

to 368.61l for the average author.



I. COPYRIGHT IN ROMANTIC PERIOD BRITAIN




                                                                                           4
        Copyright was first formalized in Britain’s Act for the Encouragement of

Learning of 1710, commonly known as the Statute of Anne. The Statute granted

publishers of new books 14 years of exclusive rights, with an extension to 28 years if the

author was alive at the end of the first 14 years.5 In return for exclusivity, publishers

were required to register all new books with the Stationers’ Company and deposit copies

with the British library and eight university libraries in England and Scotland:

    Enacted that nine Copyes (sic) of each book or books upon the best paper that from
    and after the tenth day of April One thousand seven hundred and ten shall be printed
    and published as aforesaid or Reprinted and published with additions shall by the
    printer and printers thereof be delivered to the Warehouse Keeper of the said
    Company of Stationers for the time being at the hall of the said Company before such
    publication made for the use of the Royal Library the Libraryes (sic) of the
    Universities of Oxford and Cambridge the Librarys (sic) of the four Universities in
    Scotland the Library of Sion College in London and the Library commonly called the
    Library belonging to the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh respectively Which said
    Warehousekeeper (sic) is hereby required within ten days after demand…(Statute of
    Anne, London 1710).

        When the first copyrighted books approached the end of their 28-year term,

booksellers who had purchased copyrights sought injunctions from the Court of Chancery

to stop competing publishers from printing copies of books that came off copyright.

Their argument was that, as a “natural right of the author,” copyright was a perpetual

common law property right (Patterson 1986, p. 153, Feather 1988, p. 79). A decision in

the House of Lords in Donaldson v. Becket in 1774 ended this “Battle of the Booksellers”

(1743-1774, Patterson 1986, p. 153) and established that, unlike other types of property

rights, copyright was limited to a certain number of years, defined by the duration of the

copyright term. During these years, infringement was punishable by substantial fines. In

1801, for example, a printer who had violated copyright lost all infringing copies and

5
 Booksellers had pushed for the act, and “Except in the preamble, authors were not mentioned at all…the
Act was a booksellers’ act,” (Feather 1988, pp. 74-76). For books that had been published before the Act,
booksellers received exclusive rights for 21 years starting in 1710 (§2, Statute of Anne, London 1710).


                                                                                                            5
paid a fine of 3d per sheet, “half to the crown, and half to whoever sued for it” (Seville

1999, p. 239). Printers who imported infringing books were fined £10 (Seville 1999, p.

239), roughly 20 times the average weekly wage of working-class men in the early 1800s

(Bautz 2007, p. 12).6

         In 1798, a decision in Beckford v. Hood (1798, 7 D. & E. 620) called into

question the deposit requirement as it established that books were eligible for

infringement damages even if they had not been registered with the Stationers’ Company.

As a result of this decision, the number of book deposits per year fell by 40 percent

between 1793 and 1803 (Deazley 2007, p. 816).



A. Extensions in the Length of U.K. Copyright in 1814

         On July 29, 1814, to reaffirm the deposit requirement, Britain’s Parliament passed

 A Bill [as recommended on third re-commitment] to Amend the several Acts for the
Encouragement of Learning, by securing the Copies and Copyright, of printed Books, to
the Authors of such Books, or their Assigns

It required that – in order to be protected by copyright – publishers had to deposit copies

with the British Museum and 10 university libraries within 12 months of publication (§2).

It also extended the length of copyright to 28 years or the remaining length of the

author’s life, if the author was alive at the end of the 28-year term. For books within 14

years from the first edition by authors who had died within the first 14 years after first

publication, this change implied an increase in the length of copyright from 14 years

under the Statute of Anne to 28 years.



6
  In continental Europe and the United States, however, U.K. copyrights were not respected. To prevent
the importation of pirated copies into Britain, excise officers were instructed to search luggage for books
that may have been intended for resale (St. Clair 2004, p. 200).


                                                                                                              6
II. DATA

         The main data for the current analysis consist of payments to 105 authors by 19

publishers for 208 works of fiction published in Britain between 1800 and 1829. We

have collected these data from a digital depository of archival records in British Fiction

1800-1829: a Database of Production, Circulation, and Reception.7 These data include

information on publishing for 441 titles, drawn from the records for 19th-century

publishing houses Longman & Co (from the Special Collection of Reading University

Library), William Blackwood, Cadell & Co., Constable & Co., John Murray II, and

Oliver & Boyd (from the National Library of Scotland), as well as author’s

correspondence and historical accounts of Britain’s publishing industry.

         To extract information on payments to authors from these sources, we first

performed an automatic search for keywords for “payment to author,” “paid to author,”

“half profits to author,” “cash,” “interest” “pounds,” guineas,” “copyright,” and other

terms connected with payments to authors. This algorithm identifies payments for 203 of

441 titles; we read these records individually to collect information on types, amounts,

and dates of payments for each of these titles. We also examine the remaining 238 titles

to search for payment and accounting information, which an automatic search may miss.8

         For example, Longman’s entries for Amelia Opie’s Tales of Real Life (1813) read:

    Divide Ledger Entry, Longman & Co.
    10 June 1813. The impression consisted of 2000 copies.

 Out of 320 titles with dated information, records for an additional 69 titles include no information on
payments to authors or other information on revenue and expenses. 33 records for Oliver & Boyd include
detailed data on advertising, which we plan to explore in future work.


                                                                                                           7
     Jan 1815. A further 172 copies had been sold by this date, for a total of 98. 18. 0.
     Jan 1815. Half profits to author, 43. 15. 8; half profits to Longman & Co, 43. 15. 7.
     ...
     [Jan 1816]. The remaining 120 copies had been sold by this date, for a total of 69. 0. 0.
     [Jan 1816]. Half profits to author, 34. 9. 5; half profits to Longman & Co, 34. 9. 4.
     …
     [June] 1820. Half profits to author, 10. 12. 4; half profits to Longman & Co, 10. 12. 3.9


A careful reading of these entries allowed us to identify five additional observations with

payment data. Detailed accounting data are available for 98 additional titles. For 10 of

these 98 titles, accounting data report a loss for the publisher and no payment to authors.

We exclude 6 titles for which payment is to a translator of a volume of a collected work

rather than to the original author.

          We then check the genre for all 208 titles; 207 of 208 titles are novels. The

remaining title is John Banim’s Revelations of the Dead-Alive, a collection of fictional

essays (published in 1824 by Simpkin & Marshall).

          Each of these observations covers a single book, and the large majority are for

first editions (201 of 208). Three of the remaining 7 observations are for first editions of

new volumes. For example, an agreement between the author Charlotte Smith and the

publisher Longman in 1802 covers volumes 4 and 5 of The Letters of a Solitary

Wanderer: Containing Narratives of Various Description (both published in 1802).

          Lags between payments and years of first editions occurred when publishers

reviewed draft copies of a new book, and agreed to purchase the rights to that book. For

example, Longman wrote in a December 3, 1812 letter to Amelia Opie, concerning the

author’s Tales:

     We sent you a parcel by Coach on Tuesday which we hope you have received ere this.
     In the parcel we put a note informing you that we had paid the £4. 10. 0 agreeable to

                                                                                                 8
   your request. // Your title pleases us; & we shall be happy to see the MS as soon as
   you can favor us with a perusal of it (Longman Archives, Longman I, 97, no. 383).

And two days later, on December 5 of the same year, warning the author:

   We have certainly been playing somewhat at cross purposes. Perhaps your first note
   was not quite as clear as it ought to be to the weak capacities of booksellers; & they,
   by conning it frequently over, rendered the subject less clear to their comprehension.
   However now we understand that you have finished one of the series of Tales, & that
   the others are not written; on consideration, we would not advise you to put any part of
   the collection into the hands of the printer till you have written the whole that are to be
   published at one time; as, in this case, you would be harrased [sic] out of your life both
   with writing & correcting the proof sheets (Longman Archives, Longman I, 97, no.
   387).

In addition to the editors’ own reviews, editors also asked other authors to comment on

new manuscripts. For example, Longman writes to Amelia Opie on October 11, 1813 in

reference to Elizabeth Benger’s The Heart and the Fancy (published in 1813 by

Longman):

   …pray accept our best thanks for your remarks on the Heart & the Fancy (Longman
   Archives, Longman I, 98, no. 75.)

The median payment to author is made in the year in which the first edition of a book is

published; 57 payments are made in the year before the first edition, and 5 payments are

made 2 years in advance.

       For most titles, publishers submitted payments to authors for a decade or less; for

some titles, however, payments to authors span up to 35 years for profit-sharing

payments. For example, in June 1836, Longman recorded a payment of 1.23l to Amelia

Opie for The Father and Daughter, which was first published in 1801 (Longman Divide

Ledger 3D, p. 259.) In June 1840, Opie received a payment of 2.41l from Longman for

her novel Temper (published in 1812, Longman Divide Ledger 3D, p. 261).




                                                                                            9
         Among 208 titles, 133 include the publisher Longman; another 18 include both

publishers Blackwood and Cadell & Co., and 3 titles each include Blackwood and Cadell

& Co. alone. Constable is a co-publisher on six of Longman’s titles, including three with

Sir Walter Scott, and Colburn is a co-publisher of one title with Longman.

         Seventy of 105 authors appear only once as an author in the data set. Six authors

publish 5 or more books. Among them, Anna Maria Porter (1780-1832) accounts for 9

novels, including the popular love story The Hungarian Brothers (published 1807 by

Longman, set in the French Revolutionary Wars). Porter collaborated with her sister Jane

Porter on two volumes of stories Coming Out; and The Field of the Forty Footsteps

(published by Longman in 1828) and Tales Round a Winter Hearth (published in 1826 by

Longman).10

         The data include two books that were first published after the death of the authors.

For William Williams’ (d. 1791) Journal of Llewellin Penrose (published in 1815 by

Murray), Murray paid a lump sum of 200l in 1814 to the author’s estate (173.27 in year

1800 pounds), and published Journal in 1815.11 For Joseph Strutt’s (d. 1802) Queenhoo-

Hall, published in 1808, Murray records for a payment of 25.03l to Strutt’s son.12 Strutt

died before the novel’s completion, and the final chapter of the novel was written by

Walter Scott.13




10
   In addition to the two books by the Porter sisters, three remaining titles were co-authored: Coquetry by
Charlotte Champion Pascoe and Jane Louisa Willyams; Body and Soul by George Wilkins and William
Shepherd; and Tales and Legends, by Marion and Margaret Corbett. One additional title may have been
co-author by a male and female author within the same family, The Hebrew: A sketch in the nineteenth
century: with the dream of Saint Kenya (1828, by Charles William Chaklen and/or Miss Chaklen (E, MS
4016, fol. 170).

         To calculate lump sum payments to authors and income from profit sharing, we

tally individual entries from the ledgers of publishers. For example, Longman’s archives

record a lump sum payment to Opie of 400l for the copyright of her Simple Tales on

April 23, 1806: “Payment to author: 400. 0. 0. Longman. Impression Book No. 3, fol.

53).” Revenues from profit-sharing are recorded in publishers ledgers, such as:

      Jan 1814. By this date, 1693 copies had been sold, for a total of 973. 9. 6…
     [June 1834]. By this date, the remaining 8 copies had been sold as follows: 4 sold at 0.
     3. 0 each, for a total of 0. 12. 0; 4 sold at 0. 11. 6 each, for a total of 2. 6. 0. Total sum
     from the sale of these 8 copies: 2. 18. 0 (Longman Divide Ledger 1D, p. 300 and
     Longman Divide Ledger 2D, p. 214)

the total of which adds to nominal income from profit-sharing of 413.27l for Amelia Opie

from the Tales of Real Life. Nearly all profits are shared equally between authors and

publishers; only for William Godwin’s Mandeville (published in 1817 by Longman) does

a title earn its author 25 percent of profits (in addition to a lump sum payment of

453.41l).

         To control for inflation, we convert all amounts into real single unit pounds using

Clark’s (2013) Retail Price Index with 1800 as the base year. One single unit pound (l)

equals 20 shillings (s) or 240 pence (d). To calculate income from profit sharing, we

convert each payment to year 1800 pounds, using the year of the payment as the base unit

for the conversion, and then add the converted amounts to calculate the authors’ total

income from profit sharing for that title. For example, Opie’s nominal income of 413.27l

is equivalent to 374.19 year 1800 pounds.14

  Available at http://measuringworth.com/ukearncpi/ accessed on 04/24/2013. A 1820 contract between
Scott and his publisher Archibald Constable covered four separate titles: Ivanhoe, the Monastery, the
Abbot, and Kenilworth together were paid an amount of 5000 Guineas for copyright as part of Constable’s
plan to issue the four novels as part of an octavo set (Letter from Archibald Constable to Scott, 3 Nov 1821,
Grierson, VII, 13).


                                                                                                          11
         To normalize payments to authors by the size of books, we collect information on

the length of each title, measured by the total number of pages. These data are available

for all 208 titles. The median author earns a total income of 15.17l for 100 pages, with an

average of 40.74l and a standard deviation of 77.86.

         To examine whether the 1814 Act may have created a differential increase in

payments for authors in different age brackets, we collect data on birth and death years of

authors from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and online sources if no

information is available from the latter source. Demographic data are available for 60 of

105 authors (or 152 of 208 titles).15



III. LUMP SUM PAYMENTS TO AUTHORS

         In a lump sum contract, publishers assume all risk and pay for the entire costs of

printing and distribution. In return, authors give up any claims on future profits, and

transfer copyright to the publisher (St. Clair 2004, p. 161). For example, Longman & Co.

assert their property rights in Jane Porter’s historical novel The Scottish Chiefs (published

in 1810) in a letter to Mr. Barclay on August 12, 1824.

     The Copyright of the Scottish Chiefs is our property, we having purchased it of Miss
     Porter, as we have done all her other writings: and we consider it of so much value,
     that we should not be disposed to deligate [sic] the right of printing an edition to any
     one. We should however have no objection to sell you an edition of 1000 or 2000
     copies (Longman Archives, Longman I, 101, no. 459B.)




15
   The share of authors for which demographic data are available is roughly equal across time periods and
across different types of payments. Demographic data are available for 27 authors of 47 titles until 1814,
including 20 authors of 29 titles with lump-sum payments only, 9 authors of 16 titles with profit-sharing
only, and 2 authors of 2 titles with both types of payments. Demographic data are available for 45 authors
of 105 titles after 1814, including 29 authors of 60 titles with lump-sum payments only, 18 authors of 35
titles with profit-sharing only, and 7 authors of 10 titles with both types of payments.


                                                                                                        12
Representatives of Longman continue to assert their rights 21 years in another letter on

the 9th of March 1831 (Longman Archives, Longman I, 102, no. 165A).16

         Across all years, authors of 112 titles receive lump-sum payments only, 80

receive only income from profit-sharing agreements (without a lump sum payment) and

16 receive both types of payments.17 The share of titles with profit-sharing agreements

remains roughly constant over time. Until 1814, authors of 43 in 66 titles received a

lump-sum payment; after 1814, authors of 85 in 142 total titles received a lump-sum

payment.18

         The author of the median title (James Fenimore Cooper, The Red Rover,

published in 1827 by Colburn) received a lump sum payment of 214.45l.19 The average

lump sum payment across 128 titles with lump sum payments is 493.08l, with a standard

deviation of 848.14l.20 By comparison, a working class male earned a nominal 23.58l in

1800 and 32.26l in 1829 (35.16 in year 1800 pounds).21 The smallest lump-sum payment

is 3.44l, for Mrs. Costello’s The Soldier's Orphan (published in 1809 by Longman);22 the




16
   By comparison, copyright for less than one third of 144 titles by Scottish Enlightenment authors between
1746 and 1800 remained registered in the name of the author (Sher 2006, p. 243). Registered titles may,
however be more valuable titles; only 40 percent of 360 titles in Sher (2006) were registered.
17
   Four in 16 titles with both types of payments are by Barbara Hofland: Body and Soul (1822), Integrity
(1823), Decision, A Tale (1824), and Self-Denial(1827). The other 12 titles are: Jane Porter ‘s Thaddeus of
Warsaw (1803), Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility (1811), Miss H. Laurence’s London in the Olden Time
(1825), Miss M. G. T. Crumpe’s Isabel St Albe (1823), Orton Smith’s Sketches of Character (1808), Robert
Mudie’s Glenfergus (1820), Scott’s Rob Roy (1818), William Godwin ‘s The Seventeenth Century in
England (1817), William Henry Pyne’s Wine and Walnuts (1823), and Scott’s Waverley (1814).
18
   The share of titles with lump sum payments only also remains roughly constant, with 39 of 66 titles until
1814 and 73 of 142 titles with lump-sum payments after 1814.

   Bautz (2007, p. 12) reports that the typical wage of a working man was between 9 and very exceptionally
40 shillings. If a typical wage was 10s, and workers were able to work 50 weeks per year (which will
probably lead us to overestimate total wage), a typical annual wage may have been 500s or 25l.

largest lump sum payment is 5928.08l for Walter Scott’s The Pirate (published in 1822 in

Edinburgh by Constable & Co. and in London by Hurst, Robinson & Co.).23

        Data on lump sum payments reveal a substantial increase in payments for the

median author after 1814. Among 43 titles with lump sum payments between 1800 and

1814, the median payment was 100.51l (Robert Charles Dallas, The Morlands, published

in 1805 by Longman). Among 85 titles with lump sum payments between 1815 and 1829,

publishers paid a lump sum of 361.73l to the author of the median book, (Anna Maria

Porter, The Fast of St. Magdalen, published in 1808 by Longman), more than three times

the median payment between 1800 and 1814. Normalized by page counts, payments to

the median author increased from 10.50l per 100 pages until 1814 to 33.46l per 100 pages

afterwards (with an average of 15.44l per 100 pages and a standard deviation of 15.97

until 1814 and an average of 71.29l per 100 pages and a standard deviation of 101.50

after 1814).24

        The data also indicate that the increase in lump sum payments was heavily

skewed towards a small number of authors (Figure 1). On average publishers paid

authors 160.09l in fixed payments until 1814 (with a standard deviation of 213.55, Table

1) and 661.54l after 1814 (with a much larger standard deviation of 989.59). Sir Walter

Scott received the largest lump sum payments after 1814, with an average of 2,443.53l,

6.63 times compared with lump sum payments for 368.61l for other authors.

24
  Among 39 titles with lump sum payments only between 1800 and 1814, the median payment was 100.5l
(Robert Dallas, The Morlands, published in 1805 by Longman). Among 73 titles with lump sum payments
only between 1815 and 1829, publishers paid a lump sum of 396.01l to the author of the median book,
(Amelia Opie, Tales of the Heart, published by Longman in 1820) nearly four times larger than the median
payment between 1800 and 1814. Normalized by page counts, payments to the median author increased
from 11.19l per 100 pages until 1814 to 37.44l per 100 pages afterwards.


                                                                                                     14
       This differential change is consistent with survey data for U.S. musicians in 2011

(DiCola’s 2013) survey of U.S. musicians, which suggests that more successful

musicians draw a larger share of their revenues from copyright-related sources. For

example, composers in the top income bracket reported drawing 68 percent of their

revenue from copyright-related sources, compared with 12 percent for all musicians

(including music teachers as well as performers).

       Even excluding Scott, lump sum payment to authors increase by more than 100

percent from an average of 157.71l for 42 titles until 1814 to 368.61l for 73 titles

afterwards and from a median of 100.48l to 305l. Until 1814, the highest lump-sum

payments are 1,270.41l (Frances D’Arblay, The Wanderer, published in 1814 by

Longman) and 579.56l (Sydney Owenson, Woman: or, Ida of Athens, published in 1808

by Longman). After 1814, the highest lump-sum payments are 1,716.61l (Washington

Irving, Tales of a Traveller, published in 1824 by Murray) and 1,501.15l (Sydney

Owenson, The O’Briens and the O’Flahertys, published in 1827 by Colburn).

       There is a clear shift in the distribution of lump sum payments to authors after

1814 when we exclude Scott (Figure 2). Overall, we see a movement towards higher

lump sum pay, with an increase in the standard deviation from 213.55 to 355.62 and a

reduction in the share of small payments. Until 1814, 50.0 percent of the sample earned

100l or less; after 1814, 20.5 percent earned 100l or less.



Differential Changes in Payments to Younger Authors after 1814

       Considering the life expectancy of Romantic Period writers, the 1814 Copyright

Act implied a larger increase in copyright for younger compared with older authors. The




                                                                                          15
author of the average title in our data set was 43.1 years old at the time of publication,

and the author of the median title was 43 years old. The Act extended the length of

copyright from 28 years to “life of author” for living authors, but even based on

optimistic calculations, a 42-year old writer could only expect to live another 29 years in

1814.25 Younger authors, however, could expect to live additional years, and therefore

benefitted more from the extension to “life of author.” At the opposite extreme, authors

above 65 years benefitted more from the extension for books by dead authors from 14 to

28 years, which allowed them to sell a longer revenue stream to publishers. Only 4 titles

in the data, however, are by authors above 65, so we cannot credibly estimate a

differential effect for older authors.

         Consistent with a differential increase in the length of copyright, payments to

authors below the age of 30 increased by a factor of 4 after 1814, from an average of

85.08l for 5 titles until 1814 to 426.99l for 5 titles after 1814 (Table 2). These titles

include only lump sum payments. Payments to the median author under 30 (Francis

Lathom, Very Strange, but Very True!, published in 1803 by Longman) - increased by a

factor of 4.5 from 67.86l until 1814 to 304.99l after 1814.26

         By comparison, lump sum payments to authors 30 years of age or above increased

by roughly a factor of 3.42 from an average of 216.78l for 27 titles before 1815 to an

average of 741.86l on average for 66 titles after 1814. Payments to the author of the

median title increased from 100.5l (Robert Charles Dallas, The Morlands, published in

   Based on calculations of life tables in Li, MacGarvie and Moser (2013), which estimate years of
remaining life conditional on living conditions in five-year intervals and on the authors’ survival to a five-
year age bracket. Forty-two is also the age of the average author at the year of the first edition in a data set
of 1,072 book titles with information on price and other characteristics in Li, MacGarvie, and Moser (2013)
26
   The median lump payment after 1814 is 304.99l (Mary Shelley Wollstonecraft, The Last Man, published
in 1826 by Colburn).


                                                                                                             16
1805 by Longman) and 110.6l (Charlotte Smith, The Letters of a Solitary Wanderer,

published in 1800 by Longman) to 426.99l (John Wilson, The Foresters, published in

1825 by Blackwood) and 396.01l (Amelia Opie, Tales of the Heart, published in 1820 by

Longman).

         The increase in payments to older authors was in large measure driven by lump

sum payments to Scott, who was 43 years old in 1814, and published 15 novels after

1814. Excluding Scott, lump-sum payments to the average authors above 29 years of age

increased by 69 percent from 215.12l for 26 titles until 1814 to 363.70l for 54 titles after

1814. Payments to the median author excluding Scott increased from 105.5l (again

between Dallas’s Morlands and Smith’s The Letters of a Solitary Wanderer) until 1814 to

336.68l (Catherine Cuthbertson, The Hut and the Castle, published in 1823 by Constable

& Co.).



IV. INCOME FROM PROFIT SHARING

         For 80 of 208 observations on payments to authors, authors only receive income

from profit sharing, without lump sum payment; all of these authors receive 50 percent of

profits.27 For example, Longman’s ledgers list a series of payments for Opie’s Tales of

Real Life:

     Jan 1814. Half profits to author, 272. 8. 9; half profits to Longman & Co, 272. 8. 9…
     June 1834. Half profits to author, 1. 9. 0; half profits to Longman & Co, 1. 9. 0.

To calculate income that is purely from profit sharing, we convert each of these to year

1800 pound units and sum all payments in year 1800 pounds. For Opie’s Tales, this adds



27
  St. Clair (2004, p. 164) explains that profit-sharing arrangements allowed authors and publishers to share
profits “either by half or in some other proportion, after all the costs of publishing had been met…”


                                                                                                         17
to 374.19l.28 Across all 80 titles with positive income from profit sharing, the median

title earned 47.65l (Margaret Roberts’ Duty published in 1814 by Longman);29 the

average title earned 164.49l, with a standard deviation of 425.29.30

         Income for the average title increased by 37 percent from 139.91l (for 23 titles,

with a standard deviation of 192.15) until 1814, to 174.41l (for 57 titles with a standard

deviation of 490.21). Per page, however, income from profit-sharing payments declined

by 13.5 percent from an average of 19.45l per 100 pages (with a standard deviation of

26.72) to 16.79l per 100 pages (with a standard deviation of 40.64). Payments to the

median title also declined from 53.49l (Catherine Hutton, The Miser Married, published

in 1813 by Longman)31 to 46.49l (Barbara Hofland, Patience, published in 1824 by

Longman).

         A potential explanation for the lower increase in payments for titles with profit

sharing is that they had more uncertain revenue streams, and therefore benefitted less

from the extension. For example, Longman’s Owen Rees writes to Anna Bray on

September 26, 1827:

     “We very much regret that the sale of [your previous work] De Foix has not been such
     as to warrant our purchasing the copyright of your new work [White Hood]; but we
     would with pleasure undertake it on the plan of dividing the profits.”32

Then, payments from profit sharing may have failed to increase after 1814, because

expected benefits from additional years of exclusivity were small.

V. TOTAL INCOME, PAYMENTS TO SIR WALTER SCOTT, AND TITLES WITHOUT INCOME

        To calculate total income, we add lump sum payments and income from profit

sharing for all authors. The median total income – including lump sum payments and

profit sharing is 131.28l (Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility, published in 1811 by

Egerton).33 The largest total income is 5,928.08l (Walter Scott, The Pirate, published in

1822 by Constable & Co.) and the smallest total income is 2.17l (Elizabeth Benger, The

Heart and the Fancy, published in 1813 by Longman). The observed increase in profit

sharing payments is heavily skewed towards a small number of titles (Figure 4).

Excluding Scott, however, the distribution is substantially less skewed (Figure 5).



Sir Walter Scott

        Four titles earned Scott more than 4,000l each in total income (including lump

sum payments and profit-sharing): Rob Roy (1818, 4,417.028l in total payments), The

Pirate (1822, 5,928.08l), Chronicles of the Canongate, volume II (1828, 4,503.44l) and

Anne of Geierstein (1829, 4,455.31l). Total payments for Scott’s other titles are nearly 7

times compared with the average 127 titles by other authors after 1814: The Monastery

(1820, 1,385.81l), Ivanhoe (1820, 1,385.81l), The Abbott (1820, 1385.81l), Kenilworth

(1821, 1,385.81l), Peveril of the Peak (1822, 1,472.97l), The Fortunes of Nigel (1822,

1,472.97l), Quentin Durward (1823, 1,472.97l), and Chronicles of the Canongate volume

I (1827, 2931.66l).34

  In 1821, Scott sold the copyrights of four novels – Ivanhoe, The Abbot, Kenilworth, and The Monastery –
to Constable for 5,000 guineas, equivalent to 5543.22 year 1800 pounds. Constable also purchased the
remaining copyrights of The Pirate, The Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the Peaks, and Quentin Durward, for
5,000 guineas in 1821 (Lockhart 1838, p. 168).


                                                                                                      19
         A celebrated author of poems, such as The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and

The Lady of the Lake (1810), Sir Walter Scott’s first novel was published in 1814, with

the anonymous publication of Waverley. After 1814, the British Fiction data include 15

novels by Scott, for which he earned an average of 2,570.60l.

         Constable had initially offered Scott a lump sum payment of 700l for the

copyright for Waverley, but Scott declined Constable’s offer, allegedly arguing that

Constable’s proposed payment was “too much” (Lockhart 1838, p. 255). Instead, Scott

and Constable agreed to a profit-sharing agreement for the first edition of Waverley,

earning the author 455.72l in profit sharing for the 7th edition alone.35 After the Waverley

novels proved successful, Scott received large lump-sum advances with additional

income from profit sharing:

     “For most of the novels after Waverley the method adopted was somewhat different.
     Scott sold to Constable and Co. the right to print two thirds of the first impression of
     10,000 (in some cases 12,000) books for a fixed sum. Until 1822 or thereabouts the
     price of the two thirds was £3,000, but it seems to have been thereafter reduced to
     £2,500. The remaining one third was reserved for James Ballantyne, but in regard to
     one half of this third James acted as Trustee for Sir Walter” (Grierson 1938, p. 146).

         Scott’s experience, however, was unusual. For one, Scott was able to use an

inheritance in 1805 (Grierson 1938, p. 33) to purchase a third share of Ballantyne &

Company, a publishing house that was owned by Scott’s childhood friend James

Ballantyne and James’ brother John Ballantyne (Ballantyne & Company 1838, p. 17).

Following this purchase, many of Scott’s works were co-published by Constable and

Ballantyne, leaving Ballantyne in control of the production (Kelley 2010, p. 13).

  The 455.72l for the 7th edition is the only payment for Waverley in the British Fiction data. St. Clair
(2004, p. 245) reports “When a ship bringing the first copies of the latest Waverley novel from Edinburgh
docked in London, the books would be distributed by noon the next day, even breaking the rules against
working on the Sabbath.”


                                                                                                        20
         Scott’s novels were also extremely long-lived, and frequently earned Scott

substantial amounts of additional payments for later editions. For example, Guy

Mannering (published in 1815 by Longman and Constable, printed by Ballantyne) was

published in 11 editions (Garside 1999, p. 391). The British Fiction data include

payments in half-profits between March 1815 and November 1817 for the first through

fourth edition; Scott received 1,278.08l for these editions.36 For Rob Roy, Longman paid

Scott of 2,280.00l for the first edition in 1817, and 848.00l for the second edition in 1818.

For Tales of my Landlord, co-published by Murray and Blackwood in 1816, Scott

received 2,805.60l in profit sharing.37



Novels without Payments to Authors

         Ten titles by Longman & Co. record a loss and no payments to the author. For

example, Longman report capital outlays, sales, and other expenses for Mary Anne Neri’s

gothic romance The Hour of Trial: A Tale (published in 1808 by Longman) without any

references to payments to the author:

     [June 1808]. The impression consisted of 750 copies.
     21 June- Dec 1808. Total outlay (paper, printing and misc. expenses): 155. 0. 0
     June 1808. To advertising: 17. 5. 0.
     …
      [Feb-July 1811]. To further advertising: 1. 2. 0.
     [Feb-July 1811]. To boarding 39 copies: 1. 19. 0.
     [n.d.]. Loss on the production of this novel: 0. 6. 1.38




36
   A sixth edition appeared in 1820, published by Constable alone (Garside 1999, p. 391). There are no
records of a 6th edition but the 5th edition was published in two parts (Garside 1999, p. 400)
37
   Murray Archives, Ledger B, pp. 37–38 and Copy Ledger 1809–47 (part publishing), pp. 167–68.
38
   Longman Divide Ledger 1D, p. 95, June 1808. Data on expenses are most detailed for Longman. There
are two titles by other publishers with losses to publishers and positive payments to authors: My
Grandfather's Farm, by Gabriel Alexander (paid 21.22l), published 1829 by Oliver and Boyd, and St.
Aubin, by Janet Stewart (paid 8.72l), published 1821 by Oliver and Boyd.


                                                                                                    21
       Anecdotal evidence suggests that authors of books without payments were less

popular and unfavorably reviewed. For example, The AntiJacobin Review and Magazine

(1808, p. 192) describes Neri’s Hour of Trial as

   “…rather calculated to deaden the energies, and excite desponding thoughts in the
   minds of youth, than to offer them the amusement for which they turn the pages of a
   Novel…”

Four years earlier, The Monthly Review of November 1804 (p. 315) had described Neri’s

Eve of San Pietro (published in 1804 by Cadell & Co.) as a “a work of imitation...in

many respects inferior to the original.” (The Monthly Review, November 1804, p. 315).

       Six of 10 titles with negative profits and no payment to author were first

published between 1800 and 1814, 4 were published after 1814. The average loss was

20.72l, with a standard deviation of 13.44, a maximum loss of 41.25l (Edward Trevor

Anwyl, Tales of Welsh Society and Scenery, published in 1827 by Longman) and a

minimum loss of 3.39l. The median loss is 19.98l.



VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

       This paper presents a new historical data set on revenues to publishers and

payments to authors, which we have collected from archival sources, including ledgers of

transactions, as well as letters between publishers and authors. These data indicate that

payments to authors increased after a change in copyright policy, which increased the

length of copyright protection. The data also show that younger authors, who benefited

more from the extension in copyright from 28 years to “life of author,” experienced a

larger increase in payments compared with older authors.




                                                                                            22
       Although our findings are primarily descriptive and cannot establish a causal

effect of copyright, they are consistent with the view that in principle shifts towards

stronger copyright laws can help to strengthen the economic incentives for creativity. It

is important to keep in mind that the 1814 Act increased the length of copyright starting

from a low base of pre-existing rights at 14 and 28 years. By comparison, modern

changes increase the length of copyright starting from a high base of pre-existing rights,

at 50 years or more beyond the death of authors. At extremely high levels of pre-existing

rights, the incentive effects of an additional year are likely to be small. The costs of

stronger copyrights in terms of limiting diffusion, however, may be substantial.

Diffusion effects may be as critical as incentive effects in determining the welfare

implications of copyright, making them an important topic for future research.

       Among all writers in Britain’s Romantic Period, Sir Walter Scott received the

largest payments. On average Scott earned 10.3 times as much for 15 novels after 1814,

compared with 127 novels by other authors after 1814. Scott’s works, such as Waverley

and Rob Roy were particularly long lived, and the creation of long-lived copyright terms

for these works allowed Scott’s publishers to charge higher prices for an additional

number of years (Li, MacGarvie and Moser 2013). Data on payments to Romantic

Period authors suggests that Scott and other authors were able to extract some of the

additional revenue stream from publishers. Other authors may have been inspired by

Scott’s example to invest in creative work; these authors may have been overly optimistic

in assessing their chance of emulating Scott’s success, but this is a topic for future

research. Additional data are needed to examine whether an increase in the profitability

of writing helped to encourage the creation of additional books and higher quality books.




                                                                                           23
Such analysis will investigate variation in creative output across genres as well as across

quality levels.

        The data also show that publishers used different payment schemes to strengthen

author’s incentives to support the sales of their books, and we observe a substantial

amount of variation in the timing, as well as in the size and in the types of payments

across different types of authors and books. Exploring this variation requires additional

data collection; once the data are complete, we hope to examine how publishers varied

payment schemes to create incentives to create new works.
