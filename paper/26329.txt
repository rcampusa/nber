Cross-Sectional Dispersion of Risk in Trading Time

                                           ABSTRACT

We study the temporal behavior of the cross-sectional distribution of assets' market exposure, or
betas, using a large panel of high-frequency returns. The asymptotic setup has the sampling
frequency of the returns increasing to infinity, while the time span of the data remains fixed, and
the cross-sectional dimension is fixed or increasing. We derive a Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
for the cross-sectional beta dispersion at a point in time, enabling us to test whether this quantity
varies across the trading day. We further derive a functional CLT for the dispersion statistics,
allowing us to test if the beta dispersion, as a function of time-of-day, changes across days. We
extend this further by developing inference techniques for the entire cross-sectional beta
distribution at fixed points in time. We demonstrate, for constituents of the S&P 500 index, that
the beta dispersion is elevated at the market open, gradually declines over the trading day, and is
less than half the original value by the market close. The intraday beta dispersion pattern also
changes over time and evolves differently on macroeconomic announcement days. Importantly,
we find that the intraday variation in market betas is a source of priced risk.

1    Introduction

Measuring assets' exposure to systematic risk, including the sensitivity to the overall market, plays
a central role in the implementation and testing of asset pricing models. Indeed, measurement error
in the estimated betas, i.e., covariances of asset returns with the systematic risk factors, can have
nontrivial consequences for assessing the ability of asset pricing models to explain the cross-section
of asset prices, see, e.g., Shanken (1992), Jaganathan and Wang (1998), Kan and Zhang (1999),
Gospodinov, Kan, and Robotti (2009) and Kleibergen (2009). The standard approach of measuring
betas is based on running linear regressions using daily or lower frequency data. This requires the
use of periods spanning multiple years to control the size of measurement errors in the estimated
betas. However, asset betas change over time, and this can be crucial for applications, i.e., an asset
pricing model may hold only conditionally, see, e.g., Hansen and Richard (1987).
    One way to accommodate time variation in betas is to model them as functions of observables
such as firm characteristics, macro variables and systematic risk factors, see, e.g., Shanken (1990),
Jagannathan and Wang (1996), Ferson and Harvey (1999), Connor, Hagmann, and Linton (2012),
Gagliardini, Ossola, and Scaillet (2016), among others. An alternative (nonparametric) approach,
following Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a), is to make use of high-frequency returns. In-
traday data hold the promise of attaining the identical precision in beta estimation as from low
frequency data, but over significantly shorter time windows. The increased liquidity in financial
markets renders such an approach practically feasible; indeed, Bollerslev, Li, and Todorov (2016)
demonstrate the advantage of using high-frequency betas for cross-sectional asset pricing.
    Prior studies using intraday data to estimate beta typically ignore any potential intraday vari-
ation in betas by averaging across the trading day. They either compute beta as a ratio of the
daily integrated covariance of the asset with the systematic factor divided by the daily integrated
variance of the systematic factor (as in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a)), or they aggregate
betas estimated over local blocks (as in Mykland and Zhang (2009) and Li, Todorov, and Tauchen
(2017)) across the day. In either case, the objective is to enhance the precision of the estimates. The
premise is that intraday variation in beta is nonexistent or that it is immaterial for asset pricing.
Given the extensive evidence of pronounced intraday variation in second-order return moments,
it is natural to ask if this assumption is empirically justified. As an illustration, in Figure 1, we
plot estimates of the market beta for two large stocks (Caterpillar and Johnson & Johnson) using
high-frequency returns from distinct parts of the trading day. The figure suggests that market betas
vary in a highly systematic manner. The betas of both stocks converge strongly towards unity­the
cross-sectional population average of market betas­over the course of the trading day.

Figure 1: Intraday Variation in Market Betas. The betas are computed over local windows
of two hours using 3-minute return data, according to equation (18), and averaged over the full
sample of 2010-2018. The left panel represents Caterpillar and the right is for Johnson & Johnson.

   Is the above evidence of intraday variation in market betas statistically significant? Does it
hold more generally in the cross-section of stocks? The goal of the current paper is to develop
econometric tools for answering such questions, characterizing the pattern of intraday variation in
betas, and studying its role in explaining the cross-sectional variation in asset prices.
   Figure 1 suggests that, if present, the time variation in market beta takes on a particular form.
Specifically, the cross-sectional dispersion of betas may decline monotonically over the trading day.
Formally, we define this quantity (the cross-sectional dispersion of betas) at each point in time as,
                                         N

one day), and N is the number of assets in the cross-section. We construct estimates of Dt,
develop the feasible limit theory needed for formal econometric inference of such objects. Our
measures are constructed from a panel of high-frequency returns on a large cross-section of assets.
The asymptotic setting is one in which the mesh of the observation grid shrinks to zero while the
time span of the data remains fixed. The size of the cross-section may remain fixed or increase
along with the sampling frequency. In the latter case, our inference is for the cross-sectional limit
    N which, in general, is a random quantity.
of Dt,
   We form our measure of the cross-sectional dispersion in market beta from the ratio of a local
quadratic covariation estimate for the asset and market return divided by a local estimate for the
quadratic return variation of the market. If the size of the cross-section grows asymptotically, then

day (as indicated by the values of ) is determined solely by the systematic risk factors in the
asset returns, where we allow for an arbitrary fixed number (unknown to the econometrician)
of latent systematic risk factors beyond the market. In contrast, if the size of the cross-section
remains fixed, then the idiosyncratic risks will also impact the limit distribution of our statistic.
Importantly, however, our feasible inference procedures are valid both for a fixed or increasing N .
Moreover, the inference is conducted in a way that does not require knowledge of the number of
systematic factors in the returns or the corresponding factor loadings.

a function of . Directly deriving the limiting behavior for estimates of Dt,
is, however, difficult because this convergence does not hold uniformly in . Instead, we adopt
an alternative approach, taking advantage of the one-to-one mapping between a function and its

Fourier transform. This is convenient, as the Fourier transform of estimates for Dt,
weighted sums of block estimates for the dispersion over the day, and their limit distribution is
mixed Gaussian. Furthermore, we show that the convergence of these estimated Fourier transforms
is uniform in their argument, thus delivering a functional convergence result enabling inference
       N as a function of .
about Dt,
   We extend the above analysis by developing inference for the full cross-sectional distribution of
betas at a given point in time. Specifically, we derive a functional limit result for an estimate of
the characteristic function of the cross-sectional market beta distribution at fixed points in time.
This limit result can be used to test if there are other changes in the cross-sectional distribution
of betas, not fully captured by the cross-sectional beta dispersion. In addition, through Fourier
inversion, we may exploit this result to recover the density of the cross-sectional beta distribution
at any given point in time nonparametrically.
   We assess the finite sample performance of the new econometric tools through simulations from
a model that mimics key features of the data used in our empirical study. The Monte Carlo analysis
confirms that our limit theory provides a satisfactory basis for finite-sample inference. Our empirical
application is based on the constituents of the S&P 500 index over the sample period, 2010-2018.

Figure 1, we find the highest beta dispersion at the market open, followed by a gradual decay
during the trading day. That is, high/low beta stocks, with betas above/below unity, tend to have
a downward/upward sloping market beta trajectories across the trading day. This intraday pattern
holds throughout the sample, with the decline of the cross-sectional beta dispersion during the
trading hours turning even more pronounced towards the latter part of the sample. Consistent
with an information-based explanation for the observed pattern in betas, we also find that the

Dt,
   Given the stability and strong statistical significance of the intraday variation in market betas,
one may wonder whether it matters for asset pricing. To address this question, we construct a
number of tests based on a simple sorting scheme. At the beginning of each trading day, we
sort the stocks in the cross-section according to their beta at the market open. We then form a
portfolio long the stocks in the bottom one-third and short the stocks in the top one-third of this
beta distribution. We scale the long positions so that the overall beta of the portfolio is zero at
the market open. We hold the portfolio over the full trading day and close the position at the
market close. Because of the systematic intraday variation in the market betas, this portfolio does
not remain market-neutral, but gradually becomes more positively exposed to market risk as the
trading day unfolds. If this intraday beta variation is unpriced, however, this portfolio should not
earn a risk premium. On the contrary, we find strong evidence against this hypothesis, suggesting
that this intraday beta variation is a source of priced risk. We conduct various robustness checks
that further corroborate this conclusion.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first introduce setup and notation in Sec-
tion 2. We then construct our measures of cross-sectional dispersion in market betas in Section 3.
This section also develops the feasible limit theory for our dispersion statistics. We apply these
asymptotic results in Section 4 to construct tests for changes in the beta dispersion both within the
trading day and across trading days. Section 5 extends the theory by developing inference for the
entire cross-sectional beta distribution. We assess the finite-sample properties of the econometric
tools through simulations in Section 6. Section 7 contains our empirical analysis, and Section 8
concludes. Finally, the proofs are provided in Section 9.

asset pricing. In particular, we allow for an arbitrary number of systematic factors, and the factor
loadings may be time-varying. Apart for the market index, the systematic factors are latent and
their number r unknown to the econometrician. Similarly, except for regularity type conditions,
the time-varying factor loadings and the time-varying stochastic volatilities are left unrestricted.
Idiosyncratic (diffusive) risk in asset prices is captured by the independent Brownian motions
     (j )
(Wt )j =1,...,N . Likewise, the dependence structure of the jumps in the cross-section is also uncon-
strained. If asset price jumps have the identical beta with respect to market jumps as the diffusive
            (j )
beta, t , they may be included in the inference. We do not impose this restriction, so we eliminate
returns containing (identified) jumps when constructing our statistics.
     We focus on the evolution of the cross-sectional distribution of market betas over time. Denoting
the continuous part of the (predictable) quadratic variation for two semimartingales X and Y by
X, Y        c   (see, e.g., Section I.4 in Jacod and Shiryaev (2003)), we may define the market betas as,

                                             (j )           d X (j ) , X (0) c
                                                                             t
                                          t         =           (0)      (0) c
                                                                               ,                 t  R+ ,        j = 1, ..., N,                                    (4)
                                                            d X ,X           t

Of course, the analysis that follows can be trivially extended to study the cross-sectional distribution
of factor loadings with respect to other (observable) systematic risk factors.

3      Inference for the Cross-Sectional Dispersion of Market Betas

This section introduces our cross-sectional dispersion measures for market betas and derives an
associated feasible limit theory. The inference is based on discrete observations of {X (j ) }j =0,1,...,N
                        1 2
at equidistant times 0, n , n , ..., T , where T refers to the time span of our data, which is fixed
throughout, the integer n denotes the number of times we sample within a unit interval, n = 1/n
signifies the length of the sampling interval, and the high-frequency increment of X (j ) is given by,

                          (j )                 (j )
            n
            t,i X
                  (j )
                       = X(t-1)+i/n - X(t-1)+(i-1)/n ,             t  N+ ,   i = 1, ..., n, j = 0, 1, ..., N.   (5)

As noted in the introduction, we measure time in units of one day. The notation above, therefore,
implicitly assumes that we sample at high frequency throughout the full day. In practice, of course,
the day consists of an active trading session and an overnight period with no, or only limited,
trading. We may accommodate this feature by splitting the unit interval [t - 1, t] into a trading
part [t - 1, t - 1 + ] and an overnight period [t - 1 + , t], for some   (0, 1]. We may then assume
we utilize high-frequency observations only during the interval [t - 1, t - 1 + ], i.e., that we sample
                  1                  n
at t - 1, t - 1 + n , ..., t - 1 +   n    , for t = 1, ..., T . However, to simplify notation, henceforth,
we set  = 1, so we exclude the overnight periods. It is evident that our results, trivially, may be
extended to allow for  < 1.

3.1     Estimates of the Market Beta Dispersion

We start by forming estimates for the market beta dispersion at any given point in time. In
constructing our statistics, we rely on a standard truncation approach (see, e.g., Mancini (2001,
2009), Jacod and Protter (2012)) to eliminate the jumps in the (partially) observed sample path
of the assets. More specifically, we truncate the increments of X (k) via,

                           (j )
                          t,n     n ,             (0, 1/2),        t  N+ ,   j = 0, 1, ..., N                   (6)

In the Monte Carlo study and the empirical analysis we provide additional detail on the particular
            (j )
choice of t,n . Exploiting the above notation, we define the sets,

                   (j )                 (j )           (j,l)                  (j )                    (l)
             At,i = {|n    (j )
                      t,i X |  t,n },                 At,i = {|n    (j )      n    (l)
                                                               t,i X |  t,n  |t,i X |  t,n },                   (7)

for j, l = 0, 1, ..., N . Our statistics will be computed on these sets.
    To construct an estimate for the cross-sectional dispersion of betas at a given point in time,
 N ,
Dt,    we must account for the fact that both the market beta and the asset volatilities are stochastic
and change over time. As a result, we construct our measures on an interval whose length shrinks

                                                               7
as we sample more frequently. Specifically, we use a local window of kn high-frequency increments,
for a sequence kn satisfying,
                                                  kn          n ,        (0, 1).                                            (8)

The sets of indices for the price increments over which we compute our measures on a given trading
day is then denoted,

              n                                                 n
             I  = { n - kn + 1, ..., n } ,                     I  = { n - kn + 2, ..., n } ,   [0, 1].                      (9)

To compute market betas and their cross-sectional dispersion, we require estimates for the quadratic
(co-)variation. The continuous part of the quadratic variation for an asset is estimated by,

               (j,l)        n
              Vt,      =     n|
                                        (n    (j ) 2
                                         t,i X ) 1{A(j,l) } ,           j, l = 0, 1, ..., N,       t  N+ ,   [0, 1].       (10)
                           |I       n
                                                              t,i
                                  iI

If the objective is to measure the continuous quadratic variation of asset j , it is natural to set l = j
    (j,l)
in Vt, . However, for measuring beta, it makes more sense to compute the quadratic variation and
covariation used in its construction on the identical set of increments. Of course, the jump times of
a semimartingale on a finite interval are of Lebesgue measure zero, and hence whether we set l = j
or l = j makes no difference for the asymptotic analysis that follows.
   We next define a measure for the difference between the asset covariation with the market and
the market variation as follows,

      (j )          1 n
    Ct, (2) =                         (n
                                       t,i-1 X

                                                                 - n
                                                                   t,i-1 X

                                                                                           )

where j = 1, ..., N . Note that we use a coarser frequency in the construction of Ct, (2), as we double
                                                                           (j )                                    (j,l)
the length of the high-frequency increments used in Ct, (2) compared to those for Vt, (the use of
an even coarser grid for the covariance measure is readily accommodated). The reason is twofold.
First, from a theoretical perspective, the coarser frequency avoids a potential "degeneracy." If we
                                                     (j )               (j,l)
were to use the identical frequency for Ct, (2) and Vt, then, in the absence of other systematic risk
factors beyond the market return, the leading term for the error of our estimate of the dispersion
measure will stem from the time variation in betas and stochastic volatilities over the local window.
The behavior of this error is difficult to characterize in our general nonparametric setup. Given
existing empirical evidence for multiple systematic risk factors in asset returns, the degenerate
scenario is not likely to be of practical relevance. Nonetheless, we define our statistics such that
this issue is avoided, with the cost being a slight loss of efficiency in our estimator if the market is

                                                                    8
the sole systematic risk factor. Second, from a practical perspective, the use of a coarser frequency
    (j )
in Ct, (2) helps minimize the impact of potential asynchroneity effects on the statistics due to the
lower liquidity of individual assets relative to the market index.
   Our local measure of cross-sectional market beta dispersion, Dt,   N , is now simply given by,


                                                   2
                                                                    
                                 N        (j )
                     N       1          C t,   (2)
                   Dt,   =           
                                            (0,j )
                                                     1{V (0,j ) > }  ,   [0, 1],                  (12)
                            N            V              t,       n
                                j =1       t,

where
                                                 n      1/ log(n).                                           (13)
                                                                               (0,j )
Because the estimate of the beta dispersion involves division by Vt, , which is not bounded away
from zero in finite samples, we impose a lower bound for the local estimate of market variance.
This bound does not have an asymptotic effect on the statistic or its limit distribution.
   It is easy to show (and it also follows from our convergence results in the next section) that as
n   and N  N , for some N  (0, ], we have the following convergence in probability under
Assumption A, given in the appendix,

                                                N     N       P
                                               Dt, - Dt, - 0.                                                (14)

We note that we allow for the size of the cross-section either to remain fixed or to increase as we
                                             N typically converges, under suitable assumptions,
sample more frequently. In the latter case, Dt,
to a cross-sectional limit, which may still be a random number. Allowing for N to be finite or
infinite is convenient from an empirical point of view, as one need not take a stand on whether the
cross-sectional dimension of the return panel is sufficiently large relative to the sampling frequency
to justify one finite-sample approximation versus another.
   We next introduce a few measures that are used in the construction of a bias-correction term
     N as well as an estimate for its asymptotic variance. Towards this end, we split the set I n
for Dt,                                                                                        
into the following two "even" and "odd" subsets,

      n                     kn - 1         kn - 3                                            n    n    n

                               2              2

The motivation behind these definitions of the two statistics is the following. By subtracting con-
                      (j ) and V
secutive summands in C          (0,j ) , we cancel their (conditional) mean which, although random,
                              t,             t,
                                                                                                                                  (j )
is locally constant (i.e., approximately constant over the short time window over which Ct, (2) and
 (0,j )
Vt,   are computed). After this centering, the consecutive summands are approximately indepen-
dent and possess a symmetric distribution. Therefore, C (j ) and V
                                                                  (0,j ) can be used to measure the
                                                        t,         t,
                     (j )           (0,j )
variability in Ct, (2) and Vt, . This is very convenient for our setup, in which the size of the
cross-section N can increase to infinity asymptotically, as we avoid estimation of the additional
systematic factors driving the asset returns as well as the loadings on them. Similarly, we do not
need to make an assumption or impose a bound on the number of systematic factors driving the
returns, which is typically the case when making inference for factor models.
      This approach of computing the asymptotic variance is reminiscent of the so-called observed
asymptotic variance proposed recently by Mykland and Zhang (2017), although there are a couple of
nontrivial differences. First, in our setting N may be asymptotically increasing, which complicates
matters, because of the (unknown) factor structure in the returns. Second, we use statistics from
"even" and "odd" increments in generating the "observed asymptotic variance," unlike Mykland
and Zhang (2017), who use successive blocks. Our procedure, therefore, generates less of a bias
in situations where the estimand may vary across the local block (which will be the case for our
dispersion measures).
      Finally, in the construction of the bias-correction term as well as the asymptotic variance, we
need a local estimate of the market betas. We use the following,

3.2    Feasible Limit Theory

This section presents our limit results for the market beta dispersion statistic. We start with a

feasible Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for Dt,
        L-s
below, - denotes stable convergence in law, implying, importantly, that the convergence holds
jointly with any F -measurable random variable, see, e.g., Jacod and Shiryaev (2003).

Theorem 1. Suppose Assumptions A and B hold. Let n   and N  N , for N  (0, ], with
   (1/4, 1/2),        (0, 1/2) and          > 2 - 4 . For K an arbitrary finite set of points in [0, 1], and
T a finite set of positive integers in [0, T ], we have,

                                                                       -      {Zt, }tT , K ,                       (22)

where {Zt, }tT , K is a sequence of standard normal random variables defined on an extension of
the original probability space and independent of F .

   The limiting result above holds both when N is fixed and when it increases to infinity asymp-
totically. There is no restriction on the relative growth of the sampling frequency and the size of
                                                                N is determined solely by the
the cross-section in Theorem 1. The asymptotic distribution of Dt,

systematic factors in the asset returns when N  . This is because systematic risk, unlike id-
iosyncratic risk, is not averaged out in a cross-sectional aggregation. On the other hand, when N is
                                                                                    N . Importantly,
fixed, both systematic and idiosyncratic risks determine the limit distribution of Dt,
the econometrician does not need to take a stand on which of the two asymptotic setups (N fixed
or asymptotically increasing) is at work. Similarly, there is no need to estimate or impose a known
upper bound on the number of systematic risk factors in the inference.
    The asymptotic variance estimator, Avar(Dt,  N ), is of order O (1/k ), which implies that the
                                                                    p    n

rate of convergence of Dt, is kn . In addition, the limit distribution of Dt,
                                  N ), in general, will be a random variable. Finally, the dispersion
the probability limit of kn Avar(Dt,
measures computed at distinct points in time are asymptotically F -conditionally independent.
   As with other applications involving truncation-based estimates of volatility functionals, it is
optimal to pick the truncation parameter             near 1/2. When we do this, our restriction for the
block size is very weak, suggesting a feasible CLT result will apply for a wide range of kn . Of
course, the bigger the (asymptotic) block size, the faster the rate of convergence for the dispersion
         N .
measure Dt,
   Theorem 1 enables us to formally compare the cross-sectional market beta dispersion across
different days as well as different times within the trading day. However, if the dispersion changes
                                                        N as a function of its time-of-day argument,
during the day, it is natural to study the behavior of Dt,
                                                                        N .
. For this purpose, we now develop a functional convergence result for Dt,
   Using the one-to-one map between a function (in L2 ) and its Fourier transform, we can charac-
terize the behavior of the dispersion function during the trading day through its Fourier transform.
Therefore, we introduce a family of functions to weight the dispersion measure across the different
times of the trading day and analyze the associated functional convergence of the weighted disper-
sions within a family of weight functions. More specifically, suppose for every u  U , where U is
a compact subset of R, we have a weight function u : [0, 1]  C. We then define our weighted
(complex-valued) total dispersion measures via,

and, in the above, we set u (s) = 0 for s > 1. We further have,

                                                    P                                                 P

Moreover, for T a finite set of positive integers in [0, T ], the above convergence in law holds jointly
for t  T , with Zt (u) and Zs (u) being F -conditionally independent for s, t  T with s = t.

   This convergence result is in the space of continuous functions on a compact interval, equipped
with the uniform topology. Alternatively, we could have stated a functional convergence result for
functions taking values in a weighted L2 space. However, since the functions of interest (mainly,
 N as functions of ) are defined on the bounded interval [0, 1], it is enough to look at their Fourier
Dt,
transforms only on a compact interval including zero for their analysis.

    We further note that the convergence rate of T Dt (u) is faster than that of Dt,
                                                N
versus kn . This is because, in the case of T Dt (u), the errors in measuring dispersion on the
entire unit interval are averaged out, which enhances the convergence rate. As a consequence, the
requirement on the local window kn , i.e., the restriction on , is now much stricter relative to the
one needed for Theorem 1. Nevertheless,               can still take values in a range without impacting the
CLT result in Theorem 2, which is a desirable feature for practical applications.


4     Tests for Cross-Sectional Dispersion in Market Betas

We now exploit the limit results in the previous section to design tests for hypotheses regarding
                                                  N exists, as the size of the cross-section N
the beta dispersion. We assume that the limit of Dt,
converges to N , for N either a finite number or infinity. We denote this limit by,

                                           N
                               Dt, = plim Dt, ,             t  N+ ,      [0, 1],                       (32)
                                            N N

and further define,
                                                1
                          T Dt (u) =                u () Dt, d,    t  N+ ,   u  U.                     (33)
                                            0
    We will apply our theorems by averaging the dispersion measures across trading days. Towards
this end, we introduce the notation,

                       N             N           N              N
                      DT , =        Dt, ,       DT , =         Dt, ,    DT , =          Dt, ,          (34)
                               tT                         tT                       tT

                                                                              N   N (u), and T D (u).
for T being a finite set of integers in [0, T ]. We define similarly T DT (u), T DT             T


4.1   Tests for Intraday Variation in Dispersion

We start by designing tests for determining whether the market beta dispersion varies across the
trading day. Specifically, we introduce the set,

                        T (,  ) =  : DT , = DT ,                , ,   [0, 1],  =  .                    (35)

We then seek to test whether the sample path belongs to T (,  ) or its compliment. For that
purpose, we propose a test statistic with the following critical region,
                                                                         
                         |DTN - B N - DN        +  B N |                 
                             ,      T ,     T ,     T ,
           Cn =                                               > z1-/2 ,                     (0, 1),    (36)
                                        N              N
                           tT Avar(Dt, ) + Avar(Dt, )
                                                                         



                                                         14
where z is the -quantile of the standard normal distribution. Then, from Theorem 1, we have,

                           P(Cn |T (,  ))  ,            P(Cn |T (,  )c )  1,                      (37)

provided          
                   (DN - DT , - DN + D                            
                     T ,          T ,    T , ) 1(T (,  )) = op 1/ kn ,
                                                                                                  (38)
                   (DN - D        N                     c
                     T ,   T , - DT , + DT , ) 1(T (,  ) ) = op (1).

The above condition obviously holds, when N is finite. When N is infinite, the second part of
equation (38) typically follows by invoking a Law of Large Numbers for N  . For the first part
of equation (38) with an asymptotically increasing N , we require the given rate of convergence for
the above-mentioned cross-sectional Law of Large Numbers, and we need N to grow sufficiently
fast relative to kn . Alternatively, this condition automatically holds without restrictions on the
relative size of the two dimensions of the return panel, if the market betas are assumed constant
across trading day (recall these assumptions concern only the null hypothesis).

4.2    Tests for Functional Variation in Dispersion

We now go on to derive a test for variation in Dt, (as a function of ) across different trading
days. Specifically, we are interested in deciding whether the sample path belongs to the following
subset of the sample space,

                   (T1 , T2 ) = {  : DT1 , = DT2 , ,        - a.e. } ,   T1  T2 = ,               (39)

where T1 and T2 are two disjoint sets of integers in [0, T ].
                                                                                            N -D
   As for the previous test, we need a condition for the asymptotic size of the difference Dt,   t,

which, in the current setting, takes the form,
             
                             N               N
                                                                              
                   [0,1] |DT1 , - DT1 , - DT2 , + DT2 , | 1((T1 , T2 )) = op ( n ),
              sup
                                                                                                  (40)
                             N               N                        c
                   [0,1] |DT1 , - DT1 , - DT2 , + DT2 , | 1((T1 , T2 ) ) = op (1).
              sup

Similar comments to the ones following equation (38) apply here as well. In particular, the first of
                                                          N , as a function of , with N  
the above conditions hold, whenever a functional CLT for Dt,
applies, and N is sufficiently large relative to n (depending on the rate of convergence of this cross-
                                                                                          (j )    (j )
sectional CLT). Alternatively, this condition holds without any restriction on N , if t+ = s+ ,
for s, t  T ,   [0, 1] and j = 1, ..., N .
   For constructing the critical region of the test, we exploit the following corollary to Theorem 2.



                                                   15

                                   sup      T DT1 (u) - T DT2 (u)       > 0.                                  (42)

                                                                                                   N          N
    Part (a) of the above corollary characterizes the asymptotic behavior of T DT1 (u) - T DT2 (u)
under the null hypothesis. Part (b) shows that for determining whether DT1 , differs from DT2 ,
(as a function of ), we only need to look at the difference between their Fourier transforms for u
on a compact subset of R containing zero. This result follows from Bierens (1982); see also Bierens
and Ploberger (1997). Given Corollary 1, we propose a test with the following critical region,

                                                 N                N
           Cn =         n - kn + 1 sup T DT1 (u) - T DT2 (u) > z1-/2                    ,      (0, 1),        (43)
                                       uU

where z is the -quantile of a centered Gaussian process on U with covariance and relation func-
tions given by     tT1  T2   t (u, v ) and     tT1  T2        t (u, v ), respectively. We note that z may be
computed easily via simulation. From Corollary 1, it follows, provided condition (40) holds, that,

                           P(Cn |(T1 , T2 ))  ,               P(Cn |(T1 , T2 )c )  1.                         (44)

    Finally, we observe that a number of suitable substitutions within the above test enables us to
test the hypothesis that the market beta dispersion, as a function of the time within the trading
day, has a particular parametric specification. Specifically, we must replace DT2 , by some function
                            1 iu                     N
D on [0, 1], substitute    0 e   D d        for T DT2 (u), and set T2 = , thus obtaining a test for the
hypothesis DT1 , = D for   [0, 1].


5    Inference for the Cross-Sectional Distribution of Market Beta

We finish the theoretical analysis by proposing an estimator for the cross-sectional distribution of
market betas and providing the associated limit theory. Hitherto, we have focused on the cross-
sectional dispersion of market betas. However, as we now show, we can extend this analysis to study
the entire cross-sectional beta distribution. We will do this by estimating the characteristic function

                                                         16
of the cross-sectional beta distribution at a given point in time. The associated convergence result,
presented below, is functional and takes place in the complex-valued Hilbert space L2 (w),

                            L2 (w) =        f :RC                     |f (u)|2 w(u)du <        ,                   (45)
                                                                  R

where w is some positive-valued and continuous weight function with exponential tail decay. The
inner product on L2 (w) is induced from the inner products of its real and imaginary parts, i.e., for
f and g two elements of L2 (w), we set

                                            f, g =            f (z ) g (z ) w(z ) dz.                              (46)
                                                        R

Next, for a random complex function X taking values in L2 (w), we introduce the covariance operator
Kh = E[(X - E(X )) h, X - E(X ) ], and the relation operator Ch = E[(X - E(X )) h, X - E(X ) ],
where h  L2 (w). We recall that a Gaussian law on L2 (w) is uniquely identified by the mean,
covariance and relation operators. We refer to this law as CN (µ, K, C ), for µ being the mean, K
being the covariance, and C being the relation operator.
   Our estimator of the characteristic function of the cross-sectional distribution of market beta
                                     (j )                (0,j )
can be easily constructed from Ct, (2) and Vt,                    in the following manner,

                                              N                       (j )
                                      1                           Ct, (2)
                          Lt, (u)   =                exp iu            (0,j )
                                                                                + iu ,     u  R.                   (47)
                                      N                             Vt,
                                              j =1


The next theorem provides the CLT for Lt, (u).


Theorem 3. Suppose Assumptions A and C hold. Let n   and N  N , for N  (0, ], with
   (1/4, 1/2),        (0, 1/2) and  > 2 - 4 . Then, for t  N+  [0, T ] and   [0, 1], we have,
                                                             
                                            N

                             kn Lt, (u) -      exp iut+  - Zt, ,                            (48)
                                          N
                                                       j =1


where Zt, is F -conditionally CN (0, Kt, , Ct, ), and the operators Kt, and Ct, are given by,

  Kt, h(z ) =        kt, (z, u)h(u)w(u) du,          Ct, h(z ) =             ct, (z, u)h(u)w(u) du,   h  L2 (w),   (49)
                 R                                                       R

with the functions kt, (z, u) and ct, (z, u) given in Assumption C.

   Using feasible version of this result one can make formal inference for the cross-sectional dis-
tribution of market betas at a given point in time (or fixed points in time). In particular, we can
conduct tests for deciding whether the entire cross-sectional beta distribution changes during a


                                                               17
trading day or across trading days. In addition, we can estimate the density of the cross-sectional
                                                
beta distribution at time t - 1 + , denoted by ft, (x), via Fourier inversion:
                                                                                  un
                                                                       1
                                                   ft, (x) =                            e-iux Lt, (u)du,                                      (50)
                                                                      2       -un

for some positive sequence un   as n  .
    Finally, as for the analysis of the dispersion, we can construct cross-sectional moments of tem-
porally aggregated estimates for betas. Specifically, for T a set of integers in [0, T ], we can define,
                              N                                (j )                                                 un

       LT , (u) =                  exp iu                       (0,j )
                                                                                     
                                                                             + iu , fT , (x) =                            e-iux LT , (u)du.   (51)
                        N                       |T |          Vt,                                            2     -un
                            j =1                       tT

A functional CLT result for LT , (u), analogous to the one in Theorem 3, may be obtained here as
well. For brevity, we do not state it explicitly.


6      Simulation Study

We now assess the finite sample properties of the new inference procedures. To this end, we conduct
a Monte Carlo study in which we vary the sampling frequency, window length, and number of assets
in the cross section. The analysis is based on simulation from the following affine jump-diffusion
model for the return on the market and each of the N assets,
                            (0)                    (0)                                                 (1)        (2)
                        dXt        =          Vs dWs   + Zt dNt ,                           Vt = Vt          + Vt ,
                            (i)                         (i)                       (i)     (i)
                        dVt        = i  - V t                 + i           Vt dBt ,            i = 1, 2,                                     (52)
                            (j )         (j )          (0)                        (j )          (j )
                        dXt        = t            Vt dWs   +                 Vt dWs    + t Zt dNt ,                     j = 1, ..., N,

cess with intensity J capturing the arrival of market jumps with size given by (Zs )s1 , where

Given our objectives, we calibrate the specification for the intraday variation of beta carefully. The
market betas obey the following dynamics,
                                       (j )                                (j )

                                                        uniform([0.5, 1.5]),                    j = 1, ..., N,                                (54)

                                                                                  18
and the function  is given by,

                   t,  (x) = x +  t,  (x - 1),                   t  N+ ,           [0, 1],               x  R,                       (55)
                                                                                                                           (i)
for some smooth function of t and ,  t,  : N+ × [0, 1]  R. We use three functions, {  }i=1,2,3 ,
                                                                    (1)                                                               (1)
which depend only on   [0, 1], for  t,  . The first,   , is a constant, chosen so that if  t,  =   ,
            (j )
then E(t - 1)2 equals the average daily estimate for the dispersion of the market betas observed
                                (2)                          (2)                                           (j )
in our data. Next, we set   , so that  t,  =   implies a value for E(t                                            - 1)2 that matches
                                                                                                                                      (3)
the average dispersion of the market betas as a function of time-of-day in our data. Finally,  
                                               (2)                                                                           (j )
is calibrated in an analogous way to   , with the difference being that the implied E(t                                             - 1)2
now matches the average dispersion of the market betas as a function of time-of-day observed in
our data only on days with low volatility. For the latter, we find that the beta dispersion as a
function of the time-of-day appears to differ substantially from that computed on the other days

   We begin by studying the finite-sample properties of the test for equal cross-sectional dispersion
in betas during parts of the trading day, given in Section 4.1. The empirical rejection rates of the
test under the null hypothesis are provided in Table 1, while those under alternative hypotheses
are reported in Table 2. The results in Table 1 point to a satisfactory behavior of the test under
the null hypothesis, with the empirical rejection rates being very close to its nominal size. This
holds true for all the different values of n, |T |, and N that we consider.

   Turning to our ability to detect market beta intraday variation, Table 2 shows that our test has
                                                                                                   (2)
excellent power properties against the given alternative (we consider equation (55) with  t, =  
as our alternative). This holds true even for the scenario in which we average the dispersion
statistic over the smallest of our choices for |T |, 65 trading days. As expected, the power of the
test is somewhat lower when comparing the cross-sectional dispersion not at the market open, but
rather at lunch, versus the market close. This is because the discrepancy in Dt, between the two
points within the trading day now is decidedly smaller, see Figure 2.
   Next, we explore the properties of the functional test for variation in dispersion, developed
in Section 4.2. We implement it with U = 2 and discretize the domain using increments of /3
(i.e., u  {0, /3, 2/3, ..., 2 }). The critical test values are obtained from the procedure outlined in

We notice a slight over-rejection for T = 250 and low values of n. Overall, however, the test has
empirical rejections rates under the null hypothesis close to the corresponding nominal size.

    To examine the power of the test, we set  t, =   for t  T1 and let  t, =   for t  T2 .
Results for this simulation scenario are given in Table 4 and reveal good power of our test. Not
surprisingly, the power improves as the sampling frequency increases. We further note that the
rejection rates appear insensitive to the choice of N (the size of the cross-section).


7    Empirical Study of Intraday Market Beta Dispersion

We now use the developed econometric tools to study empirically the intraday behavior of the
market betas. The analysis is based on high-frequency returns on the constituents of the S&P 500
stock market index over the period 2010-2018. We only retain stocks that belong to the index for
the entire sample period, leaving us with a cross-section of 329 stocks. Our proxy for the market
is the SPY ETF on the S&P 500 index. On each trading day, we sample the asset prices at the
3-minute frequency. This provides us with 120 return observations per day for each asset. We
remove days with partial trading. Overall, the sample contains 2245 full trading days.

7.1   Empirical Evidence
                                                                          1     T    N
First, we compute the average dispersion measure for the entire sample,   T     t=1 Dt, .   The function
is plotted in the left panel of Figure 3. It reveals that the cross-sectional dispersion of the market
                                                                                      1   T    N
betas declines monotonically over the trading day. The reduction is substantial:      T   t=1 Dt,   at the
market close is less than half of its value at the open. This is consistent with the illustrative plot



                                                 22
for the two stocks displayed in Figure 1 of the Introduction. We can now test whether the cross-
sectional dispersion in market betas is invariant across the trading day by applying the procedures
developed in Section 4.1. A natural concern is the potential for a confounding effect from excessive
noise in the beta estimates at the start of trading due to high idiosyncratic volatility at the market
open. The formal test in Section 4.1 accounts for such features, and thus can discriminate between
this type of explanation relative to true changes in the distribution of market betas. Our tests
comparing the dispersion over various parts of the trading day overwhelmingly reject the null
hypothesis, with p-values equalling zero up the fourth digit after the decimal point.
   The evidence from the left panel of Figure 3 suggests that high beta stocks (in excess of unity)
have their market beta decline during the trading day, while the opposite is true for the low beta
stocks. This conjecture is confirmed in the right panel of Figure 3. It plots the cross-sectional
quantiles of the market betas across the trading day. The changes for the two extreme quantiles
(the 10'th and 90'th) are most significant, while the median market beta displays little variation
over the trading day. To explore whether this intraday pattern in market betas is robust, we
repeated the analysis for 2-year subsamples. The message of a declining cross-sectional dispersion
in market betas over the trading day remains intact, with the evidence strengthening in the second
half of the sample. For brevity, we do not report these results here.

left panel displays the cross-sectional dispersion in market betas and the right panel plots the
corresponding quantiles. All quantities are treated as functions of the trading day and computed
by averaging over the entire sample. The selected quantiles are: 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th.

   Using the analysis of Section 5, Figure 4 depicts our estimates of the cross-sectional distribution
of the market betas at the open and close of trading. They are clearly very different, with the former
having a significantly wider support than the latter, even if they both have modes close to unity.

Figure 4: Cross-Sectional Distribution of Market Betas at Open and Close of Trading.
                     
The plot displays fT  , (x) using the first two hours of trading (solid line) and the last two hours
of trading (dashed line), both computed over the entire sample. The tuning parameter un in the
Fourier inversion is set to inf {0 < u : |LT , (u)| < 0.0005}.



   Given the overwhelming evidence for intraday variation in betas, we now explore the evolution
of this pattern over time. Figure 5 plots the time-series for the cross-sectional dispersions of betas
at the market open and close, representing the parts of the active trading day with the highest
and lowest dispersion. To mitigate the impact of estimation error, we report dispersion measures
computed over rolling window of 250 days. The dispersion of the market open betas fluctuates
greatly across time, unlike that of the market close betas. In fact, following a decline towards
the end of 2013, the beta dispersion at market close has been remarkably stable. In contrast, the
dispersion at the market open increases initially till some time in 2012, and then gradually declines,
reaching a low during 2015, when the gap between the dispersion of the market open and close betas
also is the smallest in our sample. Since then, the dispersion in the market open betas increases
sharply, about four-fold, and remains highly elevated for the remainder of our sample.
   Overall, Figure 5 strongly suggests that the intraday pattern of market betas is evolving across
our sample period. We may explore this hypothesis through the formal test procedures developed
in Section 4.2. The results are reported in Table 5. We perform the test annually, i.e., we test
whether the cross-sectional dispersion of betas, as a function of time-of-day, changes across the
calendar years in our sample. The reported results show that, for most calendar year pairings, the
null hypothesis of an equal intraday pattern for the cross-sectional dispersion of market betas is
overwhelmingly rejected. Interestingly, the last three years of our sample, when the cross-sectional
dispersion of market betas at the open of trading has increased significantly, the intraday dispersion
pattern appears more stable, or similar, across adjacent years.

Table 5: Tests for Changes in Cross-Sectional Dispersion of Market Betas over Time.
The table reports p-values for tests of equal dispersion of market betas as functions of time-of-
day. Each entry corresponds to a pairwise test, detailed in Section 4.2, involving the years in the
corresponding rows and columns.


   It is natural to ask whether the time variation in the cross-sectional beta dispersion, as a function
of the time within the trading day, can be explained by observable economic variables. We begin
to explore this issue by investigating the dependence of Dt, (as a function of ) on the level of
market volatility. To the extent that the intraday variation in market betas is associated with the
information flow and the separation of different type of trading (e.g., based on private signals or



                                                            25
hedging motives) across the trading day, the level of market volatility should affect the intraday
evolution of the betas. As a proxy for the market volatility, we use the level of the VIX volatility
index, computed from the CBOE option exchange, at the beginning of the trading day. Using the
time series empirical quantiles of the VIX series at market open over our sample period, we split
the sample into low, medium and high volatility regimes according to the level of VIX falling into
the 5th-to-25th quantile, the 40th-to-60th quantile, and the 75th-to-95th quantile, respectively. We
then compute our beta dispersion measures in each of the three volatility regimes and display the
results in the left panel of Figure 6. Interestingly, the figure reveals no big discrepancies in the
compression of the cross-sectional dispersion of betas in the afternoon across the three volatility
regimes. The main distinction is that the elevation of Dt, is more pronounced in the low volatility
regime than in the other regimes at the beginning of the trading day.

Figure 6: Variation in Cross-Sectional Distribution of Market Betas. The left panel
displays the cross-sectional dispersion in the market betas computed on days of low (solid line),
medium (dot-dashed line), and high volatility (dashed line). The low, medium, and (high) volatility
regimes are defined by the market open VIX falling within its 5th-to-25th, 40th-to-60th, and 75th-
to-95th empirical quantiles. The right panel depicts the dispersion of the market betas computed
on days with (solid line) and without (dashed line) FOMC announcements.

   Using the results of Section 4.2, we now formally test the null hypothesis of no difference in the
beta dispersion function across the volatility regimes. The results are reported in Table 6 and are
in line with the pattern in the left panel of Figure 6. In particular, there is no significant difference
in the intraday behavior of the betas in the high and medium volatility regimes. However, there is
evidence of significant discrepancies in the intraday beta behavior between the low volatility regime
and the other regimes, with our test rejecting the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level. As
Figure 6 indicates, this is primarily due to the behavior of the market betas in the first few hours
after the market open during the low volatility regime.

table reports p-values of the test in Section 4.2 for equal cross-sectional beta dispersion as a function
of time-of-day across volatility regimes. The volatility regimes are defined in Figure 6.



       We finally compare the beta dispersion functions on days with and without pre-scheduled FOMC
announcements. The release of information regarding the FOMC meeting usually occurs at 1pm
Central Time during our sample period. The estimated dispersion functions are displayed in the
right panel of Figure 6. Due to the relatively low number of days with FOMC announcements
in our sample (a total of 69), the estimated beta dispersion function for these days is visibly
noisier. Nevertheless, the difference relative to the beta dispersion function on days without FOMC
announcement is evident. The beta dispersion function is somewhat steeper on days with FOMC
announcement and there is a sharp drop in the beta dispersion right around the announcement
time, and it then remains flat afterwards for the remainder of the trading day. The formal test
for equal dispersion functions on days with and without FOMC announcements is in line with the
above discussion. It rejects the hypothesis with p-value well below conventional significance levels.
At an intuitive level, our results suggest that the stocks become more similar in terms of their
exposure to systematic macro level risk immediately following the FOMC meeting.1
       Overall, our empirical results document significant intraday variation in the market betas across
the trading day, with systematic risk in stocks being more dispersed at the start of trading and
becoming more concentrated towards the market close and following the release of macroeconomic
news of relevance for the entire economy, as exemplified through the FOMC announcements. Fur-
thermore, the market beta dispersion function, viewed as a function of the time within the trading
day, varies substantially across the sample, with a significant part of this variation stemming from
the behavior of the betas at the market open.
   1
    One may conjecture that different types of news with economy-wide implications will have a differential short-
term impact on the cross-sectional dispersion of market betas. Some economic developments may favor specific
economic sectors relative to others, while updates regarding policy changes intended to fuel or dampen the level of
general economic activity may be associated with a more uniform market dependency across all equities. Intuitively,
the FOMC announcements would fall in the latter group, implying a narrowing of the beta distribution. Further
pursuit of such ideas is outside the scope of the present paper.

7.2   Asset Pricing Implications

We now explore the asset pricing implications of our empirical results, indicating systematic in-
traday changes in the cross-sectional distribution of market betas. Many asset pricing models,
including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), stipulate that the return on the market port-
folio is a component of the aggregate pricing kernel. Therefore, if the persistent changes in the
market betas over the trading days matter for asset pricing, we should expect to find a statistically
significant and time-varying return on portfolios that have a positive exposure to the market, sim-
ply due to this intraday variation in betas. We test this hypothesis now. Specifically, each day at
the start of trading, we sort stocks according to their market open beta. This beta is computed at
the beginning of each month and kept constant during the rest of the month, using high-frequency
returns from the first two hours of trading on the preceding 250 trading days. Our portfolio takes
a long position in the bottom 1/3 of stocks sorted on the market open beta and a short position in
the corresponding top 1/3 group of stocks. We adjust the weight on the long position, so that the
market beta on our constructed portfolio is exactly zero at the open of trading, i.e., the portfolio
is market-neutral. We hold the position throughout the trading day and close it at the end of
trading. We then open the position in the corresponding portfolio again the following trading day
and hold it until the close, and repeat this procedure every trading day in our sample. Given the
documented intraday pattern in market betas, i.e., they converge towards unity during the trading
day, our initial market-neutral position at the open will gradually build a positive market exposure
over the course of the trading day, reaching a maximum at the close. Therefore, if the intraday
compression of beta towards its cross-sectional mean is associated with a risk premium, we should
expect the above portfolio to earn excess profits. The findings from this exercise are summarized in
Table 7. They corroborate the risk premium conjecture as, indeed, the portfolio return is positive,
and both economically and statistically significant.
   In the above strategy, we did not hold stocks overnight due to the absence of a time-of-day
estimate for the market betas during the market close-to-open period. However, it is evident that
there is a transition overnight from a low to high beta dispersion. Therefore, it is natural to check
whether this systematic overnight variation in betas is also priced. For that purpose, we now sort
the stocks at the end of each trading day according to the market close beta. The long and short
positions are now switched: the portfolio will be long high market-close beta stocks and short low
market-close beta stocks. The portfolio is held only for the close-to-open period. The portfolio is
constructed to be market-neutral at the end of the trading day, but will have positive overnight
exposure to the market. Hence, if this variation in beta is priced, we also expect this portfolio

Table 7: Expected Returns on Time-of-Day Variation in Market Betas. The table reports
monthly percentage returns on strategies based on market beta sorts at market open or close. The
portfolios consist of stocks in the bottom and top 33% of the cross-sectional beta distribution. The
portfolio positions are adjusted to be market neutral at formation. The portfolio is short/long high
beta stocks and long/short low beta stocks, when sorting on open/close betas, and the portfolio is
rebalanced each trading day. The last three columns correspond to the part of the day over which
the position is held. The betas are computed over windows of length 250 days, using the first and
last two hours of trading. Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis.


to earn a positive premium. In fact, Table 7 confirms this hypothesis. The mean return of the
portfolio is lower than for the one formed over the trading day, but the overnight portfolio has a
much smaller variance, leading to an even higher degree of statistical significance.
   It follows that, if we were to hold the portfolio formed on the basis of sorting at the market
open only during the overnight period, then it should earn a negative risk premium. Likewise,
our portfolio formed from a sort on the market-close betas should lose money, if held exclusively
during the trading day. These predictions are consistent with the evidence reported in Table 7.
Consequently, if either of the two portfolios (sorted on the open- and close-market betas) is held for
the entire day­trading hours plus overnight­its systematic return components will cancel, leaving
an overall small and insignificant return. This testifies to the high-frequency nature of the portfolio
premium, which sets it apart from a corresponding literature exploiting beta anomalies to design
profitable trading strategies. For example, our intraday portfolio, that involves shorting high beta
stocks and taking long positions in low beta stocks, is similar to the "betting against beta" strategy
proposed by Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) to exploit the empirical finding that high beta stocks
earn lower risk premium than implied by the CAPM; see, e.g., Black (1972) and Black, Jensen,
and Scholes (1972). However, Table 7 shows that our intraday "betting-against-beta" portfolio
does not earn a statistically significant return, when held during the entire day (including the
overnight period). Thus, the risk premium, we identify for our intraday and overnight portfolios,
is fundamentally different from the "beta anomaly" exploited in Frazzini and Pedersen (2014). In

                                                    29
fact, the latter is associated mostly with small stocks, see, e.g., Novy-Marx and Velikov (2018),
and those stocks are excluded from our analysis. In contrast, our explanation for the presence of
a risk premium is that, by construction, the portfolio has a positive market exposure within the
trading day, so the compensation is "rational" - stemming from the systematic time-variation of
the intraday market betas.
   To further check the robustness of our result concerning the risk premium associated with the
intraday (and overnight) variation in market betas, we next explore whether it can be rationalized
through exposure to well-known market-neutral risk factors. Indeed, a potential alternative expla-
nation for the evidence in Table 7 is that the excess returns reflects compensation for exposure to
other systematic sources of priced risk. Primary candidates are the size and value factors of Fama
and French (1996), as well as the momentum factor introduced by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)
and Carhart (1997). There is an extensive literature in empirical finance documenting the ability
of these factors to explain the cross-sectional behavior of expected stock returns, in addition to
the market factor. We use daily data on the Fama and French and momentum factors, using a
rolling window of 250 days to compute the loadings of the various portfolios, whose excess returns
are reported in Table 7. Even after controlling for this exposure of our intraday and overnight
long-short portfolios, the excess returns remain nearly unchanged, leaving the statistical signifi-
cance intact. This reflects the fact that our portfolios, capturing the intraday and overnight market
beta variation, have a very weak association with the size, value and momentum risk factors. For
brevity, we do not report these results, but they are available upon request.
   Finally, the evidence in Table 7 regarding the differential behavior of the constructed portfolios
is reminiscent of empirical results reported by Lou, Polk, and Skouras (2019), as they document
opposing excess returns for known trading strategies during the trading day versus overnight.
However, the approach and conclusions are fundamentally different. Lou, Polk, and Skouras (2019)
do not explore high-frequency fluctuations in the risk exposures, and they ascribe their findings
to a reversal of the risk premium across segments of the (calendar) day. In contrast, our evidence
is consistent with a reward for market risk exposure, both intraday and overnight. Hence, while
Lou, Polk, and Skouras (2019) end up explaining the observed patterns through clientele effects, we
"rationalize" the different behavior of the constructed portfolios directly through the documented
intraday variation in market betas.

8     Conclusion

This paper explores the intraday variation in market betas in a general nonparametric setting.
The inference is based on a cross-section of stocks and the market portfolio. The time span of
the return panel is fixed, while the sampling frequency increases to infinity. The size of the cross-
section is either fixed or increases asymptotically. We form estimates of the cross-sectional market
beta dispersion over local time windows. We derive a feasible limit theory for the beta dispersion
measures, both for a fixed number of distinct times during the trading day and in a functional
sense. We further extend the analysis by developing a functional limit theory for estimates of the
characteristic function of the cross-sectional beta distribution at given points in time. Exploiting
these econometric tools, we find strong evidence for systematic variation in the cross-sectional
dispersion in market betas, both during the trading day and across trading days. Market betas
have the highest dispersion at the market open and tend to compress towards unity gradually
during the trading day. We further document that portfolios designed to generate an increasing
net market exposure over the course of the trading day earn substantial risk premiums, consistent
with the intraday pattern in market betas constituting a source of priced risk.

Assumption SA. We have Assumption A with T1 = . Furthermore, the processes ((j ) )j 0 ,
                                                                                                                                 (0)
( (j ) )j 1 , ( (j ) )j 1 , and ( (j ) )j 1 are uniformly bounded on [0, T ], and |t | is bounded from below
by a positive constant on [0, T ].


   We will prove the results under the stronger Assumption SA. A standard localization argument
then can be used to show that they continue to hold under the weaker Assumption A.

Furthermore, given the lower bound restriction on Vt                                      in Assumption SA, we have

where the constant Kp depends on p. Therefore, by making use again of Lemmas 1-3 and taking
into account the restriction on                    and          of the lemma, we have altogether:
                                       N                                     1+2(2 -1)-                                                 1-

                                       j =1

where again the constant K does not depend on t,  and j . Combining the above bounds, we get
the first bound of the lemma in (102). For the second bound in (103) we make in addition use of
the following
             n
       1                           1,(j )               2,(j )                                  1,(j )                2,(j )           2         K

            s=kn

which in turn follows by application of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the second bound in (110).

Therefore, it suffices to prove the convergence result with i,t,,n replaced by i,t,,n in Zt,,n . Such
a convergence result will follow by an application of Theorem IX.7.3 of Jacod and Shiryaev (2003)

for M being W (0) , a component of B , or a bounded martingale orthogonal to them (in a martingale
sense). The first two convergence results in (151) and (152) follow directly by taking into account
that the volatility processes and the beta process all have c`

in (153) when M is W (0) or a component of B holds trivially because due to the symmetry of the
                                                         (k)

                               t,i (i,t,,n t,i M ) = 0 in this case.
   Suppose now that M in (153) is equal to a bounded martingale orthogonal to W (0) and B .

First, En           n
        t,i (i,t,,n t,i M ) = 0 for k = a, b because M is orthogonal to W

                                                                                               (k)

we are left with showing (153) with k = c and M being a continuous bounded martingale that is
orthogonal to W (0) and B . In this case, we can write

We start with showing the counterpart of Lemma 10 in the current context. The result of Lemma 11
below is slightly more restrictive than what we showed in Lemma 10 when N = . Nevertheless,
it suffices for the purposes of proving Theorem 2.

uous functions on [0, 1], where I is a countable set. For n  , kn   and N  N , with

where we define  n (i) and  n (i), for i = 1, ..., n, from  and  exactly as in (30).
   Furthermore, the above two convergences hold uniformly for ,  belonging to the set of weight-
ing functions of the theorem. Overall, the above results, together with Lemma 11 imply the con-
vergence result of the theorem holds finite-dimensionally, i.e., for any finite set of points in U .
Therefore, we are left with showing tightness of the sequence in the space of continuous functions
on U equipped with the uniform topology. For this, we make use of Theorem 12.3 of Billingsley
(2013) and Lemmas 3, 5-8 as well as the smoothness of u (z ) in u assumed in the statement of the
theorem.

follows by an application of Lemma 11.
