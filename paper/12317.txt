                                           ABSTRACT


Since the dawn of broadcasting, and especially in the past decade, Americans have turned their
attention from local to more distant sources of news and entertainment. While the integration of
media markets will raise the private welfare of many consumers, a globalized information and
entertainment industry can undermine civic engagement, transforming locally engaged citizens into
viewers consuming programming from distant sources. In response to such concerns, many
regulatory agencies, including the Federal Communication Commission in the United States, curtail
the integration of media markets to promote “localism.” Determining the right balance between the
private benefits of integrated markets and the public value of civic engagement requires evidence
on the size of the positive spillovers from local media. In this paper, we exploit the rapid growth of
Hispanic communities in the United States to test whether the presence of local television news
affects local civic behavior. We find that Hispanic voter turnout increased by 5 to 10 percentage
points, relative to non-Hispanic voter turnout, in markets where local Spanish-language television
news became available. Thus, the tradeoff between integrated media markets and civic engagement
is real, and our results provide a basis for the continued pursuit of regulatory policies that promote
localism.

       I.      Introduction

       The increased integration of markets for news and entertainment fundamentally

changes the quality and quantity of media products available to consumers. Because the

production of entertainment and news is characterized by significant fixed cost, increases

in market size raise the number and quality of products. Consequently, more viewers can

watch shows that better match their preferences. For instance, satellite and cable TV

have brought American football to Europe, Japanese anime to Latin America and

Mexican soap operas to the United States. But the availability of these products can

reduce the consumption of local news and entertainment in two ways. First, consumers

who prefer anime to local news will watch the former. Second, the local media products

that lose their audiences may be forced to change their targeting or cut quality, and they

may even cease to exist if their audience falls below a critical threshold. Thus, in

integrated media markets, even those who prefer local content may end up watching

globalized shows. For these reasons, some scholars claim that the rise of integrated

media transforms locally engaged citizens into passive viewers and undermines civic

society (Putnam, 2000).

       Against this backdrop, many regulatory agencies, including the Federal

Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States, seek to protect local media

and promote localism. In the words of former FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell,

“fostering localism is one of this Commission’s core missions and one of three policy

goals, along with diversity and competition, which have driven much of our radio and

television broadcast regulation during the last 70 years.”




                                             1
       Is “localism” really desirable? In particular, are there positive spillovers from the

provision of local content that can help justify the loss of private welfare that integrated

media markets would produce? In this paper we propose a simple test for the presence of

spillovers from local news programming. We ask if the presence of local television news

affects local civic behavior. The ubiquity of local television news programming across

all US metro areas makes it impossible to study its effects on the general population. In

contrast, the availability of Spanish-language local television news has changed

considerably in recent years, providing us with an experiment to study the effect of local

news on electoral participation. The number of metropolitan areas with Spanish-

language local television news (on Telemundo or Univision) grew from 14 in 1994 to 25

in 2002. This trend reflects the rapid increase in the U.S. Hispanic population, which

grew by 58 percent between 1990 and 2000, from 22 to 38 million. The non-Hispanic

US population increased by 9 percent over the same time period.

       We use cross-sectional and time-series variation in the availability of news in

Spanish to study its effects on one important measure of civic engagement, voter turnout.

We find that, relative to non-Hispanic electoral participation, Hispanic turnout is five to

ten percentage points higher in markets with Spanish-language local television news.

Longitudinal estimates, based on markets that get a first local Spanish-language news

program between 1994 and 2002, are somewhat smaller but still economically and

statistically significant. For the case of Spanish-language television news, the spillovers

from local media to civic engagement exist, and they appear to be fairly important.

       Documenting an increase in spillovers for television is of particular interest

because, in the concern about disengagement from local activities, television is generally



                                              2
singled out for the most criticism. There is compelling evidence, for example, that the

spread of television between 1950 and 1970 caused both the decline in local newspapers

and a substantial drop in voter turnout (Gentzkow, 2004). However, claims that

television undermines local civic engagement ascribe to a medium what is a more general

economic effect. As this study documents, even in today’s fairly integrated markets,

television is quite capable of increasing civic engagement if there is sufficient spatial

agglomeration of individuals with similar tastes. Based on our results, we conclude that

the decline in turnout that followed TV was not due to a specific effect of television; it

was market integration that undermined electoral participation. Our evidence that local

media affect engagement in local politics provides some empirical basis for the policy

promotion of localism across different forms of media.

       This paper proceeds in four sections. We present some background on how the

number of products depends on the spatial distribution of consumer preferences in section

2. Section 3 introduces the data used in the study. Next, we present evidence on how the

availability of Spanish-language local television news depends on the size of the local

Hispanic population. In section 5, we present estimates of the effect of Spanish-language

local news on Hispanic voter turnout in non-presidential general elections. We conclude

with a discussion of how markets can undermine or foster civic engagement.




       II.     Background

       This study links the literature on entry in differentiated product markets with

recent models of political economy. There is ample evidence that, in the presence of

fixed costs, products are made available in markets only when large groups want them.


                                              3
For instance, black-targeted radio stations are only available in markets with many black

citizens (Siegelman and Waldfogel, 2001; Waldfogel, 2004). Similarly, daily newspapers

report more frequently about issues of interest to blacks in cities with a larger black share

of population. This in turn increases black readership (George and Waldfogel, 2003). In

the context of this study, we expect to observe Spanish-language news programming only

in markets with a substantial number of Spanish speakers.

       Hispanics in markets with local Spanish news, we believe, are also more likely to

participate in elections. Models of political economy suggest several reasons why better-

informed citizens are more likely to turn out. One explanation is that the consumption

benefits of voting might be larger if citizens are more confident of voting for the “right”

candidate (Matsusaka, 1995). Alternatively, less-informed voters can have an incentive

to delegate their vote to better informed citizens via abstention (Feddersen and

Pesendorfer, 1996, 1999). Whatever the underlying mechanisms, a well-documented,

strong empirical regularity is that people who receive campaign messages are more likely

to participate in elections (Cox and Munger, 1989; Caldeira, Clausen and Patterson,

1990; Bartels, 1993; Wielhouwer and Lockerbie, 1994; Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999;

Gerber and Green, 2000b). Thus, the basic premise of our approach is that Spanish

speakers will find it easier to become informed about an election, and candidates will find

it less complicated to reach likely Hispanic voters, in markets with local Spanish news.

Both mechanisms will raise the turnout of Hispanics.




       III.    Data




                                              4
           The data for this study are drawn from three sources: the Current Population

Survey’s Voting Supplement, 1994-2002; the 1990 and 2000 US Census; and direct

collection of information on the availability of Spanish-language local television news in

US metropolitan areas. Specifically, we have an MSA panel for the even-numbered

years between 1994 and 2002 on the number of stations offering local news in Spanish

for all US metro areas, and individual-level voter turnout data from the CPS. The CPS

data also indicate the individuals’ MSA, Hispanic status, and various individual

characteristics. The metropolitan areas in our sample contain 85 percent of US Hispanic

population in 2000.

           We gathered our list of stations broadcasting news in Spanish from the Telemundo

and Univision websites. We contacted each of these 50 stations to learn if they produce

and broadcast local news. We also know when these stations began airing local news in

Spanish. This information allows us to construct a variable indicating whether there is

local Spanish-language news in each year for 265 markets. We assume that the

metropolitan areas without affiliates of these networks lacked local Spanish news. In

1994, there were 14 metro areas with Spanish-language local news, containing 63 percent

of the Hispanics in the sample. By 2004, the number of sample metro areas with

Spanish-language local television news had increased to 25, and these 25 areas contained

76 percent of sample Hispanic population.1




           IV.     Availability of Spanish-Language Local News

    Percentages based on 2000 Census Hispanic population of each metro area.


                                                     5
       In our approach, we assume that the availability of Spanish news reflects the size

of the Hispanic population. Table 1 explores the determinants of having at least one local

station broadcasting local news in Spanish via a probit relating the presence of Spanish-

language local news to the size of the Hispanic and the non-Hispanic population. The

table reports probability derivatives for 1990 (panel A) and 2000 (panel B) Census data.

Not surprisingly, Hispanic population bears a positive and significant relationship to the

likelihood of having local news in Spanish. An additional million Hispanics raises the

probability by 45 percent in 1994. There is no such relationship for the non-Hispanic

population. The estimates for 1994 (panel A) imply that the Hispanic population needs to

reach a size of at least 350,000 for the probability of having Spanish news to exceed 50%.

As figure 1 shows, many more metro areas are to the right of this threshold in 2000 than

in 1990. By 2004, 25 of the 265 metro areas have at least one Spanish-language local

news broadcast (see table 2).

       While Spanish-language local news is available in only selected metropolitan

areas, national news on Telemundo or Univision is available almost anywhere via cable

and sometimes also over the air during the entire study period. National news programs

cover the presidential election, so even Hispanic populations lacking local Spanish-

language news had easy access to news about the presidential contests in 1996 and 2000.

The widespread availability of Spanish-language national news suggests that the effects

of Spanish-language local news programming on Hispanic turnout will be larger in non-

presidential election years.




       V. Spanish Local News and Hispanic Voter Turnout


                                             6
        1. Empirical Strategy

        We are interested in determining whether the availability of Spanish-language

local television news programming affects Hispanic voter turnout. A simple approach to

this question would be to relate an Hispanic individual’s turn-out decision to a measure of

the availability of Hispanic language news (HLN), estimating a model of the form

(1)     Vim = αHLN m + X i β + ν im

on a sample of Hispanic persons. In equation (1), Vim is a dummy indicating if individual

i who lives in metro area m voted. Xi contains characteristics of the individual, HLNm

indicates whether the area has Spanish-language local television news, and νim is an error

term.

        A basic problem with this approach is that the tendency for individuals (Hispanic

or otherwise) to vote may be related to unobserved area factors, or that the error term is

really vim = μ m + ε im , where μm is common to all persons in the metro area. Factors of

this sort might include the ease with which persons can travel to the polls, or the weather.

If this is the form of unobserved differences, one solution is to “difference out” the

behavior of non-Hispanics. If δH is an indicator for whether a person is Hispanic, then we

can estimate

(2)     Vim = αHLN m + X i β + α H δ H HLN m + δ H X i β H + μ m + ε im

using the entire (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) sample. If Spanish-language news boosts

Hispanic turnout – but not non-Hispanic turnout – we expect αH to be positive. That is,

we expect the relationship between HLN and turnout to be more positive for Hispanics

than for non-Hispanics.




                                               7
       While appealing, the above approach remains vulnerable to a concern of group-

specific unobservables correlated with voter turnout. For example, Hispanics interested

in political participation may congregate in metropolitan areas with media outlets.

Circumventing this problem requires group-specific unobserved fixed effects for each

metro area. Because we have data on 5 separate elections – and because of the growth in

the availability of Spanish-language local news availability during our sample – we can

include group-specific MSA fixed effects in our models. That is, we can estimate a

longitudinal model of the form:

(3)    Vimt = αHLN mt + X it β + α H δ H HLN mt + δ H X it β H + φ t + μ mH + μ mNon − H + ε im ,

including group-specific MSA effects as well as time effects.

       2. Results

       Before turning to regression evidence, we can get suggestive evidence about the

effect of Spanish language local television news on Hispanic turnout from a comparison

of Hispanic and non-Hispanic turnout in markets with and without local Spanish-

language television news (table 3). Using all available years for our sample markets

(panel A), Hispanic voter turnout averages 37 percent in markets without local Spanish

news and 45 percent in markets with local television news in Spanish. Non-Hispanic

turnout is 58 percent in markets without, and 60 percent in markets with Spanish-

language local television news. Whatever is raising Hispanic turnout in the places with

Spanish-language television news, it does not affect non-Hispanics.

       Panels B and C of table 3 separate presidential and non-presidential election

years. Two contrasts are immediately evident. First, turnout is much higher in

presidential election years, for both Hispanics and non-Hispanics, regardless of the local


                                                  8
media environment. Second, the difference in Hispanic turnout in places with and

without Hispanic local news, relative to the same geographic difference for non-

Hispanics, is slightly larger in absolute terms for non-presidential years. That is, the

difference in differences for non-presidential years is 7.6 percentage points, while the

difference in differences for presidential years is 6.3 points.2 Of course, the simple

statistics in table 3 are raw, and we turn to regressions to revisit these comparisons with

statistical controls.

           Table 4 presents probit estimates of the model in equation (2), reporting

probability derivatives. The X variables included are indicators for income quartiles,

education level, and gender, as well as first and second-order terms in age. We allow the

coefficients on all X variables to vary by Hispanic status. The first column pools all years

of data, and the results echo table 3a. After accounting for individual observable

characteristics, the difference in non-Hispanic turnout is slightly negative (-2.6 points).

The difference in differences for Hispanics is 9.8 percentage points. Pooling the non-

presidential years, in column (2), the difference in differences is 11.1 percentage points,

while it is 7.7 percentage points for the presidential years. (We discuss columns (4)-(6)

below).

           These results are consistent with other recent evidence on the relationship

between black-targeted local papers as well as radio stations and black voter turnout

(Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel, 2005). Like this one, that study documents elevated

turnout by blacks (relative to whites) that were particularly large in non-presidential

elections. The results above show that Spanish-language local television news boosts


2
    To see this, note that (40.0-30.8) – (54.5-52.9) = 7.6, while (53.5-45.7)-(68.5-67.0)=6.3.


                                                        9
Hispanic voter turnout in non-presidential elections from about 30 to about 41 percent –

or by over a third. In presidential election years, the presence of Spanish-language local

television news appears to raise Hispanic turnout from about 46 to 54 percent, or by

about a sixth.

        Table 5 presents longitudinal estimates of model (3), which we implement as a

linear probability model because of the large number of dummy variables. We find that

αH is roughly 5 percentage points and statistically significant. While smaller than the

estimates from the cross sectional models, this still implies that HLN presence boosts

Hispanic turnout by roughly 15 percent. When we estimate the model separately for the

presidential and non-presidential election years, we obtain a statistically significant

estimate of 7.8 percentage points for non-presidential years and a statistically

insignificant estimate of 2.0 percentage points for presidential election years.

        3. Robustness

        The evidence in tables 4 and 5 shows that Hispanic voter turnout is higher in

places with Spanish-language local news. This result arises both in the cross section as

well as over time, as more places get Spanish-language local news. Earlier, in table 1, we

showed that places with more Hispanics are more likely to have access to Spanish-

language local television news. A natural concern about our documented relationships

between Hispanic voter turnout and Spanish-language local television news is that it

actually reflects some other mechanism operating through the level or growth of local

Hispanic population. For example, a sufficiently large local Hispanic population may

facilitate the existence of other institutions, such as clubs or political organizations that




                                              10
also boost voter turnout. If these organizations are more effective in local than in

national elections, their presence could explain the results in tables 4 and 5.

        To explore this possibility, we estimate our basic models including the indicator

for Spanish local news as well as the size of the Hispanic population. In particular,

columns (4)-(6) of Table 4 add Hispanic population and its interaction with the Hispanic

dummy to model (2). In these models, the coefficients on the interaction of the Hispanic

dummy and the local Spanish news variable become smaller, but the basic pattern

remains, and the coefficient for non-presidential years retains its statistical significance

(0.07 rather than 0.11). Columns (4)-(6) of Table 5 add Hispanic population and its

interaction with the Hispanic dummy to the longitudinal model (3).3 As with the cross

sectional model, the coefficients decline although the pattern (of higher coefficients for

the non-presidential election years) remains the same. Rather than 0.077 (with a standard

error of 0.031), the coefficient falls to 0.053 (with a standard error of 0.033).

        4. Size of the Estimated Effect

        We take our results to indicate that Spanish-language news programs boost

Hispanic turnout by 5 to 10 percentage points overall. In non-presidential election years,

the periods when the presence of local news actually changes the kind of political

information available to Spanish-speakers through television, the effects are quite large.

The presence of Spanish-language local television news raises Hispanic turnout by 8 to

11 percentage points. Because Hispanic turnout averages 30 percent in non-presidential

elections in places without local Spanish-language televisions news, the effects are



3
 We only observe Hispanic population by MSA at decennial frequency. We calculate each non-Census-
year’s population using constant MSA-specific geometric growth rates.


                                                11
between 27 and 37 percent. Using Hispanics as a window into the possible effects of

television on political behavior, it appears that the effects of television on voter turnout

can be large and positive.

        As a practical matter, local television news can substantially change the Hispanic

composition of the electorate. While Hispanics make up only 12.5 percent of the US

population, their share varies widely across areas. Across the 265 sample metro areas,

the median Hispanic share is 3.7 percent, while the 75th percentile is 8.4 percent, and the

90th percentile is 27.0 percent. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of local Spanish-language

television news on the Hispanic share of the electorate in non-presidential elections,

using a simple calculation: Assume (from table 3b) that 31 percent of Hispanics turn out

to vote if there is no Spanish-language local news, while 39 percent turn out if there is

Spanish-language local news (31 percent, plus the relatively conservative longitudinal

estimate). Assume (from table 3b) that 53 percent of non-Hispanics turn out in non-

presidential elections. Then, if h is the share of an area’s population that is Hispanic,

then the Hispanic share of the electorate is (0.31 + δ 0.08)h [(0.31 + δ 0.08)h + 0.53(1 − h)] ,

where δ is 1 if there is Spanish-language local news, 0 otherwise. Figure 2 plots the

Hispanic share of the electorate with and without Spanish-language local news. For

example, when Hispanics make up a quarter of local population, they make up 16.2

percent of the electorate without Spanish-language local news and 19.5 percent of the

electorate with Spanish-language local news. When Hispanics make up half of local

population, their corresponding shares of the electorate are 36.8 and 42.1.




        VI.     Conclusion


                                              12
       With more integrated media markets and a larger variety of programming choices,

many consumers opt for non-local programming. While such choices enhance the private

benefits of media consumption, there is a concern that reduced localism undermines civic

engagement. Exploiting variation in the cost of accessing information about local

politics, we find support for this concern. Hispanics without access to local television

news are significantly less likely to participate in elections than Hispanics with access to

news in Spanish.

       Finally, our study shows that television bears a mixed relationship with political

participation. Historically, the spread of television has been linked with declining

political participation. But it is important to distinguish medium-specific effects from the

effects of market integration. Television carries both local and national news. The

spread of television, like other national information sources, can attract people away from

local products and local affairs. But television can also include local content, chiefly

local news, and we find that the availability of Spanish-language local television news

significantly boosts Hispanic voter turnout. Even today, television is quite capable of

increasing civic engagement if there is sufficient spatial agglomeration of individuals

with similar tastes.
