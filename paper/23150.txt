                                          ABSTRACT

U.S. health care spending in 2012 totaled $2.8 trillion or 17.2 percent of gross domestic product.
Given the magnitude of health care spending, the large public sector role in health care, and the
reforms being implemented under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), we
believe it useful to examine several basic questions: What was the public share of national
spending on the eve of reform?How has the public share evolved over time? And how are the
benefits of public spending on health care distributed within the population by age, poverty level,
insurance coverage, health status, and ACA-relevant subgroups? The questions we pose, while
basic, cannot be answered with commonly-available statistics due to the sheer complexity of
health care financing in the U.S. The objective of this paper is to provide answers by combining
aggregate measures from the National Health Expenditure Accounts with micro-data from the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

          The Distribution of Public Spending for Health Care in the United States
                                on the Eve of Health Reform


       U.S. health care spending in 2012 was $2.8 trillion or 17.2 percent of U.S. gross domestic

product (GDP) (Martin et al., 2014). Spending of this magnitude can place significant pressures

on families striving to afford premiums and out-of-pocket payments for care, on employers

providing insurance to current and retired employees, and on governments concerned with the

fiscal implications of public spending on health care. Despite the recent slowdown in health care

expenditure growth, these pressures are likely to increase, with growth in health care spending

predicted to outpace growth in GDP over the next decade (Cuckler et al., 2013). As a result, the

role of government in the financing of health care is likely to remain at the forefront of public

policy debate for the foreseeable future.

       In this paper we examine several basic questions: What is the overall percentage of

health care paid for by the public sector? How has the public share changed over time?

And what is the incidence of public spending across key subgroups of the population?

These questions may be basic, but the complexity of health care finance in the U.S. makes it

difficult to provide answers with commonly-available statistics. Measuring public spending

entails tracking not only outlays from public insurance coverage (such as Medicaid and

Medicare), but also implicit tax subsidies (such as those for employer-sponsored insurance),

public grants to providers (such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share payments), and private

premium payments for public coverage (such as Part B Medicare premiums). Because no

single data source provides all of this information, in this paper we combine aggregate

measures from the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) with micro-data from the

Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The first section of the paper adjusts NHEA



                                                 3
estimates to provide an historical look at the public-private spending mix since 1960. The

second section presents a “benefit incidence analysis” of public spending in 2010, by age,

poverty level, insurance coverage, and health status, and across ACA-relevant subgroups on the

eve of reform.

1. Aggregate Public Spending on Health Care

       The NHEA, produced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),

combine data on provider revenues and administrative claims to produce aggregate estimates of

U.S. health spending by service type and payment source (CMS, 2014a). We modify the NHEA

estimates in two ways. First, we reclassify as private the portion of Medicare paid for by private

premiums (these payments are voluntary and thus more akin to a “user fee” than to a tax).1

Second, we shift to public spending the portion of private spending that is defrayed by tax

expenditures.

       Unfortunately, we are aware of no consistent and comprehensive time series for tax

expenditures, and published tax expenditure estimates can be only imperfectly reconciled. For

1987, 1996, 2002, 2007, and 2010 the tax subsidy estimates are from calculations performed by

one or more of this paper’s authors, providing a reasonably consistent and comprehensive set of

adjustments.2 We describe the 2010 estimates in greater detail below, but our basic objective is

to include: (a) federal income, state income, and payroll tax expenditures for employer-

sponsored insurance (ESI) (subsidies for employer contributions and for tax-exempt employee

contributions); (b) the excess medical care itemized deduction; (c) the tax preference for self-

employment health insurance; (d) tax preferences for (health care) flexible spending accounts

and health savings accounts; (e) the exemption of medical care from sales taxation; and (f) a

range of smaller tax expenditures, such as those available to nonprofit providers. Tax

expenditure estimates were constructed assuming that all preferences were removed


                                                 4
simultaneously (rather than, say, allowing the excess medical care deduction to grow in response

to removal of the ESI and self-employment preferences).

       We fill gaps between 1987 and 2012 by interpolation and extrapolation, building on

estimates of the ESI subsidy for current workers from: Miller and Selden (2013), Selden and

Gray (2006), and Joint Committee on Taxation (available for 1967-present, but only covering the

federal income tax portion of the ESI subsidy)(JCT, various years), as well as estimates in Sheils

and Hogan (1999) and Sheils and Haught (2004). For earlier years, we construct estimates that

are as consistent as possible from a variety of published sources dating back to 1967, filling any

remaining gaps back to 1960 using Barro and Redlick’s historical average tax rates (National

Bureau of Economic Research, 2012) and NHEA estimates of private insurance premiums. Due

to the variety of data sources used to construct our time series for tax expenditures, our results

should be viewed as an approximation of how public spending has evolved over time.

       Figure 1 clearly shows both the remarkable rise in real per capita spending and the rising

public share. Combining public outlays with implicit public spending through tax expenditures,

the public share of total health spending increased from 31.2 percent in 1960 to 46.8 percent in

1970 (following the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid). Subsequent changes were more

gradual, but tended to increase the public share, which reached 53.6 percent in 1990, 57.2

percent in 2000, 58.7 percent in 2007, and 59.2 percent in 2012. Tax expenditures as a

percentage of health care spending peaked in the 1979-81 period at an average of 15.5 percent of

total health care spending, declining thereafter to approximately 13 percent at present. This

decline is due primarily to lower marginal tax rates. Together with the fact that private spending

itself is a declining share of total spending, declines in marginal rates more than offset the shift

toward the use of Section 125 plans to exempt employee premium contributions from taxation.




                                                  5
In contrast, public outlays have quite steadily increased as a share of U.S. health care spending,

even after the initial introduction of Medicare and Medicaid.

2. Benefit Incidence of Public Spending on Health Care

       Given that the public sector accounts for well over half of all U.S. spending on health

care, a natural next question concerns the incidence of benefits from this spending across key

socioeconomic groups. To answer this, we move beyond aggregate NHEA estimates, updating

and extending the “benefit incidence analysis” for 2002 in Selden and Sing (2008). Benefit

incidence analysis is a “statutory” method of accounting in a simplified manner for the

distribution of benefits from public spending (Selden and Wasylenko, 1992). Public programs

are assumed to confer benefits in proportion to services or payments received. We do not

attempt to measure the risk-reducing benefits associated with public insurance or the cash-

equivalent valuation by recipients for benefits received, and we ignore shifting across

generations and throughout the economy – our rationale being that we seek to provide a

complete overview of a very complex sector.3

       Our starting point is the MEPS household survey sponsored by the Agency for

Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

MEPS contains individual and household-level data on health expenditures and use, health

insurance coverage, health status, and a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic

characteristics for a nationally-representative sample of households in the civilian, non-

institutionalized population (Cohen, 1997).

       Although MEPS is an ideal starting point for analyzing the distribution of public

spending, no household survey, by itself, can support a complete distributional analysis. First,

household data suffer from underreporting, and high-cost cases may be underrepresented.

Second, household respondents cannot be expected to report certain types of spending, such as


                                                 6
administrative costs or some hospital payments not tied to patient events. Third, although MEPS

provides much of the data to compute tax expenditures, such subsidies are implicit by nature and

thus not readily reportable by household respondents.

       To remedy the first gap, we begin with 2007 NHEA benchmarks that have been aligned

with the type of service and source of payment definitions in MEPS and adjusted to exclude

spending for the institutionalized, active-duty military, and foreigners visiting the US - groups

not included in MEPS (Bernard et al., 2012). We age these benchmarks forward to our analysis

year, 2010, and then align MEPS by type of service and source of payment. Gaps are closed in

part by upweighting high-cost cases and in part by scaling reported amounts (Bernard, Selden,

and Pylypchuk, in process).

       Next we allocate amounts in NHEA that were outside the scope of MEPS. Personal care

services are allocated in proportion to home health care spending. Administrative costs are

allocated in proportion to benefits received, with any premiums paid by households for public

coverage netted out of public benefits received. Medicaid and Medicare Disproportionate Share

payments and state and local funding for public hospitals are allocated using MEPS data on

uncompensated care.4 For completeness we also allocate: research spending in proportion to

prescription drug spending; investment in structures and equipment in proportion to hospital use;

and public health spending evenly across the population. Throughout the analysis, health

insurance provided by public employers to their employees is considered private spending (a

noncash form of compensation in lieu of higher cash wages), rather than public insurance.

       Finally, we estimate a comprehensive array of tax expenditures. To simulate the tax

subsidy from exclusion of employer-sponsored insurance premiums from federal income, state

income, and Social Security and Medicare payroll taxation, we combine marginal tax rates




                                                 7
(simulated using the National Bureau of Economic Research TAXSIM model)5 with MEPS HC

data on employee premium contributions and employer premium contributions (imputed using

regressions estimated with the MEPS Insurance Component survey of employers).6 We also

simulate the medical expense deduction and the exemption of health care spending from most,

but not all, state and local sales taxation. Finally, we allocate to MEPS individuals national

estimates of a variety of smaller tax subsidies, such as the tax exemption of non-profit hospitals

(Bernard, Selden, and Pylypchuk, in process). All differences discussed in the text are

statistically significant at the 5 percent level, and all standard errors and statistical tests reflect

the complex design of MEPS.

1.1. Aggregate Results

        The top row of Table 1 presents the incidence of benefits from public spending on health

care in aggregate. Overall, public spending accounted for 57.6 percent of total spending on

health care (a slightly lower percentage than in Figure 1, due to the exclusion of active-duty

military and persons residing in institutions). We report expenditures in five subcategories:

“Medicaid and CHIP” includes payments for patient care and administration costs, net of

premiums paid by households, for Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP),

and a small number of similar state-funded programs. “Medicare” is defined similarly. These

two categories comprise 67.6 percent of all public outlays. “Other Public: General” includes the

NHEA categories of public health, public investment in structures and equipment, Medicare

Graduate Medical Education, and public research – amounts that tend to benefit broad groups of

the population and may have public goods attributes. All remaining public outlays are grouped

in “Other Public: Targeted.” This includes other public third party programs, such as the

Veterans Administration, Workers’ Compensation, and the MEPS expenditure categories of




                                                    8
Other Federal and Other State and Local, all of which entail payments linked to specific

beneficiaries (i.e., payments that can be measured in MEPS). The “Targeted” category also

includes Medicaid and Medicare Disproportionate Share payments, which are payments to

hospitals based on their caseloads of lower-income populations.7 Finally, the “Tax

Expenditures” category includes all of the tax preferences mentioned above, accounting for just

over one quarter (26.6 percent) of all public expenditures on health care (within the civilian

noninstitutionalized population).

1.2. Age Groups

       Public spending in 2010 was strongly related to age, with children age 0-18 receiving

$1,809 on average, versus $3,539 for adults age 19-64 and $9,678 for seniors (all amounts in

2010 dollars). In part these differences mirror the overall age gradient in health care spending.

Despite the large differences in average public spending between children and seniors, the public

share of total spending for seniors (65.2 percent) is very similar to that of children (63.9 percent).

On a percentage basis, adults age 19-64 receive less than children or seniors (public spending is

52.8 percent of total spending for this group).

       The lower public shares for adults age 19-64 is not surprising given that Medicare

provides nearly universal coverage for seniors and given that public coverage expansions in

recent years, prior to the ACA, have been disproportionately targeted at children (Medicaid and

CHIP). Medicare and Medicaid/CHIP together comprise only 17.9 percent of total spending for

adults under 65 (calculated from table as ($828+$371)/$6703), versus 30.2 percent for children

and 47.8 percent for seniors.

1.3. Poverty Level

       Table 1 also shows the incidence of public benefits by family income as a percentage of

the Federal Poverty Line (FPL). Not surprisingly, Medicaid/CHIP spending was targeted at


                                                  9
lower income groups. In contrast, the remaining categories of public health care outlays were

somewhat more evenly distributed, and tax subsidies strongly favored high-income families.

Overall, public spending accounted for 79.9 percent of total health care among those under 100

percent of FPL. Perhaps more surprisingly, even among those at or above four times the poverty

line the public share was 46.8 percent.

1.4. Health Status

        The top panel of Table 2 shows the incidence of public benefits by self (or proxy)

reported health status.8 Our results highlight the extent to which the public sector targets those

with the greatest health care needs. This is particularly true for public outlays on third party

reimbursement for care (i.e., Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, and Other Public: Targeted). It is not

surprising that public outlays would be highest for those in fair or poor health; these groups also

have the highest private expenditures. More noteworthy is that the public share rises as health

status deteriorates, so that the public sector in the U.S. disproportionately cares for those with

greatest health risks.9

1.5. Insurance Coverage

        The bottom panel of Table 2 shows the incidence of public benefits by insurance

coverage. Not surprisingly, public expenditures are largest on average ($19,291) for dual

eligibles (persons ever covered by Medicare and Medicaid). Also not surprising is that the

public share for persons ever covered by Medicaid/CHIP (but not Medicare or private) is very

high (91.6 percent). More noteworthy is that the public share is just over 50 percent for the full-

year uninsured (though the absolute amount, $1,124, is small relative to other insurance groups).

Even for persons with private coverage during the year the public share is 42.6 percent, due to

$1,678 in tax expenditures and $436 in Other Public: General (both per covered person).




                                                 10
1.6. ACA-Relevant Subgroups

       Table 3 shows the incidence of public benefits for adults age 19-64 by ACA-relevant

subgroups.10 For simplicity we focus on U.S. citizens who are never enrolled in Medicare and

who do not receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI).11 We identify six groups. The first

consists of persons enrolled at any point during the year in Medicaid (or, in a few cases, CHIP).

Even after excluding “dual” Medicaid/Medicare enrollees and persons receiving SSI, this group

currently benefits from extensive public expenditures ($4,480 on average), with a public share of

83.3 percent.

       The second and third groups consist of persons with modified adjusted gross income

(MAGI) under 138 percent of FPL. In group 2 are adults in expansion states who would be

eligible for Medicaid as of January 1, 2014 (if not earlier).12 Group 3 consists of adults in non-

expansion states who will not in general be eligible for Medicaid.13 Neither group receives a

particularly high benefit from public spending on health care; average amounts for groups 2 and

3 are $1,536 and $1,566, respectively.

       The fourth group consists of those gaining eligibility for subsidized Marketplace

coverage. We define this group as adults who (a) would be ineligible for Medicaid using 2014

rules, (b) have MAGI between 100 and 400 percent of FPL, and (c) lack access to affordable ESI

coverage (neither the person nor their spouse is offered ESI through current jobs).14 From a

benefit incidence perspective, this group looks quite similar to lower-income groups 2 and 3.

       Group 5 consists of persons with MAGI over 138 percent of FPL who are offered

coverage through their own job (or whose spouse is offered coverage) – the offers making them

(in most cases) ineligible for subsidized Marketplace coverage even if their MAGIs are under

400 percent of FPL. As has been well-documented in prior studies regarding the regressive




                                                11
incidence of the ESI tax subsidy, this group has access to affordable coverage (at least for single

coverage), and it receives approximately double the public benefit on average ($2,905) compared

to adults in groups 2, 3, 4 – who generally have lower incomes and whose public benefit ranges

from $1,389 to $1,566.

       Looking at these first five groups, benefit incidence analysis clarifies the extent to which

the ACA, as designed, targeted Medicaid expansions and private coverage subsidies at groups in-

between Medicaid enrollees and those with access to ESI. As designed, the ACA would help to

level what was, pre-ACA, a U-shaped pattern of benefits across these groups (see, for instance,

Rennane and Steuerle, 2011). The actual effects of the ACA on this distribution of public

benefits will depend, for groups 2 and 4, on their take up of coverage and their resulting use of

medical care. For group 3 the question is whether their states decide to adopt the ACA Medicaid

expansions.

       The final group consists of persons with MAGI over 400 percent of FPL who lack their

own or spousal ESI offers. Compared to groups 2-4, this group currently receives approximately

the same level of public outlays and nearly twice as much in tax expenditure (reflecting in part

tax preferences for self-employment and retiree coverage). Because of this group’s higher

income, it was not targeted by the ACA – though members of this group may be affected by

ACA provisions regarding guaranteed issue, community rating, and other reforms in the non-

group market.

3. Limitations

       There are several noteworthy limitations of our study. First, Figure 1 presents published

NHEA estimates that we have modified using tax expenditure estimates drawn from a variety of

published and unpublished sources. These tax expenditure estimates can be only imperfectly

reconciled and interpolated, raising caveats regarding the consistency of the resulting time series.


                                                12
Second, our incidence analysis focuses on average spending by subgroups, and we do not

measure the risk-reducing benefits associated with public insurance or the cash-equivalent

valuation by recipients for benefits received. Third, the ultimate beneficiaries of public spending

may be different in some cases from those we identify. For instance, public spending on behalf

of seniors may offset private transfers from (or increase bequests to) their children (Sloan,

Zhang, and Wang, 2002). Fourth, tax expenditure estimates were constructed under the

assumption that employers shift the burden of employer premium contributions to workers based

on the plans they take up (rather than based on their ability to pay or their underlying health

risks), and, while this likely has little effect on aggregate estimates (Miller and Selden, 2013),

alternative assumptions might affect the measured incidence of ESI tax subsidies across workers

(Selden and Bernard, 2004). Finally, persons in institutions (and active-duty military) are

outside the scope of MEPS and thus were not included in our incidence analysis.

4. Discussion

       The estimates presented in this paper provide basic background information on the

overall public share of health care spending, its growth over time, and the distribution of public

benefits across key population subgroups. Overall, the public share of U.S. spending on health

care in 2012 totaled 59.2 percent when we include tax expenditures as a form of public spending

(and when we treat household-paid premiums for public coverage as being akin to a user fee).

Our historical analysis documents a long-term trend toward higher public shares in total

spending, with growth in public outlays representing the primary driver over time (versus tax

expenditures, which peaked as a percentage of health care spending in the years 1979-1981).

       Our incidence results for 2010 show that the distribution of public spending across age,

poverty, insurance and health status have not changed since 2002 (Selden and Sing, 2006).



                                                 13
Publicly-financed health care, both in magnitude and as a percentage of total spending, is largest

for seniors, while benefits as a percentage of total spending are lowest for adults age 19-64.

Moreover, even though it was public outlays, more than tax expenditures, that drove the rising

public share of total health care spending from 1960 to present, our incidence estimates for 2010

show that all income groups (classified by poverty level) share in the benefits of public spending.

Even among families with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty line, public spending

accounted for nearly half of total spending.

       This paper also presents benefit incidence estimates for ACA-relevant groups of non-

senior adults. Our results highlight the relatively low level of pre-ACA public benefits flowing

to adults under 400 percent of FPL who neither were enrolled in Medicaid nor had access to

ESI – precisely those adults the ACA targets for expanded access to government-subsidized,

affordable coverage.

       In future work, “benefit incidence analysis” can provide a valuable tool to evaluate ACA-

related changes in public spending. The Congressional Budget Office (2013) shows that ACA

provisions to expand health insurance will increase the public share of total spending,15 and an

important question for public policy will be the extent to which the ACA evens the distribution

of public benefits across adults. Furthermore, tracking the benefit incidence of public spending

can provide a useful backdrop for the on-going debate over further steps the country might take

on entitlements and tax policy to ensure long-term fiscal stability.

1
    Medicare premiums paid by households for 1987 to 2010 are from NHEA “sponsor” estimates

(CMS, 2014b), supplemented with pre-1987 data on Medicare financing from Trustee Reports.

Although we use NHEA sponsor estimates for Medicare premiums, note that our public/private

estimates differ from NHEA sponsor estimates in several key respects. First, we exclude

nonpatient revenue. Second, we count Medicare as public, whether it is funded by payroll taxes

or general revenues (excluding only the portion paid by premiums). Third, we treat all

employer-sponsored insurance as private, including that for government employees. Lastly, we

account for tax expenditures. As a result, our estimates of the public share are substantially

larger than those in the NHEA sponsor estimates.

    Estimates for 1996 are from Selden and Moeller (2000), which is also our source for

unpublished 1987 estimates. For 2002, estimates are from Selden and Sing (2008) (see also

Sheils and Haught, 2004). Note that tax expenditures that reduce health care spending (such as

property tax exemptions or exemptions from ad valorem sales taxes) effectively increase the total

amount of health care spending by a small percentage.

    Each family’s ESI tax subsidies were allocated across policyholders and their covered

dependents in proportion to spending paid for by private insurance (or pro rata across covered

persons in families that had no care paid for by private insurance).
7
    For instance, Medicare DSH is tied to hospital caseloads of persons receiving Supplemental

Security Income (SSI). Medicaid DSH payments are targeted at hospitals treating indigent

populations.
8
    Persons with missing health status were excluded from the analysis.
9
    Our methodology generally follows that of Selden and Sing quite closely; however, one

difference concerns the treatment of private spending in public share calculations. Selden and

Sing measure the benefit of private insurance using premiums paid by households (or

employers). In this paper, the benefit of private insurance is based on paid claims (plus an

implied load). This is more symmetric with our use of claims paid by public insurers (plus net

administrative costs) to value the benefit of public spending on coverage. This refinement has

negligible effect on our public share computations based on age, income, insurance, or ACA-

relevant groups. It does, however, improve our public share estimates across health risk,

lowering the public share estimates for those with high health risks.
10
     Because income (and thus eligibility) can fluctuate during the year, this portion of our analysis

focuses on income measured as of the first interview during 2010 (and we subset the full-year

MEPS sample to those in MEPS as of that interview).
11
     ACA main coverage provisions do not apply to persons with Medicare or who receive SSI-

related Medicaid coverage for disability. While some ACA coverage provisions apply to some

noncitizens (those who are documented and who meet residency tests), immigration status is not




                                                   16
measured in MEPS and must be inferred probabilistically based on a number of observed

characteristics. Including noncitizens would have very little effect on the estimates in Table 3.
12
     Some adults in these states were eligible for, but not enrolled in Medicaid under pre-ACA

rules, and some lived in states that implemented ACA-related expansions prior to the start of

2014.
13
     Included in this group are some adults who were eligible for, but not enrolled in Medicaid

under pre-reform rules. Note that in non-expansion states, persons with MAGI between 100

percent FPL and 138 percent FPL are eligible for subsidized exchange coverage (if they lack

access to affordable ESI), so that this group is excluded from group 3. Note also that in non-

expansion states the change from pre-ACA Medicaid income counting rules to MAGI and the

elimination of asset tests may make some current enrollees ineligible, while conferring eligibility

on some adults who would previously have been ineligible.
14
     ACA also specifies that such coverage must have an actuarial value of at least 60 percent and a

single coverage premium under 9.5 percent of MAGI. Also, a spouse’s offer would not affect a

person’s subsidy eligibility unless the person can be covered through the spouse’s plan. MEPS

does not provide data on actuarial value and only observes employee contributions and coverage

of other family members for plans actually chosen. Given that most ESI plans meet these tests

for most employees, we focus solely on own and spousal offers in defining group 4 for Table 3.

SOURCE: Authors' calculations using 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data aligned with 2010 National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) data
and other national benchmarks. Sample contains 32,846 positively-weighted observations. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for the complex
design of the MEPS sample, but do not reflect uncertainties regarding the adjustments to align the MEPS with national benchmarks.
These results are for persons aged 19-64 who are citizens due to the cross-state variation in eligibility rules for non-citizens.
