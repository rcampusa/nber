An Economic Approach to Alleviate the Crises of Confidence in Science: With an Application
to the Public Goods Game

                                          ABSTRACT

Novel empirical insights by their very nature tend to be unanticipated, and in some cases at odds
with the current state of knowledge on the topic. The mechanics of statistical inference suggest
that such initial findings, even when robust and statistically significant within the study, should
not appreciably move priors about the phenomenon under investigation. Yet, a few well-
conceived independent replications dramatically improve the reliability of novel findings.
Nevertheless, the incentives to replicate are seldom in place in the sciences, especially within the
social sciences. We propose a simple incentive-compatible mechanism to promote replications,
and use experimental economics to highlight our approach. We begin by reporting results from an
experiment in which we investigate how cooperation in allocation games is affected by the
presence of Knightian uncertainty, a pervasive and yet unexplored characteristic of most public
goods. Unexpectedly, we find that adding uncertainty enhances cooperation. This surprising
result serves as a test case for our mechanism: instead of sending this paper to a peer-reviewed
journal, we make it available online as a working paper, but we commit never to submit it to a
journal for publication. We instead offered co-authorship for a second, yet to be written, paper to
other scholars willing to replicate our study. That second paper will reference this working paper,
will include all replications, and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Our
mechanism allows mutually-beneficial gains from trade between the original investigators and
other scholars, alleviates the publication bias problem that often surrounds novel experimental
results, and accelerates the advancement of economic science by leveraging the mechanics of
statistical inference.

1    Introduction
Returns from public goods and social programs are, more often than not, intrinsically
uncertain. As such, it is often difficult to precisely quantify ex-ante what benefits these
investments accrue to society. Yet, people are typically called to voluntarily contribute to
public goods before uncertainty unfolds. Individuals may hold information that can help
narrow down the possible returns of a public goods investment, but a significant degree
of uncertainty may still persist. Thus, in addition to not knowing whether other people
will contribute or free ride – the classic strategic uncertainty problem – individuals make
decisions while aware that the information they hold is imprecise, and knowing that other
people as well hold imprecise information, which could potentially differ from their own.
     One prominent example is giving to charity (see List, 2011, for a review). Returns
from charitable investments are hard to quantify, and donors may have different opinions,
information and beliefs about the value of a given social service or program. Despite these
obstacles, and despite the absence of formal incentives and institutional rules to alleviate
free-riding, sustained cooperation is often observed.
     Knightian uncertainty represents a pervasive feature of public goods investments, but
little is known about how it affects cooperation in social dilemmas. This paper addresses
this gap using a laboratory experiment in which participants play a repeated public goods
game where the returns from investing in the good are observed with noise. We vary the
level of uncertainty about quality and whether each participant only observes his own noisy
signal, or observes everyone’s signals. Previous experimental work has studied public goods
provision in a world of certainty: while there is uncertainty about other people’s behavior,
everybody knows what cooperation buys.
     Here we take a step closer to reality and ask: can cooperation be sustained over time
when the quality of a given public good cannot be precisely estimated? We find, surpris-
ingly, that uncertainty has a positive effect on cooperation. For any given level of quality,
cooperation breaks down significantly less when quality is observed with noise compared to
the baseline case in which quality is perfectly observed. The economic magnitude of these
effects is large: on average, the rate of decline in contributions is halved in the presence of
uncertainty.
     We show that our results are unlikely driven by confusion, since cooperation when noisy
signals are publicly observed is inversely correlated with the informativeness of the signals.
Otherwise said, as we reduce uncertainty, cooperation decreases. In the limiting case where
public signals fully resolve uncertainty, cooperation rates revert back to those observed in
the baseline. We argue that the presence of Knightian uncertainty fosters conditional
cooperation by generating ambiguity around the determinants of players’ payoffs. When
the returns from public goods contributions are perfectly observed, any reduction in payoffs
can only be attributed to other players free-riding. When the exact quality of a public good
is unobserved however, lower returns from a public good may be driven in part by a lower-
than-expected quality of the good itself. While uncertainty has no effect on the Nash


                                              1
equilibrium outcome, it does affect decisions of conditional cooperators who may become
more tolerant to payoffs’ reductions, effectively limiting the “snowball effect” of free-riding
on conditional cooperation. An alternative and related explanation is that the presence of
uncertainty facilitates cooperation among betrayal averse individuals (Bohnet et al. 2008,
Aimone and Houser 2012).
    This paper makes two key contributions: first, we show that uncertainty about public
goods’ returns represents one of the mechanisms through which provision can be sustained
in absence of incentives mechanisms or institutional rules. The role of Knightian uncer-
tainty in public goods decisions, and in particular its coordination properties, has received
no attention in previous work.
    Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a novel and concrete pathway to
tackle untraveled empirical research avenues. Experimental studies sometimes produce
surprising results that challenge the status-quo of economic knowledge. Such studies face
a binary fate: either their relevance and validity is dismissed, or they are embraced as
important and insightful findings. As Maniadis et. al (2014) point out, however, such
judgments commonly rely on statistical significance as the main criterion for acceptance.
As such, many new and surprising empirical results may be false positives simply because
of the mechanics of statistical inference. Similarly, new surprising results that suffer from
low power, or marginal statistical significance, may sometimes be dismissed even though
they point toward an economic association that is ultimately true. In the first instance,
false positives may generate entirely new research efforts that are based on a false premise.
In the second instance, false negatives may delay economic inquiries of otherwise fruitful
and important research avenues.
    This study, like many others, represents an example of this inference problem. Our
results reject the hypothesis that uncertainty reduces public goods contributions at the
p<.05 level, and our design has power of about 80%. Are our surprising results capturing
a true association? Given the mechanics of inference, it is difficult to provide a definite
answer based on one single exploration. Even if we had very low priors about the likelihood
of our results being true, our findings would lead us to update our priors upward using
Bayes rule. For example, suppose that before running our experiment we had a prior
about the likelihood that uncertainty increases cooperation of only π=1%. After running
the experiment and observing the results, we would update this prior to 13.9%, a very
large increase relative to the initial beliefs.1 However, if we were to (fail to) replicate our
study once, the post study probability that our results capture a true association would
fall to 3%, and further fall to 0.007% with two (unsuccessful) replications. This exercise
highlights how further replications reduce the probability that an initial finding is true,
but at the same time shows how few replications can dramatically increase the reliability
and credibility of a novel experimental finding. With priors as low as 1%, just three
   1
    As shown in Maniadis et al. (2014), the post-study probability that a result captures a true association
                                         (1−β)·π
can be calculated as follows: PSP = (1−β)·π+α(1−π) .



                                                     2
additional successful replications would lead to update the post-study probability at above
80%, establishing thus robust evidence around a novel economic insight. While in theory
replicating novel findings is desirable, in practice the incentives for replication are seldom
in place. Once a study has been published, the original investigators have little incentive
to replicate their own findings, and have only to lose from others doing so. On the other
hand, the returns from replicating a published study are generally low, discouraging other
scholars to replicate the original study.
    This paper proposes and puts into practice a novel and simple mechanism that allows
mutually beneficial gains from trade between original investigators and other researchers.
In our mechanism, the original investigators, upon completing their initial study, write a
working paper version of their study. While they do share their working paper online, they
do however commit not to submit it to any journal for publication, ever. The original
investigators instead offer co-authorship of a second paper to other researchers who are
willing to independently replicate the experimental protocol in their own research facilities.2
Once the team is established, but before beginning replications, the replication protocol
is pre-registered at the AEA experimental registry, and referenced in the first working
paper. This is to guarantee that all replications, both successful and failed, are properly
accounted for, eliminating any concerns about publication biases. The team of researchers
composed by the original investigators and the other scholars will then write and coauthor
a second paper, which will reference the original unpublished working paper, and submit
it to an academic journal. Under such an approach, the original investigators accept to
publish their work with several other coauthors, a feature that is typically unattractive
to economists, but in turn gain a dramatic increase in the credibility and robustness of
their results, should they replicate. Further, the referenced working paper would provide
a credible signal about the ownership of the initial research design and idea, a feature
that is particularly desirable for junior scholars. On the other hand, other researchers
would face the monetary cost of replicating the original study, but would in turn benefit
from coauthoring a novel study, and share the related payoffs. Overall, our mechanism
could critically strengthen the reliability of novel experimental results and facilitate the
advancement of scientific knowledge.
    The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a concise review
of the experimental work on public goods provision. Section 3 presents the experimental
design. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 presents a simple, incentive-compatible
framework for incentivizing replications in Economics. Section 6 presents the replication
plan for this paper. Finally, section 7 concludes.

    Replications would use the original program, instructions, and payoffs of the original paper, as well as
the same sample size.

2       Background
Public goods provision represents one of the most studied decision-making environments
in the experimental economics literature. A comprehensive review of this literature goes
beyond the scope of this paper, but the interested reader may refer to Ledyard (1995) and
Chaudhuri (2011). Three stylized facts that are relevant for this paper emerge from the
literature on public goods contributions: first, initial contributions to public goods typi-
cally exceed zero, what the Nash equilibrium would predict.3 Second, cooperation tends to
unfold over time (Andreoni 1995), a tendency linked to the presence of heterogeneous pref-
erences such as self-interest, altruism, and conditional cooperation (Brandts and Schram
2001; Fehr et al. 2001; Bowles and Gintis 2002; Frey and Meier 2004; Fischbacher and
Gatcher 2010; Ambrus and Pathak 2011; Fischbacher et al. 2014). Third, centralized
institutions, such as taxation, competition, and voting rules (e.g. Falkinger et al. 2000;
Kosfeld et al. 2009; Dannenberg et al. 2010; Reuben and Tyran 2010; McEvoy et al.
2011; Putterman et al. 2011; Kesternich et al. 2014), and decentralized institutions, such
as communication, moral and monetary sanctioning and rewards (Fehr and Gachter 2000;
Masclet et al. 2003; Bochet et al. 2006; Sefton et al. 2007; Gachter et al. 2008; Bo-
chet and Putterman 2009; Nikiforakis 2010), all contribute to various degrees to promote
cooperation.
    A feature common to all these studies is the absence of risk and Knightian uncertainty
about the value of the public good: the marginal per capita return from investing in
the public good (hereinafter MPCR) is perfectly observed by all participants. Only a
handful of papers depart from certainty about the value of the public good. Fisher et al.
(1995) introduce heterogeneity and incomplete information about other players’ returns
by allowing different players to have different MPCR values. In their setting, while there
is incomplete information about other players’ MPCRs, each player knows how much the
public good is worth to him. The authors find that subjects’ behavior seem to be only
affected by their own MPCR, showing thus a negligible effect of information about other
people’s returns.4 Levati et al. (2009) study contributions under imperfect information
about the MPCR: in their setting, the MPCR can take one of two (equiprobable) values,
and each subject knows these values and their probability distribution.5 The parameters
are set such that the behavior of a risk-neutral individual should not be affected by the
    3
     Various factors contribute to higher-than-predicted contributions, such as kindness (Andreoni 1995),
confusion and decision errors (Anderson et al. 1998; Kurzban and Houser 2002), warm-glow (Andreoni 1990,
Palfrey and Prisbey 1997), strategic play (Andreoni 1988), distributional concerns (Fehr and Schmidt 1999;
Bolton and Ockenfels 2000), and intentions’ signaling (Rabin 1993; Charness and Rabin 2002; Dufwenberg
and Kirchsteiger 2004; Cox et al. 2007; Cox et al. 2008).

Komai et al. 2011.
   5
     Notice that their public goods game is a social dilemma only in expectations, since the low value of
the MPCR is such that it is not socially optimal to contribute, and the high value is such that it is both
socially optimal and a Nash equilibrium to contribute everything.



                                                    4
presence of risk. They find that under imperfect information, overall contributions decrease,
a result solely driven by lower contributions in the first period of the repeated public goods
game. Boulu-Reshef et al. (2016) modify the design of Levati and colleagues by maintaining
each possible scenario as a social dilemma, and allowing contributors to receive different
MPCRs. The authors find little effect of risk on contributions.
    The only study that we are aware of that uses Knightian uncertainty is Gangadhran
and Nemes (2009), in which the authors employ a within-subject design to sequentially
introduce Knightian uncertainty over the private account and the public good account,
and allow participants to pay a fee to convert uncertainty over the two possible values of
the MPCR (zero or the MPCR) into risk. Similarly to Levati et al. (2009), the game is a
social dilemma only in expectations, since there is a positive probability that participants
receive a zero payoff even when everyone fully contributes.
    Our paper departs from previous studies in a number of important ways: first, our
parameter space allows us to investigate the effect of Knightian uncertainty over a rich set
of situations, from social dilemmas, to situations where it might be socially optimal not to
fund the public good, and to cases where fully contributing might be a Nash equilibrium.
Second, in our setting Knightian uncertainty cannot be converted into risk, an experimental
feature that confounds the effect of Knightian uncertainty with strategic uncertainty.6
Third, our design introduces (and varies) Knightian uncertainty by providing subjects
with a noisy signal (drawn from a known support but unknown distribution) about the
true value of the MPCR, an approach similar in spirit to what has been done in the
common value auction literature (see Harrison and List 2008). This structure allows us to
capture a critical feature of real-life public goods: when choosing whether and how much to
contribute, individuals have to take into account that other contributors, like themselves,
may hold over-optimistic or under-optimistic beliefs about the value of the public good.


3       Experiment design
3.1     A public goods game with environmental uncertainty: definitions
In a standard linear public goods game, participants are randomly assigned to groups of
size N , and are endowed with M tokens that they can either invest in a private account
that accrues only to their own payoff, or contribute g ∈ [0, M ] tokens to a group project
that pays a return θ to all group members. There is no Knightian uncertainty in this
game, as θ is perfectly observed by all members. In this game thus, each player’s decision
is characterized by the following general payoff function:
    6
    In such setting, subjects not only face strategic uncertainty over other people’s contributions, but also
over others willingness to pay to eliminate Knightian uncertainty.

                                                          j=1

    In our experiment we introduce Knightian uncertainty in the public goods game in
the following simple way. Instead of observing θ, each participant receives a noisy signal
si = θ + i , where i is distributed according to an unknown distribution with mean zero
and standard deviation σ. It is common knowledge that all signals are drawn from the
same distribution. Depending on treatments however, participants either observe only their
own signal (private signal), or observe their own signal and the signals of all other group
members (public signals).
    When signals are privately observed, the payoff function takes the form:
                                                              N
                                                              X
                                  πi = M − gi + E[θ|si ] ·           gj                            (2)
                                                              j=1

    When signals are publicly observed instead, the payoff function becomes:

                                                        \            N
                                                                     X
                               πi = M − gi + E[θ|si         sj ] ·         gj                      (3)
                                                                     j=1
             T
    where si sj is the intersection between a player’s own signal and the vector of signals sj
received by other group members. This simply means that the true θ has to be compatible
with all signals. Equation 3 shows that public signals can vary in how informative they
are about the underlying true value of θ: if at least two group members receive opposite
“extreme signals”, then the true θ is perfectly identified, and uncertainty is fully resolved.
The opposite situation is when sj = s ∀j (e.g. everyone receives the same signal), in which
case observing other people’s signals does not add any useful information.

3.2    Experiment details
We first describe the general procedure, and then provide details about our treatments.
In each session, 16 participants play 4 repeated public goods games in groups of 4 play-
ers. Each game consists of 8 rounds. In each round, participants choose how to allocate
10 tokens between a private account and a group account.7 After each game, groups are
reformed using a stranger matching procedure. Participants are only identified by a ran-
domly generated ID number. It is common knowledge since the beginning that only one
of the 4 games will be randomly selected for payments, and that each player will be paid
   7
     20 tokens are worth US$1. Each token placed in the private account is worth 1 token only to the
subject. After each round, participants are informed about their own payoff for that round, but are not
told how many tokens other players have invested in the group account.



                                                  6
the sum of earnings made in the 8 rounds that constitute that game. In all treatments,
the instructions specify which are possible values that the MPCR can take. The minimum
possible value of the MPCR is 0.05 and the maximum is 1.25, with increments of 0.1. There
are therefore 13 possible values that the MPCR can take. In all treatments, subjects are
told that in 3 out of 4 games the true MPCR is constant within each game (e.g. the MPCR
does not vary between rounds); instead, in one of the 4 games the true MPCR is randomly
drawn every round (with replacement) from the 13 possible values. In all treatments, the
3 games with constant MPCR have always the following (predetermined) MPCR values:
0.25, 0.55, and 0.95. We have two sessions per treatment, and we (partially) vary the
order in which games are played : in one session the order of games is: 0.25, 0.55, 0.95,
VARIABLE; in the other the order is 0.95, 0.55, 0.25, VARIABLE. Before the beginning of
each game, participants are informed about whether the game has a constant or variable
MPCR. To control for risk and ambiguity preferences, at the end of the experiment all
participants play an incentivized Eckel-Grossman risk task (Eckel and Grossman 2002),
and an ambiguity task. This basic structure is common to all treatments.
    We have a total of four treatments in our experiment plus a baseline. We have thus
a total of 160 subjects, equally balanced across treatments. The baseline treatment Base-
VCM is a standard public goods game without Knightian uncertainty.
    We have two private signal treatments in which participants only observe their own
signal. In treatment Private Thin each participant receives a private signal known to be
drawn from the interval: true MPCR ±0.1. So for instance if a participant receives a
private signal of 0.55, he knows that the true MPCR can either be 0.45, 0.55, or 0.65. He
also knows that if the true MPCR is, for instance, 0.65, another player might have received
a signal of 0.55, 0.65, or 0.75. Differently, in treatment Private Thick participants receive
a private signal known to be drawn from the interval: true MPCR ±0.2. So for instance
if a participant receives a private signal of 0.55, he knows that the true MPCR can either
be 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, or 0.75.
    We have two public signals treatments, Public Thin and Public Thick, that have the
same parameters of the private conditions, but differ in the fact that participants also
observe the signals of other group members.8
    The experiment was conducted at the ExCEN experimental laboratory at Georgia State
University, and was programmed using O-Tree (Chen et al. 2016). Participants received a
show-up fee of $10.




  8
      In the three constant MPCR games, participants receive only one signal per game.


                                                    7
4     Results
We present our results in two steps. We first summarize a simple non-parametric analysis
of the effect of uncertainty on public goods contributions.9 We show how our baseline
results compare to previous standard public goods games without uncertainty. We then
compare aggregate behavior in the baseline to our two treatments in which participants
receive a private signal about the true MPCR. Finally we compare results in baseline and
private signal conditions to treatments in which signals are publicly observed.10 In the
second step we analyze our data using econometric models that fully take into account
group-specific dynamics and the panel nature of our data.
    Table 1 sets the stage for our non-parametric analysis, showing average round contri-
butions aggregated by rounds for all treatments and periods with constant MPCR levels.11
   9
     Unless otherwise noted, all results from pairwise comparisons are from two-sided non-parametric
Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests. Table 1 also reports p-values corrected for multiple hypothesis testing
(see List et. al 2016).
  10
     Notice how our public signals treatments serve two purposes: first, they represent an approximation
of institutions that reduce uncertainty about public goods’ quality by aggregating private information;
second they provide us with a control for whether participants understood our experimental setup, and in
particular the relationship between signals and returns from the public good.
  11
     Table 1 averages round contributions between the two orders in which participants can experience the
periods. Participants are randomly assigned in each treatment to two sequences of periods (sequence 1:
{0.25, 0.55, 0.95, Variable period}. Sequence 2: {0.95, 0.55, 0.25, Variable period}. In each treatment,
16 participants experience Sequence 1 and 16 sequence 2. For each treatment and MPCR level, we test
the equality of distributions across orders using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. In all treatments
with private or public uncertainty (both thin and thick), we find that the distributions across orders are
not statistically different for periods with MPCR equal to 0.25, 0.55, while are different at 1% level when
MPCR equals 0.95, with average contributions always higher under order 2. A similar exercise on baseline
Base-VCM reveals that distributions with MPCR equal 0.25 are different at 10% level, and at 1% level
when MPCR equals 0.55 and 0.95. In all cases, average contributions are higher under order 2. We believe
averaging contributions across orders is appropriate for two reasons: First, while under some conditions the
order clearly affects the level of contributions, the rate of decay of contributions over time is nevertheless
the same between the two orders for all treatments and MPCRs. Second, the differences across orders are
always in the same direction for all treatments and MPCR (e.g. order 2 has higher average contributions).
Thus, for the non-parametric section of our results we pool the two orders together, while we explicitly take
order into account in our econometric analysis.

    Figure 1 conveys three clear messages. First, contribution patterns in our baseline are
comparable to previous public goods experiments. Second, contributions under private
uncertainty (either thin or thick, except for Private Thick with MPCR=0.25) are always
higher than the baseline, and cooperation breaks down less frequently when the quality
of the public good is uncertain. Third, contribution and cooperation levels under public
signals are similar to the corresponding baseline cases.
    We first look at baseline contributions. For all values of the MPCR of the public good,
we observe that cooperation breaks down over time.12 When MPCR=0.25, average con-
tributions start at 40.9%, and progressively decline to 13.8% in the final round. Similarly,
when the MPCR equals 0.55, subjects start by contributing about half of their endowment,
ending up with average contributions of about one third (33.4%) in the last round. The
majority of previous public goods experiments use an MPCR of 0.5, and our results fully
compare. For instance, in Andreoni (1995) average contributions start at 56% in round
1 and decline to 26.5% in round 10 (in their round 8 contributions are 35.1%). Even
when the MPCR level is almost such that fully contributing is a Nash equilibrium (e.g.
MPCR=0.95), average contributions start at 68%, only to decline to 49.7% in the last
round.
    Observing higher contributions and more stable cooperation under environmental un-
certainty is striking. For MPCR equal to 0.55 and 0.95, average contributions to (pri-
vate) uncertain public goods are significantly higher than the corresponding certain public
goods. Even when the MPCR is almost such that contributing is not socially optimal
(MPCR=0.25), we find that average contributions are 4% higher under thin uncertainty
than the baseline (no difference under thick private uncertainty). More importantly, we find
that for almost all levels of quality of the public good and level of (private) uncertainty,
cooperation breaks down less than in the baseline case. When uncertainty is thin, the
difference between first and last periods’ average contributions are never statistically sig-
nificantly different, no matter the level of the MPCR. As uncertainty grows (Private thick
treatment), we observe a statistically significant decline in cooperation when MPCR=0.25
(z=0.23,p=0.021) and MPCR=0.55 (z=1.85,p=0.063) (but not when MPCR=0.95). While
the latter decays of contributions are statistically significant, the magnitude of such declines
is small: 16.5% when MPCR equals 0.25, and 13.4% when MPCR equals 0.55.13
    Clearly, as every subject receives a (random) private signal, these results could be driven
by subjects receiving upward biased signals. Figure 1 reports average round contributions
for Private Thin and private Thick divided by whether subjects received a signal above,
equal, or below the true MPCR, and compares them with average round contributions in
Baseline VCM. Averaging contributions by the type of signal received clearly abstracts
from other group members’ signals and behavior, but provide a first important indication
for how uncertainty affects cooperation.
  12
     For all MPCR levels, first and last periods’ average contributions are significantly different
(MPCR=0.25: z=3.5,p=0.000; MPCR=0.55: z=2.1,p=0.035; MPCR=0.95: z=1.9, p=0.048).
  13
     In the baseline, the decline for MPCR equal to 0.25 is 27.2% and 16% when MPCR equals 0.55.

Figure 1: Average contributions in Baseline and Private thin or thick treatments by the
type of signal received




    Figure 1A shows that in treatment Private Thin, subjects who receive upward biased
signals tend to contribute more than their baseline counterparts. The figure also impor-
tantly shows that subjects who receive a downward biased signal do not differ in their
behavior from baseline subjects. This is surprising because for those subjects the best
possible outcome is indeed the true MPCR observed by baseline subjects. Figure 1B shows
contributions from subjects facing a more highly uncertain public good. The pattern is sim-
ilar to Private Thin, with the exception that as uncertainty grows, also subjects receiving
a signal equal to the true MPCR tend to contribute (slightly) more than the baseline.
    So far we have abstracted from the fact that any given individual i is repeatedly observed
over time t (32 rounds) and makes decisions in four separate groups g (8 sequential decisions
in each group), which likely differ in the composition of signals received, value of the public
good, and other group characteristics and dynamics. To account for these differences,
we adopt the following econometric strategy. For each set of results, we estimate highly
dimensional fixed effects models with standard errors clustered both at the group and
individual level (see Cameron et al. 2008; Correia 2017). As our observations are censored
by design (about 17% are left-censored), we also estimate the coefficients of each regression
using random effects panel tobit models with group dummies.14
    Before turning to the econometric analysis of our main data, we first address the possi-
bility that our subjects were confused by the experimental design. To address this concern
we turn to our public treatments, which provide a useful test for confusion and errors. If
participants did not understand the experimental procedure, then contributions in public
treatments groups in which public signals fully resolve uncertainty should differ from base-
  14
    While tobit models are reported as a robustness check, boundaries exercises show low sensitivity of our
estimates to changes in the censoring threshold, suggesting that linear estimators are unbiased.

line contributions. For instance, this could happen if subjects failed to take into account
others members’ signals, or did not understand that the true MPCR must be compatible
with all signals. For similar reasons, the level of informativeness of the public signals (i.e.
how many values of MPCR are admissible given the set of public signals) should have little
predictive power on players’ contributions if our results are driven by confusion or errors.
    Table 2 shows that this is not the case. Columns 1 and 2 compare round contributions
from baseline subjects, who perfectly observe the true MPCR (called henceforth θ), and
round contributions from subjects in our two public treatments who are in groups in
which public signals fully resolve uncertainty. Conditionally on receiving fully informative
public signals, contributions are statistically indistinguishable from baseline contributions
(coefficient “public signals treatments”) under both model 1 and 2. Columns 3 and 4
include all subjects from public treatments and baseline, and explore how the level of noise
of public signals affect contributions. Our main variable of interest in column 3 and 4,
“number of possible θs”, counts the number of values that the true MPCR can take given
the observed public signals. For example, if the number of possible θs is equal to 3 in
a given group, then subjects know than any of those 3 values could be the true MPCR.
Under both econometric specifications, and for any given value of the true MPCR, noisier
public signals induce higher contributions. For instance, In model 4 a 1 unit increase in
the number of possible MPCRs compatible with all signals induce an average increase in
contributions of 1.081 tokens for any given level of the true value of θ (p=0.067).

public signals treatments (both thin and thick). Columns 1 and 3 reports estimates from random effects panel tobit models with dummies
for groups (dummies not displayed in the table). Columns 2 and 4 reports estimates from highly dimensional fixed effects lineal models with
standard errors clustered both at the group and individual level. Groups and individual fixed effects are absorbed in model 4 but not in
model 1, so that the coefficient for ”Public signal treatment“ can be estimated. Variable “True θ” identifies the true MPCR for the round.
Variable “Number of possible θs compatible with all signals” counts the number of values that are compatible with the true θ given the
public signals. The dummy “Only one possible θ (0=no; 1=yes)” takes value 0 when the public signals do not uniquely identify the true θ,
and 1 when they do (and in all observations in the baseline). (Robust) standard errors in parentheses (for models 2 and 4). *** p<0.01, **

               Having shown that confusion has difficulty explaining our results, we turn to an econo-
            metric analysis of cooperation under Knightian uncertainty. In particular, we are interested


                                                                      13
in how uncertainty affects cooperation over rounds, and how uncertainty affects coopera-
tion both within and between different values of the true MPCR. We first assess the effect
of cooperation between MPCR and over time.
    We estimate the following general model (for our highly dimensional linear model):

              yi,g,t = α + β1 T + β2 Xit + β3 Ygt + β4 Xit · T + β5 Xgt · T + igt          (4)
    Where our dependent variable, yi,g,t , is the contribution to the public good made by
i in time t while in group g. T is our treatment, baseline vs. uncertainty under private
signals. Xit , with a slight abuse of notation, is a vector of individual fixed effects plus a
set of individual information received in time t, such as the type of signal received. Xgt
is a vector of group characteristics, such as the true value of the MPCR for that group in
time t, the contributions made by other group members, and the types of signals received
by other group members.
    Table 3 reports estimates from a random effects tobit model and a highly dimensional
fixed effect model with standard errors clustered at the group and individual level. Under
the latter specification we find, unsurprisingly, that contributions decrease over time (0.27
less tokens invested in each subsequent round, p=0.000). However, when the value of the
public good is observed with noise, contributions decrease significantly less over time (inter-
action between time and treatment equal to 0.128 tokens, p=0.072). The effect is stronger
and more statistically significant under our tobit specification. We also find evidence of
a strong and positive effect of uncertainty on between-MPCR contributions (2.96 tokens,
p=0.008). Finally, we do not find evidence that other group members’ contributions in
previous rounds have a statistically significant effect on contributions, and neither does its
interaction with our uncertainty treatment. We also do not find evidence of a significant
effect of the composition of other members’ signals. We construct two dummy variables
for whether at least one other group member has received an upward/downward biased
signal, and neither is statistically significant.15
  15
     The same results are obtained if we include the number of other members who received an up-
ward/downward biased signal instead of these 2 dummies.

    We conclude our econometric analysis by looking at how uncertainty affects within-
MPCRs contributions, that is, how uncertainty affects cooperation at any given level of
quality of the public good.
    Table 4 explores how receiving a private signal greater or lower than the true MPCR
θ affects contributions at any given level of true MPCR. Under our highly dimensional
linear model specification, we find suggestive evidence of an effect of upward biased signals
within levels of MPCR, but no effect of downward biased signals, a result in line with the
trends seen in figure 1. We construct two dummies that capture whether an individual has
received a signal above or below the true MPCR θ, and we interact them with our true
MPCR levels (0.55, 0.95. 0.25 is the omitted MPCR level). When the MPCR is equal
to 0.55, receiving an upward biased signal increases contributions by 1.7 tokens (p=0.062)
compared to when MPCR equals 0.25. We do not find a statistically significant effect for
an MPCR equal to 0.95. In our linear specification, we do not find significance for the
interaction of different MPCRs with signals lower than the true MPCR. The results for
our tobit specification are consistent, with the exception of a statistically significant effect
on the interaction between MPCR=0.95 and receiving a signal lower than the true MPCR
(p<0.05).

5    A simple incentive-compatible framework for replication
     in economics
Current publication practices in Economics provide little incentives to replicate existing
studies. As Hamermesh (2007) puts it, “Economists treat replication the way teenagers
treat chastity — as an ideal to be professed but not to be practiced”. Once a paper is
published, the original authors have little incentive to replicate their own work. Similarly,
the incentives for other scholars to closely replicate existing work are typically very low:
replication studies rarely attract the attention of major journals, thus providing very low
expected returns on this dimension from such investments. While in this paper we focus
on the close replication of an existing experimental design, we note that other types of
replications are rare as well, such as obtaining published datasets to replicate the results,
or investigating a research question using a different design and setting.16
    The lack of close replication of existing experiments is particularly problematic with
studies that find novel and surprising results. Building on a formal methodology developed
in the health sciences literature (Wacholder et al. 2004; Ioannidis 2005; Moonesinghe et
al. 2007), Maniadis et al. (2014) propose a simple framework that highlights how to use a
Bayesian approach to evaluate how a novel result should move scholars’ priors about a given
phenomenon. We focus here on the simplest case of updating after observing results from
one study. Let π be the prior that a given scholar has about a given scientific relationship.
Call α the significance level of an experiment investigating such relationship, and (1 − β)
the power of the experiment. The post-study probability (PSP) that a given scientific
association is true can be computed using the following formula:

                                                              (1 − β) · π
                        Post-Study Probability =                                                     (5)
                                                        (1 − β) · π + α(1 − π)
    where (1 − β) · π represents the probability that a true result is declared true for any
given prior π, and the denominator represents the probability that any result is declared
true (e.g. α(1 − π) is the probability of a type I error given prior π). So for instance
if a given scholar belied that a certain scientific result had a 1% chance of being true at
α = 5% level and power (1 − β) = 80%, after observing one study confirming that result
he would update his priors to 13.9%. Even more dramatically, a scholar holding priors
of 10% would update the post-study probability to 64%. This example highlights how
volatile low priors are when they only depend on evidence provided by a single study.
  16
     Hamermesh (2007) surveyed authors of 139 empirical studies published between 2002 and 2004 in
Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILRR) and the Journal of Human Resources (JHR), both journals
with open data access policies, and found that the mean number of requests for data in each of these two
specialized journals was just one, and 60.5% of authors of these papers never received a request to share
the data. Hamermesh conducted a similar survey with authors who published on the American Economic
Review between 1999 and 2000, and found that the median request for data was three, with 22% of authors
never receiving a request.



                                                   18
More importantly however, the post-study probability of novel and surprising results is
very sensitive to failed replications. Figure 2 shows how scholars holding initial priors
π = 1% and 10% should update their priors based on subsequent replications that fail to
replicate the results at α = 5% with power (1 − β) = 80%. As seen, when only the original
study is available, priors would move from 1% to 13.9% with initial priors π = 1%, and
from 10% to 64% when initial priors are π = 10%. With one additional failed replication,
the PSP given π = 1% would fall from 13.9% to about 3%, and to 0.07% with two failed
replications. Assuming π = 10%, one failed replication would lower the PSP to 27.2%,
while two would further reduce the PSP to 7.3% It can be easily seen that with three
or more failed replications, the post-study probability converges to zero regardless of the
initial priors.

Figure 2: Post-study probability of a given result being true as a function of the number
of failed replications and priors π = {1%, 10%}(assuming α = 0.05, β = 0.8)




                                            19
    Figure 2 shows how a few failed replications can rapidly undermine the credibility of a
novel finding, but overall fail to account for the benefits of replicating. Figure 3 shows how
the post-study probability (assuming π = 1%) varies based on the number of successful
replications out of five and out of ten total replications. The message is clear: just a few
successful replications allow robust convergence of post-study probabilities at above 80%.

Figure 3: Post-study probability of a given result being true as a function of the number
of successful replications (assuming π = 0.01, α = 0.05, β = 0.8)




   As we have seen however, there are little to no incentives in place for a wider and
more systematic use of replications. In the next subsection we propose a simple incentive-
compatible mechanism to promote replications.




                                             20
5.1     The replication mechanism
We propose and put into practice a simple mechanism based on what we believe to be
mutual gains from trade between the original investigators and other scholars interested
in the same research topics. Our mechanism is as follows for experimentation but it could
easily be adapted to more general empirical exercises:

Step 1 : Upon completion of data collection and analysis of a new experiment, the original
investigators find a significant result. The original investigators commit to write a working
paper out of the original study, but commit not to send it to a refereed journal, ever. The
working paper, as explained below, should be posted online on an academic repository (e.g.
SSRN, working paper series etc.). After calculating the minimum number of replications
necessary to substantiate their results given their design, the original researchers offer co-
authorship of a second paper to other scholars who are willing to replicate independently the
exact experimental protocol at their own institution using their own financial resources.
It is a mutual understanding that the second paper is the only paper that will be sent
to refereed journals upon completion of all replications, and will include an analysis of
the original dataset and of all replication datasets. It is also a mutual understanding
that the second paper will reference the first working paper, and that the latter will be
coauthored only by the original investigators. The reference to the first working paper
serves a dual purpose: it enables the original investigators to credibly signal the paternity
of the original research idea, and, as explained below, it provides a binding commitment
device for original investigators and other scholars alike that increases the credibility of the
replication strategy.

Step 2 : Once the original investigators find an agreement with scholars willing to commit
to replicate the original study, the original authors pre-register the replication protocol
at the American Economic Association RCT registry. The registered protocol includes
details about the experimental protocol and materials (e.g. instructions), the data analysis
and findings of the original study, lists the names and affiliations of the scholars who will
replicate the study, and provides a tentative timeline for replications. All parties agree
that only the replications listed in the AEA pre-registration will be included in the second
paper.17

Step 3 : Once step 3 is completed, the original investigators include in the first working
paper a section describing the replication protocol, including the list of scholars who will
replicate and the reference number for the AEA pre-registration. The original authors then
post their first working paper online.
  17
     The reason for listing the replications and the replications’ team in the pre-registration is twofold: first,
it provides a commitment device for all scholars involved in the project. Second, and most importantly, it
provides a credible signal about the total number of replications that will be conducted. This is critical to
avoid any publication bias (e.g. only successful replications are included in the final second paper).


                                                       21
Step 4 : Replications are conducted, data is collected, and the second working paper is
written and submitted to a refereed journal by the original investigators and the other
participating scholars.


6     Replication plan
This section outlines our replication plan. Below is the list of scholars who have agreed
to replicate our study and co-author the second paper which will be sent out to a refereed
journal.

    1. Phillip Grossman - Monash University.

    2. Daniel Houser - George Mason University.

    3. Marie Claire Villeval - CNRS and University of Lyon.

    The replication plan and the original study are registered at the AEA RCT Registry
and the unique identifying number is: “AEARCTR-0002142”. The public URL of the trial
is: www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/2142.


7     Conclusion and discussion
We set out to investigate how the presence of Knightian uncertainty about the value of
a public good affects cooperation, a pervasive and yet unexplored characteristic of most
public goods. In a laboratory experiment, participants receive noisy signals about the
value of the public good. We vary whether individual signals are privately or publicly
observed and the degree of uncertainty. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that introducing
noise about the returns from contributing to a public good increases cooperation. We
suggest that uncertainty may increase the tolerance for payoffs’ reductions of conditional
cooperators, since in this environment low returns from a public good may be driven in
part by a lower-than-expected quality of the good, rather than just by the presence of
free-riders.
    Our study, like many others, explores a novel research question and finds results that
may look quite surprising to many scholars. Instead of arguing for the veracity of our
results, and sending this article to a peer-reviewed journal, we take a step back and propose
to put into practice a simple incentive-compatible mechanism to promote replications of
novel research findings. We commit never to publish this paper, but we instead offered
co-authorship for a second paper to scholars interested in independently replicating this
study. Regardless of whether the results of this paper will replicate or ultimately prove
being false positives, we believe that our mechanism represents a valuable approach for
experimental economists to enhance – and not undermine – the impact of novel studies


                                             22
exploring uncharted territories, and it is our hope that other scholars will follow our path.
More generally, we believe that this approach has viability for any empirical exercises,
whether it is an experiment, an empirical exercise using naturally-occurring data, or a
meta-analysis of previous studies. Replication exercises should be a pillar of deepening our
scientific understanding, and should play a critical role in any model of building scientific
knowledge.
