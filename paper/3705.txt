                                             ABSTRACT

      We examine the effects of family background variables and neighborhood peers on the

behaviors of inner-city youths in a tight labor market using data from the 1989 NBER survey of

youths living in low-income Boston neighborhoods. We find that family adult behaviors are strongly

related to analogous youth behaviors. The links between the behavior of older family members and

youths are important for criminal activity, drug and alcohol use, childbearing out of wedlock,
schooling, and church attendance. We also find that the behaviors of neighborhood peers appear to

substantially affect youth behaviors in a manner suggestive of contagion models of neighborhood

effects. Residence in a neighborhood in which a large proportion of other youths are involved in

crime is associated with a substantial increase in an individual's probability of the being involved in

crime. Significant neighborhood peer effects are also apparent for drug and alcohol use, church

attendance, and the propensity of youths to be out of school and out of work. Our results indicate

that family and peer influences both operate in manner such that "like begets like."

 I. Introduction

      The last two decades have witnessed a substantial deterioration along many dimensions in the

economic and social conditions of disadvantaged young Americans. The changes appear to have been

especially adverse for black youths living in the ghetto neighborhoods of large American cities. In

particular, the rate of joblessness has increased substantially for less-educated youths (Freeman,

1991a; Juhn, 1991). The real and relative wages of both black and white young, less-educated

workers have plummeted since the early 1970s. The poverty rate among families headed by young

persons has increased. Many observers believe that the problems of crime, violence, and drug abuse

reached "catastrophic" proportions in American inner cities in the late 1970s and have probably

continued to worsen (Wilson, 1987). In fact, the proportion of black men 20 to 29 years old directly

in trouble with the law (in jail or prison or on probation or parole) reached 23 percent in 1989

(Mauer, 1990). While some disadvantaged youths continue to advance in the mainstream economy,

the trends of the 1970s and 1980s suggest that a substantial proportion are likely to become unable

or unwilling to work regularly in the normal market economy.

      What factors differentiate among those inner-city youths that make progress in the mainstream

economy through schooling and working and those who do not follow such a path? Recent proposed

explanations for the problems of the disadvantaged have emphasized a decline in the availability of

jobs for less-educated workers in America's central cities (Kasarda, 1989) and the role of family and

neighborhood factors operating through peer influences and the behavior and characteristics of adult

role models (Wilson, 1987; Crane, 1991). While Freeman (1989, 1991a) has provided evidence that

strong local labor market conditions improve the labor market performance of inner-city youth, the

question of how important are disadvantageous family and neighborhood factors in hindering the

progress of youths even in vibrant labor markets remains relatively unexplored.

      In this paper, we address these issues through an examination of the effects of family
background and neighborhood characteristics on the socioeconomic outcomes of inner-city youths in
                                                  2

a tight labor market (Boston in early 1989). We perform this analysis using the 1989 NBER survey

of youths living in low-income, inner-city Boston neighborhoods. The survey provides detailed

information on family background variables, neighborhood characteristics, standard measures of

socioeconomic outcomes, indicators of drug use and criminal activity, and on youths' social contacts

and views of their neighborhoods.

      While the existing literature empirically examining the extent to which an individual's
socioeconomic success is influenced by various family and community background factors is immense,

the 1989 NBER Boston Youth Survey has two features for studying family and neighborhood effects

not available in most of the data sets used in previous research.' The survey provides some

nonstandard family background variables such as information on the church attendance, drug use, and

criminal records of respondents' older family members. Second, the survey allows us to look at the

influences of peers within geographic entities resembling actual neighborhoods, since we have
information on exact street addresses for a substantial majority of the respondents.

      We draw two main conclusions from our empirical analysis. The first is that measured family

background variables are strongly related to the socioeconomic outcomes of disadvantaged youths in

a manner suggestive of potentially causal behavioral links. We find that different family background

variables have quite distinct relations with the different measures of socioeconomic outcomes for the

youths in the sample. In particular, family background variables appear to be most strongly related

to similar variables for youths and usually not significantly related to other outcome variables when

directly-related family background variables are included in the specification. In other words, youths

who had family members in jail when they were being raised are much more likely be involved in



   'A small sampling of the literature examining the impacts of family background variables on
economic success includes Blau and Duncan (1967), Corcoran et al. (1989), and Altonji and Dunn
(1991). The empirical literature on neighborhood effects is critically reviewed in Jencks and Mayer
(1990).
                                                 3

criminal activity; those with family members with drug problems are more likely to use drugs; those

with teenage mothers and parents who were not married are substantially more likely to have children

out of wedlock; and those with more-educated parents get more schooling.

      Our second main finding is that the spatial pattern of outcomes in our sample from the Boston

Youth Survey appears consistent with the view that neighborhood effects operating through peer

influences are important for socioeconomic outcomes, even within a sample in which all the youths

are living in high-poverty communities. Residence in a neighborhood in which many other youths

are involved in crime, use illegal drugs, or are out of work and out of school is associated with an

increase in an individual's probability of the analogous outcome even after controlling for a variety

of family background and personal characteristics.

      The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the 1989 NBER Boston Youth Survey

and provides descriptive information on Boston inner-city youth. Section III examines the relations

between family background variables and youth outcomes. Section IV empirically examines the

importance of neighborhood effects on youth outcomes. Section V concludes.



II. A Profile of Disadvantaged Youths in a Tight Labor Market

     The NBER surveyed some 1200 youths aged 17 to 24 from high-poverty neighborhoods in

inner-city Boston in early 1989. The survey was implemented in a period with an extremely strong

labor market in Boston at the tail end of a sustained economic boom and was completed before the

emergence of the recent economic downturn in the New England region. The survey was designed

with the intention of developing a portrait of how disadvantaged youths fare in a tight labor market

and to assess hypotheses concerning the economic factors and family and neighborhood influences

that affect their labor market success and other socioeconomic outcomes. The survey questionnaire

contains ten modules covering labor market experiences, current living arrangements, family
                                                  4

background, social contacts and neighborhood characteristics, childbearing and marital history,

schooling experiences, personal history, illegal activities, drug use, and respondent opinions and
outlook.

        In contrast to the 1979-80 NBER Survey of Inner-City Black Youths (Freeman and Holzer,

1986), the 1989 NBER Boston Youth Survey covered white (and other nonbiack) youths as well as

blacks, and included young women as well as young men. The survey covers youths in three high-

poverty areas of Boston's central city: Roxbury (a primarily black area), South Boston (an almost

exclusively white area), and South Dorchester (a racially mixed area). The survey had a response rate

of 71 percent and was implemented using a residence-based sampling design analogous to the one

used in the 1979-80 NBER survey.



A. Respondent Characteristics and Family Backgrounds

        Table 1 provides information on the family backgrounds of the black males, white males, black

females, and white females in the sample. (The sample does not contain a sufficient number of

Hispanics or Asians to analyze separately). The table indicates that relatively more blacks than whites

come from single-parent homes in which the father was not present when the respondent was age

14. The fraction of both blacks and whites from homes without a father present at age 14 is
substantially greater than the national averages for blacks and whites from the National Longitudinal

Survey Youth sample (a somewhat older sample containing young persons aged 14-21 in 1979).2 The

fraction of black males from homes with fathers is 43 percent in our Boston sample in comparison

to 52 percent for the NLSY. The contrast for white males is even more striking: 59 percent for the



   2Tabulations from the NLSY were performed by the authors using the random and supplemental
samples. All averages are weighted averages using sampling weights to convert the numbers into
representative national averages. The averages are quite similar when only the random sample is
used.

Boston youth sample versus 84 percent for the national sample from the NLSY. Table 1 further

shows that the blacks in the Boston youth survey are much more likely to have had a teenage mother

and to have had parents who were not married to each other than are the white youths.
Approximately 30 percent of both the black and white youths report having been supported by

welfare at some time when they were being raised.

      In sharp contrast to typical national samples, the blacks appear to have been raised by
individuals with more years of schooling than the whites in our Boston sample.3 Over 80 percent

of the blacks in our sample claim to have had a "parent" with a high school degree in contrast to only

58 percent for the blacks in the NLSY. On the other hand, the whites in our sample appear to have

much less-educated parents than random national samples of whites.

      The 1989 NBER Boston Youth Survey has three further interesting variables on the family

backgrounds of the respondents. These variables are based on the responses to the question "how

often, if at all, did any of the following things happen to the family you were brought up in?: (1)

someone in your family was in jail; (2) someone in your family had drug/alcohol problems; and (3)
the adults in your family went to church." Responses to these questions could be coded as often,

sometimes, rarely, and never. The questions were asked immediately after a series of questions on

the respondent's family when he or she was 14 and on the type of upbringing the respondent
received. The responses to the questions indicate that a substantial minority of the respondents had

family members that had been in jail. The majority of whites in the sample indicated having family

members with drug or alcohol problems. Finally, blacks were more likely to come from families in

which the adults went to church often. As we shall see below, the responses to these three questions


    3The sample does not contain standard parents' education variables. Instead, we have information
on the education of the person the respondent denotes as having been most important in raising him
or her when he or she was 14. When this variable was not available, we used education of person
contributing most money in raising youth. When both variables were unavailable, we used the
education of the older adult with whom they were living at the survey date.
                                                   6
seem to be strongly related to respondent behaviors similar to the information being probed about

their family members.

      The bottom part of Table 1 provides information on the living arrangements of the respondents

at the time of the survey. Most of the youths are living with a parent or with older adults. A large

fraction of the youths live in low-income households with disproportionately many more blacks than

whites coming from quite poor families.

      We have two measures of public housing residence for the sample. The first comes directly

from the self-reports of the respondents. The second measure we derived using the addresses of the

respondents and information on the exact location of Boston's public housing projects provided by

the Boston Housing Authority (BHA).4 Many more whites than blacks in our sample reside in public

housing projects. This is indicative of Boston's quite distinct pattern of public housing. The largest,

high-density public housing projects in Boston (the Mary Ellen McCormack and Broadway-D Street

projects) are located in South Boston and largely inhabited by whites. This contrasts with other large

cities such as Chicago in which high-density, high-rise public housing is largely located in black areas.

Overall, almost 40 percent of the whites in the NBER sample live in public housing, as compared to

1 percent for whites at similar ages in the national NLSY sample in 1980. Using self-reports of public

housing residence, as is also found in the NLSY, we find that the blacks in the NBER survey are also

much more likely to live in public housing (approximately 30 percent as compared to 13 percent in

the NLSY).

      In summary, the 1989 NBER Boston Youth Survey contains a sample of young people who are

disproportionately disadvantaged along many dimensions. We next examine whether these



   4The two measures correspond quite well for the whites in our sample. The vast majority
indicating residence in public housing do appear to actually reside in BHA projects. In contrast, the
majority of blacks indicating residence in public housing do not appear to live in BHA projects and
are likely to receive government rental assistance.
                                                  7
disadvantages translate into particularly poor socioeconomic performance even in a robust economy.



B. Respondent Socioeconomic Outcomes

      Table 2 provides measures of socioeconomic outcomes for blacks and whites in our Boston

youth sample. A moderate proportion of both the blacks and whites are still in school with the

proportion higher for blacks. A larger fraction of the blacks are still in school and a much greater

fraction of the whites are high school drop outs. This finding is consistent with evidence that blacks

get more schooling than whites with similar family background characteristics (e.g. Altonji, 1988) and

is not surprising given that the blacks in the sample seem to have more-educated parents than the

whites.

      In contrast to the greater educational attainment of blacks in the sample, the whites appear to

be more successful in the labor market. Whites are much more likely to work and have a much lower

unemployment rate. Overall, since the proportion of youths out of school in the sample who are

employed is quite low, a quite significant proportion of the sample respondents are "idle" -- out of
school and not employed.

      Did the tight labor market in Boston raise the labor market performance of these disadvantaged

youths to levels close to the national average? Table 2A contrasts standard measures of labor market

participation and idleness for the 18-24 year old black and white males in our sample to national

averages from the Current Population Survey for 1988. The tight labor market appears to have put

the 18-19 year old, disadvantaged black males in the sample up to even footing with the national

average for black males of similar age. In contrast, the 20-24 year old black males are much more

likely to be unemployed and idle than the national sample. The difference may arise at least partly

from the much greater likelihood that the 20-24 year olds who had gained from the strong Boston

economy may have moved out of these neighborhoods than the successful 18-19 year olds. The

disadvantaged white males in the sample have much lower labor force participation, higher
unemployment, and greater idleness than average white males in their age groups.

      Returning to Table 2, we find that the statistics concerning drug use and crime present some

surprises. Whites are much more likely than blacks in the sample to admit to having committed

crimes, to selling drugs, and to using illegal drugs. While the proportion of young white males who

admit that they committed crimes in the past year is quite high relative to national samples like the

NLSY (as indicated in tabulations presented by Freeman (1986)), the proportion of blacks who admit

to committing crimes does not appear to be particularly high relative to national samples. The higher

rate of crime reported by whites than blacks in the sample may reflect the tendency for black youths

to substantially underreport criminal acts relative to whites (Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis, 1981), or

it may arise because the survey failed to adequately sample the segment of the black population in

these areas involved in crime. These self-reports of crime contrast sharply with the findings presented

below that blacks are more likely to have friends in gangs and are more likely to think crime and

violence are major problems in their neighborhoods.5 Finally, there is some indication that the

financial rewards to criminal activity increased for disadvantaged youths in Boston during the 1980s.

Freeman (1989) reports that many more black males in Boston in the 1989 NBER survey than in the

1980 NBER survey reported that they could earn "more on the street doing something illegal than

on a straight job" (66 percent in 1989 versus 44 percent in 1980) and that average illegal earnings for

this group increased substantially from 1980 to 1989.

      Finally, blacks (especially black women) in the sample are much more likely have parented

children without being married than are whites. In fact, extremely few of the individuals in the

sample are married.

by blacks in the 1989 NBER Boston Youth Survey.

C. Social Contacts and Neighborhood Characteristics

      Many recent discussions of the problems of disadvantaged youth have emphasized the
characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they reside and the nature of their social contacts. In

particular, Wilson (1987) has highlighted the potential importance of the increasing social isolation

of the poor and Jargowsky and Bane (1990) that poor blacks become increasingly geographically

concentrated since 1970. A series of questions were included in the NBER Boston Youth Survey

to attempt to determine the nature of extent of contact these youth have with persons engaged in

various activities in their neighborhoods.

      The top part of Table 3 summarizes the responses to questions concerning neighborhood
contacts. A significant fraction (at least 37-42 percent) of both the black and white youths report that

they "know very well persons" involved in crime in their neighborhoods. A large proportion of black

youths (30 percent of males and 16 percent) of females report having friends in gangs (although very

few admit to being in gangs themselves) and most have friends who sell drugs. Furthermore, less than

30 percent of the respondents indicate that they know well persons in "business, accounting,
engineering, science, or law" and approximately 50 percent of the youths in the sample indicate that

they do not know any professionals in these fields in their neighborhoods. The youths are much

more likely to know people in trouble with the law and welfare mothers than they are to know

professionals. This suggests some possibility that they are socially isolated without middle class role

models in their communities. On the other hand, the respondents are clearly not geographically

isolated and the majority leave their neighborhoods to go elsewhere essentially every day.

      The NBER survey also provides information on the youths views of life in their neighborhoods.

These perceptions are summarized in Table 4. The youths report that their neighborhoods have

many jobless men, many welfare mothers, and many drug dealers. In contrast to their lower self-

reports of criminal activity, the blacks in our survey are twice as likely as the whites to respond that

crime and violence are serious problems in their neighborhoods. While the blacks in the sample are

more likely to know professionals in their neighborhoods, they are much less likely than the whites

to indicate that their community provides support for people who try to get ahead through schooling

and getting jobs. Similarly, a majority of the whites (57 percent) indicate they prefer living in their

neighborhoods to other locations, while a substantial majority (61 percent) of the blacks express a

desire to move out of their neighborhoods.



III. Family Backgrounds and Socioeconomic Outcomes

      How do the differences in family background factors among the disadvantaged youth in inner-

city Boston relate to differences in socioeconomic outcomes? Table 5 provides a first look at this

question by comparing six socioeconomic outcome variables (measuring criminal activity, illegal drug

use, childbearing out of wedlock, labor market and school activity, and church attendance) for youths

with and without eight different family background characteristics.

      While one must be careful in drawing inferences from the comparisons in Table 5 since they

do not control for many other relevant factors, the table presents a striking message: each family

background factor seems to be a reasonably strong predictor of youth behaviors similar to the

behavior of adults in the family being captured by the family background variable.6 Youths who had

family members in jail when they were being raised are more than twice as likely (25 percent to 12

percent) to admit to being involved in criminal activity in the last year than are those who report no

family members in jail. Similarly, those with family members with drug and alcohol problems are

much more likely to use drugs; the best predictor of whether a youth has parented a child out of



    6The message is quite similar when one separately examines cross-tabulations of the type
presented in Table 5 for blacks and whites and for black males and white males.

wedlock are whether his or her parents were married; parent's education differentiates among

educational attainment of youths but is not much related to criminal behavior; and, unsurprisingly,

youth regular church attendance is most strongly differentiated by the church attendance behavior

of family adults. Many of the family background variables appear strongly related to idleness (being

out of work and out of school).

      To determine whether or not the family background variables continue to be highly related to

similar youth behavior once other background variables are allowed to have an impact, we estimated

ordinary least squares equations linking socioeconomic outcomes (linear probability models for
discrete outcomes) to the background factors, race, sex, and age.7 While these regressions do not

tell us whether background factors cause outcomes or whether certain background factors and

outcomes go together for other reasons (omitted variables correlated with both), strong patterns in

the results may provide information helpful for the further exploration of potentially causal models.

      Table 6 presents the estimates of models relating our six socioeconomic outcome variables to

"exogenous" personal and family variables.8 The strong impacts of family background variables on
directly related youth behaviors and weaker effects on other behaviors (except idleness) continues

to hold in the multivariate analysis presented in Table 6. For example, the estimates in the first

column show that the two family variables potentially related to illegal activities by parents and older

siblings (whether the respondent had family members in jail or with drug problems) have the largest

and most significant estimated impact on self-reported criminal activity. In the second column, the

estimates show that the variable indicating whether an individual has family members with drug

problems has a large effect on illegal drug use. Furthermore, the two background variables with


    7The results are extremely similar for the models with dichotomous dependent variables when
logits and probits are used rather than linear probability models.

   8The welfare variable was dropped from the specification since it provided quite similar
information to the variable for whether the respondent's parents were married.

large impacts on single parenting are whether the respondent had a teenage mother and whether the

respondent's parents were married. While the effects of standard family background variables

(whether both parents were present at age 14 and parent's education) are substantial and significant

for the standard outcome measures of idleness and schooling, the indicator variables for having had

a family member in jail and for having a teenage mother seem to be (at least to some extent) general

indicators of potential future socioeconomic distress for youths.

      We have explored the robustness of our findings concerning family background variables to a

large number of changes in specifications and samples. The basic qualitative findings concerning the

impacts of family background variables presented in Table 6 remain quite similar when we restrict the

sample to males only and when the specifications are expanded to include further (potentially

endogenous variables) such as an indicator variable for residence in public housing and a measure

of the family income (the income of those with whom the respondent resides). In addition, the

results are robust to estimating these equations on the younger half of the sample separately from

the older half. The relevant results are also not much altered when dummy variables for broad

neighborhoods or zip codes are included in the specifications.

      We conclude that different family background variables appear to have quite distinct relations

with the different measures of socioeconomic outcomes for disadvantaged youths. In particular,

family background variables typically appear to be most strongly related to variables capturing

analogous behavior for youths. The impact of family background variables appears more complex
than simply as picking that "good" families have "good" kids and "bad" families have "bad" kids.



IV. Do Neighborhoods Matter for Disadvantaged Youths?

      Many observers believe that when children from disadvantaged families have predominantly

disadvantaged neighbors that their chances of escaping from poverty and advancing in the mainstream
                                                  13

economy are greatly diminished.9 Neighborhoods may, prima facie, be thought to influence youths

in two complementary ways. First, if adult neighbors are involved in an activity -- crime, for example,

or drug abuse -- observation of this activity may directly influence youths in the neighborhood.

"Collective socialization" models of neighborhood effects (Wilson, 1987) focus on the way adults in

a neighborhood affect youths who are not their children. Affluent adult neighbors may act as positive

role models indicating that success follows from hard work and may help maintain neighborhood

order. Second, neighborhoods provide youths with close proximity to others in their age group.

Interaction with peers who exhibit certain behaviors may influence youths directly. "Epidemic" or

contagion models (Crane, 1991; Montgomery, 1990) emphasize the way in which peers influence one

another's behavior and are based on the assumption that an individual's likelihood of getting involved

in an activity depends positively on the fraction of his or her neighborhood peers involved in such

an activity.

      In addition to its use in quantifying family influences, the NBER Boston Youth Survey can be

used to study the effects of neighborhoods on youth outcomes. We are able to use the data available

in the Boston Youth Survey to examine the potential importance of neighborhood effects operating

through peer influences.'0

      To perform our analysis of neighborhood influences, we exploit the fact that we know the

precise street addresses of a substantial majority of the youths in the NBER Boston Youth survey."


    9See Jencks and Mayer (1990) for a review of alternative models of neighborhood effects.

     '°While we would like to explore the importance of non-familial adult influences, we do not have
appropriate data to do so at present. The only non-familial adult behavior measured in our sample
is that of the parents of other youths in the survey. However, the parents of peers may not provide
a representative sample of non-familial adult behavior in a youth's neighborhood.

    "We recovered the address sheets for 997 of the 1200 survey respondents. The other 203 address
sheets were (inexplicably) not kept. We were able to determine the exact locations of the residences
of the respondents in 988 of the 997 cases using the addresses reported on the address sheets and
detailed Boston street maps. The sample for which we have addresses appears to be quite similar
                                                 14

On the basis of geographic location, we assign youths to neighborhoods roughly one or two square

blocks in size, with four or five youths per neighborhood. The 988 youths for which we know physical

location are assigned to 206 neighborhoods. We use these neighborhoods in the empirical work that

follows.



Descriptive Evidence of Neighborhood Effects

      There is significant heterogeneity in neighborhood characteristics and outcomes, even among

high-poverty communities in Boston's inner city. To bring some of these differences into focus, we

present in Table 7 the percentage of youths reporting particular activities in the three broad areas

of the city covered by the survey: South Boston (310 observations), Dorchester (446 observations)

and Roxbuiy (232 observations). The percentage of Roxbury youths reporting family members in jail

while they were being raised is higher than that in Dorchester or South Boston. However, a higher

percentage of South Boston youths report family drug or alcohol abuse problems (56percent) than

do those in Roxbury (39 percent) or Dorchester (42 percent). There is also a striking difference

between these areas in the percentage reporting that their parents were never married, with the rate

in South Boston (8 percent) significantly lower than that in Dorchester (27 percent) and Roxbury (35

percent).

      Although the differences in youth outcomes and family background characteristics between

these three areas of the city at least partially reflect the racial differences summarized in Table 2,

there are also large differences among neighborhoods of similar racial compositions within each of

these areas of the city. For example, large differences exist between neighborhoods in the percentage



to the full sample on virtually all characteristics except race. Disproportionately many of the
addresses are missing for the nonwhites and nonbiacks from the original sample. We have repeated
the analyses in sections II and III using the smaller sample that we can place into exact
neighborhoods and found qualitatively and quantitatively quite similar results.

of youths reporting that family members have been in jail. Family jail terms are much more prevalent

in the western neighborhoods of South Boston (home of the Broadway-D Street public housing

project) than in South Boston's eastern neighborhoods. The data also suggest that individual family

background variables have quite distinct spatial patterns. The southern neighborhoods of South

Boston have a relatively high incidence of family members in jail, but a relatively low incidence of

parents not married. For the central neighborhoods of Dorchester, the opposite is true: relatively

low rates of family members jailed, but relatively high incidence of unwed parents. In the northern

neighborhoods of Roxbury, both rates are high.          This suggests that models in which some
neighborhoods are "bad," and act generally as "bad" influences on youths, will not be adequate to

explain our data.

      There exists, as well, a substantial amount of spatial correlation across neighborhoods in youth's

socioeconomic outcomes: neighborhoods with a high degree of idleness tend to be adjacent to or

near other neighborhoods with high idleness rates. Neighborhoods with lower gang membership rates

tend to be near neighborhoods with similarly low rates.12 Spatial correlation remains even after

conditioning on family background and personal characteristic variables.13 Spatial correlation in the


          can be seen also by calculating Moran I statistics (MI) of spatial correlation for the 206
neighborhoods in our sample. The measure of spatial covariance relative to variance for outcome
Y can be calculated:

                MI = Y'WY/2J
                         Y'Y/n

where W is a matrix that assigns each observation its' neighbors. W = {w1} such that w1 = 1 if i and
j share a boundary, else w = 0. J is the number of boundaries in the system, and n is the number
of neighborhoods in the system. The MI statistic is asymptotically normally distributed. For the
outcomes we will analyze below, the MI statistics are: CRIME = 0.18 (t-stat = 3.83); DRUG USE
= 0.10 (2.05); SINGLE PARENT = 0.10 (2.07); IDLE = 0.15 (3.15); FRIENDS ARE GANG
MEMBERS = 0.07 (1.47); CHURCH ATI'ENDANCE =0.12(2.48); REGULAR ALCOHOL USE
= 0.10 (2.16).

    13 Regressions were performed on those observations for which addresses are available. The
regression results are almost identical to those reported in Table 6 for the sample as a whole.
                                                  16

mean residuals by neighborhood suggests that there may be large neighborhood effects, with the rates

of outcomes in some neighborhoods much higher [lower] than one would expect given personal and

family background characteristics. In addition, neighborhoods with particularly high [low] mean
residuals tend to be adjacent to or near similar neighborhoods.



Estimates of Neighborhood Effects

      To more formally explore the extent to which neighbors influence one another, we explicitly

allow for the possibility that other young people in the neighborhood directly influence youths'

actions. Table 8 presents probit estimates that allow for the influence of neighbors in a given youths'

behavior for seven socioeconomic outcome indicators: criminal activity, illegal drug use, parenthood

outside of wedlock, idleness, friendship with gang members, church attendance, and regular alcohol

use. In each of the estimated equations, neighbors' observed behavior is included as an independent

variable, along with the family background and personal characteristic variables used in Section ifi.

The models estimated in Table 8 are of the form:



            =    WY       + X13 +u

       Y1 =     1   ifY > 0, Y =   0 otherwise



where Y is an (Nxl) vector of youth outcomes, u is an (Nxl) vector of disturbance terms, and W is

an (NxN) matrix that assigns to each observation the mean of its neighbors' outcomes. That is, the

ith row of W assigns to observation i the average behavior of i's neighbors. In this estimation,

"neighbors" include both those observations with which a given youth shares a neighborhood

observations in immediately adjacent neighborhoods. Because each neighborhood contains only 4 or

5 observations      and represents a quite compact geographic area, we allow youths in adjacent

neighborhoods to be included in measures of neighbor activity in order to provide a more precisely

estimated measure of that activity in the area immediately surrounding a youth. Thus, a youth's

neighbors includes other youths in the geographic area stretching approximately two blocks in each

direction from the youth's residence.

      The estimates presented in Table 8 are the derivatives of the predicted probabilities for each

outcome with respect to each covariate evaluated at the sample mean characteristics." Similar to

the results presented in Table 6, family factors continue to have significant effects on related youth

behavior. Youth drug use, for example, is more highly correlated with reported family drug problems

than with any other family background variable; parenting a child out of wedlock continues to be

highly correlated with having parents who never married, and with having a teenage mother. In

addition to the related family background variables, it appears that related peer behaviors have

substantial and significant effects on youth involvement in crime, drug use, church attendance, alcohol

use, and idleness. For example, the point estimates in column (1) imply that the direct effect of

moving a youth with given family and personal characteristics to a neighborhood where 10 percent

more of the youths are involved in crime than in his or her initial neighborhood is to raise the

probability the youth will become involved in crime by 2.3 percent. Peer influences appear to be less

significant in affecting the propensity of youths to have children out of wedlock than they do for the

other activities examined.

      While the results in Table 8 suggest strong family and peer influences, there are several

potential sources of bias in estimating peer effects by directly entering neighbor's outcomes as
explanatory variables in models to estimate individuals' socioeconomic outcomes. The discussion


    14The models estimated in Table 8 are of the form Y = ZS + u, where u is a vector of i.i.d.
normal error terms with mean zero and unit variance. The derivative of the probability that Y=1
with respect to the covariate Z evaluated at Z° is given by (Z°&) 6, where () is the probability
density function for a univariate standard normal random variable. The reported derivatives in Table
8 are evaluated at the sample means of the Z's.

above implied that neighboring observation j influences observation i's actions while at the same time

being influenced by observation i. This structure means that an individual observation's error term

is correlated with its neighbors' outcomes and its neighbors' outcomes enter its equation as an

explanatory variable. In this case, probit estimates with neighbors' outcomes on the right-hand side

of the equation do not yield consistent estimates of peer effects. In addition, significant correlation

between neighbors' behavior and a given youth's behavior may be due solely to correlation in the

shocks to their systems. In other words, one would not want to attribute influence to peers that

which was instead correlation in u1's among youths in a neighborhood arising from unmeasured factors

affecting all youths in the neighborhood. For example, crime and drug involvement may be higher

in some neighborhoods than others because of laxer law enforcement activity rather than because of

peer influences. Although unmeasured variables common to neighbors are likely to lead to upward

biased estimates of peer effects using the direct probit approach in Table 8, measurement error in

neighbor's outcomes from respondent misreporting of activities is likely to lead to downward biased

estimates using this approach.

      The problem of estimating peer or neighborhood effects has an analogue in analysis of discrete

panel data, where researchers have been interested in distinguishing between serial correlation and

potential habit persistence.'5 In our analysis of peer effects, we wish to distinguish between spatial

correlation in the errors and true interdependence in youth behavior. We will do so using two

procedures similar to those recommended for assessing the importance of habit persistence in the



    '5When the value taken by the latent variable Y for i in period t is a function of the value of the
latent variable for i in earlier periods,

        Y(i,t) = f[Y(i,t-1)],
the model is said to exhibit "habit persistence." Heckman (1981a,b) carefully discusses empirical
strategies to attempt to distinguish true habit persistence from serial correlation in the errors in
discrete panel data models.
                                                  19

discrete panel data/time series analogue.

      In the time series case, Chamberlain (1985) recommends adding lagged exogenous variables to

the model and testing their significance. If current behavior does       respond to lagged exogenous

variables, this can be taken as evidence that there is no interdependence. In the spatial case, this

becomes a test of whether neighbors' family and personal background characteristics (WX) are

significant explanatory variables of a youth's predisposition to a behavior (Y*) in models that also

include an individual's own family and personal background characteristics (X) as explanatory
variables.

      To carry out these tests, probit models for youth socioeconomic outcomes were estimated

taking as explanatory variables the same individual-specific personal and family background variables

used in Table 8. The log likelihoods of these models are recorded as the log likelihoods for Model

I in Table 9. We then compare these log likelihoods to those from probit models (Model 2 in Table

9) which take as explanatory variables, in addition to all of the personal and family background

variables used in Model 1, the average values of the same set of personal and family background

variables of the youths's neighbors. Neighbors are defined, as above, to be youths in the same one

to two block area and in immediately adjacent areas.

      These tests, presented in Table 9, suggest that youths' behaviors are interdependent for most

of the behaviors discussed above. Comparison of log likelihoods of probit estimating equations that

allow for the presence of neighbors' variables (WX) with those that do not suggest that neighbors'

variables are highly significant in predicting criminal activity (Likelihood Ratio (LR) test = 36.6,

Probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis of equality between likelihoods =0.99), drug use,

gang activity, church attendance, and alcohol use. These tests suggest less neighborhood influence

in idleness, and almost no evidence of neighbor influence in parenting out of wedlock (LR= 17.0,

Prob=0.48). These tests encourage closer attention to behavioral interdependence.

      The second approach we take is to put more structure on the problem by directly modeling a

youth's predisposition toward a behavior as a function of other youths' predispositions, allowing for

the simultaneity induced by such a structure. The estimating equation is chosen to allow youth i's

predisposition to an outcome (Y) to depend upon neighboring youths' predispositions to that
outcome (Y), in addition to the same set of conditioning variables (Xi) used in Tables 6 and 8. This

approach yields a model which can be written as:



(1)

(la)     Y1 = 1 ifY >0, Y= 0 otherwise


where u is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and c is the parameter measuring the

extent of neighborhood peer influences.

        Underlying continuous variables indicating youth predispositions towards an outcome or the

extent of youth involvement in an activity such as drug use are not available in the Boston Youth

Survey. The only data available are discrete indicators of youth behaviors.'6 Since Y' is not

observed, we note that equation (1) can be rewritten:



(2)      Y = [I-W]'X/3 + [I-W]'u.


Furthermore, we observe that the matrix associated with X13 in (2) can be expanded:



         [I-pWi1=I+W+2W2 +3w3...

      '6See   Jones (1990) for an alternative instrumental variables approach to estimating peer
influences when continuous outcome measures are available.
                                                  21

as long as    is less than one in absolute value. With q less than one in absolute value, the higher

order terms become less and less influential and can be ignored for all practical purposes. We

approximate the matrix [I - p W]' and estimate the model implied by (la) combined with the

following equation17:



(3)      y* = [I + w + 2 W2]        x    + [I - W]1 .


        Under this approach a youth's own personal characteristics and family background variables

identify 8, and neighbors' family background and personal characteristics are used to identify peer
influences. More specifically, variation in neighbors' personal characteristics and family background

variables (WX) and those of neighbors' neighbors (W2X) identify p. As in Heckman (1978), it is

more convenient to work with a variance normalized version of estimating equation (3). Details of

the estimation procedure are presented in Appendix 1.

        Estimates using this approach are presented in Table 10. The reported estimates are the

derivatives of the predicted probabilities for each outcome with respect to each covariate evaluated

at the sample mean characteristics. As was true in the estimates in Table 8 where simultaneity was

not explicitly modelled, the addition of neighboring youth behavior does not break the strong

relations between family background variables and directly related youth behaviors found in Section

HI. It continues to be the case that family drug and crime history are the most influential family



      17We have also estimated equation (3) with expansion to a third term in --that is, approximating

         [IW]4 i+w+2w2                    +3w3.
The estimates were virtually identical in all case to the estimates using an expansion to 2 suggesting
the influence of the higher order terms beyond 2 quickly die away and are of little practical
significance.

variables in a model of youth crime activity. Among family variables, illegal drug use and regular

alcohol use are still most closely tied to family drug/alcohol abuse, and single parenthood is still most

responsive to mother's age at youth's birth and to parents' being unwed.

      Estimates of neighborhood peer influences (estimates of ) are given in the top row of Table
10. Controlling for simultaneity in neighbors' behavior also does not break the strong neighborhood

interdependence in youth behavior observed in Table 8. Increases in neighbors' involvment in crime,

drug and alcohol use, gang activity, idleness and church attendance have large and significant effects

on a given youth's involvement in these activities. The results suggest that youths within a
neighborhood have large and significant effects on each others' behavior, even after including

substantial controls for personal characteristics and family background variables. In other words,

youths residing in a neighborhood in which a substantial fraction of young people are involved in

crime or use illegal drugs have significantly higher probabilities of exhibiting analogous behavior than

youths with similar family background and personal characteristics living in neighborhoods in which

a small fraction of other young people are engaged in such activities. The magnitude of
neighborhood peer influences are particularly large for illegal drug use and church attendance. On

the other hand, peer influences appear unimportant for childbearing out of wedlock.

      One possible caveat to our interpretation of the results in Tables 8, 9 and 10 is that they may

be partially being driven by errors in the measurement of individual family background variables that

are correlated with the measured average characteristics of one's neighbors. For example, if our

observed family background measures consist of true family backgrounds plus measurement error that

is uncorrelated with the truth and if families are sorted among neighborhoods on the basis of "true"

family background characteristics, then neighbors' X's will be correlated with an individual's error

term. On the other hand, our finding that the estimated effects of family background variables are

not much reduced by the inclusion of neighbors' variables suggests that our estimates of neighborhood
                                                   23

effects do not largely reflect the possibility that neighbors' variables may proxy for mismeasured family

background variables.18

      Our findings complement the results of recent studies using tightly defined neighborhoods. For

example, Crane (1991) finds strong neighborhood influences on dropping out behavior and teenage

pregnancy in a national sample using geographic neighborhoods of similar size to the one's used in

our analysis. Brooks-Gunn et al (1991) also find evidence that a geographic neighborhood's
socioeconomic mix is significantly related to adolescent behaviors (out-of-wedlock childbearing and

dropping out of school) using census tracts and zip code areas as neighborhoods. Similarly using

schools rather than residential neighborhoods, Mayer (1991a,b) finds substantial effects of a school's

socioeconomic mix on teenage fertility and high school graduation rates. The one discrepancy
between our findings and these other studies is that we find quite weak neighborhood effects on out-

of-wedlock childbearing.



V. Conclusions

      Our main findings are that the behaviors of family members and neighborhood peers appear

to substantially affect the behavior and outcomes of disadvantaged youths. The pattern of influences

suggests that two inner-city youths with the same personal characteristics may have quite different

socioeconomic outcomes depending on family role models and peer influences in their neighborhoods.

Our results indicate that family and peer influences both operate in manner such that "like begets

like." These family and neighborhood influences are important even under the tight labor market

conditions prevailing in Boston in the mid- to Iate-1980s.

       Our results are consistent with Wilson's (1987) emphasis on the importance of role models.


    '8See Borjas (1991) for a formalization of this argument in the analogous case of examining the
extent to which the effects of ethnic group average characteristics on youth outcomes may pick up
mismeasured individual family background variables.

Wilson (1987, p.7) argues that the presence of working class and middle class black families

"reinforced and perpetuated mainstream patterns of norms and behaviors." Our findings suggest that

such families may influence inner city youths directly through the actions of their children, or perhaps

indirectly, with influence working from adult neighbor to parent, and from parent to child.

      The possibility of substantial family and neighborhood influences presents a mixed message with

respect to the future prospects for those growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods. On the

pessimistic side, strong family and neighborhood effects imply that those from disadvantaged
backgrounds may have difficulties even under the most optimistic scenarios involving labor shortages

and tight labor markets in the future. On the optimistic side, such effects also suggest that shocks

or policy interventions that positively affect individuals will have positive multiplier effects within

neighborhoods through peer influences and across generations through family influences.

If a youth's predispOSit0fl toward a behavior is a function of neighboring
                        toward that behavior, the structural equations appear
youths' predispositions
(as in the text):


                         -   (I   -
                                      W)1 Xfl ÷ (I-W)1 u                      (2)




where u is assumed to be normally distributed, u — N(O,                        ).



                   yi        liffYO.   i



                   y         — 0 otherwise.
                    i


The variancecOVar1ae matrix for (2) is


                             — E(VV') —      (I   -
                                                      W)' (I -   W)1' o


where V —     the       Lth element of (I -           ) 1u.
         i




The variance_normalized version of equation (2) appears



                             —   D'   (I -        W)' X ÷ D1 (I-W)' u                  (2.A)




 where the inverse of D, the square root of the DIAG(c2), is used to give the
 model unit variance disturbances.

 Clearly the probability that                     is greater than zero,


 Pr(Y)       0 —        Pr( (I-W)' u         (I -      W)1 X


 is equal to the Pr(Y*                0) —    Pr(D1     (I-W)1 u    D1 (I -     W)1 X) I.

with the influence of the later terms dying out. Using this matrix expansion,

the variance (Ci) can then be written:


Q- (I -         W)1      (I -   W)"     :

— (I      --   (W    + W') +       + W2'-- WW') )


                                ÷ terms involving     and higher orders of .
