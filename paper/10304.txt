Does “Aggregation Bias” Explain the PPP Puzzle?

                                            ABSTRACT

Recently, Imbs et. al. (2002) have claimed that much of the purchasing power parity puzzle can be

explained by “aggregation bias”. This paper re-examines aggregation bias. First, it clarifies the

meaning of aggregation bias and its applicability to the PPP puzzle. Second, the size of the “bias”

is shown to be much smaller than the simulations in Imbs et. al. (2002) suggest, if we rule out

explosive roots in the simulations. Third, we show that the presence of non-persistent measurement

error – especially in the Imbs et. al. (2002) data – can make price series appear less persistent than

they really are. Finally, it is now standard to recognize that small-sample bias plagues estimates of

speeds of convergence of PPP. After correcting small sample bias by methods proposed by Kilian

(1998) and by So and Shin (1999), the half-life estimates indicate that heterogeneity and aggregation

bias do not help to solve the PPP puzzle.

1. Introduction

      Rogoff (1996) defines the “purchasing power parity puzzle” as:

     How can one reconcile the enormous short-term volatility of real exchange rates with the
extremely slow rate at which shocks appear to damp out? Most explanations of short-term
exchange rate volatility point to financial factors such as changes in portfolio preferences, short-
term asset price bubbles, and monetary shocks. Such shocks can have substantial effects on the
real economy in the presence of sticky nominal wages and prices. Consensus estimates for the
rate at which PPP deviations damp, however, suggest a half-life of three to five years, seemingly
far too long to be explained by nominal rigidities. It is not difficult to rationalize slow
adjustment if real shocks – shocks to tastes and technology – are predominant. But existing
models based on real shocks cannot account for short-term exchange-rate volatility. (pp. 647-
648.)

      Algebraically, it is helpful to express this in the following terms. Take a log-linear

approximation of the home country and foreign country consumer price indexes:

(1)       pt = α1 p1t + α 2 p2t + ... + α N pNt                   pt* = α1 p1*t + α 2 p2*t + ... + α N p*Nt .

pt is the log of the home CPI, and pt∗ the log of the foreign CPI, assumed for convenience to be

expressed in a common currency. pit ( pit* ) is the price of good i in the home (foreign) country.

We will assume that the CPI weights, α i , are the same at home and abroad. The α i weights

correspond to the expenditure share on good i near the point of approximation.

      To understand Rogoff’s PPP puzzle, classify the N goods into the K traded goods, and

N − K nontraded goods, and then note we can write the log real exchange rate, qt , as:

(2)                                               qt ≡ pt* − pt = xt + yt ,

where xt is the relative traded price indexes between the home and foreign country:

                                                       K
                                                            αi               K
                                                                                 α           K
                         *
                   xt ≡ pTt − pTt , with pTt ≡ å               pit , pTt∗ ≡ å i pit∗ , αT ≡ å α i ,
                                                       i =1 αT              i =1 αT         i =1


and, where yt involves the relative price of nontraded to traded goods at home and abroad:

                                                             1
                                                                           N
                                                                                    αi                  N
                                                                                                               αi
       yt ≡ (1 − αT )( p*Nt − pTt
                               *
                                  − ( pNt − pTt )) , with pNt ≡           å                     ∗
                                                                                         pit , pNt ≡ å              pit∗ .
                                                                         i = K +1 1 − αT            i = K +1 1 − αT


Real tastes and technology shocks drive the relative price, yt . Since those shocks are likely to

be very persistent, the slow adjustment of real exchange rates could be explained if the yt were

predominant in movements in qt . But as Rogoff notes, the innovation variance of yt is much

smaller than the innovation variance of xt . This relative price component cannot account for the

volatility in real exchange rates.

      The xt component of course is highly volatile. Its volatility is easy to understand in the

context of models in which nominal consumer prices are sticky (when expressed in their own

currencies.) In that case, xt inherits the volatility of nominal exchange rates. As Rogoff notes,

nominal exchange rate volatility can be explained by financial factors. But how do we explain

the persistence of xt ? We might hypothesize that nominal prices adjust gradually toward their

long run mean, perhaps according to an AR(1) process:

           xit = θ xit −1 + ε it , where xit ≡ pit∗ − pit , and ε it is ~ i.i.d., E (ε it ) = 0 , E (ε it2 ) = σ 2 .

Under these assumptions, xt itself is an AR(1) process, with first-order serial correlation given

by θ . But Rogoff notes that the persistence of real exchange rates (a half life of 3-5 years) is

inconsistent with plausible estimates of the speed of nominal price adjustment.

      Imbs et. al. (2002) (hereinafter IMRR) offer a potential resolution to this puzzle. They argue

that the real exchange rate behavior can be reconciled with sticky-price models. Their

explanation involves introducing heterogeneity into the processes for xit :

(3)                    xit = θi xit −1 + ε it , where ε it is ~ i.i.d, E (ε it ) = 0 , E (ε it2 ) = σ i2 .




                                                               2
They argue that there is an “aggregation bias” when we use the half-life of real exchange rates to

draw inferences about the speed of price adjustment. When this bias is corrected, they claim that

estimates of price adjustment drawn from real exchange rates are completely in line with models

of slow nominal price adjustment. They find an average half-life of price adjustment on the

order of one year.

   Our objective is to reexamine the case for “aggregation bias”. In section 2, we restate

IMRR’s definition of “aggregation bias”, and examine the statistical and economic meaning of

this bias. Section 3 performs some simulations to assess the size of this bias. Our simulations

differ from those in IMRR in that we restrict xit to be non-explosive – that is θ i ≤ 1 . In section

4, we discuss measurement error. In general, xit may appear to be less persistent than it actually

is if its measurement is marred by an additive error that is not very persistent. Unfortunately, the

data in IMRR has many such problems. Finally, as is now well known, there can be severe small

sample bias in estimating autocorrelation coefficients. IMRR do not employ a correction for this

bias, but we show its importance in section 5.

   All four sections point toward the same direction: that “aggregation bias” is not a likely

solution to the PPP puzzle. Section 2 shows that there is no general sense in which aggregation

biases downward estimates of the speed of adjustment. The simulations of section 3 show that in

practice the effect of aggregation bias is very small. Section 4 finds that when the data is

cleaned, there is no empirical evidence of aggregation bias. Finally, the estimates of section 5

that correct for small sample bias imply very slow adjustment of prices – i.e., the PPP puzzle is

worse than you think.

 IMRR also investigate biases associated with another sort of heterogeneity. Panel studies of

PPP frequently impose the identical speed of adjustment across all real exchange rates, but

IMRR argue that that assumption can bias estimates of the half-life of real exchange rates. We

                                                  3
do not address biases in panel estimates here – there is already a large literature devoted to that

topic. While our empirical work replicates the panel methods of IMRR, our focus is on the

aggregation bias.




2. Heterogeneity and Aggregation Bias

    IMRR investigate the properties of qt . In their empirical work, and their simulations, they

make the following claim: the estimated half-life of qt is much larger than the average estimated

                                     N              N
half-life of the xit , where qt = å α i xit and     åαi = 1 .   Analytically, they demonstrate a different
                                    i =1            i =1


result: the first autocorrelation of qt is larger than the average of the first autocorrelations of the

xit , when the xit follow AR(1) processes defined in equation (3). First, we note that there is not

necessarily a direct relationship between the size of the first autocorrelation and the half-life. An

average of N variables that each are AR(1) generally will be an ARMA(N,N-1) process. The

impulse response function for an ARMA(N,N-1) process can be non-monotonic and is not a

simple function of the first autocorrelation.

    Nonetheless, it is revealing to examine the expression for the first autocorrelation of qt . It is

not true that in general there is aggregation bias. That is, the first autocorrelation may be greater

or less than the average of the first autocorrelations of the xit . We can unambiguously state there

is aggregation bias only when the α i (the weights in the price index) are equal for all i; σ i2 (the

innovation variance for xit as defined in equation (3)) is the same for all i; and, the cross-

correlations of all series are equal ( σ ij ≡ E (ε iε j ) , i ≠ j , are all equal.)




                                                           4
      Granger (1980) examines the properties of sums of AR series. Here we make some

observations relevant for the discussion in IMRR.

      The expression for the “aggregation bias” in the first autocorrelation is a nonlinear function

of the autocorrelation coefficients θ i , the weights α i , the variances σ i2 , and the covariances σ ij .

                    Cov(qt , qt −1 )
Define θ a ≡                         , which is the first autocorrelation of the real exchange rate. The
                     Var (qt )

weighted average of the autocorrelation coefficients for the xit is given by

           N
      θ ≡ å α iθ i .
           i =1


As shown by Imbs, Mumtaz, Ravn and Rey (2003), the first order autocorrelation of the real

exchange rate is given by:1

                         N
(4)       θ a = θ + å λi (θi − θ ) ,

      “Aggregation bias “ is defined as θ a − θ . Aggregation bias may be positive or negative.

There is upward aggregation bias, as IMRR assert, if the higher values of θ i get higher weights,

                  N
λi , so that      å λi (θi − θ ) is positive.
                  i =1


      The first issue to address is the fact that the consumer price indexes are not simple

unweighted averages of prices. The IMRR methodology imposes the assumption that the price




1
  This equation is essentially the same as the one derived in Imbs et. al. (2003) for equal weights. We have
followed their nice derivation in Appendix A. As Imbs et. al. (2003) note, their version of equation (4) for N prices
was derived in response to correspondence from one of the authors of this paper, which outlined the effects of non-
zero correlation and different variances on aggregation bias that we describe here.

                                                                   5
index is equally weighted.2 Even if the aggregation bias (as defined here) is zero, θ a does not

necessarily equal the unweighted average of the θ i .

    This alone could lead IMRR to overstate aggregation bias. Rogers and Jenkins (1995) found

that they were only able to reject the null that xit has a unit root for specific fresh food items –

eggs, oranges, apples, bananas, chuck roast, and a few others. But fresh food has a low weight in

the overall CPI. Simply taking an unweighted average of speeds of adjustment gives too much

weight to these goods, and makes the unweighted average of the θ i lower than the weighted

average, θ .

    In the special case in which the weights are all equal ( α i = N −1 ), the innovation variances for

all xit are equal ( σ i2 = σ 2 ), and all of the covariances of innovations are equal ( σ ij = ρσ 2 ), Imbs

et. al. (2003) show that aggregation bias is positive.

    In general, however, aggregation bias could be positive or negative. We can write:

                                                   N
                                  Cov(α i xit , å α j x jt )
           Cov(α i xit , qt )                      j =1
    λi =                      =                                .
             Var (qt )                      N
                                     Var (åα j x jt )
                                            j =1


                                                                                      Var ( xit )
For example, if the series were uncorrelated and weights were equal, λi =             N
                                                                                                     . If the
                                                                                     åVar ( x jt )
                                                                                     j =1


variance of xit is large relative to the average variance, then θ i will be disproportionately

weighted in θ a . But that could cause θ a to be too large (if θ i is larger than θ ) or too small (if

θ i is smaller than θ ).


2
   For example, their RCM estimator (discussed below) has the mean speed of adjustment as an unweighted average
of the θ i .

                                                                   6
                                                                                   Cov( xit , qt )
    More generally, if the series are correlated but the weights are equal, λi =                   .
                                                                                   N ⋅ Var (qt )

Allowing for non-zero correlation could push the aggregation bias in any direction. Consider

this simple example. Suppose N = 3 , weights are equal, and there is perfect negative correlation

between x1t and x2t : specifically, x1t = − x2t . Then qt = 13 x3t . The persistence of the real

exchange rate is the same as the persistence of x3t .
                                                                           H H
    The aggregation bias is a nonlinear function of the parameter vectors θ , α , and the variance-
                                          H H
covariance matrix, Σ . That is, θ a = f (θ , α , Σ) . Take a first-order Taylor series approximation
       H H
of f (θ , α , Σ) , around a point of θ i = θ for all i. It follows from (4) that

                 N
    θ a = θ + å λi (θ i − θ ) ,
                 i =1


where λi is the value of λi evaluated at the point of expansion. There are two special cases to
                                         H H
consider. First, suppose we evaluate f (θ , α , Σ) at a point where all weights are equal, all

variances are equal, and all covariances are equal. We find (see Appendix A):

                 1      N
        θa =
                 N
                        åθi .
                        i =1


That is, near the point of expansion, there is no aggregation bias. Alternatively, if we evaluate at

a point where the weights are not equal, but the variances of the innovations are equal and they

are perfectly correlated, we find

           N
    θ a = å αiθ i = θ .
          i =1


Again, there is no aggregation bias. In the data, the innovations in the xit are all highly

correlated with the innovations in the nominal exchange rate.


                                                     7
   In other words, aggregation bias is second order. Unless there are very large differences in

speeds of adjustment, large differences in innovation variances, big differences in weights, and

low correlation, aggregation bias will not be large.

   In the next section, we consider simulations to gauge the size of the aggregation bias.



3. Simulations

   We first examine aggregation bias in simple OLS simulations. An example of the type of

simulation we perform is: generate N AR(1) series with sample size T = 50, 100, 150, 200, 250,

300 and 500. The AR(1) coefficients in these series are drawn from a uniform distribution on the

range of 0.881 to 0.999 with mean θ = 0.94 . We note that if a series has an AR(1) coefficient of

0.94, its half life is 11.2 periods. We choose θ = 0.94 to match the baseline simulations in

IMRR.

   More precisely, the data generating processes is:

                                           xit = ς i + θ i xit −1 + ε it ,

with two different specifications:

   1. DGP1: ς i = 0 , θ i = θ + µi , θ = 0.94 , µi ~ i.i.d . uniform[−0.059, 0.059] ,

   2. DGP2: ς i ~ i.i.d . N (0,1) , θ i = θ + µi , θ = 0.94 , µi ~ i.i.d . uniform[−0.059, 0.059] .

Then average the N series and estimate an AR(1) on the average series. Let θ a be the

autoregressive coefficient for the average of the xit . To calibrate the aggregation bias per se, we

average the estimates of the θ i from the N series and compare it to the estimated θ a , which we

call θˆa . Each experiment is conducted with 2500 draws.

   These experiments are designed to meet the criterion of the theorem of Imbs et. al. (2003)

that guarantees that aggregation bias will make the autoregressive coefficient of the average

                                                         8
series greater than the average of the autoregressive coefficients from the individual series. That

is, each series is weighted equally in the average, the innovation variances are equal, and the

cross-correlations are all equal (set equal to zero.)

      Table 1 reports results with N = 100. We first direct attention to the column labeled “Bias

Uncorrected”. Perhaps surprisingly, the estimated AR(1) coefficient on the average price is

usually less than the mean θ from the individual series. There does not appear to be aggregation

bias unless we allow for a very long sample period. Otherwise, the bias goes the other direction.

      The reason for the downward bias is the familiar problem of small-sample bias. The small

sample bias trumps the aggregation bias unless the series is very long. (This matches the finding

of Choi, Mark, and Sul (2003) with similar simulations.)

      Next, we investigate if the number of individual price series affects our results. We thus

increase the number of AR(1) series from 100 to 500. Clearly, Table 2 indicates that the results

are similar even when we aggregate more individual series.

      We then consider a new DGP with higher persistence ( θ =0.98) and present the results in

Table 3. 3 The estimated coefficient on the average series is almost always less than 0.98.

      In Table 4, we examine how the degree of cross-sectional heterogeneity in persistence affects

the magnitude of aggregation bias. We set the number of sectors equal to 100, sample size equal

to 300, and θ =0.94. µi is assumed to be distributed uniformly in the ranges of [-0.009,0.009], [-

0.019,0.019], [-0.039,0.039] and the benchmark case: [-0.059,0.059]. Aggregation bias is larger

when the degree of heterogeneity is higher.

      In each table, we also attempt to separate out the effects of small-sample bias from

aggregation bias. There is no aggregation bias if θ i = θ for all i. So for each table, we redo all



3
    We need to assume   µi ~uniform[-0.019,0.019] to keep θ i <1.
                                                           9
simulations imposing θ i = θ for all i. Call this estimate θˆ . That gives us an estimate of the

small sample bias as simply θˆ − θ . We then subtract the small sample bias from our estimate of

θˆa (the autoregressive coefficient of the average series) to get our Bias Corrected estimate,

θˆbca = θˆ a − (θˆ − θ ) . We report these bias corrected estimates of the autoregressive coefficient in

columns 5-8 of each table. Comparing these to the true θ used to generate the data gives us a

measure of the aggregation bias that is unpolluted by small-sample bias.

   We find that there is some aggregation bias, but it is not nearly so dramatic as the simulations

of IMRR indicate. For example, consider our base simulations in Table 1. With θ = 0.94 ,

(implying a half-life of 11.2 months), we find that θˆbca ≅ 0.956 when the sample size is 250. This

implies a half-life of 15.4 months. In the empirical work of IMRR, the sample sizes closer to

150 months for most of the series. Then we find θˆbc
                                                  a
                                                     ≅ 0.952 , implying a half-life of 14.1

months. None of the simulations show a very large aggregation bias.

   Aggregation bias appears not to be a major problem in this case at least in part because we

know that the first-order serial correlation of the aggregated series is so large in the data. Since

the autocorrelations of the individual series are bounded above by one, we cannot observe a great

deal of heterogeneity among these correlations and still generate an aggregate with a serial

correlation of 0.94. The aggregation bias in this case is not large because there is not much

heterogeneity to be aggregated.

   Why do we find that aggregation bias is so small in our simulations (and almost always

dominated by small-sample bias) while the simulations in IMRR indicate a strikingly larger

aggregation bias? In generating the AR(1) random variables with a distribution of first-order

autoregressive coefficients, the simulations in the IMRR fail to put an upper bound of one on that

coefficient. That is, they use series that are explosive, which is an inappropriate representation

                                                   10
for the log of real exchange rates. (Granger (1980) states explosive roots are “generally

considered to be inappropriate for economic variables.”) The problem this causes is clear. For

example, if there is one series with a root of 1.08 (which is the upper bound in some of the

simulations in IMRR), and that runs for 100 observations, it will explode to such a degree that

when it is averaged in with the stationary and unit root series, it will completely dominate the

average. (1.08 to the 100th power equals around 2200.) The average will look a lot like an

AR(1) with a root of 1.08.



4. Data and Measurement Error

   In order to investigate the importance of parameter heterogeneity, we use relative prices of

goods at the sectoral level for 16 categories of goods for the United States and 9 European

countries: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and the

United Kingdom. Our monthly price data is obtained from Eurostat and is the data that was used

in Engel (2000), although we have updated the cleaned-up data to 1996:12 to match the IMRR

data set. The length of each series varies. The longest runs from 1981:1 to 1996:12 while the

shortest runs from 1981:1 to 1994:9. The nominal exchange rate data is collected from the

International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. A comprehensive description of data is

provided in Appendix C.

 Comparing our data set with what was used in IMRR, there are some issues worth noting:

First, an odd thing about the IMRR data set is that it is missing data on nominal exchange rates

from 1976-1991 or 1993 for six countries: Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and the

Netherlands. Simply by using a widely available source for exchange rates – the IFS database –

their data sample can be considerably enlarged. The IFS data on exchange rates is virtually

identical to the data IMRR use for those data points that are in both data sets. Second, our

                                                11
cleaned up price data only starts in 1981:1, while the IMRR uncorrected data starts in 1975:1.

However, that data has few observations before 1981:1; that is, there are mostly missing

observations from 1975:1-1980:12 in their uncorrected data.

   Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix D compare a few of the series used by IMRR with our cleaned

data. We follow Engel (2000) in cleaning the data. As the figures indicate, in many of the series

there are a very small number of observations that apparently have very large errors. Almost all

the data we use, and all the corrections, coincide with the data in Engel (2000). That paper (fn.

1, p. 1453) describes the data-cleaning process: “In cases where there were more than a few

errors in one series, the series was dropped. Hence, there is not data for all nine countries for all

of the goods. In cases where data entry errors were near the beginning or end of the series, the

series were truncated. In some cases, the data was corrected from other sources. In some cases

the entry error involved a transposition of digits which was corrected. In the remaining cases, the

data points were replaced using interpolation from adjacent data points. The total number of data

points used in the tables that are corrected data is 99 (out of a total of approximately 40,000 data

points.)”

   Measurement error will reduce the measured persistence of a stationary series if the

measurement error is less persistent than the series itself, assuming the measurement error is

uncorrelated with the true series. That is, let yt = qt + zt , where qt is the series whose

persistence we would like to measure, and zt is measurement error. If we measure persistence

by the first autocorrelation, then

    cov( yt , yt −1 ) cov(qt , qt −1 ) + cov( zt , zt −1 )
                     =                                     ,
      var( yt )           var(qt ) + var( zt )




                                                               12
                                                       cov(qt , qt −1 ) cov( zt , zt −1 )
assuming independence of qt and zt . But then, if                      >                  , we conclude that
                                                         var(qt )         var( zt )

                                                               cov( yt , yt −1 ) cov(qt , qt −1 )
the measured series is less persistent than the true series:                    <                 . On the
                                                                 var( yt )         var(qt )

other hand, the average price series will be plagued less by the bias introduced by measurement

error, if the measurement error is independent across prices (but innovations in prices are

correlated.)

   The data from IMRR plotted in Figures 1 and 2 (more plots are available from the authors on

request) appear to have very large, very transitory measurement error. In some cases, the

corrections made by Engel (2000) may smooth the data too much (when the bad data were

corrected by interpolation.) But the number of data points smoothed in this way – indeed, the

number of foul data points altogether – is small. It is unlikely that the cleaning process has much

of an effect in making the data appear more persistent than it is. But clearly the uncleaned data

could make the series appear much less persistent – even a small number of errors of the size

evident in Figure 1 and 2 can have a big impact on the estimates of the autoregressive

coefficients.



5. Empirical Estimates

5.a. Correcting small-sample bias

       Small sample bias will lead to underestimation of half-life of deviations from PPP.

Murray and Papell (2002a, 2002b, and 2003) address the problem of small sample bias in both

univariate time series and panel data. Applying the median-unbiased estimation methods

proposed by Andrews (1993) and Andrews and Chen (1994), they demonstrate that most recent

studies which report shorter half-lives than the consensus in long-horizon data or panel data

underestimate the half-lives of PPP deviations, and thus overestimate the speed of mean

                                                  13
reversion. Most of the unbiased point estimates of half-lives lie within the 3-5 year range and in

some cases, even longer. They conclude that “panels do not help solve the purchasing power

parity puzzle,” and “the purchasing power parity puzzle is worse than you think”.

   Cashin and McDermott (2003) also calculate the median-unbiased half-lives of parity

deviations in three different models, Dickey-Fuller regression, Augmented Dickey-Fuller

regression, and Phillips-Perron regression to investigate the real effective exchange rate for 22

industrial countries. Their findings come to the same conclusions as in Murray and Papell

(2002a, 2002b): after removing the downward bias of standard autoregressive estimators, the

cross-country average of half-lives of deviations from parity range between 4-15 years.

   Many different approaches have been suggested to correct for small sample bias. The first

one is the median-unbiased estimator proposed by Andrews (1993) and Andrews and Chen

(1994). Andrews (1993) shows how to obtain the exactly median-unbiased estimates and exact

confidence intervals of half-lives in a AR(1) model. For autoregressive model with higher order,

Andrews and Chen (1994) demonstrate how to perform approximately median-unbiased

estimation of AR coefficients. The efficiency of this method relies on the availability of the

known median function and precise distribution assumptions. Moreover, median function does

not work well if the true AR(1) coefficient is near unity, which is the case when studying PPP

since real exchange rates exhibit very high persistence.

 A second approach is mean-unbiased estimates, proposed by Kilian (1998). This method uses a

sample reuse procedure based on a bootstrap. The bias-corrected AR coefficients and confidence

intervals for impulse response function are obtained by using a bootstrap-after-bootstrap method.

Since Kilian’s bias-corrected percentile method is designed and motivated for stationary

autoregressions, it may perform worse when the process is near nonstationary.




                                                14
    A third approach relies on recursive demeaning procedures, which is introduced by So and

Shin (1999) and has be applied in Sul, Phillips and Choi (2003) and Choi, Mark and Sul (2003).

The idea of this method is that the recursive demeaning reduces the bias from the correlation

between residuals and the lagged dependent variables when fitting an intercept. The advantage of

this method over the other two methods mentioned above is that it is simple to apply. The

correction procedure only requires the sample mean to be replaced by the partial sample mean

(the average of data up to the time point) when conducting estimations. Since the approximately

median-unbiased estimators proposed by Andrews and Chen (1994) are computationally intense,

it is less feasible for our purpose to correct the small sample bias in a large panel data set with

number of group (N) being about 130. We will apply the second and third bias correction

methods (i.e. the Kilian (1998)’s method and So and Shin (1999)’s method) to correct the small

sample bias in the group mean estimations. The details of group mean estimators (random

coefficients model and mean group estimator) and the bias correcting procedures are presented in

Appendix B.

5.b. Empirical Results

      In this section, we present our empirical results of the random-coefficient (RCM) and mean-

group (MG) estimations under bias corrections. In order to compare with the estimates in IMRR,

we also conduct the estimations without bias correction. The half-lives are obtained from

impulse response functions and the 95% confidence intervals for the half-lives are calculated

using nonparametric bootstrap with 1000 replications. The orders of autoregression are chosen

to be 5 to match those repored in IMRR.4 Our estimation results are reported in Table 5.

      First, consider column (1), which contains the sum of AR coefficients, half-life, and 95%

confidence interval for the half-life in the bias-uncorrected RCM and MG estimations. The bias-


4
    Our persistence results are nearly identical when we use 4, 5, or 6 lags.

                                                            15
uncorrected estimates of MG estimator suggest a range of the half-lives around 25-26 months,

which is below Rogoff’s 36 to 60 months consensus. The half-life estimates from RCM model,

however, are very close to the consensus.

    We note that we are able to replicate IMRR empirical results using their uncorrected data set

quite closely. Our point estimates of the sums of the autoregressive parameters are very similar.

In the RCM model, our point estimate is 0.9311, which compares to a point estimate of 0.9481

reported in IMRR for the RCM estimator. We find a half-life of 12 months compared to

IMMR’s 14 months. So, though our dataset has dropped a few of the prices used in IMRR, when

we use the uncorrected data, we find the very low half-lives that they do. (Indeed our data

exhibit slightly shorter half-lives.) But these short half-lives disappear entirely when we use the

corrected data.5

    As mentioned above, these GLS weighted/simple weighted least squares estimators of AR

coefficients are underestimated because of downward small sample bias. We now report the

bias-corrected estimates using the correcting procedure suggested by Kilian (1998) and So and

Shin (1999) in columns (2) and (3). The results in column (2) or (3) suggest that correcting the

small sample bias raise the point estimates of the half-lives in both RCM and MG estimations.

They are well above 3 years. When So and Shin’s (1999) method is used, the half-life estimates

of PPP deviations are about 17 years for RCM and are about 13 years for MG. These results are

consistent with a much slower rate of convergence to PPP as found in Murray and Papell (2002b)

and Choi, Mark and Sul (2003).

5.c. Country-by-country study




5
  Our longer half-lives are coming both because we correct the data errors, and because we supply the missing
exchange rate data. With our exchange rates, but the uncorrected price data, we find the sum of the AR coefficients
to be .9662, and a half-life of 21 months.

                                                        16
   It may not be appropriate to do panel estimates across countries if the main concern is the

magnitude of aggregation bias. Aggregation bias means that aggregating the goods into

aggregated price indices causes a bias in estimates of the speed of adjustment of the real

exchange rate when the individual goods adjust at different speeds. However, the other well-

known problem in panel estimations is that estimating in a panel a single mean speed of

adjustment for different countries may cause bias as well. A panel study across countries mixes

the two problems, which means that we really cannot tell how much of the problem comes from

the price indexes aggregation versus the problem arising from imposing the same mean speed of

adjustment for each country. To concentrate on the aggregation problem, we investigate the

country-by-country estimates of the bias-corrected speed of adjustment of real exchange rates in

both aggregated and disaggregated level. We can then measure the aggregation bias more

precisely than a cross-country panel study. The results are presented in Table 6. Here we report

the results after correcting small sample bias by So and Shin (1999)’s method with 5 lags. Using

Kilian (1998)'s method and different lag lengths gives us similar results.

 The first two columns are results using aggregated data. Column 1 (AGG-CPI) simply uses

consumer price index (CPI) data while column 2 (AGG-TCPI) contains the results from equally

weighted aggregation of our cross-sectional price data. There is only a slight difference between

the point estimates of persistence from different measures of aggregation. Columns 3 and 4 use

disaggregated price data with MG estimation (column 3) and RCM estimation (column 4).

Clearly, by comparing columns 1 and 2 with columns 3 and 4, it can be found that aggregation

bias is small in most countries. Furthermore, in the case of the RCM estimator, there is no

aggregation bias, no matter which method of aggregation is used (AGG-CPI vs. AGG-TCPI).




                                                17
6. Concluding Remarks

    According to Rogoff (1996), the consensus of empirical studies is that half-life deviations

from purchasing power parity are between 3 and 5 years. The documented low convergence

speed in real exchange rates induces a purchasing power puzzle since the half-lives of PPP

deviations seem too long to be justified by models with nominal rigidities.

  IMRR (2002) demonstrate the importance of the role of heterogeneity and aggregation bias in

explaining the PPP puzzle. Based on 2-digit sub-sectional price data from 19 categories of goods

and 13 countries, they find much faster mean reversion of the real exchange rate than the

consensus view. They claim that considering aggregation bias solves the PPP puzzle.

  In this paper, we have re-examined the claim in IMRR. We investigate the same data set in

IMRR with corrections of a few entry errors in the data and additions of the missing nominal

exchange rate data in their study. Using the cleaned data set, we find half-life estimates in line

with Rogoff’s consensus. Further, using two different bias-correcting methods proposed by

Kilian (1998) and So and Shin (1999), we find that the point estimates of half-life deviations

from PPP are even higher than Rogoff’s consensus. We cast doubt on the claim that aggregation

bias can account for the PPP puzzle.

  Moreover, we argue based on theory and simulations, that aggregation bias is unlikely to be

large.

  The finding that aggregation bias is not large should be no surprise to readers of the literature.

Engel (2000) uses the same data source as IMRR (but with cleaned data) and concludes that for

most goods adjustment is slow. That paper concludes, “for most categories of goods, there is not

even evidence that deviations from the law of one price tend to be eliminated.” This is also

similar to the conclusion reached by Rogers and Jenkins (1995), examining the behavior of

relative prices between the U.S. and Canada for a long list of narrowly defined goods. In very

                                                 18
few cases could they even reject the null of a unit root in the deviations from the law of one

price. Crucini and Shintani (2002), using a large worldwide cross-section of goods prices from

the Economics Intelligence Unit, do find rapid convergence to deviations from the law of one

price (half-lives of 9 to 12 months.) But they explicitly find no aggregation bias. The rate of

convergence of the average of their prices is very similar to the average of the rates of

convergence of their individual prices.

 Aggregation bias does not seem to explain the PPP puzzle.

For Tables 1-4: The “Bias Corrected” for AGG (columns 5 and 7) is computed as (1) column 1 +
small sample bias and (2) column 3 + small sample bias. The small sample bias is obtained as

(2) aggregating these series; (3) estimating the aggregated series; (4) small sample bias is the
difference between the estimate of θ and the true θ .

APPENDIX A
1. Derivation of Equation (4):6

Equation (A1) and (A2) represent our model:

(A1) xit = θ i xit −1 + ε it , E (ε it ) = 0 , E (ε it2 ) = σ i2 , E (ε it ε jt ) = σ ij ,

                N             N
(A2) q t = å α i xit ,        åα     i   = 1.
               i =1           i =1

The least square estimate of the persistence of qt is given by θ a :

         Cov(qt , qt −1 )
θa =                      ,
          Var (qt )

(A3) Cov(qt , qt −1 ) = å êθ iα i         + å   (θ   + θ   )α   α                ú,

                        i =1 ê
                             ë

and

                  N é                                σ ij ù
                           σ i2         N
(A4) Var (qt ) = å êα i2           + 2 å    α  α              ú.
                           − θ   2
                                                    − θ   θ
                                              i j

                      ë  1      i      j >i       1     i   j úû

Hence, it follows that:

    The derivation follows that of Imbs. et. al. (2003), allowing for different weights in the price index.

Thus, take a first-order Taylor series approximation around a point of θ i = θ for all i :

                i =1




Where we use the fact that

B.2 Bias Correcting Methods


B.2.1 Kilian (1998)

Given a covariance stationary AR(p) process,

                                     yt = α + β 1 y t −1 + β 2 y t − 2 + L + β p y t − p + u t ,

where u t ~ i.i.d . (0, Σ u ) .

                                                           ˆ = vec( βˆ1 , βˆ 2 ,L βˆ p ) . Generate
Step 1a: Estimate the AR(p) model and obtain the estimates Β

1000 bootstrap replications Β̂ * from

                              yt* = αˆ + βˆ1 y t*−1 + βˆ 2 y t*− 2 + L + βˆ p y t*− p + u t* ,     (*)

using standard nonparametric bootstrap procedures. Then approximate the bias term

Ψ = E (Βˆ − Β) by Ψ * = E * (Βˆ * − Β                                     ˆ =Β
                                    ˆ ) ; this suggests the bias estimate Ψ  ˆ * − Βˆ

Step 1b: Calculate the modulus of the largest root of the companion matrix associated with Β̂ as
                            ~ ˆ
m(Βˆ ) . If m(Β
              ˆ ) ≥ 1 , set Β            ˆ ) < 1 , construct the bias-corrected coefficient estimate
                              = Β . If m(Β

~                 ~
         ˆ . Plug Β                  ~            ˆ =Ψ                    ˆ =δ Ψ
                                                     ˆ and δ = 1 . Define Ψ       ˆ and
Β = Βˆ − Ψ          into m(⋅) . If m(Β) ≥ 1 , let Ψ1        1              i +1 i  i


                          ~ ~                        ~                                  ~
                                                                ˆ , i = 1, 2,…, until m(Β
δ i +1 = δ i − 0.01 . Set Β = Β i after iterating on Β i = Βˆ − Ψi                        i ) < 1.


                    ~
Step 2a: Substitute Β for Β̂ in equation (*) and generate 2000 new bootstrap replications Β̂ *

using standard nonparametric bootstrap procedures. In order to reduce the computational



                                                                  30
requirements, we follow Kilian’s (1998) suggestion that use the first-stage bias estimate Ψ̂ as a

proxy for Ψ̂ * .
                   ~
Step 2b: Calculate Β * from Β̂ * and Ψ̂ * , following the same procedures in step 1b with obvious

changes in notation.

Step 3: Calculate the 25 and 75 percentile interval endpoints of the distribution of impulse

response function.


B.2.2 So and Shin (1999)

Consider the following simple AR(1) model as an example, the extension to higher order AR(p)

model is straightforward. Assume

                                         y t = α + ρy t −1 + u t ,

the bias-corrected estimate of ρ by recursive demeaning method proposed by So and Shin

(1999) is given by

                                         å

                                                                                       ,
                                              åt =2 ( yt −1 − yt −1 ) 2
                                                    T




where

                                                          1 t −1
                                          yt −1 =            å ys .
