                                           ABSTRACT




Many art critics and scholars argue that art markets are irrational, and that there is no correlation
between prices and artistic importance. This paper identifies all living artists who have executed at
least one work that has sold at auction for at least $1 million, and ranks them both by the highest
price for which any of their works have sold, and by the number of times their works have sold for
$1 million or more. These rankings show that the most valuable art is made by the greatest artists:
the leaders in these tables, including Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman, Robert Rauschenberg, Gerhard
Richter, and Jeff Koons, are clearly among the most important artists alive today. This study also
underscores the fact that the most important art of the past 50 years has overwhelmingly been made
by young geniuses who have made radical conceptual innovations at early ages.

The Value of Art Prices

               There is a good correlation between what is considered great art
               and what is expensive art... The artists who are respected and
               thought important, whose work is most esteemed for its innovation
               and beauty, become the most expensive.
                                              Peter Watson, 19921

       Many scholars categorically deny that art prices have any value as an indicator of genuine

artistic importance. A recent example of this attitude was provided by Richard Benson, the dean

of the Yale University School of Art, who told the New York Times that “We don’t consider

success in the marketplace has anything to do with being a successful artist.”2 Many critics share

Benson’s Olympian disdain for market outcomes. So for example Robert Hughes of Time once

declared that “the price of a work of art is an index of pure irrational desire.”3

       Yet art prices have not been universally rejected by either scholars or critics. Some

scholars have recognized that the value of works of art inevitably affects how they are perceived.

Thus for example the eminent art historian Meyer Schapiro observed that “the enormous

importance given to a work of art as a precious object which is advertised and known in

connection with its price is bound to affect the consciousness of our culture.”4 Even more

narrowly there is a significant tradition in which critics and other observers of trends in modern

art have cited prices as evidence of artistic success, particularly in support of new challenges to

the entrenched artistic establishment. So for example one of the first champions of the

Impressionists, the critic Théodore Duret, argued in a famous early defense of their work in 1878

that its success in the market was a sign of its importance: “Because it is necessary that the public

who laughs so loudly over the Impressionists should be even more astonished! - this painting

sells.”5 In 1940 Virginia Woolf equally used prices as indicators of importance. Thus in her
                                                    4

biography of Roger Fry she wrote of the pain he had suffered when the Post-Impressionist

exhibition he presented in London in 1910 was so widely ridiculed, but she concluded that

“Time... vindicated Roger Fry, if money is any test. Shares in Cézanne have risen immeasurably

since 1910. That family, who... accumulated works by Matisse must today be envied even by

millionaires.”6 More recently, in1989 the critic Peter Schjeldahl conceded that “I must admit that

the artistic judgment of current big bucks is better than the average among, say, critics. (Like the

prospect of being hanged, shelling out millions may concentrate the mind wonderfully.)”7 And in

the same year, the former Director of the Tate Gallery, Sir Alan Bowness, explained that it is

only the most important artists whose work attains the highest prices: “It is only the museum

artists whose work begins to rise to exceptional prices.”8

        It is hardly surprising that many artists pay close attention to the market for their work,

for a number of reasons. Auction outcomes directly affect artists’ reputations. Elizabeth Murray

acknowledged this in a recent interview: “Somebody told me once, when the auctions started to

be a big deal, ‘You’re never going to be anywhere until one of your paintings goes for over

$500K.’ I’m beginning to think there’s something to that at this point, it’s so much about

money.”9 Jeff Koons made a similar point more emphatically, telling a critic that his concern for

the price of his work did not stem from greed, but rather from his concern for its reception:

“What I’m saying is that the seriousness with which a work of art is taken is interrelated to the

value that it has. The market is the greatest critic.”10

        This paper will use auction prices to identify the most important artists alive today.

Together with scholars’ assessments, this evidence will also serve as the basis for a systematic

assessment of the careers of these most important living artists. The analysis carried out here will
                                                  5

yield important new insights into the achievements of leading contemporary artists, and the

sources of their success. It can also point to some common patterns of these artists’ training and

their rise to artistic importance.

Price Lists

                Lists seem trivial, but in fact they are crucial symptomatic indices
                of underlying struggles over taste, evaluation and the construction
                of a canon.
                                                 Peter Wollen, 200211

        Table 1 presents an alphabetical listing of every living artist who has had at least one

work sell at auction for at least $1 million.12 The table has 39 entries. For present purposes, these

artists will be ranked in two ways. Table 2 ranks them by the single highest price for which any

of their works has sold at auction.13 Table 3 then ranks them by the number of times their works

have sold at auction for at least $1 million.

        Before examining these lists, it is worth noting that these rankings based on the most

valuable works will be used in preference to other possible rankings, including the total value all

of an artist’s works have generated at auction. The reason for this is the concern here with artistic

importance. Greatness in art depends not on quantity but on quality. The greatest artists are

obviously not those who produce the most works, or even those who produce the most good

works, but rather those who produce the work of the greatest importance. Some great artists have

been extremely productive, but others have left only a handful of works. Two twentieth-century

artists clearly illustrate the extremes: Pablo Picasso was among the most prolific of modern

artists, while Marcel Duchamp created a very small body of work, but Picasso and Duchamp may

have been the two most important artists of the past century. Because of the irrelevance of the
                                                  6

volume of work an artist produces for his or her importance, the rankings here concentrate on the

most important works.

       The rankings of Table 2 and 3 are not identical, but they are broadly similar. The top 10

artists in Table 2 are all among the top 17 in Table 3, and the top 11 in Table 3 are all among the

top 17 in Table 2. Thus in general it is the artists whose work has sold for the very highest prices

who have also had the most works sell for more than $1 million. Perhaps the most striking

difference between the two rankings occurs for Gerhard Richter, who ranks a respectable seventh

in Table 2, but stands alone at the top of Table 3 by a large margin over Jasper Johns. The large

number of Richter’s paintings that have sold for very high prices is a significant fact that will be

considered in analyzing his position in contemporary art.

Does the Market Work?

               Perhaps the importance that we must attach to the achievement of
               an artist or a group of artists may properly be measured by the
               answer to the following question: Have they so wrought that it will
               be impossible henceforth, for those who follow, ever again to act
               as if they had not existed?
                                                Walter Sickert, 191014

       Before proceeding to more detailed analysis of the evidence presented in Tables 2 and 3,

it is useful to consider the reliability of these data for our purposes. Does the art market work?

Do the highest prices attach to the work of the “museum artists,” as Alan Bowness would have it,

or is the auction market so irrational that its outcomes bear no relation to the importance of

particular artists or their work, as Richard Benson and Robert Hughes appear to believe?

       As Walter Sickert recognized, importance in art is determined by influence: the most

important artists are those whose influence is greatest, and thus those whose successors cannot
                                                  7

“act as if they had not existed.” Does the auction market identify these artists: are the artists who

stand at the top of Tables 2 and 3 those whose work has had the greatest impact on their

successors?

       Even a brief survey can suffice to indicate the answer to these questions. Jasper Johns

ranks first in Table 2 and second in Table 3. His work is widely recognized as having played a

key role in producing a shift from the gestural abstraction that dominated advanced art during

most of the 1950s to the Pop art and Minimalism that would come to dominate the 1960s. So for

example looking back from late in the 1990s, Arthur Danto reflected that Johns’ early work

“opened up the present in which we all exist artistically.”15 One of the leading textbooks of

modern art recently observed that “The formal innovations of Jasper Johns had an even more far-

reaching influence than Rauschenberg’s in bringing on the radical new objective art of the

sixties.”16 It is not an accident that Johns is juxtaposed with Rauschenberg, for in different ways

both of them were responsible for overthrowing the visual art of Abstract Expressionism and

replacing it with a more conceptual approach that descended from Duchamp. Perhaps the most

distinctive element of Rauschenberg’s contribution was his invention of the “combine,” in which

the use of real objects reduced the role of painting, and thus contributed to the proliferation of

hybrid genres of art during the 1960s and beyond. It was in recognition of this trend toward

mixtures of different artistic media that Leo Steinberg observed that “on the New York art scene

the great shift came in Rauschenberg’s work of the early 1950s,” and that Arthur Danto would

write in 1997 that “the artistic mainstream today is very largely Rauschenbergian.”17

       Gerhard Richter’s place at the top of Table 3 reflects his importance in producing a partial

counterbalance to the influence of Rauschenberg. In some respects Richter’s role parallels that of
                                                 8

Andy Warhol, for during the 1960s both pioneered new approaches to painting, based on

photography, that appealed to younger artists who did not want to abandon that traditional

medium.18 Like Warhol and other Pop artists, Richter and his friend Sigmar Polke developed

styles of painting that avoided what many of their contemporaries considered the excessive

emotional and philosophical claims of Abstract Expressionism, and pointed toward more ironic

and emotionally detached images. In the process, they became models for younger painters in

both Europe and the US who created a revival in painting during the 1980s. Looking back from

the vantage point of 1990, Peter Schjeldahl declared that “the four absolutely best artists, by my

own and many other people’s lights, to have emerged internationally since the ‘70s - Sigmar

Polke, Gerhard Richter, and Anselm Kiefer, along with the late Joseph Beuys - are German.”19

       Bruce Nauman, who ranks second in Table 2, was a leader of the cohort that followed

that of Johns and Richter. Nauman’s highly conceptual approach to art produced contributions in

a wide variety of media. In 1990, Schjeldahl summarized his role: “Now 48, a dominant figure in

the generation of post-minimalism and vastly influential in Europe, he is a maverick who at one

time or another has affected the course of just about every visual medium except painting,

earning a prestige among serious younger artists like that of no one else since Jasper Johns.”20

Eight years later, the English critic Richard Cork testified to Nauman’s continuing role, noting

that “Nauman has influenced younger artists in all kinds of ways. Damien Hirst and Rachel

Whiteread are only the most prominent of the British practitioners to owe him debts.”21

       From the next cohort, Jeff Koons ranks prominently in both Tables 2 and 3. Koons is

perhaps the most controversial and flamboyant American artist since Warhol. He has just turned

50, and art historians have not fully charted his role in contemporary art. Some critics have
                                                  9

weighed in, however. Thus in 1988 Schjeldahl declared that Koons “may be the definitive artist

of this moment.”22 Sixteen years later, Arthur Danto observed that “It is widely acknowledged

that Jeff Koons is among the most important artists of the last decades of the twentieth

century.”23

        This discussion could be extended to more of the artists who figure prominently in Tables

2 and 3, situating them within what Bowness called the “chronological sequence of [museum]

artists, carrying forward an argument which forms the material of modern art.”24 This would

include recent views of Lucian Freud as a precursor of the Neo-Expressionist painting of the

1980s, of Cy Twombly as an inspiration for Neo-Expressionism and Graffiti art, and of Frank

Stella as a key link between Jasper Johns and Minimalism.25 Yet for present purposes it seems

unnecessary to extend this discussion. For examination of Tables 2 and 3 establishes beyond any

reasonable doubt that the auction market has assigned its highest values to those artists who have

been leaders of their generations. Sir Alan Bowness clearly understood this, noting that it is the

rarity of these key artists “that accounts for the phenomenal prices achieved today in the auction

houses.”26 But it is difficult to see how even Richard Benson or Robert Hughes could deny that

Johns, Rauschenberg, Richter, Nauman, Koons, and the other artists who head Tables 2 and 3 are

the most influential artists alive today.

Creative Careers

                Each stylistic portion of an artist’s total time span constitutes a
                separate sum of artifacts, and this is recognized by the art market in
                the values it places upon certain “periods” of an artist’s work in
                contrast to others.
                                                Harold Rosenberg, 197427

        Recent research has shown that there is a consistent relationship between an artist’s
                                                  10

methods and goals and the stage of his career in which he produces his most important work. To

provide a basis for examining this relationship for the artists considered in this study, Table 4

shows the ages of the artists when they executed the works listed in Table 2.

       The ages in Table 4 cover virtually the entire adult life span, ranging from a minimum of

23 (Stella) to a maximum of 73 (Bourgeois). Yet their distribution is far from uniform, as young

ages appear much more frequently than older ones. The median age in Table 4 is 34. More than

three-fifths of these highest-priced works were produced by artists below the age of 40; less than

one-fifth were made at 50 or above. The median age of the top 10 artists when they made their

highest-priced works was just 32.5; the top two - Johns and Nauman - were both in their 20s

when they made the works that would later sell for millions of dollars.

       The youth of many of these top artists when they produced their best work is not merely

an artifact of the auction market, but is confirmed by the judgments of art scholars. Six of the top

artists in Table 4 have entries below the age of 35. For these six artists, Table 5 presents their

ages in the single year from which their work was found to be most often illustrated in a search

of 13 art history textbooks published since 2000.28 The evidence of the textbooks yields ages very

similar to the auction results: for three of the six artists the two sources produce the same age,

and the median of the six ages from the textbooks, of 30, is virtually the same as the median of

29.5 obtained from the auction outcomes. Art scholars thus agree with collectors that many of

our greatest living artists have peaked at very early ages. Understanding why is critical for

understanding contemporary art.

Conceptual Innovation

               We are living in a conceptual art world.
                                             Arthur Danto, 200129

       The preponderance in Table 2 of works made by young artists is a consequence of the fact

that from the late 1950s to the present advanced art has been dominated by conceptual

innovation.30 The artists who stand at the top of Tables 2 and 3 include some of those most

responsible for the transition to this conceptual era, as well as many of their most important

successors who have sustained it.

       During the late 1940s and most of the 1950s, the leading artists worked experimentally,

by trial and error, as they proceeded in the pursuit of images they judged visually. For Jackson

Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and their friends in New York, as for Pierre

Soulages, Hans Hartung, Nicolas de Staël, and their colleagues in Paris, art was created not in the

mind but on the canvas: “One begins with a mark, another mark, a third mark - a splash, a

smudge, a drip - until the whole work energetically completes itself and the artist can then see

what has been achieved.” Gestures and actions were privileged over ideas, for “hand and eye

were everything, and for those who can remember that era, the intellect could hardly have been

more suspect.”31

       In the late 1950s an abrupt change occurred. The turning point is often considered to have

been Jasper Johns’ first one-man exhibition at Leo Castelli’s gallery in 1958. There Johns

presented paintings of flags and targets that “invalidated the aesthetic - or part of the aesthetic -

of the most esteemed members of the advanced painting culture of the time... [I]t signaled the

end of an era.”32 Ever since Johns’ show, most leading artists have worked conceptually,
                                                  12

carefully planning their works prior to making them, in order to express ideas they had

formulated in advance. Preconception is so central to this art that Roy Lichtenstein, whose

cartoon images might have seemed to have little in common with Frank Stella’s early paintings

of black stripes, could remark in 1965 that a primary concern of his art was “the same kind of

thing that you find in Stella... that before you start painting the painting, you know exactly what

it’s going to look like.”33 In fact, because for many of these artists “all of the planning and

decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair,” a number of them could

delegate the production of their works to assistants or other artisans, and a series of major artists,

from Warhol and LeWitt to Koons and Hirst, have executed little of their own work.34

       With the transition from an experimental to a conceptual art, the currency of the advanced

art world shifted from the creation of striking images to the presentation of arresting ideas. This

change in product implied an equally radical change in methods of production, and consequently

in the gestation period of artistic innovation. The trademark images of the Abstract

Expressionists and Tachistes developed over the course of years, and often decades, of

experimentation, as the artists gradually explored the visual properties of their materials and their

own actions. Experience was necessary for mastery of their art. In contrast, the novel ideas of

their conceptual successors were typically formulated quickly, in momentary flashes of

inspiration. And the most radical new ideas were usually produced by artists who had not been

active long enough to become constrained by fixed habits of thought, and who could therefore

break away from conventions that more experienced artists automatically followed. Inexperience

consequently became a key ingredient for significant innovation in this conceptual era. For the

contributions that constituted the landmarks of contemporary art, the wise old master was
                                                  13

suddenly replaced by the brash young genius.

       The careers of important conceptual innovators are normally marked by a major early

contribution. In many cases, the artist’s work deteriorates thereafter, as he either repeats the early

innovation or fails in attempts to produce others. In some cases however, conceptual innovators

go on to make other significant innovations. These are generally less important than their first

contribution, because they are usually more circumscribed by the artist’s accumulating

experience, but in any case they are likely to be very different from it, for the key to generating

new ideas is to tackle problems so different that the artist is forced to use new approaches. The

more radically the artist changes problems, the greater the chance to make an important new

contribution. The careers of conceptual innovators are therefore usually marked by precocity, and

those of great conceptual innovators are also often marked by diversity.

Young Geniuses and Old Masters

               Falloffs in the later work of major artists are so far from unusual as
               to be the rule in our mercurial culture.
                                              Peter Schjeldahl, 200535

       How do the theoretical schemes described above relate to the careers of the artists

considered in this study? Understanding this requires examination of the artists individually.

Space does not allow this for all 39 artists, but this section will consider the careers of eight of

the artists identified as the most important. These will be the seven highest-ranked artists in

Table 4, as well as the youngest artist who ranks in the top 20 in that table. In each case, the

analysis will consider the relationship between the particular artist’s most influential

contribution, or contributions, and his age when he executed the relevant work.

       As noted earlier, Jasper Johns was a central figure in the transition from the experimental
                                                 14

art of Abstract Expressionism to the conceptual approaches of Pop and Minimalism. Johns’ most

important works were those he made during the late 1950s. Of the 38 illustrations of his work

included in the 13 recent textbooks referred to above, 10 were of paintings he made in 1955, four

each were of works from 1958 and 1959, and another five were of works from 1960. Thus more

than 60% of his illustrations are of work he produced by the age of 30, and no single later year

was represented by more than two illustrations. Johns’ paintings of flags and targets were the

result of a radical new idea formulated early in the career of a conceptual innovator.

        Johns explained that he chose to paint the flag “because I didn’t have to design it. So I

went on to similar things like the targets - things the mind already knows.”36 And as Leo

Steinberg pointed out, it was the way Johns painted these objects that eliminated the need for

decisions: “Since they tend to constitute the whole subject of a particular work, Johns’s objects,

systems, or signs predetermined the picture’s shape and dimensions.”37 The clarity of Johns’

conceptual contributions meant that his innovations were immediately available to other artists.

So for example as a senior in college Frank Stella saw Johns’ 1958 show, was intrigued by “ the

idea of stripes... the idea of repetition,” and during he next year made his own paintings of

stripes. Exhibited at Castelli’s gallery in 1960, these Black paintings remain the most important

work the conceptual Stella has made in his long career; one of them places him among the top

ten artists in Table 2.38

        During the 1960s many young artists turned away from painting, and Bruce Nauman

became a leader in the use of other genres. As Schjeldahl observed in 1982, “Artists in the late

1960s were optimistic about the aesthetic potential of technologies and systems, and Nauman

played with most of them - video, film, photography, light, sound, language, mathematics,
                                                  15

holography, and more - to memorable effect.”39 Nauman’s extremely diverse body of work is

considered to have influenced a series of younger artists in a wide variety of ways; these artists

include such prominent figures as Rachel Whiteread, Jenny Holzer, Matthew Barney, Kiki Smith,

Cindy Sherman, Vito Acconci, Tracey Emin, and Sarah Lucas.40 And Nauman’s most important

innovations tended to cluster early in his career; more than half of the illustrations of his art in

the textbooks surveyed for this study were of works he made between the ages of 24 and 27.

       There is a common thread in Nauman’s work, in that he has persistently used his own

body and its actions as his subject.41 Yet from the beginning of his career, Nauman used the

history of art as the direct inspiration for his ideas. Kathry Hixson listed a few examples: “Many

of Nauman’s works could be interpreted as homages to Jasper Johns’s sign-paintings, Joseph

Beuys’s fat corners, Marcel Duchamp’s fountain, Michael Heizer’s masculine earth-movings, or

Dan Flavin’s fluorescent light tubes.”42 After seeing a retrospective exhibition, Schjeldahl

observed that “Nauman was never not Nauman... [H]e has made only ‘mature’ work.”43 This is

not surprising, for Nauman’s art has never been based on observation and analysis of the outside

world, or on the gradual development of techniques, but rather on the sudden production of new

ideas inspired by art history, filtered through the prism of introspection about his own body and

its immediate environs.

       Lucian Freud is the lone experimental artist among the eight considered in this section.

His art requires observation: “I could never put anything into a picture that wasn’t actually there

in front of me. That would be a pointless lie, a mere bit of artfulness.” He considers his art a

search for an elusive goal, but recognizes that because this goal is unattainable, what is most

important is the process of the search:

                A moment of complete happiness never occurs in the creation of a
                work of art. The promise of it is felt in the act of creation but
                disappears towards the completion of the work. For it is then that
                the painter realizes that it is only a picture he is painting. Until then
                he had almost dared to hope that the picture might spring to life.
                Were it not for this, the perfect painting might be painted, on the
                completion of which the painter could retire. It is this great
                insufficiency that drives him on. Thus the process of creation
                becomes necessary to the painter perhaps more than it is in the
                picture. The process is in fact habit-forming.44

Freud’s avoidance of preconception is such that he not only makes no preliminary studies for his

paintings, but he does not even lay out the whole figure of the subject on his canvas as he begins

to paint: “I’d rather it ran off the edges than have to cramp the forms.”45 Freud paints only people

he knows well, for he wants his “portraits to be of the people, not like them. Not having the look

of the sitter, being them.”46

        As Table 6 shows, Freud is the only one of the eight artists considered here who made the

majority of his highest-priced works after the age of 50. Freud’s method evolved over time. John

Russell reported that “whereas in earlier days Freud never over painted, he will now take the

image out and start all over, time and time again, till it has the inevitable look that he wants.”47

The power of Freud’s work has grown over time, for its strength lies in the progressive rejection

of artifice that occurred as the artist gained confidence in his ability to portray people without

stylization or pretense. His late work is both his most expressive and his most disconcerting, for

as Freud observed, “the task of the artist is to make the human being uncomfortable.”48

        Leo Steinberg quoted Jasper Johns as saying that Robert Rauschenberg was “the man

who in this century had invented the most since Picasso.”49 Early in his career, Rauschenberg

produced a large number of innovations, all the embodiment of new ideas, and most of which
                                                  17

crossed the boundaries of traditional artistic genres. In a famous statement, Rauschenberg

declared: “Painting relates to both art and life. Neither can be made. I try to act in that gap

between the two.”50 Rauschenberg’s versatility meant that his influence spread widely. An early

example is the white paintings he made as a student at Black Mountain College in 1951, which

comprised a series of white panels. After seeing the white paintings the composer John Cage

wrote his famous 4'
                  33", in which a pianist sat in front of an audience for that length of time,

without playing a single note. What would prove to be one of Rauschenberg’s minor innovations

had thus inspired a work that a recent survey of modern American music described as a

“landmark” that “requested a new attitude toward listening, and toward the concept of music

itself.”51

         Rebus, Rauschenberg’s entry in Table 4, was a 1955 painting that contained a variety of

collage elements. During that year Rauschenberg attached more and more real objects to his

canvases, until the works became three-dimensional and often free-standing, prompting to give

them a new name, of “combine.” As Table 7 shows, several of these are among the most

celebrated works by living artists, as Bed and Monogram are two of the five works by the 39

artists studied in this paper that appear most often in the art history textbooks surveyed.

Rauschenberg made Rebus, Bed, and Monogram before he turned 35, and he made all 14 of his

works represented in Table 3 before the age of 40. Although Rauschenberg has continued to

make large amounts of art throughout his long career, his significant contributions were made

early. As the English critic Richard Cork wrote in 1981, “No enfant was more terrible than

Rauschenberg in his heyday, but the trouble is that even the most precocious child has to grow

up.”52 Like his friend Jasper Johns, during the 1960s Rauschenberg was surpassed by a new
                                                18

generation of young and iconoclastic innovators, who used his innovations for their own ends.

       Cy Twombly was a less radical innovator than his contemporaries Johns and

Rauschenberg, and his art developed more gradually. He is nonetheless a conceptual artist, whose

trademark style is a synthesis of the art of a number of his predecessors. Twombly’s most

distinctive work began after he settled in Rome in the late 1950s, as he blended the gestural touch

of Abstract Expressionism with marks adapted from the work of Jean Dubuffet and Alberto Burri

to make images that are often considered as forms of writing or calligraphy.53

       Twombly’s influence on other artists was less widespread than that of Johns and

Rauschenberg, and its impact was less sudden than theirs. But over time a number of younger

painters, both in Europe and the US, were influenced by his blending of primitive images with

sophisticated handling of color. So for example in 1962 the young artists Sigmar Polke and

Gerhard Richter incorporated a number of Twombly’s devices into their early development of a

German version of Pop art.54

       Jeff Koons is a conceptual innovator who is often placed in a line of descent that includes

Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol.55 His art is based on ideas and images he draws from a

series of earlier artists, including Duchamp, the Surrealists René Magritte and Salvador Dali,

Man Ray, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, and the Pop artists Roy Lichtenstein and James

Rosenquist, as well as from magazines and billboards.56 Koons produces his work systematically.

In making paintings, for example, he begins by using a computer to create composites from

photographs he has cut from magazines and books. “After I have an image on a computer file

that I like, we make a digital slide. And then the slide is projected and we draw out the image on

the canvas.”57 A staff of assistants then executes the painting according to Koons’ instructions. In
                                                 19

1999, while rushing to meet a deadline for an exhibition at the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin,

Koons had a total of 47 artists working on a series of paintings, each more than 12 square meters

in size: “There were a lot of people mixing color. And we had two different shifts, so the studio

was going twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, always with half the staff there working

to complete the paintings.”58

       Arthur Danto has argued that Koons’ most important contribution is his creation of

objects that, in Koons’ language, have “the sense of ready-made inherent in them.” These are the

statues that resemble the cheap kitsch objects sold at gift shops and souvenir stands, but that are

in fact made by highly skilled craftsmen from original designs created by Koons. By designing

objects that might have been ready-mades but were in fact drawn from his own imagination,

Koons created “commonplace kinds of objects reimagined as surrealistic presences.”59 Both his

work and the public image he has created have been seen as influences on a number of younger

artists.60 So for example not only did Koons influence Damien Hirst in making his famous steel

and glass cases, but Hirst also explained that he admired Koons for deliberately constructing

“Jeff Koons, the Artist.”61 Another young British artist, Sarah Lucas, was influenced by Koons’

sexually explicit sculptures and photographs; her sculpture, Woman in a Tub, paid tribute to

Koons not only in its subject matter but by using the same title he had used earlier.62 Koons’

conceptual approach to art is reflected both in his eagerness to present works that have outraged

many in the art world, whether for their aesthetic qualities or their sexual explicitness, and in the

image he has carefully cultivated of the artist as a brash young iconoclast.

       Since the early 1960s, Gerhard Richter has used photographs as the basis for many of his

paintings. He explained that this reduced the number of decisions he had to make: “When I paint
                                                 20

from a photograph, conscious thinking is eliminated.” Drawing an object by hand could lead to

distortion and stylization: “By tracing the outlines with the aid of a projector, you can bypass this

elaborate process of apprehension.” 63 Richter’s method and his embrace of preconceived images

clearly identify him as a conceptual artist. But his career path is an unusual one. As noted earlier,

his position at the top of Table 3 points to the large number of important works he has made.

Table 6 furthermore shows that he has made these over an extended period, with concentrations

in his 30s and 50s.

       Richter is perhaps most noted for painting representational works based on photographs,

a practice he began in 1962. But he has made a number of other distinct contributions. These

include the color charts he began to make in 1966, which have been interpreted as a synthesis of

Pop art and of late Abstract Expressionism; abstract paintings, initially made by painting from

photographic enlargements of small sections of representational paintings, which he began to

make in 1970; and paintings with powerful albeit ambiguous political content, most notably the

15 paintings from photographs of members of the urban guerilla Baader-Meinhof group, three of

whom died in a German prison in 1977, which Richter made in 1988.64

       The protean nature of Richter’s style recalls the practice of an earlier modern conceptual

master. In 1985, Meyer Schapiro reflected that “If the works of Pablo Picasso were not identified

directly with his name, if they were shown together in a big exhibition, it would be rather

difficult to say that they were the work of one man.” Schapiro was puzzled, and troubled, by

Picasso’s frequent shifts of style: “If you can work in any... way you please, then no one way has

a necessity; there is an element of caprice or arbitrariness of choice.”65 In 2002, Arthur Danto

remarked that visitors to Gerhard Richter’s retrospective exhibition then on display “are certain
                                                 21

to be baffled by the fact that he seems to vacillate between realism and abstraction, or even

between various styles of abstraction, often at the same time.” Danto recalled that “These

vacillations seemed to me so extreme when I first saw a retrospective of Richter’s work... that it

looked like I was seeing some kind of group show.” Danto noted that many artists would reject

Richter’s behavior: “To change styles too often inevitably would have been read as a lack of

conviction.”66

       The frequent and rapid stylistic shifts of both Picasso and Richter are a phenomenon that

had long been understood by conceptual artists. So for example as early as 1921 the critic and

painter Amedeé Ozenfant wrote a commentary titled “Picasso’s Language,” in which he observed

that “When he paints a picture, he knows what he wants to say and what kind of picture will in

fact say it; his forms and colors are judiciously chosen to achieve the desired end, and he uses

them like the words of a vocabulary.” Ozenfant explained that consequently when Picasso

worked in one style, it didn’t mean he had abandoned any other: “Because Picasso nowadays

paints both cubist and representational works, it has been falsely claimed that he is giving up

Cubism; this had caused commotion in the studios and joy among diehards. Can such people not

understand that Cubism and figurative painting are two different languages, and that a painter is

free to choose either of them as he may judge it better suited to what he has to say?”67 Schapiro

and Danto failed to understand that changes in style mean very different things to experimental

and conceptual artists. Experimental artists seek for their one true style, and from their vantage

point any quick changes or alternation in styles can only be seen as insincere, but conceptual

artists can treat styles as languages, and can consequently shift from one to another as they find

appropriate for the occasion. As Picasso explained, “Whenever I have had something to say, I
                                                 22

have said it in the manner in which I have felt it ought to be said.”68

       The large number and broad distribution of Richter’s most valuable works over an

extended period are testimony to the fact that he is considered to have made important

contributions at several stages of his career. Consistent with this, Amy Dempsey’s recent guide to

styles of modern art gives Richter main entries both under “Super-realism,” for the photo-

paintings he began to make in the early 1960s, and under “Neo-Expressionism,”illustrated by an

abstract painting he executed in 1999. Because of his artistic longevity and his versatility, Richter

has had an influence on many younger artists, including painters as different from each other as

Chuck Close, David Salle, and Zhang Xiaogang.69 Richter is widely respected as an artist who

has consistently found ways to make significant advances in painting during periods, in the late

1960s and the 1970s, when many young artists were turning away from painting, and he and

Sigmar Polke are routinely mentioned as central figures in inspiring the renewed popularity of

painting for young artists in both Europe and the US in the 1980s.

       Damien Hirst’s meteoric rise to prominence began in 1988, when as a second-year art

student at Goldsmiths’ College he curated Freeze, a group show of the work of a number of

fellow students, at a vacant building in London’s Docklands. The show created immediate

interest and has become recognized as a landmark event for its announcement of the young

British artists, or YBAs, who are considered by many English observers to have become the

leaders of the international advanced art world of the 1990s.70 A series of group shows soon

followed Freeze, and from one of them in 1990 Charles Saatchi bought A Thousand Years, a

work of Hirst’s in mixed media: “steel, glass, flies, maggots, MDF, insect-o-cutor, cow’s head,

sugar, water.”71
                                                    23

        Hirst’s approach to art is conceptual: “I like creating emotions scientifically.”72 His works

are direct: “Hirst’s most successful works have an immediate impact, physically communicating

a thought or feeling.”73 His declaration that he wants his paintings “to look like they’ve been

made by a person trying to paint like a machine” echoes Andy Warhol’s famous statement that

“The reason I’m painting this way is that I want to be a machine,” just as Hirst’s practice of

having his paintings made by assistants follows that of Warhol.74 The tanks in which Hirst

suspends dead animals echo the tanks in which Jeff Koons floated basketballs, just as Hirst’s

creation of a public persona that complements his work appears to follow Koons’ systematic

pursuit of personal and professional fame. Thus Hirst openly admits that his art and his public

image cannot be considered separately: “With me it’s really got to be about the personal life and

the art and the fame and how it connects.”75

        Hirst’s art draws on a number of central influences. In addition to Koons, these include

Claes Oldenburg’s sculptures, the geometric art of Minimalism, and Francis Bacon’s paintings.76

Less than two decades into his career, it is still early to trace Hirst’s influence, but it is clear that

over time he has consolidated his early position as the leading member of the YBAs. In part this

is because he has become the archetypal member of the group in the perception of outside

observers, but it appears that in this role he has also affected how the other members of the group

perceive their own art. Admirers of the YBAs often argue that what distinguishes the new

English art of the 1990s, and raises it above the conceptual art being made elsewhere, is its

subject matter: instead of simply conducting intramural debates with earlier artists, the YBAs set

out “to engage instead with the broad and urgent concerns of everyday life,” and “to confront

even the most distressing, taboo aspects of existence.”77 And it has been claimed that none of
                                                  24

them engages with larger concerns than does Hirst, who “tackled head-on the eternal themes of

life, death, and regeneration, freedom and liberty, beauty and ugliness.”78

       Like many other conceptual artists, Hirst has produced a diverse body of work in a

number of media. At 40, he is recognized as a leading artist, if not the leading artist, of his

generation. It is unlikely, however, that he will ever produce another series of works that will

have a greater impact on the art world than his preserved animals in tanks, or that he will ever

make an individual work that will be more widely identified as a trademark piece than his 1991

tiger shark, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living.

       As noted earlier, seven of the eight artists discussed in this section are conceptual

innovators, This is not an accident, for the artists considered in this study are overwhelmingly

conceptual. In addition to Freud, the only experimental exceptions to this conceptual

predominance are Bourgeois, Serra, Thiebaud and Zao. The one qualification that should be kept

in mind is that there may be other important experimental artists working today, already well into

their careers, who have not yet been recognized as great artists. Louise Bourgeois affords an

example of the late recognition of a great experimental innovator. In 1981, when Bourgeois was

70 years old, an Artnews critic wrote that “Perhaps Louise Bourgeois is an idiosyncratic choice

for an article on ‘emerging’ artists. Yet she was the first to come to mind when considering

artists of high caliber whose work came to my attention during the past season.”79 Bourgeois’

work first reached $1 million at auction in 2002, when she was 91; she had made the work in

question 18 years, before when she was 73.

Geography

               The fact of working and living in New York constitutes a condition
                                                 25

               favorable to [artistic] success on the highest level.
                                               Raymonde Moulin, 200480

       During the 1950s, it became a commonplace among American critics and scholars that

the center of the art world had shifted from Europe to the US, as New York replaced Paris not

only as the major market for advanced art, but also as the center of its production.81 And although

Europeans were less inclined to recognize this change, in 1983 a French scholar admitted that

after World War II the birth of an American avant-garde had in fact “succeeded in shifting the

cultural center of the West from Paris to New York,” though he contended that this had been

accomplished by more sinister means than Americans believed.82

       In recent decades there has been a progressive reduction in New York’s dominant

position as the home of major artists: American artists have increasingly chosen to live elsewhere

in the US, and there has been an increase in the number of important European artists,

particularly in Germany and England, who have not chosen to move to the US. Overall, however,

the US remains the major country for important living artists. Thus 19 of the 39 artists listed in

Table 1 were born in the US, and several others, including Bourgeois, Hockney, Oldenburg, and

Prince, have spent much or most of their careers here. Eleven others were born in Europe and

have remained there, with Germany (Baselitz, Kiefer, Polke, Richter) and England (Freud, Hirst,

Ofili) the leading countries. Of the remaining five artists, Dumas was born in South Africa and

lives in Holland, Botero and Bravo were born in South America and spend much of their time in

Europe, Kusama lives in Japan, and Zao was born in China and lives in France.

       An interesting fact about these greatest living artists may provide support for the view of

some Europeans that in recent decades there has been a new shift, in which the US has ceased to
                                                 26

be the vital center of the production of advanced art. As Koons turns 50 this year, there are five

artists in this group who are currently below the age of 50 (Barceló, Cattelan, Hirst, Ofili, and

Tuymans), and none is American. These numbers are not so great as to constitute overwhelming

support for a statement like that of Matthew Collings, who declared in 1998 that “young British

art now dominates the world.”83 Yet it may be suggestive that two of these five younger artists

are English, and that Ofili is the only one of the five who is currently below the age of 40.

       Although there are some questions about the geographic center of the production of

advanced art, there is less uncertainty about the art world’s central marketplace, and the most

important geographic locus for the certification of artistic success. Damien Hirst expressed what

is probably a widespread attitude in 1996, when he was preparing for his first major New York

show. He was already famous in England: he had won the Turner Prize the previous year, and he

was making a film that was to be shown at London’s Hayward Gallery. As Gordon Burn

observed, “Not since the emergence of David Hockney in the early 1960s had a British artist’s

passage to fame been so rapid and spectacular.”84 Yet in spite of his position as what Burn called

“a figure of contemporary London legend,” Hirst felt that his resumé was incomplete. When

Burn asked him what a success in his forthcoming New York show would mean to him, Hirst

replied “It means I can relax. It means I can do it.” As the leader of the YBAs, Hirst went on to

state the Frank Sinatra Theorem for his followers: “I hope that people do realize that if you can

make it there you can make it anywhere. I hope that Angus [Fairhurst] realizes that; I hope that

Sarah [Lucas] realizes it.” Underlying Hirst’s recognition that the New York art world was the

most widely recognized arbiter of success, however, was a belief that it was prejudiced against

those who declined to become full-time members of it: “There’s an easy way to make it
                                                 27

worldwide: move to America. Look at Malcolm Morley and how he did in the 1980s... Malcolm

Morley would have been [nothing] if he’d stayed in England. I can’t help thinking if Gilbert and

George were American, they’d be much more significant.”85

Art Schools

               Our generation was the first fully educated generation - everybody
               went to graduate school.
                                              Chuck Close, 199786

       The experiences of the artists examined here reflect a number of other significant features

of today’s art world. One of these is a basic change that has occurred since 1960 in the early

career patterns of important artists. Until then, ever since the revolt of the Impressionists against

the Ecole des Beaux Arts, few important modern artists had attended formal degree-granting art

programs. But since then the situation has changed, as recent generations of conceptual artists

have often learned conceptual skills in graduate schools of art. Even casual inspection of the

careers of the artists listed in Table 1 reveals a number whose careers were significantly affected

by their experience in formal art schools.

       Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter enrolled in the Düsseldorf Academy of Art in 1961,

the same year in which the flamboyant conceptual artist Joseph Beuys accepted a professorship

there. Richter recalled that Beuys not only introduced him to the work of Duchamp, but that he

challenged him: “he unsettled me, because he didn’t play by the rules. He followed different

criteria and employed different strategies; he was working for an ‘expanded definition of art,’

which was not so much a protection as a challenge; a challenge to me too.”87 Beuys was then

becoming Europe’s leading seer of conceptual art based on performance, and he told his students

that painting was a reactionary activity that they could no longer pursue. This prohibition was a
                                                  28

turning point in the early careers of the two young artists: “Polke and Richter thought long and

hard about whether they were ‘allowed to paint,’ decided they were not, and for that reason took

it up with a vengeance.”88 Although Polke and Richter did not become followers of Beuys’ work,

his example of rebelliousness inspired them to perform the most rebellious act they could think

of in the early 1960s, of returning to painting. It is also difficult not to see Beuys’ influence in the

fact that both Polke and Richter would become known for their frequent and rapid changes of

style throughout their careers.89

        Chuck Close, Brice Marden, and Richard Serra are among a number of important

American artists who attended the Yale School of Art during the 1960s.90 Close explained how

the conceptual content of the school’s curriculum prepared students for the art world: “At Yale

we all learned to talk art before we could really make it. Not a bad skill actually. When you do

get a great idea at least you can recognize it, articulate it, and exploit it.”91 Ed Ruscha, who

attended art school in California, recalled that it was while he was in school that he realized that

his approach to art would be conceptual: “The time I did at Chouinard [Art Institute] was

helpful... I began to believe that it is not so much what you say that matters, but how you say it.

This ruled out so-called emotional painting. Everything should be preplanned.”92

        The most celebrated recent group of art school students were Damien Hirst and the other

YBAs who participated in the Freeze exhibition in 1988: with the exception only of Rachel

Whiteread, who had graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art, all the artists in that show

were students at Goldsmiths’ College. One of their teachers there, who is often described as the

key influence on the YBAs, was Michael Craig-Martin, who had himself attended art school at

Yale. Craig-Martin recalled that it was at Yale that he learned that art “needed to be rooted in the
                                                 29

very experience of ordinary life I had thought it sought to escape; that contemporary art existed in

a context as complex as that any other historical period.”93 Craig-Martin recently argued that the

success of the YBAs was in part a product of their academic training: “I believe that one of the

principal reasons the generation of young artists who graduated from Goldsmiths in the late

eighties had such an immediate and profound impact on the international perception of British art

was that they continued the critical dialogue that had characterized their education into the art

world beyond the school. Every exhibition, every interview, every social event became an

opportunity to extend awareness and to discuss ideas, feelings, concerns and values. More and

more artists were drawn into this dialogue of work and words, and for the first time London

could be seen to be generating rather than just responding to the central discourse that

characterizes and propels contemporary art of international interest.”94

Group Work

               Most truly original new art is the result of group activity. It appears
               that the conjunction of several exceptional talents results in
               something that is greater than the parts.
                                              Alan Bowness, 198995

       A notable fact about the life cycles of important modern artists is that at an early stage of

their careers nearly all have collaborated with other young artists who have also become

important artists. The artists considered here provide examples of these relationships.

       Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter worked closely together as students in Düsseldorf. In

1963, with two other fellow students, they rented a condemned building for the first public

exhibition of their own art, which they announced as the unveiling of what they called “German

Pop Art,” or “Capitalist Realism.” Their press release for the show declared that “Pop Art has
                                                    30

rendered conventional painting - with all its sterility, its isolation, its artificiality, its taboos, and

its rules - entirely obsolete.” In notes written in 1964, Richter explained that “Contact with like-

minded painters - a group means a great deal to me: nothing comes in isolation. We have worked

out our ideas largely by talking them through... One depends on one’s surroundings. And so the

exchange with other artists - and especially the collaboration with [Konrad] Lueg and Polke

matters a lot to me: it is part of the input that I need.” Nearly three decades later, in looking back

at that early collaboration, Richter put greater emphasis on a different stimulus he received from

his relationship with Lueg and Polke: “There were rare and exceptional moments when we were

doing a thing together and forming a kind of impromptu community; the rest of the time we were

competing with each other.”96

        Early in his career, Robert Rauschenberg worked closely with a series of other artists,

influencing them, and being influenced by them. In 1952-53 Rauschenberg traveled with Cy

Twombly to Rome, and later to Morocco. Branden Joseph noted that in a work Rauschenberg

executed in 1954, he used black crayon to make marks similar to those Twombly had developed.

The following year, in Rebus he included a drawing by Twombly.97 Rauschenberg returned to the

US in 1953, where his paintings inspired his friend John Cage to compose 4'
                                                                          33", discussed

above. In 1954 Rauschenberg met Jasper Johns, and the two spent most of the next seven years

living and working together. This period spanned the most important portion of both of their

careers, when they were making the key works that would revolutionize contemporary art.

Rauschenberg recalled that “He and I were each other’s first serious critics... Jasper and I literally

traded ideas. He would say, ‘I’ve got a terrific idea for you,’ and then I’d have to find one for

him.”98Johns later told an interviewer, “I was close to Bob’s working situation during those
                                                  31

years and certainly offered my opinion about anything I happened to see.” He freely

acknowledged Rauschenberg’s impact on him: “I suppose I learned more about painting from

Bob than I learned from any other artist or teacher, and working as closely as we did and more or

less in isolation, we developed a strong feeling of kinship.”99 And in a comment that stands for

the experiences of many advanced artists in these early alliances, Rauschenberg told a friend that

at a time when he and Johns were creating radically innovative art with little encouragement

from the art world at large, the two gave each other “permission to do what we wanted.”100

Conclusion

                Getting seventeen million dollars for a single painting - this is
                power.
                                              Jeff Koons on the auction price of
                                              Jasper Johns’ False Start101

                I think people always buy good art, and I think I’ve always been
                aware of that.
                                             Damien Hirst, 1992102

       Art scholars and critics often claim that markets for art are irrational, and that the value an

artist’s work brings at auction is unrelated to the real importance of that artist’s work. These

claims are wrong. Recent research has shown, for example, that auction outcomes sensitively

reflect the relative quality of artists’ work over the course of their careers.103 The present study

has shown that auction outcomes can systematically identify today’s greatest living artists. The

most valuable art is made by the greatest artists, and Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman, Lucian Freud,

Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, Jeff Koons, and Gerhard Richter must figure prominently in

any account of those who have made the most important contributions to modern art in the past

half century.

       This study has also underscored that fact that the most important art of the past fifty years

has overwhelmingly been conceptual. Unlike the visual art of Pollock, de Kooning, and the other

Abstract Expressionists, the art of Johns, Rauschenberg, and their successors has been based on

ideas. What this has meant in turn is that their most important work has generally been done early

in these artists’ careers: Pollock and his contemporaries were seekers whose greatest

contributions were made late in their lives, but the greatest artists alive today, who have

dominated advanced art since the late 1950s, have been finders who have confidently and

consciously made radical innovations at early ages.
