                                              ABSTRACT

       This study examines retirement outcomes in the first four waves of the Health and Retirement
Study. Measured retirement is seen to differ, sometimes substantially, with the definition of
retirement used and among various groups analyzed. Moreover, these differences vary with the wave
of the survey as respondents age. Retirement is comprised of a complex set of flows among states
representing full time work, partial retirement and complete retirement. Seventy seven percent of
transitions continue in the same or equivalent states between adjoining waves of the HRS; 17 percent
involve a move from greater to lesser labor force participation, and 6 percent involve a move from
states of lesser to greater labor force participation. Twenty two percent of the sample report they
were partially retired at some time in the first four waves, and by age 65, over a fifth of the
population is partially retired. Altogether, 14 percent of the sample experienced a reversal in the
course of the survey, moving from a state of less work to a state of more work. Comparing retirement
flows for men between the HRS and the 1969-1979 Retirement History Study, the large spike in the
population leaving full time work at age 65 observed in the RHS is reduced to half its original size
in the HRS, while the share leaving full time work at age 62 has almost doubled over time. The
results presented here should help researchers to improve their understanding of the structure of the
dependent variable in retirement studies.

        This paper analyzes retirement outcomes in the first four waves of the Health and Retirement

Study (HRS). We have a number of motivations for pursuing this topic.

        First, we would like to understand how the amount of retirement, and by implication any

estimated retirement equations, depend upon the definition of retirement a study adopts. There are

many different measures of retirement status, from measures based on self reported status, to

measures based on hours of work by week or by year, to indicators of whether the individual has

remained in or has left a long term job, to measures based on how the individual’s earnings compare

to earnings in the past, to indicators based on acceptance of retirement benefits. Each definition

produces a different measure of retirement outcomes, and of flows between waves of the survey

among the states of not retired (full-time work, F), partially retired (P) and completely retired (R).

        Second, it is of interest to explore differences in retirement outcomes among demographic

groups. Comparisons are made between retirement outcomes and retirement flows for women and

men, and among Blacks, Whites and Hispanics. It is especially interesting to document the situation in

recent years, to see how retirement patterns of women have evolved in view of the sharp changes in

patterns of women’s labor market participation.

        Third, as a precursor to estimating retirement models, we should have a full understanding of

the structure of the complex dependent variable that constitutes retirement behavior. Using the self

reported definition of retirement, this paper describes the numbers of HRS respondents of different

ages falling in each retirement category in each wave of the survey, the flows among various retirement

states from one wave to the next, and the flows by age.



                                                     1
        Fourth, it is of interest to determine how the relation between retirement outcomes and age

has changed over time. Pension plans and social security have changed in many ways over the past

two decades, and these changes influence retirement outcomes (Anderson, Gustman and Steinmeier,

1999). To isolate some of these changes, we compare retirement outcomes in samples of men

between the HRS and the earlier Retirement History Study.

        Section 2 analyzes the distribution of outcomes in each wave of the HRS using a number of

different definitions of retirement. Section 3 compares outcomes by race, ethnicity and gender. Using

a self reported definition of retirement, Section 4 examines outcomes across the four waves of the

survey. Section 4 also reports the transition rates from one state to another, and documents the many

retirement patterns that are observed in the data. In Section 5 we take a more detailed look at

retirement by age. Section 6 compares retirement outcomes of different cohorts of males: between

samples from the 1969-79 Retirement History Study and the 1992-98 Health and Retirement Study

and between HRS samples of comparable age taken in 1992 and 1998, the original HRS cohort and

the new “warbabies” cohort.

                     II. Outcomes Under Alternative Definitions of Retirement

        In this section we examine the distribution of respondents among various retirement categories

in each of the waves of the HRS, and describe how the measured retirement outcomes depend on the

definition of retirement that is used.1

        1
        Gustman, Mitchell and Steinmeier (1995) examines the sensitivity of the rate of retirement to
the measure of retirement used in wave 1 of the Health and Retirement Study. In this section we
examine the sensitivity of measured retirement to the definition of retirement used in each of the first
four waves of the HRS, and also consider how retirement dynamics are affected by the definition of

                                                    2
        Alternative definitions of retirement are given in Table 1. Outcomes under each of the

alternative definitions of retirement status are reported in Table 2 for the age eligible population in the

HRS, those born from 1931 to 1941, who answered the question in the relevant wave of the survey. 2

        Line 1 of Table 2 indicates self reported retirement status in each of the four waves of the

survey. Notice that in line 1, the probabilities of falling in each of the three retirement states, not

retired at all (F), partially retired (P) and completely retired (R), do not add up to 1.0. Rather, there

is a fourth outcome in the HRS question on self reported retirement status, question not relevant

(because the individual indicates he or she does not work for pay, is a homemaker, or hasn’t worked

for pay, in 10 years or more in wave 1, or in one year or more in waves 2 through 4).3



retirement used.
        2
           Sample exclusions are reported in Appendix 1. Age ineligibles and an overlap group with a
spouse who fell into the HRS age range, but was incorporated into the AHEAD survey, are excluded
from all waves. Attritors and those whose survey is answered by a proxy respondent are excluded
only from the waves in which a respondent survey is not available. Appendix 2 reports the same
statistics as in Table 2 where attritors and those with proxy responses are excluded from all waves,
even those waves where a response is available.
        3
        More specifically, the number of respondents who chose the four retirement categories in
each wave of the survey are indicated in the following table:

     Number of Respondents by Wave Reporting Retired, Partially Retired, Completely Retired or
                                   Question Not Relevant*
                       Not Retired            Partially Retired     Completely             Question Not
                                                                    Retired                Relevant

      Wave 1                  6548                   575                   1155                   1019

      Wave 2                  5219                   801                   1564                   681

      Wave 3                  4026                   887                   1878                   1037

                                                       3
        Over the four waves of the HRS, the share reporting they are not retired at all (F) falls from

72 percent to 42 percent of age eligible respondents, while the shares reporting they are partially or

completely retired each roughly doubles, from 6 percent to 13 percent for those reporting partial

retirement, and from 12 percent to 27 percent for those reporting they are completely retired. Thus

10 percent of the age eligibles report the retirement status question is not relevant in wave 1, 7 percent

report it is not relevant in wave 2, 12 percent report the question to be not relevant in wave 3, and 18

percent report it is not relevant in wave 4.

        Lines 2 and 3 of Table 2 report retirement status using objective measures of retirement based

on hours of work. Both objective measures, usual hours of work per week and usual hours per year,

provide similar indications of retirement status. Thus 62 percent of respondents are classified as not

retired in wave1 because they usually work 25 or more hours a week; while 60 percent are classified

as not retired in wave 1 because they usually work 1200 or more hours per year. Similar results are

also found for partial and complete retirement in wave 1 with the two hours based definitions of

retirement, with roughly 7 to 8 percent partially retired and 31 to 32 percent completely retired using

either definition. The rates of nonretirement, partial and complete retirement change the same way

between the four waves for each of the hours based definitions of retirement.

        However, the objective measures of retirement status based on hours of work suggest

different numbers falling in the different retirement outcome categories from those found with the self




      Wave 4                  3102                897                  1958                   1350
*The counts in this table are unweighted. Results in the text use weights from wave 1.

                                                     4
reported retirement measure. Thus the objective retirement measures suggest there are fewer

individuals who are not retired, especially in wave 1, than are suggested by the self reported

retirement measures. By wave 4, however, the self reported and objective measures are indicating

roughly the same population shares as not retired. Therefore, the objective, hours based measures

suggest that the flow out of full time work from wave 1 to wave 4 is smaller than when the self

reported retirement measure is used. Notice that the share of the population completely retired is

much higher according to the objective than the self reported measures. The difference is that, for the

subjective retirement variable, there is a fourth category, “Not Relevant”, while there are only three

categories when the objective hours definitions of retirement are used. We further analyze the “Not

Relevant” category in the self reported data after completing our discussion of Tables 2 and 3.

        Rows 4 and 5 of Table 2 define retirement status according to whether one remains in, or has

left a long term job. Thus the basic populations for these measures, 5204 and 2720 respectively in

wave 1 for the two measures, consist of those who, at one time or another, held a job for either 10+

years or 20+ years. Those who have left that job are classified as retired if they are no longer

working after having left their long term jobs, or as partially retired if they are working after having left

a long term job.4 Using the long term employment definition, the fraction not retired is about the same

in wave 1 as it is when the hours measures are used, with a slightly higher share not retired when long

term job is defined as a 20+ year job rather than a 10+ year job. However, the share of the relevant



        4
          The measure of retirement based on having left a long term job reported in this paper
classifies those who left a job of 10 or 20 years duration after age 45 as partially retired even if they
are working full time, and even if they are in a current job that also lasts 10 or 20 years.

                                                       5
population that is partially retired is higher using the long term job definition, since in wave 1, roughly a

fifth of the population, while working, is no longer in their long term job.5 Very wide differences in the

rate of partial retirement are also apparent when the self reported or hours based rates of partial

retirement are compared with the rates estimated on the basis of having left a long term job. The

share of the population fully retired is lower when the definition is based on long term attachment than

when it is based on usual hours of work. Retirement rates over the course of the panel are higher

when retirement is measured by long term attachment, especially when measured by the relative

difference in the fraction fully retired between the first and fourth waves of the survey.

        The next two rows of Table 2 measure retirement by the relation between usual earnings and

maximum earnings, with separate measures based on hourly wage and weekly earnings. Those who

are earning 60 percent or more than the maximum they earned in the past are classified as not retired,

those who are working but earn less than 60 percent of the maximum recorded are partially retired,

and those not working at all are fully retired.6 Fewer are classified as not retired using the wage or

earnings based measures of retirement status than using the hours based measures. The difference


        5
         Ruhm (1990) calls jobs held after leaving long term jobs “bridge jobs”. One criticism of the
concept of “bridge jobs” is that it mixes turnover from long term jobs, which may be observed for a
variety of reasons having nothing to do with retirement behavior, with the process of phasing out of the
labor market. Those in bridge jobs may be supplying a full year’s effort on a job they held after
leaving their long term job, with some having left their long term job well before they were
contemplating retirement.
        6
         The maximum wage is calculated for wave 1 using the wages reported in sections F, G and
H. After wave 1, all wages in waves up and including that wave are also included in calculating the
maximum wage. Thus for wave 3, the maximum wage includes all observed wages reported in the
past and for wave 1, plus the current wages observed in waves 2 and 3. The calculated maximum
wage used in computing retirement status does not look forward, only backwards.

                                                      6
widens from wave 1 through wave 4, so that the measure of the number flowing out of full time jobs

between waves 1 and 4 is a few percentage points higher when the wage or earnings based definitions

are used.

        Rates of partial retirement are also a few percentage points higher using the wage or earnings

based measures of partial retirement than when the self reported measures and hours based measures

are used.

        Lastly, when retirement status is based on social security receipt, the share not retired is

substantially higher than under any other measure. In wave 1 none of the age eligibles are old enough

to receive social security benefits from own work, and can be receiving benefits only as a surviving

spouse or due to own or spouse’s disability. Even by wave 4, when half the population is retired by

any of the other objective measures in Table 2, only 40 percent of age eligibles are in receipt of social

security benefits.

                     III. Retirement Outcomes by Gender, Race and Ethnicity

        Table 3 reports the probability of being not retired by gender, race and Hispanic origin. Four

of the definitions of retirement from Table 2 are used.

        Men are more likely to be not retired than women; Whites are more likely to be not retired

than Blacks or Hispanics. Difference in retirement rates by gender, race and ethnicity vary among the

different definitions of retirement. While the differences between Whites and Blacks vary by a few

percentage points across the different definitions, differences between men and women are much

wider when not retired is defined as working more than 1200 hours, than when not retired is defined



                                                     7
on the basis of the other definitions.

                                         IV. Retirement Dynamics

          All of the remaining tables use the self reported definition of retirement to explore retirement

dynamics. Table 4 measures the shares of the observations for the population transiting from the

states indicated in the column heads in one wave, to the states indicated in the row heads in the next

wave. This table summarizes the wave to wave transition rates between waves 1 and 2, waves 2 and

3, and waves 3 and 4. Thus on average, over the four waves, 38 percent of the sample begin in

nonretirement and end in the same state.

          Table 4A includes ‘not available’ as an additional state, with 21.6 percent of responses not

available in one wave or the other (12.6 + 19.0 - 10.0). Observations are included in the not

available category for a number of reasons: if the respondent refused to answer or answered don’t

know; if their survey instrument was answered by a proxy respondent, who then, following the skip

pattern of the survey, would not have been asked to report the respondent’s retirement status; or if

the respondent was not interviewed in the wave, having attrited temporarily or permanently from the

sample.

          Among respondents asked about their self reported retirement status, 14.3 percent (8.4 + 9.8

- 3.9) answer, in one of two adjoining waves, that the question is not relevant Respondents who

don’t work for pay, are homemakers, and haven’t worked for pay for ten years in wave 1, or one

year in later waves, may answer not relevant to the retirement status question.

          Table 4B rescales the data in Table 4A. It excludes the not available answers from the



                                                       8
denominator and recomputes the remaining probabilities for the 78.5 percent of the transitions among

the states of not retired, partial retirement, complete retirement and not relevant so that they add up to

100 percent. Among those transiting through the remaining four states: 49 percent continue between

adjoining waves as not retired in each; 4.3 percent report they were partially retired in two adjoining

waves; 12.9 percent report they were retired in adjoining waves; and 5.0 percent report the question

was not relevant in two adjoining waves. Consequently, 71.0 percent of transitions involved

continuing in the same state from one wave to the next.

        Considering the transitions for those changing retirement status, 11.3 percent were following a

simple retirement path, beginning as not retired, and proceeding either to partial retirement (5.2

percent) or directly to complete retirement (6.1 percent).7 Among the remaining transitions, 2.4

percent began with partial retirement and proceeded to complete retirement. In addition, 2.8 percent

went from not retired to question not relevant, a state that is difficult to distinguish from full retirement.8


        7
          The finding that movements to retirement involve a disproportionate share of transitions
directly from full time work straight to complete retirement is consistent with earlier work, but the
share of these "bang-bang" transitions is lower in these data than in the Retirement History Study
(Gustman and Steinmeier, 1984). However, the RHS group was much older than the HRS sample.
        8
          For many respondents, the states of “completely retired” and “question not relevant” appear
to be equivalent. In wave 1 the respondent is asked to report retirement status as “question not
relevant” if the respondent does not work for pay or is a homemaker, or has not worked for ten or
more years. In subsequent waves, the respondent is asked to report retirement status as question not
relevant if the respondent does not work for pay or is a homemaker, or has not worked for one or
more years. Despite these instructions, among those who indicated they were completely retired in
wave 1, and reported they were either completely retired or the question was not relevant in wave 2,
most continued to report in wave 2 that they were completely retired. However, among those who
reported the question was not relevant in wave 1 and who reported either that they were completely
retired or the question was not relevant in wave 2, forty percent switched their answer to completely
retired. Accordingly, users of the survey should be careful in how they handle those responding

                                                       9
Another 0.9 percent went from partial retirement to question not relevant.9 Altogether then, 17.4

percent of transitions were moving from a state of greater labor force participation to a state of lesser

labor force participation.

        The remaining 11.6 percent of transitions consist of two groups: 6.1 percent of the transitions

were from a state of lesser labor force participation to a state of greater labor force participation, and

thus involved reversals; with 1.8 percent involving a move from partial retirement to nonretirement; 0.5

percent from retirement to nonretirement, 1.5 percent from retirement to partial retirement, and 1.8

percent and 0.5 percent from question not relevant to not retired and to partially retired respectively.

The second group consists of the 5.5 percent of transitions between not relevant and retired.

        Altogether then, about 71 percent of the transitions were continuations in the same state from

one period to the next. Of the remaining 29 percent, about 17.4 percent were in the direction of

lowering work effort, while 6.1 percent were in the direction of increasing work effort, with the other

5.5 percent involving transitions between completely retired and not relevant.

        Table 5 asks a slightly different question from Table 4. Among those observed in the final

states indicated in the row heads, what states did they come from?

        About 89 percent of the transitions ending in nonretirement began with nonretirement; 3.4

percent involved an increase in work effort from partial retirement; 1.0 percent involved an increase in

work effort from complete retirement; while 3.2 percent answered not relevant on the previous wave,


question not relevant. A number of them will be indistinguishable from the retired population.
        9
        Note that 2.2 percent went from question not relevant to complete retirement, and 3.3
percent went from completely retired to question not relevant.

                                                    10
and 3.3 percent were previously not available.

        Among those ending in partial retirement, 43.7 % of the transitions were from nonretirement.

Over a third (36.1 percent) were from partial retirement. An additional 12.8 percent came from

complete retirement. Of the remaining transitions, 4.5 percent previously reported the question was

not relevant, and for 2.8 percent of those ending in partial retirement, in the previous wave they were

not available.

        Among those who were completely retired in the subsequent wave, more than half (53.1%)

were fully retired in the initial state. About a fourth (25.3%) came directly from nonretirement, and 10

percent came via partial retirement. About 8.8 percent of those reporting they were retired indicated

the question was not relevant in the previous wave, and in 2.8 percent of transitions, the respondent

was not available in the previous wave.

        Among those ending in not relevant, 40.2 percent gave the same answer in the previous wave,

while 22.8 percent of those answering not relevant previously reported they were not retired, and

26.1 percent previously reported they were completely retired. Lastly, among those ending in not

available, 52.5 percent were not available in the earlier wave. The majority of the rest of those not

available in subsequent waves, 29 percent, previously reported they were not retired in the initial

wave.

        Table 6 breaks down the columns in Table 4A according to the state where the individual

originated, reporting the conditional probability of transiting from the state reported in the column head

to the state reported in the row head. Thus among those beginning as not retired, 69.7 percent ended



                                                    11
in nonretirement, 7.4 percent went to partial retirement, 8.8 percent went to full retirement, 4.1

percent answered that the question was not relevant on the next wave, 9.9 percent were not available

for the next wave.

        Among those initially indicating they were partially retired, 41.6 percent continued in that state,

23.6 percent transited to complete retirement. There were reversals to full time work among 17.8

percent of the transitions observed from partial retirement. 8.1 percent of the respondents who

reported they were partially retired in one wave indicated that the question on retirement status was

not relevant in the next wave, and 8.9 percent were not available to the survey for the next wave.

        Among those beginning as completely retired, 63.1 percent remained in that state in the next

wave, 2.5 percent returned to nonretirement status, and 7.4 percent reported themselves as partially

retired in the subsequent wave. 15.9 percent of those reporting themselves as completely retired in

the initial wave said the question was not relevant in the next wave, and 11 percent were not available

for the next wave.

        Table 7 shows the complete set of flows among the four waves of the survey. There are five

panels to the table. All of the combinations in the first panel involve those who were not retired in

wave 1 (F). The second panel pertains to those who were partially retired in wave 1 (P), the third

panel to those who were completely retired in wave 1 (R), the fourth panel to those who answered

the question was not relevant in wave 1 (X), and the fifth panel includes those who were not available

in wave 1 (.) . The column heads indicate the status reported by the respondent in wave 2. In the first

column, the two letters comprising the row heads indicate the respondent’s retirement status in waves



                                                    12
3 and 4 respectively. For example, the first entry in the first panel of Table 7, 24.66, indicates that

24.66 percent of the combinations of retirement statuses across the four waves involved being not

retired in each of the four waves, that is FFFF was the status across the four waves. The second

entry in the first row of the first panel indicates that 0.43 percent of the retirement outcomes involved

FPFF, not retired in wave 1, partially retired in wave 2, and not retired in waves 3 and 4. The last

entry in column 1, FF.. indicates that 3.36 percent of respondents worked full time in the first two

waves and then were not available (.) for the last two waves.

        From the data in Table 7, adding the fraction of the sample partially retired in wave 1 to the

fraction that is partially retired in waves 2, 3 and 4 in the various sequences, we find that 22 percent of

the sample has reported sometime in the first four waves they were partially retired. This is below the

number found for the Retirement History Study, where roughly a third were found to have ever

partially retired. But the HRS sample is much younger than the RHS sample, and many more will

eventually transit through the state of partial retirement.

        Sixty eight percent of the sample work full time in wave 1. By wave 4, 31 percent of the

sample is in full time work, but only 25 percent of the sample remained in full time work throughout all

four waves.

        Altogether, 14 percent of the sample experienced a reversal in the course of the survey,

moving from a state of less work to a state of more work. Among the 68 percent of the sample who

worked full time in the first wave of the HRS, 5 percent of the sample experience a reversal of

retirement status by partially retiring or retiring and then returning to full time work. Among the 6



                                                      13
percent of the sample who indicated they were partially retired in wave 1, 2 percent of the sample

experienced a reversal in the course of the survey and are shown to be not retired at all sometime

after wave 1. Among the 12 percent of the sample who were completely retired in wave 1, 2 percent

of the sample indicated in either waves 2, 3, or 4 that they were partially retired or not retired. In

addition, among the 9 percent of the sample who answered not relevant in wave 1, or the 5 percent of

the sample who had a missing observation in wave1, 1 percent experienced a reversal by wave 4.

                                         V. Retirement By Age

        Table 8 begins the exploration of retirement status by age. The sample includes all age

eligibles as in Tables 2 to 7. Panel A pertains to retirement outcomes by age for males, Panel B for

females.

        Starting around age 53 the proportion of males not retired begins to decline at roughly three or

four percentage points per year until after age 61. Between 61 and 62 the decline is about 20

percentage points, and from 62 to 63 the proportion not retired declines about two percentage points.

There is a six percentage point decline from age 63 to 64, and an eleven percentage point decline

from age 64 to 65. Only eighteen percent of 65 year old males report themselves as not retired.

        Among men who report themselves as partially retired, partial retirement rises with age, where

it exceeds a fifth of the population by age 65.

        The proportion fully retired, or who answer the question is not relevant, account for those who

are not working full time or partially retired. The sum of the share of men who say that the question is

not relevant or who report they are fully retired rises until, between age 61 and 62 it jumps sharply



                                                    14
from 30 percentage points to 43 percentage points. There is a seven percentage point jump between

63 and 64, and again between 64 and 65. At age 65 about 41 percent of the sample still reports they

are partially retired or not retired.

         The decline for women in the percent not retired is also evident at age 54. There is a 14 point

drop at age 62. At age 65 only 17 percent report they are not retired. Partial retirement rises

continuously with age after age 55, rising to a peak of 15 percentage points at age 64. The

proportion of the sample of women answering that the retirement question is not relevant is three to

four times as high for women than men. The change in the question, allowing the non relevant

response if the respondent has not worked in the past year in waves 2 through 4, accounts for the

increase in the number choosing not relevant at older ages. About 31 percent of the sample of

women is working at age 65, 17 percentage points as not retired, and 14 percentage points as

partially retired.

         Consider some of the major differences in retirement outcomes reported by women and men.

At any age, men are roughly 10 percentage points more likely to be not retired than women, with the

gap narrowing after age 61. Men are 2 to 5 percentage points more likely to be partially retired than

women.

         Tables 9 focuses on retirement outcomes reported by respondents by age and wave.

Conditioning the sample on those who did report retirement status, there are no patterns that stand out

in the proportions who call themselves not retired or partially retired that suggest major differences

between the waves of the survey. The fraction indicating that the question is not relevant increases



                                                    15
across the waves, a change that is mirrored by a corresponding decline, of a few percentage points, in

the share who report they were completely retired. This likely reflects the effect of the change in the

qualification for the not relevant category in the self reported retirement status question from not

having worked for ten years in wave 1 to not having worked for a year in waves 2 through 4. The

effect is modest, however.

                                 VI. Retirement Trends Among Cohorts

        It is useful to consider how retirement behavior differs among cohorts. In 1998 a new cohort

was added to the Health and Retirement Study. This group, called the Warbabies, was born from

1942 to 1947. Thus at the time of the survey, the Warbabies were 51 to 56 years old. That is a little

young to discern trends in retirement. There are clues we can examine about what to expect from this

new cohort, but before we do that, it is useful to put the retirement trends in longer run perspective.

Accordingly, before comparing differences between cohorts within the HRS, we compare findings

from the original HRS cohort with findings from the Retirement History Study, a ten year panel study

of 58 to 63 year olds in 1969.

A. Comparison Between the HRS and RHS

        Table 10 compares retirement outcomes for males between the Health and Retirement Study

and the Retirement History Study.10 The results are confined to males since the RHS did not include a

representative sample of women.

        10
         For additional evidence on the trends to earlier retirement, see Anderson, Gustman and
Steinmeier (1999) and Friedberg (1999). In addition to evidence from the Current Population
Survey, Friedberg contains comparisons between the RHS and HRS. The first draft of this paper,
containing the comparisons reported here, was completed before we became aware of her work.

                                                     16
        The major trends to early retirement are apparent in the data. At age 60 more than three

fourths of the RHS were still at work full time, while fewer than two thirds of the males in the HRS are

at work. At age 62, 60 percent of the RHS sample was at work three decades ago, while little more

than a third of the HRS sample report they are not yet retired. Only at age 65 do the two samples

approach each other.

        Not all those who have left full time work have exited the labor force. At all ages, the

proportion partially retired in the HRS sample lies well above the fraction found to be partially retired

in the earlier RHS study.

        Despite the larger number who are partially retired in the HRS, only through age 64 does the

number retired in the HRS (the sum of the number retired plus those reporting not relevant in the

HRS) exceed the comparable retirement rate in the old Retirement History Study.

        The trend to earlier retirement is readily apparent in Table 11, which reports the proportion of

the sample retiring by age for each of the two surveys. There was a very large spike in retirement in

the RHS at age 65 with one fifth of the sample leaving full-time work. In the HRS, the comparable

spike at 65 is half as large, but one fifth of the HRS sample leaves full-time work at age 62. Thirteen

percent enter complete retirement between ages 61 and 62 in the HRS. In the old RHS, only 9

percent entered complete retirement at age 62.

        There is a view in the retirement literature that lack of employer provided retiree health

insurance and availability of Medicare eligibility at age 65 are major factors shaping retirement

behavior. Nevertheless, the spike in the number entering the state of complete retirement at age 65



                                                    17
has all but disappeared, and the proportion leaving full time work at age 65 has more than halved.

This raises questions about the importance of Medicare eligibility and absence of employer provided

retiree health insurance in promoting a spike at age 65 in retirement rates.

B. Comparing 51 to 56 Year Olds in the HRS and in the Warbabies

        Although the Warbabies are a little young to have retired in great numbers, we can ask how

they differ from those who were 51 to 56 in the initial year of the HRS. Table 12 compares 51 to 56

year olds in the two cohorts on a number of variables that will certainly influence retirement outcomes.

There are a number of similarities between the cohorts. One major difference, seen in row 2, is that

the share of women working full time between the ages of 51 and 56 is significantly higher in the

Warbabies. Another major difference, seen in rows 5 to 8, is the sharp decline in coverage by

defined benefit pension plans. This decline is obvious for both men and women. The influence of a

third difference will not be apparent until the Warbaby cohort reaches its mid-sixties. As seen in the

bottom row of Table 12, social security normal retirement age for the Warbabies rises for all those

born after 1942 to age 66. Both the changes in pensions and in social security may lead to some

delay in retirement for the Warbaby cohort.

                                            VIII. Conclusions

        This study has examined retirement outcomes in the Health and Retirement Study. We

measured how retirement outcomes vary with the definition of retirement adopted. We then examined

retirement outcomes among groups, and described the dynamic structure of the complex retirement

variable. Lastly, we considered changes over time, and how retirement flows found in the HRS



                                                    18
differed from those in the earlier Retirement History Study.

        Among our major findings are the following:

Self Reported Retirement Status: Over the four waves of the HRS, the share reporting they are not

retired (F) falls from 72 percent to 42 percent of age eligible respondents, while the share reporting

they are partially retired each roughly doubles, from 6 percent to 13 percent.

Retirement Based on Hours Per Year of Work: The objective hours measures of retirement suggest

there are fewer individuals who are not retired, especially in wave 1, than are suggested by the self

reported retirement measures. Using a definition based on working 1200 hours per year, 60 percent

are classified as not retired in wave 1. The proportions reporting they are partially retired using the

hours per year definition, 8.1 percent, is only 1.8 percent higher than the percentage partially retired

obtained from the self reported definition. By wave 4, the self reported and hours per year based

measures are indicating roughly the same population shares as not retired and as partially retired.

Similar results are obtained measuring retirement status by hours per year and hours per week of

work.

Defining Retirement As Having Left A Long Term Job: Using a measure based on whether one is

still in a long term job, the fraction not retired is about the same in wave 1 as it is when the hours

measures are used. However, the share of the relevant population that is partially retired is higher

using the long term job definition, because roughly a fifth of the population, while still working by wave

1 of the HRS, is no longer in their long term job they held until age 45. When considering a definition

of retirement based on long term job, it is important to remember that over 40 percent of the sample is



                                                     19
lost when the population is confined to those who ever held a job for more than 10 years and held that

job at age 45 or later, and over two thirds of the sample is lost when long tenure is defined as having

held a job for more than 20 years.

Earnings Based Measures Of Retirement: When retirement status is measured by whether current

earnings are less then 60 percent of the maximum earnings observed for the respondent, in wave 1 the

earnings based measure indicates about the same proportion are not retired as does the hours based

measure. However, the retirement flow from full time work is higher when using earnings based

measures of retirement than when the hours based measures are used.

Differences In Retirement By Gender, Race And Ethnicity: We also found significant differences in

retirement rates when we examined retirement by gender, race and ethnicity, although these

differences vary with the definition of retirement. Whites are more likely to be not retired than Blacks

or Hispanics. Most noticeable are some major differences in retirement outcomes reported by

women and men. Using the self reported measure of retirement status, at any age, men are 3 to 12

percentage points more likely to be not retired than women, with the gap disappearing only at age 65

when less than a fifth of men or women are working full time. Men are 1 to 6 percentage points more

likely to be working while partially retired than women through age 65, with the difference increasing

with age and becoming very large after 65. Women are about 10 to 20 percentage points more likely

than men to report that the retirement question is not relevant.

Dynamic Structure Of The Complex Retirement Measure: Our analysis of retirement dynamics

was based on self reported retirement status. Among those transiting between the states of not



                                                    20
retired, partially retired, completely retired and not relevant between the first four waves of the HRS,

seventy one percent of the transitions were continuations, where the respondent reported not retired,

partially retired, completely retired, or not relevant in two adjoining periods. Of the remaining twenty

nine percent, about 17.4 percent of the transitions were in the direction of lowering work effort,

moving from not retired toward retired, while a 6.1 percent of transitions were in the direction of

increasing work effort, with the other 5.5 percent involving transitions between completely retired and

not relevant.

        Starting around age 53 the proportion of males not retired begins to decline at roughly three or

four percentage points per year until after age 61. Between ages 61 and 62 the decline is about 20

percentage points, and from 62 to 63 the proportion not retired declines over two percentage points.

There is a six percentage point decline from age 63 to 64, and an eleven percentage point decline

from age 64 to 65. Only eighteen percentage points of males age 65 report themselves as not retired.

        Among men who report themselves as partially retired, partial retirement increases with age,

where it exceeds a fifth of the population after age 65.

        The proportion of men who say they are fully retired, or that the retirement question is not

relevant, rises with age, jumping 13 percentage points between ages 61 and 62. Between 64 and 65

there is a 7 percentage point jump.

        The decline for women in the percent not retired is evident from age 54. There is a 14

percentage point drop at age 61. At age 65 only 17 percent report they are not retired. Partial

retirement rises with age to about 15 percentage points. The proportion of the sample answering that



                                                    21
the retirement question is not relevant is three to four times as high for women than men and rises

through the early 60s. By age 65, about 31 percent of the sample of women is working, 16

percentage points as not retired, and 14 percentage points as partially retired.

Retirement Outcome Changes Over Time: Lastly, we compared flows from full-time work between

the Health and Retirement Study and the Retirement History Study, which reported retirement

outcomes for the cohort born from 1906 to 1911. The major trends to early retirement are readily

apparent. At age 60, more than three fourths of the RHS was still working full time, compared to 61

percent of males in the HRS. The peak in the flow from full-time work in the RHS is at age 65, while

in the HRS, about 11 percent are leaving full time work at age 65. On the other hand, the flow from

full-time work at age 62 is more important for the HRS cohort.

        A little more than a fifth of the HRS sample reports they were partially retired at least once in

the first four waves. This is below the number found for the Retirement History Study, where roughly

a third were found to have ever partially retired. But the HRS sample is much younger than the RHS

sample, and many more will eventually transit through the state of partial retirement. Indeed, at all

ages many more respondents report they are partially retired to the HRS than reported partial

retirement to the RHS.

        Although the importance of particular retirement flows have changed from the late 1970s, the

retirement variable remains extremely complex: partial retirement continues to be very important; a

large number of different retirement flows are observed across the first four waves of the HRS;

measured retirement is seen to differ with the definition of retirement used, with the precise wording of



                                                    22
questions, and among various groups analyzed. Given the complexity of the retirement variable,

modeling the full set of retirement outcomes will remain a difficult challenge.

*Outcomes from The Retirement History Study (RHS) are from Gustman and Steinmeier (1984, Table 1). HRS outcomes are from Table 8. The RHS allowed
the respondent only three choices when reporting retirement status: not retired, partially retired and completely retired. The HRS allows four choices. Therefore,
those included as completely retired in the HRS are those who answered either they are completely retired, or that the question is not relevant. Those not
available have been excluded from the base so that the percentages of those reporting they are not retired, partially retired and fully retired sum to 1.0.

not retired, partially retired and fully retired do not sum to 1.0 due to inclusion of those answering not relevant in the population base.
See Appendix 1 for sample exclusions. Sample sizes differ between the waves only because of don’t knows, refusals, or incomplete data.
