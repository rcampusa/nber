Does the Gender of Offspring Affect Parental Political Orientation?

                                            ABSTRACT

Recently, the sex of child has been widely used as a natural experiment and shown to induce change
of the allegedly stable political predisposition, however, prior results have been contradictory: in the
U.K., researchers found that having daughters leads to parents favoring left-wing political parties and
to holding more liberal views on family/gender roles, whereas in the U.S. scholars found that daughters
were associated with more Republican (rightist) party identification and more conservative views on
teen sexuality. Here, we utilize data from the General Social Survey and the European Social Survey
to test the robustness of effects of offspring sex on parental political orientation while factoring out
country and period differences. In analysis of 36 countries, we obtain null effects of the sex of the
first child on party identification as well as on political ideology. Further, we observe no evidence
of heterogeneous treatment effects. We discuss the implications of these null findings for theories
of political socialization.

Background

         Familial clustering of various traits is one of the most commonly observed patterns in the social

sciences; within families, husbands and wives tend to have similar educational backgrounds (Breen and

Salazar 2011; Domingue et al. 2014; Mare 1991), parents and children display similar social attitudes

(Glass, Bengtson, and Dunham 1986), and siblings share many healthy/deviant behaviors (Haynie and

McHugh 2003).        In particular, intergenerational inheritance (e.g., parent-child similarity) of social,

health and economic status has garnered much attention since it forms the basis of social stratification or

reproduction (Conley and Bennett 2000; Corak 2013; Hauser and Grusky 1988; Simons et al. 1991).

While high parent-child correlations have been observed for a number of traits ranging from political

attitudes (Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers 2009; Knoke 1972) to occupational status (Hauser and Grusky

1988) to health behaviors such as smoking (Chassin et al. 1998), social scientists have made little

headway in understanding how these intergenerational associations come about.                      Absent natural

experiments, it is difficult to ascertain the key causal factor, or sometimes even the direction of influence,

while ruling out unobserved heterogeneities such as shared genetic endowments.

         Political predisposition -- party identification or political ideology -- is not an exception1:

family (e.g., parent-child relationships) has been regarded as one of the most influential aspects of

socialization into political beliefs and behaviors (Alford et al. 2011; Jennings and Niemi 1968; Jennings,

Stoker, and Bowers 2009; Jennings and Stoker 2001). For example, Jennings and Niemi (1968) found

substantial agreement of party identification between parents and offspring in a 1965 sample.                      A

follow-up study in 1997 by Jennings et al. (2009) confirmed the patterns of political reproduction were

robust across cohorts and further discovered the stability of transmitted partisan orientation in adulthood,

especially among children whose initial parent/child correspondence was higher (i.e. a non-linear effect).

1
  While party identification and political ideology might be conceptualized and measured in different ways (i.e.
Liberal-Republicans and Conservative-Democrats are possible, though rare), we treat them as two of core components of
political orientation in this paper as the distinction itself is not of central interest to our study.

                                                         1
They argue that their results provide support for an intergenerational transmission model, in which views

political values are directly transmitted from parents to child via social influence and learning during

early childhood. Other results regarding the intergenerational correlation of political ideology in five

European countries could also be read to support this direct transmission model (Jennings 1984).

Nevertheless, these studies cannot completely rule out the possibility of genetic influence or indirect

influence through shared environment such as neighborhood context (Hatemi and McDermott 2012;

MacDonald and Franko 2008; Settle, Dawes, and Fowler 2009; Smith et al. 2012).

           Ideally, we might want to randomly make some parents become Republicans (or conservative)

to see whether their children are more likely to be Republicans as compared to those of control parents

who were assigned to being Democrats (or left-leaning). While this kind of experiment is impossible,

the sex2 of the (first) child provides a unique natural experiment to examine the possibility that part of

the observed correlation is due to the fact that children socialize their parents (rather than the other way

around).     Given the absence of prenatal sex-selection, the sex of child should be random, and

consequently the first order effect of the sex of child on outcomes would be unbiased by unobserved

factors (such as genetics).

           Namely, Warner (1991) and Warner and Steel (1999) have argued that parental active

engagement to address the barriers that their daughters would face leads to changes in parents’ political

views and/or civic behavior favorable to their daughters. This dynamic may not lead to a shift in

underlying political value distributions but rather a change in the rational interests of the parents, which

in turns manifests as “novel” political attitudes and/or behaviors.           It is also possible, however, that the

sex of offspring does shift those underlying values through social exposure. Namely, as women have

become more liberal (or Democratic) than men (Inglehart and Norris 2000; Norrander and Wilcox 2008),


2
  In this study we use gender and sex interchangeably for reasons of flow and rhythm in the prose; however, we are quite
aware that these are two distinct concepts.

                                                           2
having a daughter instead of a son can be considered as akin to having a new liberal member randomly

arriving in the family.   That said, given the difficulty of estimating causal effects of network influence

because of the endogeneity and reflection problems (Manski 1993), we cannot adjudicate between these

two possibilities. Either way, however, effects of offspring sex on parental political attitudes and

partisanship would certainly flip the usual view of social influence within the family as well as the

notion that political identities are fixed early in development and robust to novel social stimuli.

         We are not the first researchers to deploy this exogenous sex of offspring strategy; however, we

believe that our study improves on the shortcomings of those studies that have preceded this one.       For

example, Washington (2008) found that a Congressperson’s propensity to vote liberally – with respect to

reproductive right issues in particular – was augmented by having additional daughters. Glynn and Sen

(2014) found a similar effect in regards to decision making among U.S. Courts of Appeals judges:

judges with daughters more often voted in gender-related cases in feminist directions, though when they

extended this analysis to all issues they did not find that daughters significantly increased liberality

within the judiciary they studied. While these studies are intriguing, the study of political elites such as

judges and legislators introduces the possibility that left leaning districts or constituencies are more

likely to elect (or appoint) individuals with daughters while right leaning ones prefer their elected (or

appointed) officials to have sons. This would be interesting in its own right but ruins the presumptive

exogeneity of the offspring sex.

         That said, other recent studies using sex as a natural experiment have shown a significant

effects of offspring or sibling sex mix on party identification or political ideology even among the

general population. For instance, in the U.K., Oswald and Powdthavee (2010) found that having

daughters led parents to favor left-wing political parties and to hold more liberal views on family gender




                                                      3
roles.3     Likewise, Shafer and Malhotra (2011) found that having a daughter reduced men’s support for

traditional gender roles (but not women’s) based on analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of

Youth (NLSY 97). However, these results were contradicted by other research: in the United States,

Conley and Rauscher (2013) found that daughters were related to more Republican (rightist) party

identification and more conservative views on teen sexuality; likewise, Healy and Malhotra (2013)

found that having sisters caused men (but not women) to be more likely to identify as Republicans.

Conley and Rauscher (2013) suggest this effect may be an evolutionarily rational reaction, while Healy

and Malhotra (2013) emphasize the gender stereotyping of the childhood environment as a putative

casual mechanism.

            Even these studies that focus on non-select populations suffer from limitations. For instance,

with the exception of Conley and Rauscher (2013) and Oswald and Powdthavee (2010) each of them

considers the number of all children to be female. Thus, they introduce the possibility that liberal or

conservative individuals may have different parity progression biases when it comes to the sex of

offspring.      In other words, it is possible that conservatives and liberals (with respect to feminist issues

at least) may have different stopping rules when they have or have not achieved a certain representation

of sons or daughters among their offspring. This would reverse the causal arrow. (In fact, Oswald

and Powdthavee [2010] obtain insignificant results when they confine themselves to an examination of

the first born child only, which provides a solution to this problem.)                   Likewise, except for Conley and

Rauscher (2013) and Oswald and Powdthavee (2010), they do not distinguish between biological

offspring and step or adopted children. Marrying into a family with pre-existing boys or girls or

choosing to adopt a boy or girl oneself is certainly not an event that is plausibly exogenous to one’s

political ideology or partisan alignment.

            Despite these limitations and sometimes contradictory valences, if any of these studies are
3
    Likewise, Urbatsch (2011) found that having older sisters led to a more liberal ideology in the U.S..

                                                                 4
correct, such results not only challenge researchers who treat political predisposition as a right hand side

(i.e. causal) variable on other political outcomes4 but also call for revision and extension of political

socialization theory wherein children are merely perceived as objects of parental socialization who

develop political predispositions through a one-way learning process. Then, given that all studies can be

regarded as the same type of natural experiment (though with potentially critical differences in

specification), these significant-but-mixed results set up an interesting puzzle: why do they obtain

opposite effects?

          One plausible explanation is country or period heterogeneity (Sapiro 2004); that is, it might be

the case that the differential barriers that sons and daughters face and/or the gender split in political

ideology vary across countries and periods. For example, in a country without gender inequality or

gender differences in political partisanship parents do not need to change their political identity when

they have a son or daughter to maximize gender-specific policies to their liking nor do they become

systematically socialized by their children’s genders since there may not be any political differences by

gender in adults or children. Alternatively, it might be simply the case that significant effects are

obtained by chance (i.e. Type I error) and/or publication bias (we do not observe null effects in the

literature because they do not make it to press).

          To address these possibilities, we revisit the issue using independent samples to see whether

effects of offspring sex on parental political orientation are robust (or versatile) across periods and

countries and to test for the presence of systematically heterogeneous treatment effects. Multilevel

analysis as well as period and country fixed effect models based on cross-sectional samples are


4
  The so-called Michigan school defined party identification as “an individual’s affective orientation to an important
group-object in his environment” (Campbell et al. 1960: 121), implying that party identification is an “unmoved mover,” an
affective attachment to a group, which formed young, persists throughout the course of life cycle, and is relatively invariant
to the external shocks (Johnston 2006). By contrast, the so-called “revisionist perspective” considers party identification as
“running tally” of citizen evaluations of others’ political attitudes and events (Achen 2002; Fiorina 2002). However, Green
and colleagues show that the revisionists’ evidence is likely an artifact of measurement error (Donald Philip Green and
Palmquist 1990; Schickler and Green 1997).

employed to verify the direction and potential significance of an effect of the sex of the first born

offspring on both political ideology and partisan identification. To preview our results, we report null

findings throughout all analysis, find no heterogeneous treatment effects by subgroup, and thus question

the robustness of prior findings.



Data and Methods

          The 1972-2012 cross-sectional samples of the General Social Survey (GSS) and the 2002-2012

repeated cross section of the European Social Survey (ESS) provide a unique opportunity to investigate

the causal effects of sex of children on parent’s political views across social contexts.5 While the 1994

GSS sample used by Conley and Rauscher (2013) collects information on all of the respondents’ kids, it is

of limited scope both in terms of sample size (N=1,051) and period. By contrast, while the entire

GSS/ESS samples lack a complete fertility history, they do, however, contain information about all

children currently residing in the parental household, based on which we can infer the sex of the first child

in the household by contrasting the household census against the parental report of total number of

offspring. In the GSS, each household member’s relationship to the household head as evinced by the

household roster can be cross-referenced to the respondent’s relationship to the household head to infer

whether each household member is a child of the respondent by excluding respondents who were not the

household head.6 It was not necessary to apply this filter to the ESS, since the ESS assessed the

relationship of each household member with respondent directly. After detecting all children in the

household, we excluded respondents with no kids listed in their household roster. We additionally

excluded cases with missing values for the age or gender of any children as well as the cases of which two

 If the survey respondent is a spouse, we excluded these cases to prevent the possibility that spouse is not the biological
mother or father to the children of household head.

oldest children are the same age.7

          The treatment of interest under this study is the first child’s sex, which should be random given

the absence of prenatal sex-selection and gender-specific parity progression bias.8 However, in contrast

to the 1994 GSS sample used by Conley and Rauscher (2013), in our GSS multi-year sample and the ESS

sample we must address the potential concern that kids do leave their house for different reasons at

different times if we consider only children who live with their parent(s), although this criticism also could

apply to the previous studies using the same strategy (i.e.,Oswald and Powdthavee 2010). To minimize

this problem, we restrict our sample to parents whose oldest child is younger than 17 and thus likely to be

living at home and be captured in the household roster.9 Table 1 summarizes the sample selection

criteria; as a result of our analytic sample filters, in the GSS, 5,571 observations (9.8%) remain out of a

total potential N of 57,061 and roughly 20 % of cases remain in the ESS. Table S1 in Appendix reports

the variables’ wording and coding in the GSS and ESS, respectively.

                                                    [Table 1 about here]

          Dependent variables are intended to capture parents’ political orientations. In the first part of our

replication analysis, we adopted the same strategy as previous studies by measuring party identification.

We deploy two binary indicators for right-conservative (or Republican) and left-liberal (or Democratic)

party identification and one continuous scale for Republican (or right-conservative) party identification.

While survey instruments for measuring party identification differ between GSS and ESS and thus might

 They can be either a twin set, two consecutive births within twelve months of each other, or simply the result of
measurement error.
8
  Contrary to previous studies, we do not use the number of daughters after conditioning on the total number of children as
an instrument because it is only conditionally random unless there is no family-specific parity stopping rule. If there are
unobserved factors (i.e. son or daughter preference) that are related to the political orientation as well as the total number of
children, then the number or proportion of daughter is no longer random. We do not rely on this assumption because it is
fundamentally untestable, though using the proportion of daughters gives the same results (the results are not reported here,
but available upon request).
9
  In the GSS, the total number of kids is asked, and thus we additionally excluded those who report different values for the
numbers of all kids and those currently cohabiting.

                                                               7
not be comparable, these instruments are the same ones used in previous analyses (Oswald and

Powdthavee 2010)10 except for the one continuous variable for right party index in the ESS, which is

made by the combination of partisan attachment and party identification. In the second part of our analysis,

political ideology is the outcome of interest. However, due to the different scales in GSS and ESS

measuring the strength of political ideology, we transformed the variable into the percentage index from

-100% liberal to 100% conservative by centering and dividing it by its range.

           As for control variables, we do not expect the inclusion/exclusion of covariates to alter the

coefficients of estimates for the offspring sex effect if the sex of the eldest offspring is random (i.e.

orthogonal to other such factors). While it is reasonable to assume that children do not leave home until

the age of 16 (White 1994) and thus the eldest child’s sex is assumed to be random assignment within the

analytic sample consisting of the cases whose eldest child is younger than 17 and living at home, we also

show the estimates after accounting for several covariates to adjust remaining possible imbalances or

other omitted confounders. For example, it is possible that son preference would make fathers more

likely to live together with an eldest son than with a first born daughter(Dahl and Moretti 2008; Morgan,

Lye, and Condran 1988) ; or it could be the case that children of young parents (especially for mothers)

might leave home early (Murphy and Wang 1998). It is also possible that non-native born families

follow different rules for the timing of the offspring moving out of the parental home. Thus, parent’s age,

sex, an indicator for native born status, and age of the oldest child are included as pre-treatment

covariates, which could not be affected by our treatment variables. Additionally, we further adjust the

variables such as number of children, household size, years of completed formal schooling, marital status,


10
   For the UK case, the Conservative party is classified as Right-republican party, while the Labour and Liberal Democrat
parties as Left-liberal party. Due to the difficulty of classification of other parties on a unidimensional political left-right scale,
individual voters for other political parties are excluded in the analysis. Among 13,403, 50.29% (6,741) respond that they do
not feel closer to any particular political party and 2.13% (285) respond ‘don’t know/no answer.’ Among party identifiers,
2,077 (32.57%) are classified as Conservative and 2,731 (42.83%) and 826 (12.95%) are respectively identified as Labour
Party and Liberal Democrat, and 743 people (11.65%) who feel closer to other parties including Green Party and Scottish
National Party are dropped.

                                                                  8
labor force participation, and religion. However, these controls also could be post-treatment variables that

can be affected by the first child’s sex, which therefore should not be controlled for due to the possibility

of un-blocking the back-door path or masking the treatment effect.11 While it is possible that including

the post-treatment variables would produce biased estimates, we will show the robustness of our findings

against the inclusion of post-treatment variables, which can be a source of omitted variable biases.



Country heterogeneity

          To address the potential for country-specific heterogeneity,12 we deploy a multilevel regression

model (or mixed-effects model). The following model, with country-specific intercepts and slopes can

be used to measure the variance of country-specific treatment effects after accounting for pre-treatment

covariates.

                                  ‫ݕ‬௜௝ = (ߙ + ࣀ૚࢐ ) + ࢼ࢑ ࢄ࢏࢑ + ൫ߠ + ࣀ૛࢐ ൯ܶ௜௝ + ߳௜௝

          In this model, ‫ݕ‬௜௝ is political ideology and ܶ௜௝ is the treatment of interest for each individual i

in country j. We are primary interested in estimating two parameters; ߠ is the fixed coefficient for the

average treatment effect and ࣀ૛࢐ is the vector of random coefficients modeling the interactions between

country level indicators and the treatment variable (i.e. ࢄ࢏࢑ includes pretreatment covariates and survey

year dummies and ࣀ૚࢐ refers to the random intercept). To test whether treatment effects significantly

vary across countries, we estimate Var(ࣀ૛࢐ ) and test the null hypothesis of zero variance of the random

slope using the likelihood-ratio test (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2012, 197).




11
   For example, since daughters might increase the risk of marital disruption more than sons (Morgan, Lye, and Condran
1988), which in turn could affect the change of parents’ political views, controlling for current marital status can mask the
total effect of child’s gender.
12
   Because the number of available periods in the ESS is small (six at maximum), we cannot get reliable estimates for period
as level-2 unit and thus we focus on country heterogeneity in this analysis.

                                                             9
Identification and Inference Issues

         While we believe that the sex of the first child should be random given the absence of prenatal

sex-selection, non-differentiation between biological and adopted/step kids might raise identification

problems. To address this potential concern, Table 2 reported the results from regressing of pre/post

covariates on the sex of the first child. The parent’s sex, age, and the country of birth and generational

age gap show no significant relationships with the sex of the first child in either the GSS or ESS samples,

which supports the validity of our identification strategy. When it comes to post-treatment variables

such as years of education (since child sex may affect the educational continuation decisions of parents),

labor force status, and religion (to the extent that this is a fluid identification), they are statistically

significantly associated with the first child’s sex. Thus, we cannot know whether parental education or

religion is being affected by child sex or whether they are, by contrast, affecting the sex of offspring.

As the countries in ESS and the U.S. are not known to engage in antenatal sex-selection, the sex of the

first child should be exogenous to any particular political tendency. Nevertheless, to account for the

remaining imbalance that may be due to adopted or step children, we include post-treatment variables as

well in our statistical models; results are indifferent to their inclusion or exclusion and we show both in

the tables.

                                          [Table 2 is about here]

         The external validity of our estimates may be another potential concern. To increase internal

validity (i.e. make sure the full census of offspring are measured), only those who have at least one

(eldest) child who is younger than 17 are included in our analytic sample. We may be identifying

effects that are not generalizable to all families (i.e. most notably, to those with eldest children ages 17

or over). This is an important limitation since it may be the case that party identification is only

affected by offspring gender while the children are minors residing the parental home and that when



                                                    10
they set up their own households and contact is reduced, parents revert to the “pre-treatment” political

ideology.

                                              [Figure 1 is about here]

          Figure 1 illustrates the mean difference between the original sample and the analytic sample

expressed in standard deviation units of the original sample (also see Table S2 in Appendix). While

there are no discernible differences for our major outcome and treatment variables (less than 0.2 SD

different), the analytic samples consist of parents who have more children and thus a larger size of

household (which is self-evident because we exclude those who have no children) and whose eldest

child is young and, by extension, who are young themselves (because we limit the sample to those

whose oldest child is younger than 17), more educated, currently married and currently working. The

notable difference between the ESS and GSS samples is with respect to the gender of parent; in the U.S.

men are slightly more likely to be in the sample as compared to the U.K. sample or the ESS more

generally. This is mainly because we only include the household head. If the sex of child is random

within any particular group, then the in-sample estimates can be identified at least as local causal

estimates.



Results

Party Identification

          Table 3, below, reports the replication results from estimating the effects of daughters on party

identification. In the U.K., daughters tend to make their parents closer to right-conservative

(Conservative) party; if parents have a girl for their first child, they are more likely to lean toward

right-conservative (Conservative) party. However, the size of effects of the first child’s sex is quite small:

a first born girl leads to a 2.5 percentage point increase in Conservative party identification, and the



                                                     11
effects are insignificant. That said, these effects are statistically indistinguishable from zero. Though

these insignificant effects may merely reflect the smaller sample size relative to Oswald and

Powdthavee’s (2010) sample, it is notable that they are in the opposite direction of those authors’ results.

This contradictory direction of effect may reflect period differences; the British Household Panel Survey

(BHPS) that they used covers the period from 1991 to 2005, whereas the European Social Survey spans

the years 2002 to 2012. When we restrict our analysis to the overlapping period only in order to account

for potential period difference (2002-2004; see Table S3), we find that our opposite effect holds and, in

fact, becomes larger. So at the very least, the bottom line is that we failed to replicate their findings in

an independent sample.

                                  [Table 3 and Figure 2 are about here]

         Likewise, the effects in the U.S. are substantially smaller than the previous report by Conley

and Rauscher (2013) and are also insignificant in our larger sample of pooled waves of the GSS. We

examine the possibility of the period heterogeneity in Figure 2 based on our constructed GSS sample.

Despite the small sample size in each period, the daughter’s effect in 1994, when Conley and Rauscher

(2013) found the substantial and significant effect, is statistically significant with the same direction.

However, we also find significant effects of the first child’s sex in 2002 and 2004; however, these effects

work in the opposite direction as those in 1994. While periods when the Presidency is held by a

Democrat tend to show the negative coefficients in general (and vice versa), we cannot identify a

statistically discernible patterns across periods for the U.S. case. In general, we find statistically null

effects of offspring sex on party identification both in the US and the UK.

         To assess the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects, we test the interaction effects with

pre-treatment variables including parent’s sex, age, an indicator for native-born, and the age of oldest

child. For example, previous studies showed the effects of daughters were stronger or only significant to



                                                    12
fathers (Glynn and Sen 2014; Healy and Malhotra 2013; Shafer and Malhotra 2011), which indicates the

possibility that mother may not be affected by her daughter because she has already grown up with a

feminine point of view. Table 4 and Figure S1 in Appendix show the general absence of significant

interaction effects. This evidence evinces the possibility that previous significant findings might have

been obtained by chance13.

                                                  [Table 4 is about here]

Political Ideology

          Next we turn to political ideology. The effects of the first child’s sex in the 1994 GSS sample

are reported in Table 5. It shows the direction of effects is with what we would expect from the previous

study; daughters make their parents more conservative in the U.S. Nevertheless, the effect in the U.S.

might reflect the peculiarity of 1994 sample as we demonstrated in Figure 2 or small sample sizes.

These period and sample size concerns thus lead us to exploit the bigger sample size that the pooled

GSS and ESS datasets provide.

                                             [Table 5 and 6 are about here]

          Table 6 reports results from analyses of these pooled data. The effects of the first sex of child

are not only insignificant, but also the point estimates are themselves much closer to zero (e.g., 5.994 vs

1.047 in GSS). How small are these effects if they were significant? Having an eldest daughter instead

of an eldest son would lead to a one percentage point increase in right leaning political ideology score in

the U.S. and 0.3 percentage point decrease in the ESS sample. But, of course, these estimates are not

statistically discernable from the null of zero effect.


13
   Due to the potential concern for multiple hypothesis testing, misspecification of functional forms and the curse of
dimensionality when estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, we also employed the modified version of the Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees (BART) model developed by Green and Kern (2012), which reduces researcher discretion by
automating the detection of nonlinear relationships and interactions (for technical details, please see Hill (2011) and Chipman,
George, and McCulloch (2010)). Figure S1 in Appendix reports the results from estimating heterogeneous treatment effects
interacting with pre-treatment covariates and provides the supportive evidence for the lack of significant heterogeneous
treatment effects; that is, effects across subgroups rarely change and 95% posterior intervals always include zero.

                                                              13
                                               [Table 7 is about here]

         As with the case of party identification, we test for heterogeneous treatment effects by

interacting pre-treatment variables including parent’s sex, age, an indicator for native-born, and the age

of oldest child. Table 7 and Figure S2 in the Appendix report the general absence of significant

interaction effects for these models. One rare exception is those who were born in the U.S are more

likely to change their political ideology toward conservative by having a daughter, but the issues of

multiple hypothesis testing would make the finding less convincing.

                                      [Figure 3 is about here]

         To examine the possibility of country-specific heterogeneity, we estimate the effects of the first

child’s sex on the political ideology in each ESS country.       Figure 3 summarizes three estimates by

estimating models that include no controls, pre-treatment controls, post-treatment controls. (Countries

are ordered by their sample sizes.) Null effects are observed in almost all countries except for Italy,

Latvia, and Croatia for which sample sizes are small and thus sampling variabilities are large.        Since

the effect size appears to be strangely large given the small sample size in those countries, the significant

effects might simply result from the aberrations specific to those time periods in those countries. And, of

course, none of these survive a Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing. (The presence of

thirty-six countries in the analysis means that the proper p-value cut-off should be p<.0014.)

                                          [Table 8 is about here]

         Table 8 shows the results from testing the zero variance of random coefficients among 35

countries (except for the United States) using multilevel analysis. The coefficient estimates for the first

child’s sex do not differ from the coefficients of the country-fixed effect model and do not change

irrespective of the choice between random intercept and/or random coefficient models. The

log-likelihood ratio test under the null hypothesis of zero variance of random slope variances (0.32 SD)



                                                     14
shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis (p-value =0.58). This confirms the null patterns in Figure

3—namely, that the treatment effects across countries do not statistically vary14.



Discussion

          Despite the allegedly stable nature of party identification (especially during adulthood), two

recent studies showed that the sex of child may induce a change in parental party identification.

Namely, Oswald and Powdthavee (2010) found that daughters tend to make their parents alter their party

identification toward left-liberal in the U.K., whereas Conley and Raushcer (2013) found the opposite in

U.S. data. We re-examined these results using the GSS and ESS and found no statistical discernible

effect of the first child’s sex on party identification in either the U.S. or the U.K. – where significant

effects on party identification were reported – nor on parental political ideology in 36 countries.

Further, evidence for heterogeneous treatment effects across differences parental gender, native-born

status and age, as well as the oldest child’s age, turned out to be weak.                  As we have shown above, the

prior findings were more likely discovered due to period heterogeneity than because of country

heterogeneity. Eliminating the possibility of country-level heterogeneity is supported by the same null

findings we obtain by adopting the same analytic strategy and using Korean General Social Survey (see

Table S4 in Appendix) -- though we would not interpret models for Korean evidence as causal estimates

as in the case of Europe and the U.S. due to the knowingly greater prevalence of prenatal sex-selection

in Korea. Moreover, as Figure S3 in Appendix shows, the significant associations between the sex of

the first child and the parent’s political ideology or party identification can be obtained by chance



14
   As a fishing expedition to confirm that we were not missing any effects, we test whether the effects of daughters on
political ideology (i.e. the country-specific point estimate) are significantly related to various plausible country factors. For
instance, it is reasonable to suspect a link between the level of women’s rights in each country and the strength of the
daughter effect. To address this possibility, we relate country level coefficient estimates to 32 country level factors from the
ESS MD-Country level data. Results (are not shown, but available upon request) confirm that the effect of the first child’s
sex at country level is not significantly related to any country level factor.

                                                              15
(especially in 2009), and thus researchers might mistakenly conclude that having a daughter would make

Korean parents liberal if they only looked at 2009 sample.

            However, we do not simply argue that previous significant effects should be ignored as wrong

because it is also possible that the significant effects of daughters on parental political predisposition

may be obtained again by future studies employing other independent samples using the same analytic

strategy.    Indeed, it remains possible that, as Warner (1991) and Washington (2008) argue, parents may

actively (or subconsciously) take a daughter’s perspective and become more sympathetic to women’s

issues or even take actions toward that end, such as voting for that child’s interests. Or, as Conley and

Rauscher (2013) argue, having a daughter may trigger her parent’s instinct to constrain her sexuality and

thus induce more conservative views of teenage sexuality. While these suggested mechanisms could

explain the change of specific political views, neither mechanism can explain the change of party

identification as a whole given the heterogeneity of issue-partisanship correlations and the heterogeneity

of political preferences across groups of voters (Baldassarri and Gelman 2008; Baldassarri and Goldberg

2014).      In other words, since party identification (or political ideology) -- either as an identity or a

summary measurement of a matrix of beliefs – consists of multiple dimensions of issues and attitudes, a

change of attitude in some issues may not be sufficient to trigger a change in a whole set of political

attitudes measured by party identification or political ideology.

            Several limitations of the present study are worth noting. One of limitation is that we could

not isolate the effects of biological child versus adopted/step child with the samples we used.        It is

possible that there exist indeed treatment effects, but they are cancelled out by the association between

political ideology and willingness to adopt or marry into a family with daughters (or sons). Another

limitation is related to the timing heterogeneity.    Because of the cross-sectional nature of our sample,

we cannot rule out the possibility that the effect of having a daughter varies across the different moments



                                                      16
and time in entire life-course despite the insignificant interaction effects with the age of respondent or

oldest child were reported. Notably, it may also be applied to the longitudinal design because we never

know the exact timing of the effect.

         Another challenge is related to the challenge in estimating small effects (Gelman and Weakliem

2009). Since the size of effects in social science studies is expected to be modest in general, statistical

power (or sample size) should be large enough to detect the small or modest effects.          For example,

Urbatsch (2011) found that having older sisters leads to a more liberal ideology based on 1994 GSS

sample (N=1,783), whereas Healy and Malhotra (2013) found that having sisters causes men to be more

likely to identify as Republicans using the Political Socialization Panel in 1965, 1973, 1997 (N=330)

and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 in 2006, 2008 (N=1,668). Our null findings would

suggest the possibility that these mixed findings in the same country using the same instruments might

originate from the oddities of small samples or the period heterogeneity and/or publication bias.      As a

corrective to this source of bias, we here add comprehensive null findings to already polarized canon of

significant results.

         Our null results should have important implications for the debate on the stability of political

predisposition.    Prior research suggesting an effect of offspring sex on political ideology and

partisanship seriously challenged the paradigm suggesting that political identity formed early in

childhood (largely through parental socialization and/or genetic inheritance) and was subsequently

immovable. Our challenge to those empirical claims that adult parents’ political orientation were

affected by the random assignment of offspring sex does not, by extension, mean necessarily that

political identity in adulthood is immovable; rather, our obtaining of consistently null results should prod

researchers who wish to make the fluidity argument to find additional, more robust evidence to bolster

their case.

NOTE. 1) In GSS, sex of R's children can be ascertained only if R is the household head because GSS asked the
relationship of each household member to the head of household, whereas ESS asked the relationship of each
household member to R directly. 2) Parent's age must be higher at least 10 years old than oldest kid's age, and thus it
must reflect the coding error. 3) This case may be twins or two consecutive births, but we exclude these cases to
ascertain the sex of one eldest child. 4) In GSS, it is the case that the total number of R's children (childs) is not
equal to the number of children in household, whereas it is unidentified in ESS. 5) In analytic sample, we
additionally dropped the cases with missing covariates and dependent variables.
