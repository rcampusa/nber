                                       ABSTRACT




      This paper exploits producer's        first    order      conditions to link asset

prices   to data    on   investment,    output,     etc.    through      marginal rates   of

transformation,    just as consumer's     first order      conditions     are commonly used

to link asset prices to consumption data or proxies through marginal rates of

substitution.   It presents simulation      economies      analogous     to the consumption

based models of Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Backus, Gregory and                Ziri (1986)

that capture the size of the equity premium and the size and cyclical timing

of   the forward rate term premium.

L    Introduction



      Much of the current theory of asset pricing is based on the consumer's

first order conditions,

                            u'
                                 (c+i)
       1 â€” p                                                                                  (1)
             Et      Rt+l
                              u   (ce)

where   Rt+l   is the return on an asset and p is the consumer's discount factor.

This equation can-be derived from the statement that the consumer's marginal

rate of substitution between date and state contingent claims should be equal

to   the   price    ratio   of such claims.         This paper explores the         equivalent

equation for prc ucers, which can be derived from the condition that the

marginal rate of transformation between date and State contingent claims

should also equal           their    price ratio.      Its purpose        is   to   provide    an

empirically tractable framework for linking asset returns to macroeconomic

fluctuations.




       There is a great deal- of evidence that such links exist: term premia in

the bond market, futures premia in the foreign exchange market,                       and risk

premia in      the stock market vary through time and                 are correlated with

macroeconomic variables.            (See, among others, Hansen and Hodrick (1983), Fama

and Eliss (1987), Chen, Roll and Ross (1986), and Ferson (1986)).                     The most

common approach to explaining these results              uses   (1)   to link asset price

phenomena to        consumption data or state variables presumed to                   determine

consumption,       but this approach has not been particularly successful to date.

As a result,       a great deal of work on the         specification of the consumption
based model is in progress,         including durability,        continuous time, a variety

of     consumption     goods,     new    forms    for     the    utility     function     (state

nonseparability, habit persistence), lack of perfect consumption insurance,

heterogeneous consumers, borrowing constraints,               money, etc.



       One difficulty in empirically implementing consumption based models is

that they      require    information on         how    the   conditional distribution of

consumption varies over time and in response to the events of the business

cycle.      But business cycles are a prominent phenomenon of output,                   durables

purchases, investment,          inventories, employment etc.       ,   not   of nondurable or

services consumption. To illustrate the relative smoothness of consumption,

Fig.   1 presents the log values of consumption of nondurables and services

together with gross fixed private investment and purchases of consumer

durables.      Also,   as Wilcox (1988) has recently emphasized,               the concept of

consumption in the theoretical models corresponds weakly to the quantities

used in the income and product accounts,               especially when they are seasonally

adjusted. Furthermore, deviations from optimal decision rules that are large

enough to destroy empirically useful predictions about the cyclical relation

between consumption and           asset returns can imply minute              utility    costs.

Cochrane (1988) calculates this utility loss for a variety of models,                        and

finds that it is typically on the order                 of lc-lOC per quarter,      which is

interpreted to say that the predictions of the theory are sensitive to the

modelling of small (lQ-1OC/quarter) costs of                    information acquisition or

processing, transactions,        etc..




       This paper doesn't attempt to solve these                  or other      problems with

                                         2
consumption based models.       Instead it ties the important cyclical variables

such as output, investment,     etc. directly to asset prices via the producer's

first   order    conditions,   completely ignoring their      tie   to   (or   through)

nondurable consumption using the consumer's first order conditions.



     Of course,     one   hopes to eventually produce an empirically tractable

general equilibrium model of asset prices and economic fluctuations, one that

includes consumer and producer first order conditions and market equilibrium,

because partial equilibrium models cannot explore the effects of fundamental

sources of uncertainty, such as changes in technology or government policy.

(Brock (1982) is an example of a prototype general equilibrium model with

production,     and the model in this paper is closely related to the production

side of Brock's model.)



     However, the behavior of asset prices in general equilibrium depends on

a mixture     of preference and technological parameters, so it is hard to

understand the mapping between the structure of a general equilibrium model

and the qualitative features of the asset prices that result.             Hence,   as a

great many insights into the behavior of a complete general equilibrium model

appear from the consumer's first order conditions alone, ignoring producers,

so many insights may appear from the corresponding producer's first order

conditions,     ignoring consumers.       By studying the empirical implications of

each set of first order conditions separately before uniting them, we can

learn about preferences and technology in isolation,       and this should simplify

the task of producing empirically useful general equilibrium models.




                                      3
     Either consumer or producer first order conditions describe restrictions

between the stochastic processes followed by real variables and asset prices

or returns.    Just as (1) describes a relation that must hold between asset

returns and consumption no matter what the production technology,               so producer

first order conditions t(lO)        below] describe a relation that must hold

between   asset   returns     and   production variables        no     matter    what    the


preferences.



     These restrictions can be exploited empirically in three ways.                 First,

we can model the stochastic process for quantities, derive the process for

prices, and compare those prices or the corresponding returns to data.                  This

is Mehra and Prescott's (1985) approach,           or the approach of any empirical

implementation of Lucas' (197S) asset pricing model to data generated by a

production economy. (Models that are based on (1) are often called "general

equilibrium     following     Lucas.        However,   the   stochastic       process    for

consumption in an economy with storage or production is not exogenous as in

Lucas' model, so when these models are applied to real data,                  they in fact

only exploit partial equilibrium relationships.)             Second,    we can model the

stochastic process for prices, derive what the quantity process should be,

and compare those quantities to data.            This is the approach of permanent

income theory and the Q-theory of investment.          Third, we can model the joint

stochastic    process   for    prices      and   quantities and        test   whether    the

restrictions implied by the first order condition hold.                This is Hansen and

Singleton's (1983) approach.



     The simulations of sections 3 and 4 use the first approach to see if the

                                       4
size of the equity premium and the size and cyclical timing of the forward

rate term premium are       consistent with data on      investment and consumer

durables purchases, using a simple specification of technology.        The purpose

of this paper, like that of Mehra and Prescott's paper, is to see whether

there exist simple and approximate models with "reasonable" parameters and

functional forms     that are   capable    of   explaining a   few well-documented

phenomena, before proceeding to the construction of detailed (and hence,

unavoidably, complex) models that can be formally tested.         This paper finds

that there are such production-based models,        as Mehra and Prescott argued

that there are no such consumption based models.



        A test assesses whether a model,    including its auxiliary specification
and statistical assumptions, is capable of explaining all phenomena for which

one can derive predictions. In particular,       the model presented in this paper

and Mehra and Prescott's model have implications for asset prices beyond the

first    two moments, and those implications are ignored.      In both cases,   the

models are so simple that one can derive the prices for contingent claims,

and thus one can deduce all moments of asset returns and the prices of all

derivative securities.    A literally-minded formal test of either model would

investigate whether all these     predictions are satisfied, and such a test

would certainly reject the models in sec. 3 and 4 of this paper as well as

Mehra and Prescott's model.     The exercise of both papers is a prelude to, and

not a substitute for,     formal testing and the search for specification and

statistical assumptions that can hope to pass such formal testing.         Such a

test is under construction, in the form of a test whether the physical rates

of return on a few technologies can act as factors for stock returns.

   Mat      Prices and Producer's      fl            Conditions



       Producers' first order conditions state that the marginal rate of

transformation between state and date contingent claims achievable by varying

investments in a variety of technology must be equal to the price ratios of

such claims implicit in asset prices and payoffs.                       Alternately, they state

that firms should adjust investment,              production, etc.             until they can no

longer short a portfolio of assets that mimics the pattern of returns across

states      of nature     provided by      a   marginal unit           of    investment in          their

technology,     invest     the     proceeds in their technology,                and make       a    sure

(marginal) profit.         Thus,    they state that physical returns must lie in the

space of asset returns, and so act as factors for asset returns.                                    This

section reviews these statements of producer's first order conditions in a

simple environment with            discrete time,    a   finite number               of   states,     and

complete markets.         None of these elements are essential, but they simplify

the mathematics and they establish the               formulas used in the simulation

economies that follow.

(1987) derive this representation in a more general setting.                                  Here it is just

an accounting relation that must hold between asset prices and contingent

claim prices. The calculations that follow use either consumer or producer

first order conditions to identify the contingent claim prices,                                         and then

characterize asset returns from the contingent claim prices via (3)1

With these definitions,              the first order conditions (7) become

operate each technology up to the point where the marginal cost equals the

marginal benefits, and direct the firm to adjust investment so that the

physical returns i(st) lie in the space of asset returns RA(st) defined by

(3). This is illustrated in Fig. 2.




       Consumer first order conditions state that


                          â€”
                                            if

with   obvious modifications as the utility function is varied.                              Using (11) we
can identify the contingent claims prices from the consumption process, and

then characterize asset returns using (3).                         This is how (1) is derived.



        When there are N technologies,                      the producer first order conditions (10)

allow us to identify an N-l dimensional subspace of the S-l dimensional space

of asset returns at each                      date,    so long as the physical returns i(st)            are

linearly independent. The simulation economies that follow use a number of

technologies N equal to the multiplicity of states                            5,   in which case we can

recover contingent claims prices from the                                returns on   technologies, and

construct asset returns from those contingent claim prices.                                  Since by (3)

asset returns lie in a plane orthogonal to the vector of contingent claims

prices (see Fig. 2),                    one    finds       contingent claims prices analytically by

finding the vector orthogonal to the given plane. Let R(st) be an NxS matrix,
             â€”                          and let 1 be an            Sxl    matrix of   l's.     With     this
ij(st)            R.(st,stA),
notation, (10) can be rewritten

        1   â€”    R(s) (t)
        Then,we            can solve (10) for the contingent claims prices,

              t

                       -     t-l- 1


        We      can use        (12)         to produce an equation that looks            like    (1),     to

illustrate the equivalence of consumer and producer based models in this

case,

and p(st,st+l) is derived from production data by (12).



       The simulation economies that follow adopt a parametric form of the

above model, with two technologies for transferring consumption across dates,

fixed investment and purchases of consumer durables,                       and two states A1 and A2

at each date, high and low investment growth.                      Each technology has constant

returns    to scale in production,              but an adjustment cost to investment.                The

technologies are:

consumption based models,            the marginal products could be made stochastic by

making them depend on the state.

Unlike the Mehra-Prescott model, it is not sufficient to characterize the

current state history      s by just            the current draw of the investment growth

state         because the capital stock at any date is a function of a long past

moving average of investment.                                                    are sufficient state

     The simulations proceed as follows.                   1) Model the stochastic process of

investment growth as a two state Markov process; 2) use (14) to find the one-

or many period ahead physical returns at each date; 3) use (15) to derive one

or several period ahead contingent claim prices; 4) use the contingent claim

prices to      construct the       asset        returns     of      interest.

     A well documented puzzle of the consumption based asset pricing model is

that the difference in mean returns between stocks and relatively risk free

bonds is higher than predicted, without resorting to implausibly high risk

aversion and discount factors              greater than 1.                Shiller (1982),      Mehra and

Prescott (1985)       and Hansen        and Jagannathan              (1988)      contain   successively

sharper statements of this puzzle.



                                           12
        The consumer's first order conditions (1) imply that higher variance of

marginal rates of substitution (u'(c+i)/u'(c)) generate a more steeply

sloped mean-standard deviation frontier of asset returns. Observations on the

returns     of s stock portfolio and a risk-free rate imply a lower bound on the

slope of          the       mean-standard deviation frontier-             -   lower   because   the   stock

portfolio may not be efficient,                       or perfectly correlated with consumption

growth.     Hence one can deduce a lower bound on the volatility of marginal

rates     of      substitution and (along with data on                         consumption growth)     the

coefficient of risk aversion from the slope of the mean-standard deviation

frontier.          This is an attractive statement of the Mehra-Prescott puzzle,

because it does not require us to identify stocks with an asset that pays a

dividend equal to aggregate consumption,                        as Mehra and Prescott assumed.



        In this section, I'll contrast an approach to this puzzle using consumer

vs. producer first order conditions.                           It will be simpler and will highlight

the   symmetry of the two approaches to first derive the slope                              of the mean

standard deviation frontier given contingent claims prices,                                and then use

consumer's or producer's first order conditions to identify those contingent

claims prices from consumption or production data.

      Note that                 the frontiers are linear, as we expect given the existence of

a risk free rate.                        Also,   if consumers are risk neutral, so that state prices

are   proportional to probabilities--the price and probability vectors are

colinear--the slope of the mean-standard deviation frontier reduces to                                                        0,   as

it should.             (To see this,             substitute p(st,st+l) â€”                                          where       is an

arbitrary constant,                       into (17) or (18).                         Hansen and Richard (1987) give an

similar characterization of the conditional and unconditional mean-standard

deviation frontier.)



Using Consumption to Identify the Frontier

      Substituting the                         consumer's first order conditions (11)                                   in for the

contingent claims prices in (18)                                   ,   we relate               the   slope of the conditional
mean-standard deviation frontier to                                             the    variance of         marginal rates of
substitution:

      We can use (20) to calculate bounds on the coefficient of risk aversion

       Table 1 presents summary statistics on CRSP               stock   portfolio returns and

consumption growth in postwar quarterly data.                Each stock return in Table 1

yields a ratio of mean excess return to its standard                deviation       ji/u   of   about

.2.     Shiller (1982) reports          â€”     .279   for the S&P500.       Using   j/      â€”    .2 and

the consumption   growth statistics         from table    1, (21) implies

            .00854 (5 + .712)

If the risk aversion coefficient really is 20.6, then we need to reconcile


            â€”                         l/(l-aE(c/c)) â€”       l/(1-(20.6)(.00854)) â€” 1.21.
                l/E{(c+l/ct)]
With   Râ€”       1.0019   (the T-bill rate
                                              -   CPI in table    1), this requires that the

discount factor p            1.21.   or a neagtive discount rate of about -21% per

quarter.     A more conventional value for p, near but below                1,   requires a mean

real interest rate near 21% per quarter.



        To perform a similar calculation that recognizes the difference between

conditional and unconditional probabilities, I fit a two state Markov process

to consumption growth rates, following Mehra and Prescott.                        The two states

are growth above average and growth below average.                       I picked the value of


consumption growth in each state to be one standard deviation above or below

the mean.       Since the unconditional frequencies of each state are .50 in the

data,     this choice of growth rates              maintains the     unconditional mean and

variance of growth rates in the data.



         With the probability structure and growth rates of consumption in each

                                                                                 that follows      s.
 state    specified, we know c(stst+l) for each State

                                         16
Then,    we can identify contingent claims prices from consumption using (11),

plug (11) into to (18) to -get the (conditional)                        slope of the mean-standard

deviation frontier at each date, and then use either (17) or (19) to get the

unconditional slope.             Table 2 summarizes the results of this simulation for

various values of the risk aversion parameter, from 1 to 45. Values of the

unconditional slope (/A/) around .2 as in table 1 correspond to a more than

20.     Table 2 also presents the calculation of p times                      the conditional risk

free rate from the consumption model.                       Again,   values of a that generate the

observed slope of the mean standard deviation frontier also generate a "too

large"    PRf.          Furthermore, values of the a that reconcile the slope of the

mean-standard deviation frontier generate real interest rates that vary                        over
time or across states far more than is observed.




Using The Firm's First Order Conditions to Identify the Frontier

        The    technologies are specified in (13).                    Table 3 presents the Markov

matrix for investment growth used in the simulations. I chose the values of

the growth rates in each state to match the unconditional mean and variance

of investment growth in the postwar period.                      This choice requires

var g is the unconditional variance of growth rates.                          (22)   and (23) imply

that the growth rates in the two             states     are

        Before       proceeding with          simulations,           it's    worthwhile          to   see    how

qualitative features of this technology and probability specification map

into slopes of the          conditional and unconditional mean-standard deviation

frontiers.           The first task is to find the                    qualitative behavior of the

physical returns           and Kd defined in (14).                   When adjustment costs a â€” 0 or

the investment to capital ratio
                                (I/kt)
                                                          â€”
                                                               0,     the physical returns collapse

to    (1+mp)(1-6)      in both states           (I     eliminate the k             or    d     subscript when

referring to either         k   or d simultaneously). As the investment to capital

ratio            rises,   the last term in (14) lowers the physical return                                  into

both states, because it raises current period adjustment costs. As tomorrow's

investment to capital ratio                              rises,      the first term in (14) raises

the physical return        ,    because       the firm   gets       the benefit of higher adjustment

costs    tomorrow when disinvesting.                   Hence,       R(high growth) > R(low growth).

Fig. 3 illustrates R(st,          s)            g is    an element of         2,    corresponding to the

two   possible       states at tÃ·l.       R(high growth) > R(low growth) implies that

will lie below the 45Â° line, as in Fig.                  3.




        We want to derive the behavior of physical returns                                   as a function of

state variables et time t.            A   higher investment to capital ratio today                          1/k
implies a higher investment to capital ratio                               tomorrow
                                                                                         IÃ·1/k+1       as well

raising both investment to capital ratios,                                   and                      cancel to

first order, as explained in the last paragraph.                           The major effect of raising

the investment to capital ratio today                           is thus to increase the disparity

between the returns in the two states tomorrow, R(st,A1) awl R(st,A2), rather

than affecting the level of both.               Hence, K(I/k) behaves as follows (refer to

                     â€”       0, a   starts at         â€”   (l+mp)(l-6)    in both states,         or a

                                                            in the two states,       rather than
sideways,     increasing the disparity between

toward or away from the origin, which would reflect an overall decrease or

        Now we are in a position to graphically evaluate how big a slope of the

mean-standard deviation frontier will be generated by given parameters: we

know how production function parameters map into the position of                           and        on
                                                                                     R.K         ad

them;    the contingent claims prices are orthogonal to that line;                  and the slope

of the mean-standard deviation frontier is proportional to the deviation of

the contingent claims price vector from the probability vector.




        We're   looking for evidence that the price and probability vectors

diverge enough to generate the observed slope of the mean-standard deviation

frontier,     so it is useful to start with parameterizations that ensure no

premium,    and tharacterize more realistic parameterizations by their departure

from a no-premium configuration. Since the probabilities of various states

do not directly enter the technology as they do into expected utility, there

is no way as simple or as general as setting the coefficient of risk aversion

to 0 to guarantee that price and probability are colinear.



     The following choice of parsmeters guarantees that contingent claims

pricea will be colinear with probabilities and hence that there will be no

equity     premium. First,           assume       that there     are   no   adjustment        costs     to

investment in consumer durables,                   giving investment in consumer durables a

risk free return,        like storage.             The physical return for consumer dursble

simplifies to:

                       â€” (1 + mpd )(l         -        â€”
     Rd(st,scÃ·l)                                  6d
Second, linearize the return of capital about the                           mean growth rate of

investment.        Fig. 3 suggests that this is not a bad approximstion for small

       [p(stA)     p(st,A2)]          [



      Now,    what choices of             [dg1       dg2   give rise to prices colinear with

probabilities? We need


                                               (Alst)
       [ -dg2 dg1   ]        [ ir(A1st)                    ]

or

       lr(Alst) dg1           (Alt)       dg2


Comparing to (22), choices of dg1 and dg2 that maintain the mean                                growth   rate

at     also ensure that prices and               probabilities    are collinear.



       Now we can examine what features of a more realistic technology account

for deviation of the price and probability vectors. First, the linearization

in (24)      may   fail.         This has a very small            effect for a wide range of

reasonable parameters, as reflected in the small curvature of the (I/k) line


                                                21
in Fig. 3.          Second,         the "persistence effect":         as the Markov matrix governing

investment growth displays mote persistence3, the conditional probabilities

diverge from the unconditional probabilities and the contingent claim prices,

raising the equity premium.                     Third, the "shift effect": the constant term

               in (24) will vary over time as capital is accumulated, even if it is
Rk(st,g)

identical to Rj â€”              (1   -
                                        8d1   + mpd)        at one date.     Changes in this term shift

the point about which the deviations                                        are taken,   so that even if
                                     [dg1                           dg2J

investment growth is independent over time,                                contingent claim prices and

probabilities will diverge.



          With this in mind,               we can turn to some simulations.               I examined the

values          â€”   1,         â€” 10 and            â€”   0.     The Q-theory literature supports much

higher values for                        but the high values common in that literature are

regarded as a puzzle.                   I picked a value 6d â€”        .08 for   the depreciation rate of

durables,       and mpd â€” .10 for the marginal product of consumer durables. These

always enter together;                     they imply that             and the risk free rate are

                      â€” 1.012           (4% per year),       and have no other effects.      I chose the
(l+mpd)(l.Sd)
                                                                â€” .025 (10% per year). I chose the
depreciation rate of capital to be

marginal product of capital so that if capital is at its steady state value
      â€”                                                                                           Thus in

the steady state, there is no "shift effect".                                 With the other parameter

values,        it implies mpk              â€” .038144.           I   found very little difference in

experimenting with a wide range                         of mpk and           so long as their product

                      is the same.

          I   calculated the              conditional and unconditional slopes of the mean

standard deviation frontier in the following way:                         I    simulated investment

growth from a random number generator; then at each date,                               I   accumulated

capital, calculated     _R.K
                               and       using (14), calculated the contingent claims

prices each date using (15),             and calculated the slope of the conditional

mean-standard       deviation      frontier      using        (18).    Then      I     calculated   the

unconditional slope using (19), averaging the conditional moments over time.

This procedure yields small variations in the unconditional slope each time

due to sampling variation, so            I    report the average of ten such simulations

for each parameter choice.           Table 3 presents a flowchart of this simulation.



        Table 3 also presents the results of the simulatiors.                        The column marked

"force"     indicates whether the            certainty return on investment _R,(st,) in

(24), is forced to be          â€”                        at each date to eliminate the "shift
                                     (l+mPd)(lSd)
effect".    This is achieved by multiplying                   by a suitable constant at each
date.      The column marked "persistence"              indicates     whether the assumed Markov

matrix is the actual one ("yes") or a matrix with no persistence, formed by

the unconditional probabilities of each state ("no").                         When "force" is "yes"

and "persistence" is "no", the only thing that makes price and probability

vectors diverge is nonlinearities in
                                                 .       As the table shows, these have very

small    effects.   With "force" â€” "no" and "persistence" â€”                      "yes",     we see that

persistence in investment growth alone raises the unconditional slope to the

range     of its observed values.             "Force"    by    itself has a           smaller effect.

Finally,    with "force" â€”     "yes"   and "persistence" â€”            "yes",    we again get results

similar to those estimated from the data.                   This slope is slightly less than

the value for "force" â€”        "no" and      "persistence"      â€”   "yes",     which initially seems

puzzling.     There are states where the conditional slope is very low--prices

                                         23
and conditional probabilities are essentially colinear.                   Adopting "force"         â€”

"yes"    to minimize the risk premium based on unconditional probabilities

raises the conditional risk premium in these states.



     These simulations are analogous to Mehra and Prescott's.                             Yet    the

observed value of the equity premium is not at all hard to reconcile with

                                                                              Note that         â€” 10

instead of        â€” 1 has very little effect on the results.                  Increasing Â°k has

the effect of moving             away from        while maintaining constant the slope of

the line connecting             and         and hence the contingent claims prices and the

equity    premium.     Thus,          the   crucial observation    is    the    persistence of

investment growth,         as   widely varying (and low)          values of      the   curvature

parameter   a.K
                  result   in about the same equity premium.             Note also that the

conditional and unconditional risk free rates are constant at an arbitrary

value of 4%,      so the puzzle that values of the parameters that explain the

equity premium predict strange risk free rates does not appear in this model.



   Forward   fl Te         Premium



     The     equity    premium          simulation    investigates      the     ability     of     a

production-based model to capture the unconditional level of a risk premium.

This second set of simulations is designed to capture the cyclical behavior

of a risk premium as well as its unconditional value.



        Fama and Bliss (1987) regressed current year term premia (the ex-post

return from holding an X year bond for one year minus the return from holding

                                             24
a one year bond)   on forward rate term premia (forward rate                -
                                                                                spot   rate).

They found coefficients near 1.0 for long maturities.             They concluded that

long (K) maturity forward rate term premia move one for one with one year

expected term premia and have little forecast power for one year changes in

long (K-I) year rates.        Fama and Bliss      also pointed out that forward rate

term premia also display an enticing cyclidal pattern. Fig. 4 presents the                  5



year forward rate term premium and gross fixed investment.              In the 70's the

forward rate moved slightly before business cycles in investment; while in

the 60's and in 1979,    it moved contemporaneously. Table 5 part I presents

some regressions that quantify the cyclical correlations between the term

premium, investment,   and durable goods purchases.          While the 5 year forward

premium is negatively correlated with both the investment/output ratio and

the   durable/output ratio       taken   alone,     in   a   multiple   regression        the

durable/output ratio     is    positively correlated with        the    5    year      forward

premium, and these multiple correlations are more stable through the sample

than the single correlations.       I take the      correlations documented by these

regressions as the stylized facts to be explained.



      Since the model as developed so far is entirely real,             Fama and Bliss'

evidence that variation in the forward rate term premium is almost entirely

due to variation in a (real) risk premium and that the risk premium has an

enticing cyclical correlation with production variables make it an attractive

quantity for a simulation exercise with this model.             In this section, I'll

present simulations designed to replicate this behavior of the forward rate

term premium, in a model similar to the one presented for the equity premium.

Backus Gregory and Zin (1986)        present an analogous        Mehra-Preacott style

        Given contingent claims                   prices,       we can calculate multiperiod bond prices

as follows. The price of a one period bond is

       p (1)
                 t
               (s )   â€”Z p(s

                        5t+l
Then,       the price of a two              period       bond is



        (2)t) â€”              Z        i

        I    use the same technology as the last section,                              and the same two state

Markov model for investment growth.                                 In this model, investment and consumer

durable purchases are always in the same growth state.                                          This is a poor

approximation to quarterly data,                              in which investment and consumer durables

grow above or below their mean growth rate contemporaneously only 78% of the

time    (47,1-86,4).                 However, in annual data there are only two years in the

last forty in which                        consumer durable             growth was      above   its    mean with

                                                         26
investment growth below its mean or vice versa.                    For this reason (as well as

the computational difficulty of examining all 220 states 5 years ahead in

quarterly data rather than the             2     states 5 years ahead in annual data),                 I

will compare the model to actual data at annual frequencies.                            Alternately,

one could add more states, such as A3. durables grow and investment declines.



       The physical returns are given by              (14)   as before.

rates,    etc.   ,    will   be functions of these state variables.                    With physical

returns (14), we can calculate contingent claims prices using (15), and then

multi-period bond prices and term premia from (25)                        -   (26).    As before, I

start with a description of the parameter choices that yield desirable
                                                                              -

qualitative behavior.



       Recall        that the one period interest rate is constructed as in Fig. 5, by

the    intersection of a line connecting               k     and    with the 450 line.              This

construction mimics the creation of a risk free asset (one that pays off

equally in either state)           from the two risky technologies.                    Obviously, we

cannot pick
                     dâ€”0      as before, or there          will be no variation in interest

rates.     To match the stylized fact (see table 5 part 1) that interest rates

rise and forward premia decline (forecasting long horizon declines in the

interest rate) when investment rises but vice versa for consumer durables,                            we

must pick an arrangement like Fig. 5.                  With the      line to the right of the

      line, increases in investment raise             the one year rate,          while increases in

consumer durables purchases lower it.                 I assure this behavior by picking inpk,


        6k and                                   R corresponding to
                        so that the return                                            â€” 0   is    further

out from the origin than the corresponding return for                            as in Fig.   5.




     I   searched for parameters that produced a high correlation between

actual   and    simulated          forward premia,              within   the   space   of   "sensible"

parameters:         and        C   .2;       all returns positive,       etc. and while maintaining
               5k         6d
the geometry of Fig. 5.            I calculated the correlation without removing a mean

as

         (realsim)        /(       real         sim )5
This objective prizes a match with the level of the actual term premium as

well as matching the cyclical fluctuations.



     A   short manual search produced the following parameters, which I use in

the simulations below.             (A subsequent automated search produced only slightly

different parameters and a slight improvement in correlation, from .48 to

.499.)

     To simulate the model, I followed the following procedure (Table                                    4

presents a flowchart).             1) I produced a capital stock series at each date by

accumulating capital according to the technology (13),                          starting with "long

run values" k â€”      (1-6)/S       I     ;   2) I constructed the physical returns                 and

at each date using the observed values for investment and durable goods, and

the accumulated capital stocks;                 3)   I constructed the implied yield curve and



                                                28
forward premia five years forward at each date from (25)-(26).                  Note that

this procedure is a little different from a pure simulation of the model,

because at each date I use the actual investment and durables numbers rather

than a the value given by a simulation of the Markov model for investment

growth.    However, at each date potential future values of investment and

durables purchases needed to calculate the future physical returns are given

by the Markov model for investment growth.



-
     There are several ways             to evaluate the accuracy of    the   simulations.

First, Fig.    6 presents the simulated and actual 5 year forward rate term

premium.     (Keep        in mind that the simulated premium is only a function of

investment data,          no asset information goes into its       construction.)     The

simulation at least picks up the level and the cyclical timing of the actual

premium.     Second,       since the model predicts that all rates are functions of

Â¼'    lCkt    'dt'    kdt)
                                we can evaluate how well the simulated forward premium

matches the actual forward premium as functions of these               state variables.

Table S parts        2,    3,   4 below give regressions of the actual 5 year forward

premium on     the        investment and capital stock variables in a          variety of

specifications, and             the   corresponding regressions using    the    simulated

premium.     In both Fig. 6 and in table         S   (especially part 4) it's clear that

the simulations overstate the cyclical sensitivity of                 forward rate term

premia.    On the other hand,          the mean value of the simulated term premium is

slightly less than the actual.              An objective of R2 tn deviations from the

mean produces coefficients that match the cyclical pattern better,                 at the

expense of matching the level.



                                          29
           The model predicts an exact relation between asset prices (the 5 year

    forward rate term premium, for example)       and the state variables         tÂ¼' 1kt'
    'dt'   kdt g(s)}     so any   deviation   of the actual and simulated data is a

    formal statistical rejection of the model. Though the model is formally

    rejected,   it replicates certain interesting stylized facts of the data.                In

    particular, it gives an account of the puzzling negative partial correlation

    between investment and the forward rate term premium, implying a positive

    partial correlation with real interest rates;         it gives    an account of the

    different sign of the partial correlations of forward rate term premia with

    durables purchases and fixed investment;      and it gives a quantitative account

    of the cyclical movement in the forward rate term premium.            Also,    there    are

    (in retrospect)   potential patterns in the data that this model could not have

    replicated.    For example,   it's clear from Fig.     5 that no arrangement would

    deliver positive partial correlations of both forms              of   investment with

    forward rate term premia.



           This example also contains some lessons for the theory of investment,             if

    we regard asset returns as given and ask what are the firm's investment

    patterns.     For example, the partial correlation of investment in physical

    capital and the risk free rate of interest is positive in this nodel, and

    both the mean rates of return and the rates of return on each technology in

    each state are much higher than the risk free rate (see Fig. 5).               Thus this
â€¢
    model has the potential to explain some puzzling bad fits of the Q             theory    of

    investment, since     it   considers    the   risk   considerations in        forming     a

    "portfolio" of investments rather than just equations like l+r â€”          E (f'(k)).




                                       30
        The biggest weakness of the model so far is that I required different

parameters to match the equity premium and the forward rates.4 The essential

problem was matching the level          (not the cyclical pattern) of forward rates.
                                                                        vs.
Matching the level of forward rates required the large difference (1.05

1.02)    between R. and           In turn,     this implies that the line (Fig.    5)

connecting         and    is steeply sloped compared to the probability vectors.
             _R.

Hence, the parameters that work for the term premium yield enormous equity

            If we move      closer to         the equity premium declines towards the
premia.                                  R,
values of Table 3 and the cyclical pattern of the forward rate term premium

is                  but   the   level    of   the   forward rates   declines.   These
     preserved,

observations provide some of the important lessons we would hope to learn

from formal testing--the dimensions along which the model succeeds and fails,

and an understanding of the improvements we must seek.

Using this notation,               the       firm's problem         could be written as an expected

present value with no change of content. The equivalent form given in the

text turns      out to be notationally simpler                         to use for    producers,   since

probabilities     do not enter production functions as they do expected utility

         this       reduces        to   an unconditional               version of     (3.14)   as used in the

following paragraphs.



3One     way to quantify the persistence                               of a Markov process is with Markov

matrices of the form

                           + 9
              (l-9)ir1                  (l9)l
                                                     +   9
                 (l-9)r2             (l-9)ir2


where
          l        and
                         1r2
                               are   unconditional                probabilities   of each state.   Persistence
parameters 9             â€” .13     and 9 â€”               264 for consumption and investment respectively

produce        transition matrices very close to those estimated from postwar data.

In experiments with several Markov matrices of this form, the slope of the

mean-standard deviation frontier scaled with the persistence parameter                                  9.




 A   second weakness is that the high forward rate term premia are associated

with a falling real term structure                                 and vice versa.     Subsequent evidence by

Fama (1988) suggests the opposite: high forward rate term premia correspond

to   a   rising real term structure,                          correlated with even more strongly declining

inflation           forecasts.
