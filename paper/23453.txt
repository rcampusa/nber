The Impact of Student Debt on Education, Career, and Marriage Choices of Female Lawyers

JEL No. J12,J24

                                          ABSTRACT

We develop and estimate a dynamic model to study the impact of student debt on education,
career, and marriage market choices of young female lawyers. Our model accounts for several
important institutional features of the labor market for lawyers, including differences in the work
hours across occupational tracks and learning about the prospects of promotion to partner. Some
female students need to take on large amounts of student debt to finance their education and
hence start their careers with large amounts of negative wealth. The empirical findings suggest
that student debt has negative effects on marriage prospects, career prospects, and investments in
educational quality of female lawyers. The analysis also provides new insights into the design of
public policies that aim to increase public sector employment. We show that it is possible to
design conditional wage or debt service subsidy programs that significantly increase public sector
career choices at reasonable costs.

1       Introduction
Law school tuition increased, on average, by 60 percent in real terms during the past
15 years in the U.S. Based on a recent survey by the U.S. Department of Education the
average cost of obtaining a J.D. including tuition, fees, and living expenses was $175,000
in 2011.1 Hence, many students need to take on substantial amounts of student debt to
finance their education. Average debt of law students exceeded $105,000 in 2011. There has
been much concern in the legal profession, among policy makers and researchers that the
high levels of student debt may significantly distort career choices by discouraging careers
in the public sector. Lawyers that are struggling to pay back debt accumulated during
graduate school are more likely to accept higher paying jobs in the private sector. Less
well-known is the fact that large amounts of debt may also affect the marriage prospects
of female lawyers delaying marriage and child rearing. This means student debt may have
both a direct effect on occupational choices, but also an indirect effect through marriage
prospects. This indirect effect of student debt on marriage prospects may also drive females
into private sector jobs since they need to pay back some of their student debts to increase
their marriage prospects. Anticipating these negative effects, female lawyers with lower
resources may systematically attend lower ranked, cheaper law schools underinvesting in
the quality of education. The purpose of this paper is to develop and estimate a dynamic
model to study the impact of student debt on education, career, and marriage market
choices of young female lawyers and the effectiveness of different types of loan forgiveness
programs.
    Our model captures the observed heterogeneity among law schools which differ by qual-
ity and tuition. Since law school tuition rises substantially with quality, students face
a palpable quality-price tradeoff.2 Students differ with respect to their initial wealth or
    1
    It remains as high as $152,000 even after including all grants.
    2
    In 2014, the average cost of a J.D. at a top 10 school was $257,000, which was $58,000 higher than at
schools ranked in the 31-40 range and $78,000 higher than at schools ranked in the 91-100 range.


                                                   1
resource endowments. If the initial wealth is not sufficient to pay the full costs of the
education, a student graduates from law school with significant amounts of student debt
or negative wealth. The magnitude of the accumulated student debt depends on the initial
wealth endowment and the endogenously chosen quality of the law school attended.
   Upon graduation students enter the labor market which offers a number of occupational
tracks. In our model lawyers can work for private law firms, take a job in the public sector,
work as an in-house lawyer for a private firm, or work part time. Labor markets for lawyers
have some special institutional features that need to be modeled. First, a young lawyer
employed at a private law firm often faces an up-or-out decision regarding promotion to
partner. Promotion to partner is uncertain, but associates are evaluated on an annual
basis. A key feature of the model is a learning process which allows associates to infer the
likelihood of promotion based on their work experiences. We show that a learning model
can explain the rapidly declining prevalence of employment in private law firms during
the first 12 years after graduation observed in the data.3 Second, different careers offer
different combinations of hours and earnings. Private law firms require, on average, longer
hours than public sector jobs, but offer higher earnings in return. Our model captures these
observed differences among occupational tracks.
   Young female lawyers are also active in the marriage market. The data suggest that
student debt affects the quality of the match and the timing of marriage and child rearing.
Our model captures these facts by assuming that potential marriages depend on the amount
of wealth and individual characteristics. As a consequence, our model is consistent with
the observed fact that female lawyers with large student debt tend to delay marriage and
child rearing. Moreover, they tend to prefer higher paying jobs in the private sector to pay
off their student debt.
   We estimate the model using a combination of two data sets. Our main data set is
   3
       Miller (1984) and Crawford and Shum (2005) also estimate dynamic discrete choice models with learn-
ing.

called After the JD, which is a nationally representative longitudinal dataset assembled
by the American Bar Foundation and the National Association for Law Placement. It is
drawn from J.D. students graduating in the year 2000. We supplement these data with the
National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, a nationally representative financial aid survey
of students conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. We discuss how to identify
and estimate the parameters of our model using a simulated method of moments estimator.
  The empirical findings suggest that our model accounts for the fact that negative wealth
has large and significant negative effects on female career and marriage outcomes. Specif-
ically, women with more student debt stay longer in private sector jobs, postpone mar-
riage, marry men with lower earnings, and delay childbearing. Differences in female career
choices are primarily driven by marriage market prospects. If one equalizes marriage mar-
ket prospects for females with and without negative wealth, the differences in labor market
choices shrink substantially. The intuition is that females with large negative wealth have
fewer opportunities in the marriage market, and thereby experience poorer marriage out-
comes. Consequently, it takes them longer to meet an acceptable spouse and to have
children. Females also significantly under-invest in education quality in anticipation of the
diminished marriage market prospects associated with the future debt burden.
  The impact of debt on career and marriage choices is specific to female lawyers. We do
not observe these negative effects in a corresponding sample of male lawyers. This study,
therefore, documents the existence of significant gender differences in labor and marriage
markets for lawyers.
  Our empirical results speak to a long-standing concern of the legal profession that high
costs of law school impel graduates to eschew public service jobs in favor of more lucrative
positions in private practices. Much recent interest has focused on the design of public
service loan forgiveness programs to partially offset these negative effects. We conclude the
analysis by evaluating a variety of different loan repayment assistance programs. We com-
pare an unconditional loan forgiveness policy to career-contingent wage or interest subsidy

                                             3
programs. We show that it is possible to design conditional subsidy programs that signifi-
cantly increase public sector career choices at reasonable costs. Moreover, these conditional
wage or debt service subsidies are more effective than traditional loan forgiveness policies.
   This paper builds on the literature that has studied how the rising costs of attending law
schools affects career choices. Using a sample consisting exclusively of male law students
from the University of Michigan, Sauer (1998, 2004) finds that student debt has only a
modest influence on career choices of male lawyers during the first 15 years after graduation.
Our study complements this work by focusing on a nationally representative sample of
female law students.
   Our paper also builds on recent work by Azmat and Ferrer (2016) who use the same
data to study the gender gap among young lawyers. They document that females have,
on average, worse labor market experiences than males. We complement their empirical
analysis by providing a structural analysis of joint education, marriage, and career decisions
of female lawyers. This approach allows us to evaluate a variety of different policy options
aimed at increasing access to public sector jobs.
   Our paper is also related to Field (2009) who studies an experiment that was conducted
with male and female students at NYU’s law school. This study finds that student debt
strongly discourages public sector employment in the first two years of a person’s career.4
Our work focuses on the underlying mechanisms that produce such a strong effect.
   This study is also related to the literature that focuses on the relationship between
student debt and marriage choices. Addo (2014), Bozick and Estacion (2014), and Gicheva
(2014) document that the amount of accumulated student debt is negatively related to
the probability of first marriage using nationally representative samples of the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) participants, bachelor’s degree recipients, and
MBA students respectively. We also document significant differences in marriage quality,
   4
    Rothstein and Rouse (2011) reach similar conclusion using an experiment with a sample of undergrad-
uate students conducted a highly selective U.S. university.



                                                  4
in addition to differences in marriage rates.
   Our paper also builds on the literature that has focused on the effects of liquidity con-
straints on schooling decisions. Important studies are Keane and Wolpin (2001), Carneiro
and Heckman (2002), Cameron and Taber (2004), Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008),
Lochner and Monge-Naranjo (2011), and Johnson (2013). The main findings of these papers
suggest that a relaxation of borrowing constraints does not significantly increase college en-
rollment. We evaluate a different set of student debt policies, namely, policies subsidizing
repayments in the post-graduation stage.
   Our paper is also related to a literature that has studied the gender gap in wages and
career advancement in high-paying occupations such as corporate management, law, and
academia. Recent studies include, among others, Ginther and Hayes (2003), Ginther and
Kahn (2004), Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010), Gayle, Golan, and Miller (2012), and
Goldin (2014). We jointly model several elements identified as important in this literature,
which include the promotion structure, the time cost of childcare, and the decision to exit an
occupation. We incorporate these elements into a coherent structural framework. However,
our analysis does not capture informational frictions of the type studied in Albanesi and
Olivetti (2009). That paper develops a model in which gender differences in earnings
and home hours arise from informational friction. Employers believe that women need
more home hours and thus offer labor contracts with lower earnings, performance pay, and
effort. As a consequence, the opportunity costs for women to work at home are indeed
lower. Hence, women allocate more time to home production confirming firms’ beliefs in
equilibrium.5

analysis and presents the most relevant stylized empirical facts. Section 3 presents the

of our results and evaluates a number of different loan forgiveness policies. Section 7 offers
some conclusions.



2     Data

2.1     The Sample

The empirical analysis is based on a data set called After the JD, which is a nationally
representative longitudinal data set constructed by the American Bar Foundation and the
National Association for Law Placement. The data set follows students who graduated in
2000. The current version of the data set covers the first twelve years of student careers.
The respondents were surveyed three times: once each in 2003, 2007, and 2012. After
eliminating data points with missing information, our sample contains a total of 1193
females.
    The data set contains detailed information about the law school that was attended by
each student. For confidentiality reasons, law schools are grouped into four tiers according
to the rankings in U.S. News and World Reports Rankings 2003, which ranks the top 100
law schools in the country, and then assigns all unranked schools into one of two groups,
Tier 3 or Tier 4. In the dataset, the American Bar Association bundles the top 20 schools
as Tier 1 and the remaining ranked schools as Tier 2.
    The data set does not contain separate measures of wealth. However, it is well known
that most young households in the U.S. do not have much wealth. In practice, all wealth
that a student may have prior to entering law school is likely used to pay for the cost
of attending law school. Each participant of the survey reports total student debt upon
graduation and the remaining debt in 2006 and 2012. We treat this report as a measure of


                                              6
the negative wealth of a student.6
   The data set contains the full employment history for each individual in the sample
including organizational types and positions since 2000. It also reports salary and working
hours for the jobs held in 2003, 2006, and 2012. Similarly marital status is reported in
2003, 2006, and 2012.7 We also observe spousal salary in 2006 and 2012, and the ages of
all children as of 2012.
   We also need to characterize the initial conditions when making law school choices. In
particular, it is important to have information about unpaid debt from prior education and
available monetary resources. We, therefore, turn to the National Postsecondary Student
Aid Study, a nationally representative survey of students conducted by the U.S. Department
of Education in 2000, approximately the same cohort as the respondents in After the
JD. The dataset contains 170 female J.D. students. The dataset provides measures of
outstanding college debt, various sources of funding for law school education, tuition and
expenses, and other demographics.
   Finally, we need to characterize the admission rules of law schools. In both datasets,
we observe the students’ choices but not their choice sets. Without explicitly accounting
for the admission rules, it is hard to separate a student’s preferences from her constraints
when choosing schools. We, therefore, exploit another data set called Law School Numbers,
which was founded in 2003 as a free, publicly accessible database of user-supplied law
school applicant information. Users provide LSAT, GPA, application and later admission
portfolios. We extrapolate the admission rules in 1997 based on the 15,222 observations
from the 2003-2008 cycles.
   Table 1 provides selected summary statistics. Prior debt represents the unpaid college
   6
     This treatment is consistent with our model below that abstracts from saving. Hence the remaining
student debt is our measure of negative wealth. For the rest of the paper we will use debt and negative
wealth synonymously.

     Cohabitation is counted as marriage. Cohabitation accounts for 3 percent of whole sample. The results
change little by treating cohabitation as single.

debt, with an average of $9,400, which is much lower than the total amount of debt upon
graduation, which averages $85, 200 in our sample. Savings represents all the non-debt
monetary resources students use to finance law school education, including family transfers,
own savings, grants, etc. We treat grants as exogenous because merit-based institutional
grants are very limited.8 Students still owe on average $45,400 six years after graduation,
and $30,300 twelve years after graduation.9
   Females students graduate, on average, at age 28, further reinforcing the importance of
modeling marriage and childbearing decisions in subsequent years. The median work week
in the private sector is 48 hours, or 11 percent, longer than in the public or business sector
(in-house council, legal adviser, etc), while the pay is approximately 35 percent higher.
Note that these differences persist among time. Not surprisingly, we find that partners’
earnings are significantly higher than associates’ earnings.

   Table 2 reports the market shares of each law school type in our sample. It shows that
Tier 2 law schools capture almost half of the market.
   Table 3 reports the market shares of each occupation in four different years. Recall that
our paper primarily focuses on the transition between private practice employment and
other occupations. For that reason we aggregate all other occupations into two categories.
   8
     In the sample, students on average receive $7,000 of merit-based institutional grant, which accounts for
only 6 percent of the cost of J.D. education. Only 11 percent of students receive merit-based institutional
grant covering 20 percent or more of the cost.

     While the data set contains detailed information about financial transfers and resources of students, we
find that the reported values do not fully reflect all the resources available to students and are typically too
low to explain the observed levels of debt after graduation. We impute values of the financial endowments
that are consistent with our key equations (4) and (5) that characterize the evolution of debt before
graduation, i.e. we impute resources that are consistent with posted tuitions, estimated living expenditures,
undergraduate debt, and observed levels of debt upon graduation from law school.

   We observe a significant decline in the participation of female lawyers in private law
firms. At the same time, the share of female lawyers rises in all other sectors.


2.2     Some Stylized Facts

We document four facts about the relationship between negative wealth (measured by
outstanding student debt) and career choices, marriage, and childbearing outcomes for
female lawyers. We divide the sample into three groups of similar size by the amount of
student debt upon graduation. We call these groups Low Debt, Medium Debt, and High
Debt. The average student debt for the three groups are $18,300, $84,900 and $145,500,
respectively. We then calculate work experience, marriage rates, spousal earnings and the
probability of having children for each group. We also calculate the differences in these
outcomes between each group and the Low Debt group.10

Stylized Fact 1 Females with high debt are more likely to work for private law firms than
females with low debt.
  10
    Appendix B shows that all findings reported in this section are robust to including a standard set of
controls in a regression analysis.

                                                   10
We calculate the choice probability at private practice in the 7th and the 12th year post-
graduation for each debt group. As displayed in Table 4, in the 7th year, 42% of the High
Debt group work in the private law firms, while only 29% of the Low Debt group do. In
the 12th year, the corresponding choice probabilities are 35% and 21%. T-tests and F-test
show these gaps are statistically significant.11

Stylized Fact 2 High-debt females are more likely to postpone marriage than low-debt
females.

   We calculate marriage rates by age 34 and 40 for each debt group. Table 5 shows that the
marriage rates for the three groups are 74 percent, 69 percent and 65 percent respectively
by age 34. A High Debt individual is 12 percent less likely to be married by age 34 than a
Low Debt individual. These gaps are statistically significant.12
  11
     This fact is consistent with Rothstein and Rouse (2011), who find that student debt causes undergradu-
ate students at a highly selective university to avoid low-paid “public interest” jobs and choose substantially
higher paying jobs instead.
  12
     We also calculate the marriage rates by other ages, but the pattern remains both quantitatively and
statistically the same.




                                                      11
   This marriage gap persists at age 40. The marriage rates are 85 percent for low debt
females and 77 percent for high-debt females.13 We thus find that the gap narrows by age
40, but it is still persistent.

Stylized Fact 3 Spouses of high-debt females have lower earnings than spouses of low-debt
females.

   Not only do females with high debt delay marriage, they also seem to, at least, initially
obtain worse matches in the marriage market. We illustrate this feature by comparing the
spousal earnings conditional on getting married. Spousal earnings is our best measure of
the “quality” of match.
   Table 6 shows that spouses of Low Debt females earn an average of $113,000 annually,
which is $16,000, or 16.5 percent, higher than their High Debt counterparts. Hence, there
are significant differences in match quality at age 34.
  13
    This fact is consistent with Addo (2014), Bozick and Estacion (2014) and Gicheva (2014), all of whom
document that accumulated student debt is negatively related to the probability of first marriage using
national representative samples of NLSY97 participants, bachelor’s degree recipients, and MBA students
respectively.


                                                  12
  It is, however, important to point out that these differences disappear over time. Dif-
ferences in spousal earnings are not significant 12 years after graduation. We, therefore,
conclude that the gap between low- and high debt females closes over time as females pay
down their debt.

Stylized Fact 4 Females with high debt are more likely to postpone childbearing than fe-
males with low debt.

  Lastly, we compare the probability of having a child by age 34 and 40 across debt groups.
Table 7 shows that Low Debt females are 30 percent more likely to have children by age
34 than High Debt females. The gap shrinks to 6.3 percent by age 40. Again, there are
significant differences early, but the gap closes over time as one would expect.
  In summary, female lawyers with large amounts of negative wealth have different labor
market, marriage, and child rearing outcomes than their more wealthy peers. One might
be concerned that the differences in outcomes may not reflect differences in debt of females
lawyers, but differences in wealth among the parents of these lawyers. Unfortunately,
“After the JD” does not include parental wealth as a variable. Hence, we cannot directly

test the hypothesis that differences in outcomes reported above are due to differences in
parental wealth. However, the data set includes variables such as parental education and
an indicator whether parents have been lawyers. These variables are likely to be correlated
with parental wealth. We have included these additional regressors in the key outcome
regressions reported in Appendix B. We find that the estimates of the impact of debt on
the two most important outcomes – marital status and spousal earnings – are not affected
by including these additional parental background characteristics. Father’s education and
mother’s education are not significantly related to marriage status or spousal earnings. It
also does not matter whether the father or mother has been a lawyer. In contrast, debt
at graduation is still significant even after controlling for these additional regressors. As a
consequence, our main empirical findings do not appear to be driven by omitted variables
such as parental wealth.14
  14
    These results also suggest that we do not need to control for these parent background variables in our
structural model discussed below.




                                                   14
2.3       Gender Differences

The findings reported above suggest that debt affects the careers of female lawyers. How-
ever, debt does not strongly affect male lawyers. To illustrate these important gender
differences we also compute the same statistics reported in Section 2.2 for the male sam-
ple.15 We find that there are no significant differences in outcomes for males among the
three different debt groups.
  It is interesting to speculate why we observe these gender differences. One important
difference between male and female lawyers is that male lawyers tend to have more tra-
ditional marriages than female lawyers. Table 8 compares the earnings and labor market
participation rates among couples with male and female lawyers.

                  Table 8: Spousal Earning and Employment Status by Gender

           All monetary values are in thousands of 2014 dollars.
           The table combines part time and full time work.


  Note that spouses of female lawyers work less and have on average lower earnings than
male lawyers. The differences in participation rates are, however, small. Female lawyers in
our sample have significantly higher earnings than spouses of male lawyers. The difference
in participation rates is more than 25 percentage points. Moreover, most female lawyers –

      These relevant tables are available in an online appendix.



                                                     15
especially those with high debt – tend to work full time and hence are in marriages where
both partners work full time.
    To gain some additional insights into the underlying mechanisms that may explain the
effects of debt on female lawyers we develop and estimate a dynamic model of decision
making. In our model, negative wealth affects both the attractiveness of females in the
marriage market and the consumption opportunities via the budget constraint.



3     Model

3.1     The Timeline

We model the sequence of decision problems of a female that has decided to pursue a career
in law. The model consists of two stages: a schooling stage and a labor market stage.
The first three periods correspond to the schooling stage. Students choose a law school
among a set of differentiated schooling options. After graduating from law school, female
lawyers are active in the labor market during the remaining periods of their careers. Each
lawyer can choose among job offers from different occupational tracks. In addition, each
female participates in the marriage market which is characterized by stochastic assortative
matching. Job offers, promotions, marriage offers, and children arrive stochastically over
time. The timeline of decisions and key outcomes are illustrated in Table 9. We discuss
each of the three markets in detail below.


3.2     The Marriage Market

We follow Keane and Wolpin (2010) and assume that marriage markets are characterized by
stochastic assortative matching. The empirical evidence suggests that the probability that
a single individual receives a marriage offer is primarily a function of age. As a consequence



                                             16

we assume:


                   P r(Receives a marriage offer) = β0M + β1M At + β2M A2t                                (1)


Age effects capture the fact that marriage rates peak early and then decline sharply.16 The
quality of a marriage offer is characterized by spousal earnings given by:

                                                                                     J

              ln WtS   =   β1S dmt (Dj )   +   β2S XtS   +   β3S XtS dmt (Dj )   +          S
                                                                                           β4j Sj + St   (2)
                                                                                     j=1


This specification captures the idea that the quality of an individual’s pool of potential
husbands depends on the female’s outstanding debt, denoted by dmt (Dj ).17 Our model thus
  16
     We only report the specification that we use in the final version of the paper. We explored alternative
specifications in our previous work. In general, we tended to select the most appropriate parsimonious
model specification.
  17
     The law of motion for debt is explained in detail below.



                                                             17
reflects stochastic assortative matching in the marriage market by wealth and education.
Note that all females receive offers at the same rate conditional on age, but the quality of
the offers depends on the outstanding student debt. We also observe systematic differences
by law school attended which is captured by the terms denoted by Sj . This component is
observed by the female at the time of the match. The husband’s earnings also grow over
time with experience, XtS .18 The interaction term captures a catch-up effect since earnings
of spouses of high debt lawyers tend to rise slightly faster in the data. In addition, there
is an i.i.d. random component St that reflects a permanent unobserved characteristic of a
potential husband.
   Marriage is a terminal state in our model. We do not model divorce since divorce rates
are low in our data set. Only 6% of marriages end up in divorces over the 12-year sample
period.
   We model childbearing as an exogenous process rather than a direct choice. That said,
we find that being married is associated with a substantial increase in the probability of
having children. Childbearing is an indirect endogenous choice realized through marriage
decisions. Children arrive stochastically, with arrival rates depending on age and marital
status:


P r(new child at period t) = logistic{β0K + β1K At + β2K A2t + β3K mt + β4K mt At + β5K mt A2t } (3)


We also find that after controlling for the aforementioned variables, income or wealth (debt)
are not significantly related to the probability of having children.
  18
     We proxy experience using age of the husband which is consistent with the fact that many males work
full time in most periods after graduation.

Students initially differ by ability, which is measured by undergraduate GP A and LSAT .19
Students have monetary resources, E, which consist of parental transfers, own savings,
grants, and other non-debt monetary resources that can be used to pay for tuition. Finally,
students differ by unpaid student debt from undergraduate education DU .
   There are J different types of law schools. Each school charges tuition Tj , requires
living expenses Pj , and implements admission rules Ψj (GP A, LSAT ) ∈ [0, 1]. Compared
with undergraduate schools, law schools offer fewer merit-based grants and scholarships.
Therefore, we assume a common tuition rate for all students. The admission rules accom-
modate uncertainty in the admission process, since individuals with the same ability can
have different admission results.
   In the first period a student applies to all schools and selects one from among those to
which she is admitted. She needs to finance the cost of education Tj + Pj with monetary
resources E. If these prove insufficient, then she must borrow DjG , where


                                   DjG = max(Tj + Pj − E, 0)                                            (4)


The total accumulated debt upon graduation from school j is


                                          Dj = DjG + DU                                                 (5)


A student can only borrow to finance tuition and basic living expenses. She cannot borrow
to boost consumption in the schooling stage. Schooling choices are only made once and are
  19
    We do not include unobserved ability into the model specification for two reasons. First, our specifica-
tion is already quite complicated and allows for unobserved state variables in the learning process. Second,
we have access to a number of different observed measures of ability such as GPA and LSAT which should
capture the most important differences in ability. Future research should evaluate more sophisticated
models that also allow for unobserved differences in ability.




                                                    19
irrevocable; students do not drop out.20
   Since we do not observe consumption during the education stages, we proxy consumption
with school specific living expenditures given by:


                                              Cjt = Pj                                                 (6)


Leisure is determined by school specific work requirements. We also include a time cost for
taking care of children denoted by λ.


                                      Ljt = H − Hj − λ kt                                              (7)


Hj denotes average study time as a graduate student at school j. kt denotes the presence
of children in the household.21
   We assume that the deterministic part of the flow utility function associated with each
school choice j conditional on marriage status is given by:


                        Ujt = φ0 ln(Cjt ) + (1 − φ0 ) ln(Ljt ) + µ1 mt + ζj                            (8)


Note that the first term captures general preferences over consumption and leisure which
is given by a Cobb-Douglas function. The next term captures non-pecuniary benefit from
marriage. The last term captures non-pecuniary benefit from attending law school.
   In addition, there is an additively separable idiosyncratic preference shock for each
potential school-marriage choice. These shocks follow a Type I extreme value distribution
(McFadden, 1974).
  20
     3-year attrition rates are as low as 5 percent, as calculated by the authors using the enrollment and
degrees awarded data published on the American Bar Association.
  21
     We also solved versions of the model that included pecuniary costs of raising children as discussed in
detail below.




                                                    20
3.4       The Labor Market

Hours and Earnings

Upon graduating from law school, females enter the labor market. We assume that there
are four potential occupational choices: a private law firm associate position (l = 1), a
partner position (l = 2), a public sector or business sector position (l = 3), and part-time
employment (l = 4).22
   Each period, a female obtains an earnings-hour draw from an occupation specific distri-
bution. Let Wlt denote the earnings in occupation l and Hlt the required number of hours.
Each period a earnings-hour pair is drawn from a multivariate lognormal distribution that
depends on ability, schooling and work experience. Job offers in occupation l ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}
at year t are specified as:

                    J
                    X
                           W         W          W
       ln(Wlt ) =         β1jl Sj + β2l GP A + β3l XtR + β4l
                                                          W
                                                             XtP + β5l
                                                                    W
                                                                       (XtR )2 + β6l
                                                                                  W
                                                                                     (XtP )2 + εW
                                                                                                lt (9)
                    j=1
                   H
       ln(Hlt ) = β0l + εH
                         lt                                                                             (10)


where XtR denotes the working experience in private law firms, and XtP denotes the working
experience in public/business sector.23 The specification of the hours equations reflects the
fact that observed hours do not systematically vary with ability, education, or experience,
but they do vary across occupational tracks in our sample.
  22
     The number of women that do not work at all is surprisingly small in the After the JD. As a consequence,
we do not differentiate between part time work and unemployment. Our earlier analysis also suggests that
there are few gains from differentiating between public sector jobs and business sector positions. The share
of business sector jobs is small and the observed hours and earnings are similar to the public sector.
  23
     For simplicity, we assume that income and hours are independent from each other and serially uncor-
related. Our model generates persistence in occupational choices by allowing for switching costs.




                                                     21
Preferences and Budgets

Next we derive the budget set which depends on two components: family income and debt
repayment. The schedule for debt repayment is given by:

                                                      r
                                dpt (D) = D                                                    (11)
                                           (1 + r)(1 − (1 + r)−T0 )
                                           1 − (1 + r)(t−T0 −1)
                               dmt (D) = D                                                     (12)
                                             1 − (1 + r)−T0

where t denotes the time period, dpt is the annual repayment, dmt is the remaining debt
in the beginning of period t. T0 is the initially scheduled length of repayment. r is the
interest rate. Individuals pay equalized repayments during T0 . T0 is set to be 15 years and
r to 7 percent.24
  If both spouses are active in the labor market, we allow for income sharing between
spouses. The rate of income sharing is denoted by γ. The budget constraint is, therefore,
given by:


                      Clt = Wlt (1 − mt ) + γ (Wlt + WtS ) mt − dpt (Dj )                      (13)


The time constraint is given by:


                                       Llt = H − Hlt − λ kt                                    (14)


We assume that the deterministic part of the flow utility function associated with occupa-
tional choice l conditional on marital status is given by:


                         Ult = φ0 ln(Clt ) + (1 − φ0 ) ln(Ltl ) + µ1 mt + ψl                   (15)
 24
      Appendix D discusses how well this model tracks the observed levels of debt over time.




                                                    22
As before, the first two terms capture preferences over consumption and leisure. Note that
our specification of the utility function does not allow us to disentangle risk aversion from
substitution between leisure and consumption. The parameters of the utility function are,
therefore, primarily identified of the observed leisure-consumption trade-offs. The next term
capture the non-pecuniary benefits from marriage. The last term captures non-pecuniary
benefit from each occupation. This captures the role of work schedule flexibility, stress,
social status, and other unobserved amenities.25
   We also include asymmetric switching costs between each occupation to our utility spec-
ification to generate persistence in occupational choices. These additional parameters are
omitted from the equation above to simplify the notation. Alternatively, one could generate
persistence in occupational choices by including time dependence in the error structure of
the earnings.26
   Finally, there is an additively separable idiosyncratic preference shock for each potential
occupation-marriage choice. These shocks follow a Type I extreme value distribution.


Learning and Promotion to Partner

Private law firms feature a promotion process for associates to advance to partners. Since
promotion is uncertain, we allow for learning about the likelihood of being promoted to
partner. Each individual is characterized by a unique time-invariant match value for the
private law sector, denoted by ξ ∈ (0, 1). We assume that ξ is not directly observed by the
individual. Instead, she receives experience signals, denoted by st , in each period she works
in private practice. These experience signals can be interpreted as reviews from senior
partners. Individuals have prior beliefs about match values and have an incentive to learn
their match values through the experience signals.
  25
     Our estimated model also allows the attractiveness of public sector jobs to depend on the presence of
children to explain the increasing attractiveness of these jobs for working mothers.
  26
     In addition, it may be desirable to allow for contemporaneous correlation in earnings shocks among
sector. For a more detailed discussion, see Sauer(1998, 2004).


                                                   23
   The match value is drawn from a Beta(η1 , η2 ) distribution upon graduation. The in-
dividual receives signal st about her match value at the end of t if she takes an associate
position. st is a Bernoulli random variable such that
                                              
                                               ξ           if z = 1
                                P r(st = z) =                                                  (16)
                                               1−ξ         if z = 0

Binary signals can be interpreted as “good” or “bad”. The probability of promotion to
partner is given by:

                        J                                                       Pt−1
                        X                                                             ss O1s
            logistic{         α0j Sj + α1 GP A +   α2 XtR   +   α3 (XtR )2 }   × Ps=1
                                                                                   t−1         (17)
                        j=1                                                        s=1 O1s


where O1s is an indicator variable that is equal to one if the individual works as an associate
in a private firm and zero otherwise.
   Parameters α2 and α3 capture the idea that the promotion probability varies with ex-
perience in private law firms. Once promoted to partner, the position is permanent. In
addition, we assume individuals have to work in private law firms to receive partner offers.
That is, the arrival rates of partner offers to public/business sector employees is zero.27
   The individual does not know the true value of ξ. Instead, she has beliefs about this
value given by Beta(Bt1 , Bt2 ), which she updates at the end of each period. The initial
beliefs at the end of period t = 3 are specified as:


                                       B31 = ξ exp(η0 )                                        (18)

                                       B32 = (1 − ξ) exp(η0 )
  27
    These assumptions do not contradict any data. Although it is possible for an experienced public
defender to directly receive a partner offer, it rarely happens for younger lawyers.




                                                    24
Individuals update beliefs according to Bayes’ rule:

                                                  t−1
                                                  X
                                  Bt1 = B31 +           ss O1s                                   (19)
                                                  s=4
                                                  t−1
                                                  X
                                  Bt2 = B32 +           (1 − ss ) O1s
                                                  s=4


3.5     Dynamic Choices

Each individual maximizes expected lifetime utility by choosing one of the feasible discrete
alternatives in her time-dependent choice set in each period, until a known terminal period.
The maximization problem can be recast as a recursive, finite-horizon, dynamic program-
ming problem. Females differ by a vector of time invariant state variables such as test
scores and initial student debt. In addition, key state variables that change over time are
the unpaid student debt, the occupation specific experience levels, and the two variables
that characterize the beliefs regarding promotion to partner.
   We assume that each discrete choice has an additively separable idiosyncratic error.
Moreover, these errors follow a Type I extreme value distribution. We can therefore use
the techniques discussed in Rust (1994) to simplify the calculation of the conditional and
expected value functions. We can solve the model using backward induction.28 Given
the optimal decision rules, we simulate the model to compute the key moments used in
estimation discussed below.
  28
    To minimize the impact of functional form assumptions, we approximate the terminal value functions
by solving the model for an additional two years past the 12 years covered in our data set. Different
approaches to deal with this issue are discussed, for example, in Sauer (2004), and Kaplan (2012).




                                                 25
4        Estimation
We have adopted a method of simulated moments approach to estimate the key param-
eters of our model. While a likelihood based approach may be more efficient, computing
the likelihood for our model would be challenging given that the presence of latent state
variables due to the learning process.29
    Denote the parameter vector by φ. Let φ0 denote the vector that characterizes the data-
generating process. Let N denote the sample size of the After the JD Sample. Combine
all empirical moments used in the estimation procedure into one vector mN and denote
with mS (φ) their simulated counterparts, where S denotes the number of simulations. The
orthogonality conditions are then given by:


                                     gN,S (φ) = mN − mS (φ)                                          (20)


Following Hansen (1982), the parameters of our model can be estimated using the following
moments estimator:


                            φ̂N,S = arg min gN,S (φ)0 WN gN,S (φ)                                    (21)
                                           φ∈Φ



for a weighting matrix WN that converges in probability to a positive semi-definite matrix
W0 .30
    The estimator φ̂S,N is a consistent estimator of φ0 and the asymptotic covariance matrix
of the estimator is given in Newey and McFadden (1994). It is straightforward to correct
for the sampling error induced into the estimation procedure by the simulations. However,
if the number of simulations is large, these errors will be negligible.31 To understand the
  29
    See, for example, Eisenhauser, Heckman, and Mosso (2015), for a discussion of the trade-offs between
SMLE and SMM.
 30
    We use the inverse of estimated variances of the sample statistics as weighting matrix.
 31
    Note that the simulation error can be made arbitrarily small by letting S be large relative to N . The

basic ideas behind our approach to identification and estimation, we offer a few additional
observations.
   First, consider the parameters that characterize labor market outcomes. These include
the parameters of the job offer distributions and the arrival rate of partner promotions.
Recall that job offers depend on law school quality, academic skills as measured by test
scores, and sector-specific work experience. These parameters are primarily identified by
the conditional means of the accepted job offers. Note that we explicitly model the selection
process using functional form assumptions on the distribution of wage offer distributions.
Moreover, we choose spousal income as a plausible exclusion restriction assuming that it
affects occupational choices by altering the budget constraint. Spousal income does not
affect the earnings equations of the three occupations. Similarly, arrival rates of partner
promotion depend on a similar set of variables. These parameters are identified based on
the observed conditional promotion probabilities.
   Second, consider the parameters that relate to marriage market outcomes, which include
the parameters in the marriage offer arrival rates and the parameters of the marriage
offer distribution. Marriage offer arrival rates depend only on age. The marriage offer
distribution also depends on law school rankings. We observe conditional marriage rates
and conditional means of spousal income. A difficulty is to disentangle the arrival rate of
marriage offers from the distribution that characterizes spousal quality. To this end, we
exclude variables that affect the marriage offer distributions but not the offer arrival rates
such as school quality. Similarly age affects the probability of receiving an offer, but not
spousal income.
   Third, consider the preference parameters which are largely identified using moments
generated by interacting observed occupational choices with variables such as school quality,
simulated moments are generated for any given set of parameters by simulating 30000 histories. For a
discussion of the theoretical properties of these estimators, see McFadden (1989) or Pakes and Pollard
(1989).




                                                 27
experience, test scores, debt, marital status, whether children are present, and spousal
earnings. The idea is that these interacted variables may affect occupational choices by
altering the marginal utility derived from consumption and leisure. Similarly, we can
identify the preference parameters in the schooling stage by matching matriculation rates,
average academic skills, monetary resources, remaining debt, and total borrowing by school.
   One particularly salient pattern concerns the high attrition rates in the private law
sector. The share of employment in the private law sector shrinks by close to 50 percent for
females from top schools. Similar patterns can be observed for graduates from lower ranked
schools. It is worth noting that most of these attritions occur less than seven years after
graduation, and thus far in advance of the partner promotion evaluations. The learning
process then generates sufficiently high attrition rates in the private law sector.32
   An alternative explanation of high attrition rates and of low public employment rates
by students with high debt is that starting a career in the private sector tends to be
more reversible than starting a career in the public sector. If this is the case, debt might
discourage public sector employment only temporarily. Furthermore, if starting a career
in the public sector is less reversible, it might not be as desirable to encourage public
sector participation in early career stages. We have, therefore, also included asymmetric
occupational switching costs to capture the fact that easier to move from the private sector
to the public sector than the other way around.
   We use outside estimates for a small number of parameters. The discount factor is set
equal to 0.96. Tuition and living expenses are set equal to the average level in NPSAS.
Admission rules are recovered using Law School Numbers. The time cost of childcare is
set equal to 600 hours a year, and the intra-family income sharing rule is 0.6 (Keane and
Wolpin, 2010).
  32
    Note that Sauer (1998) generates a decline in private sector employment without relying on a learning
model. Instead he uses permanent unobserved discrete types. We abstract from these unobserved differ-
ences. But note that in our data the share of private sector employment declines from 52% in Year 3 to
36% in Year 7 which is much steeper than the decline observed for males.


                                                   28
    Instead of using a MSM estimator, we could have estimated the model using an indirect
inference approach (Gourieroux, Monfort, and Renault, 1993). To assess the potential gains
from implementing an indirect inference approach we have also estimated the regressions
reported in Appendix B using simulated data from our estimated model.33 We find that
our model replicates the key regression results rather well. Note that we do not directly
fit these conditional moments in our MSM estimation approach. These findings provide an
additional validation of our estimation approach. They also suggest that the gains from
adopting an indirect inference approach that exploits the regressions reported in Appendix

5.1       Parameter Estimates

We estimate the parameters of our model using a MSM estimator. Table 14 in Appendix
A reports key parameter estimates and estimated standard errors. We find that there are
large monetary benefits from attending top law schools. First, graduating from a Tier 1
law school increases earnings in all sectors, promotion to partner as well as earnings of
potential spouses. There are also substantial benefits from attending Tier 2 law schools
although the effects are generally smaller than the effects of top tier schools. Our estimates
also imply that the non-pecuniary benefits from attending law school are inversely related
to the quality of the law school. Attending Tier 1 law schools takes apparently more effort
than attending lower ranked law schools.
    In the online appendix we also report the OLS earnings regression coefficients and com-
pare these estimates to our structural estimates. We find that the estimates of the returns
to experience are of similar magnitude in both models. However, there are two notable
 33
      The results of this exercise are shown in Tables 6-9 in the online appendix.

differences among the set of parameter estimates. First, our structural estimates imply
that the returns to law schools are higher for private sector employments. Second, our
structural estimates imply lower returns to law schools for public sector employment. We
thus conclude that accounting for selection into occupations primarily affects the estimates
for the returns to schooling.
  The probability of being promoted to partner positively depends on work experience as
one would expect. Earnings in each occupation also increase with experience and ability.
We also find that hours of work differ among occupations, but do not systematically differ by
any observed characteristics. Finally, there are significant costs associated with switching
occupations.
  The estimates of the parameters of the flow utility function indicate that females get
some significant non-pecuniary benefits from marriage. Public sector occupations are more
valuable when having children. Being partner in a law firm provides strong pecuniary
benefits which are partially off-set by negative non-pecuniary benefits.
  We find that the arrival rate of marriage proposals declines substantially over time. The
probability of meeting a potential spouse for a 28-year-old is 0.20. The probability declines
to 0.12 when she reaches 38. Children arrival rates are much higher for a married individual
than a single one. Female lawyers in our sample have very few children out of wedlock. For
the married individual, the arrival rates of children peak at 0.35 at age 33, and decline to
0.02 when she reaches 38. As individuals value marriage, it is costly to postpone marriage.
These findings are illustrated in Figure 1.
  The quality of the spouse, as measured by spousal earnings, depends on the school
attended. Not surprisingly we find that females that graduate from better law schools meet
higher quality spouses, on average. More importantly, there is a large negative impact of
debt on the quality of potential marriages. Our estimates indicate that a $10,000 increase
in debt implies a 3.8% decrease in annual spousal earnings. There is a small catch-up effect
over time as the quality of spouses with debt increase as time goes by.

   To illustrate the learning process in our model, we plot the speed of learning for two
different realizations of signals. The first realization is a sequence of positive signals. The
second realization is a sequence of bad signals. Figure 2 illustrates the properties of our
model. Overall our estimates imply that individuals learn reasonably fast about their
prospects of promotion.
   To generate some additional insights into the properties of our model, we predict private
sector career choices for low-debt and high-debt females under three different scenarios.
First, we assume that high-debt females face the same sequence of budget constraints as
low-debt females, holding their school choices fixed. Hence differences in outcomes are only
driven by differences in marriage market opportunities. Second, we consider the opposite
case, where low- and high-debt females face the same marriage market prospects, but face
a different sequence of budget constraints, holding school choices fixed. Finally, we predict
choices for low- and high-debt females under the assumption that they have the same
baseline schooling choices.
   Figure 3 illustrates the results of this exercise. In the baseline model, the share of high-
debt individuals employed in private practice is up to 15 percentage points higher than
for their low-debt peers. Even after 12 years the gap is still approximately 10 percentage
points. Equalizing marriage prospects explains approximately a half of this gap. Equalizing
the budget constraint explains approximately 35% of the gap while equalizing the initial
school choices explains approximately 30% of the gap between low- and high-debt females.
We thus conclude that equalizing marriage prospects has a larger impact on career choices
than equalizing budget constraints or equalizing educational choices.34
   We also consider the impact of equalizing budget sets or marriage opportunities on initial
law school choices. The results are illustrated in Figure 4. Overall we find that attendance
is shifted from Tier 2 to Tier 1 law schools by up to four percentage points. Recall that
  34
   These findings are broadly consistent with the previous literature. Sauer (1998, 2004) find that the
impact of debt via the budget channel on career choices for male lawyers is small.

school quality has a large impact on the job offer distributions in the labor market. In
the public sector, the mean salary for Tier 1 graduates is 24 percent higher than for Tier
2 graduates, 31 percent higher than for Tier 3 graduates, and 46 percent higher than for
Tier 4 graduates. The compensation gap is even more pronounced in the private sector,
where the mean associates salary for Tier 1 graduates is 23 percent higher than for Tier 2
graduates, and 33 percent higher than for graduates of Tier 3 and 45 percent higher than
for those of Tier 4 schools. The corresponding numbers for partner are 45, 43, and 103
percent. We also find a high degree of assortative matching in the marriage market. After
controlling for other characteristics, spousal earnings for Tier 1 graduate are 15 percent
higher than for Tier 2 graduates, 30 percent higher than for Tier 3 graduates, and 40
percent higher than for Tier 4 graduates. We conclude that the high price of Tier 1 law
schools deters a significant fraction of qualified low wealth students from attending these
highly selective schools.

  Overall our model fits the data well. Note that the model captures the differences in

                                                36
initial career choices conditional on debt level. We observe in the data that private sector
employment of females with high debt is approximately 9 percentage points higher than
that of females with low debt initially. The model predicts a gap of 9 percentage points.
The main drawback of the model is that it predicts that the gap closes faster than observed
in the data. With respect to family outcomes, the model slightly over-predicts the gap
observed in the data. Finally, model also captures the gap in accepted spousal earnings
and the differential probability of having a child.
  We also find that the model captures the important life-cycle trends. One such trend is
the decline in private practice employment between 2003 and 2012. The data show drops
of 22 and 24 percentage points for the high-debt and low-debt females, respectively. The
model produces similar declines.

  Table 11 considers the model fit at the law school attendance level. We find that the
model accurately captures matriculation rates by tier. The model is also consistent with the
fact that students at top 20 schools accumulate more debt than students at lower quality
schools.
  Table 12 reports the key transition moments. We find that our model captures the
features of the data reasonably well. In particular, our model generates enough persistence
in occupational choices.
  Note that our baseline specification also does not include monetary costs for raising
children. We have explored the impact of adding pecuniary costs of having children to the
model. Since we do not have any data in our sample that would be informative about the

magnitude of these costs, we consider two scenarios. In the first case we set costs equal to
$10, 000. In the second case we use an estimate of $15, 000. If we assume that monetary
costs are equally shared by the couple, then these correspond to $20,000 and $30,000 of
total monetary childcare costs. Overall, we find that there are only small differences among
the model specifications.35 The main difference is that females are more likely to work in
the private sector. The relative difference between low and high debt females remains
almost constant. Hence, including these costs does not affect the relative impact of debt
on occupational choices. The effects of including these costs are similar when we consider
marriage outcomes. We thus conclude that our characterization of the relative impact
of debt on key outcomes is robust with respect to including reasonable estimates of the
monetary costs of raising children.

6     Policy Analysis
Encouraging public sector employment has been an important policy concern. One reason
is the significant shortage of public sector lawyers. For example, the New York Times
reported in 2013 that “professional guidelines recommend that public defenders handle
no more than 400 misdemeanor cases in a year, yet a 2009 report found that part-time
public defenders in Orleans Parish handled the equivalent of 19,000 misdemeanor cases per
attorney annually, which means an average of about seven minutes spent by a lawyer on
each case.” Similar shortages are observed in more severe criminal cases. Another reason
of concern is a perceived lack of high quality lawyers in the public sector (Iyengar, 2007).
A lack of high quality public defenders undermines the legal system and provides a serious
disadvantage for individuals who cannot afford to hire their own lawyers.
    Our baseline model predicts that females work on average 5.81 years in public or busi-
ness sector jobs during the first 14 years of their careers, which closely matches the data.
(Recall that our model does not differentiate between business sector and public sector
occupations.) We have also seen that female lawyers with high debt are more likely to
avoid or postpone careers in the public sector than females with low debt. This raises the
question of whether one can design public policies that would encourage participation in
public sector careers at reasonable costs.
    An example of a traditional loan forgiveness policy implemented in the U.S. is the Public
Service Loan Forgiveness Program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It
forces participants to enroll in an income-contingent repayment scheme during the first 10
years of the career. After ten years of public service, the remaining debt is then discharged.
Our analysis suggests that this policy is likely to be ineffective since 10 years are too
long given the importance of the indirect marriage market effects. We, therefore, focus on
shorter term policies in this section.
    We can use our estimated model to evaluate a variety of shorter-term policies that


                                             39
are aimed at increasing public sector employment. The first policy is a conditional loan
forgiveness program that provides a payment of principal and interest for each year of
working in the public sector conditional on having accumulated a certain experience in the
public sector. We consider a variety of policies that differ by the required years of service
(5, 6, or 7 years) and the generosity in subsidy.
  The second policy is a conditional earnings subsidy. The idea is to subsidize public
sector employment by providing a fixed percentage earnings subsidy conditional on having
worked a number of years in the public sector. We consider subsidy rates between 10 and 12
percent which are approximately as expensive as the loan forgiveness policies studied above.
Note that the two policies are similar. The earnings subsidy provides large payments to
females with high earnings while the repayment subsidy provides large payments to females
with high debt. Otherwise, these two policies are identical.
  Finally, we consider a traditional loan forgiveness policy that applies to all lawyers that
have worked a certain number of years in the public sector. In contrast to traditional loan
forgiveness policies, conditional loan forgiveness policies provide additional incentives for
each additional year of public service independently of how many years have been previously
served.
  We characterize the impact of these policies on career choices and compute the implied
costs of an additional year in public sector employment. Table 13 reports the key findings
of these policy experiments. We report the parameters of the policy in Columns 1-3. We
also report the implied price per year of extra service in Column 4, spending per capita in
Column 5, and the average years worked in the public or business sector in Column 6.
  There are several interesting findings. All policies consider above are expensive. The
prices for an additional year of public sector work range from 10 to 40 thousand dollars
for conditional earnings subsidies or conditional loan forgiveness programs. The estimated
prices are much larger for traditional loan forgiveness programs. The significant costs of
these programs are also reflected in the predicted spending per capita.

  Conditional subsidy programs are more effective than traditional loan forgiveness pro-
grams. The overall impact of the program depends on the generosity and the eligibility
criteria. Not surprisingly, we find that more generous policies have a larger overall im-
pact. The first two policies – the conditional earnings subsidy and the conditional loan
forgiveness programs – have similar effects on public sector employment and are almost
equally expensive. Conditional loan forgiveness programs tend to be slightly more effec-
tive and cheaper than conditional earnings subsidies because they target a more responsive
sub-population of female lawyers. The traditional loan forgiveness policy has much smaller
overall effects on public sector employment and is more expensive. We thus conclude that
conditional earnings subsidies and conditional loan forgiveness programs are more efficient
policies than traditional loan forgiveness policies.
  As we discussed above, an alternative explanation of high attrition rates and of low
public employment rates by students with high debt is that starting a career in the private
sector tends to be more reversible than starting a career in the public sector. To explore
this issue in more detail, we have explored another counterfactual with reduced mobility
costs from the public to the private sector. In particular, we have considered the case


                                              41
in which we reduce the switching costs from the public to the private sector by 50 (100)
percent. The average number of years in public sector increases from 5.81 years to 5.85
(6.02) years. Overall, we conclude that these policies only have moderate impacts on public
sector employment.
    We have primarily focused in this section on the problem of attracting more lawyers
to the public sector. As we discussed above, one may also be concerned that the lawyers
attracted to the public sector may be of lower quality than the lawyers that work in private
practice. More research is clearly needed to explore these issues in more detail.



7     Conclusions
We have developed and estimated a dynamic model that captures schooling, career, and
marriage choices by aspiring young female lawyers. Our model accounts for several im-
portant features of labor markets for lawyers, including differences in hours and earnings
across occupational tracks, and learning about the uncertain prospects of promotion to
partner. We have shown that our model provides new insights into the effects of debt or
negative wealth on marriage and career prospects of females. We find that the observed
gap in career paths, marriage and child rearing outcomes is primarily driven by the worse
match that high-debt females obtain in the marriage market. Finally, we use the model to
study the design of policies that aim to increase public sector employment. We have shown
that it is possible to design conditional earnings subsidies or conditional loan forgiveness
programs that significantly increase public sector career choices at reasonable costs.
    The main insights and empirical results of this study are promising for future research.
We find that females tend to choose lower-ranked, cheaper law schools to avoid debt. Loan
repayment subsidies increase a law student’s willingness to borrow and hence the demand
for high-quality education. A relevant concern for policy makers is whether top private



                                             42
schools will respond to these aid policies by increasing tuition.36 It is worth noting that
higher tuitions at law schools do not necessarily imply an inefficient outcome if law schools
use the additional revenues to increase the quality of education, thereby raising labor market
returns. It would be interesting to study these issues within an equilibrium framework that
would properly endogenize tuition and admission policies, and law school quality. We leave
these ideas for future research.




 36
    There exists a small literature studying the general equilibrium effects of financial aid policies on the
schools’ tuition levels. Epple, Romano, and Sieg (2006) and Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and Sieg (2017)
develop an equilibrium models of the college education market to study access and aﬀordability of college
education. Their quantitative analysis suggests that private schools may increase tuition in response to an
increase in publicly provided grants. Epple, Romano, Sarpca, Sieg, and Zaber (2017) show that this model
is consistent with observed price discrimination in the U.S. market for higher education. Grey and
Hedlund (2016) extend the model to account for dynamics in the labor market outcomes and show that
their model can explain the rise in college tuitions observed over time. Turner (2014) ﬁnds that colleges
capture 12 percent of their students’ Pell Grant aid through price discrimination, using a regression
discontinuity design. Cellini and Goldin (2014) document that the for-proﬁt colleges eligible for federal
student aid programs charge tuition that is 78 percent higher than that charged by comparable non-
eligible ones. Lucca, Nadauld, and Shen (2015) ﬁnd that institutions more exposed to changes in the
subsidized federal loan program increased their tuition disproportionately around these policy changes.
Overall, these studies suggest that part of the aid will be captured by the schools. But the eﬀect of
policies subsidizing repayments, especially the policies that depend on labor market outcomes, have not
yet been studied.

B.1         Females with high debt prefer private law firms

Table 15 reports reports the marginal effects in probability of working at private practice
through logistic regressions. Columns (1) and (3) do not use controls while Columns (2)
and 4) control for undergraduate GPA, school tier,whether mother is a lawyer, whether
father is a lawyer, mother’s education, father’s education, and age. The top panel uses
debt upon graduation while the lower panel uses remaining debt as of debt. The finding
that females with more debt have more work experience in private law firms is robust
among all specifications.

B.2     Females with high debt are likely to postpone marriage

Table 16 reports estimates form conditional log-log models for discrete time proportional
hazard. Time is bundled in 2 periods, each period corresponds to 3 years. We report the
marginal effects evaluated at the means of the regressors. We cluster by individual. Control
variables are undergraduate GPA, school tier,whether mother is a lawyer, whether father
is a lawyer, mother’s education, father’s education, and age. The results are for 2006. The
top panel uses debt upon graduation while the lower panel uses remaining debt as of debt.
The finding that Females with more debt are more likely to postpone marriage is robust
among all specifications.

B.3     Spouses of females with high debt have lower earnings

Table 17 reports result obtained by regression spousal income on debt without controls in
Column (1) and controlling for undergraduate GPA, age, school tier, year of bar admission,
whether a parent is a lawyer, parents’ education, and race in Column (2). In Columns (3) -
(5) we conduct additional robustness checks and control for sector specific work experience,
own salary and own work hours. The top panel uses debt upon graduation while the lower
panel uses remaining debt as of debt. The finding that spouses of females with more debt
have lower earnings is robust among all specifications.

B.4    Females with high debt are likely to postpone childbearing

Table 18 reports estimates of conditional log-log models for discrete time proportional
hazard, time is bundled in 7 periods, each period corresponds to 1 year. It reports the
marginal effects evaluated at mean. Average marginal effects are similar. Clusters are
by individual. Control variables are undergraduate GPA, school tier,whether mother is a
lawyer, whether father is a lawyer, mother’s education, father’s education, and age. The
finding that females with more debt are more likely to postpone childbearing since they
delay marriage is robust among all specifications.

We then truncate the distribution of GPA at 4 which is the maximum possible value for
the GPA.37



D      The Evolution of Debt
Table 19 compares the observed debt values with the ones predicted by the model. The
table shows that the predicted remaining debt matches up with observed remaining debt
6 and 12 years after graduation. The main difference is that the model slightly under-
predicts the initial levels of debt. Moreover, the model slightly over-predict the rate at
which females pay of their debt. Notice that females in different sectors pay down their
debt at roughly the same speed using a uniform schedule that is similar to the one we use
in our model.
   In Appendix B we have also shown that the key stylized facts reported in Section 2.2
of the paper are robust to using different measures of debt. We, therefore, conclude that
the main results reported in this paper do not depend on the specific definition of the debt
measure used in the analysis.

    Table 11 in the online appendix reports the estimated or calibrated parameter values for the joint
distribution. It also explains which data sources were used to estimate each parameter.
