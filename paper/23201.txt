Is Local Public Sector Rent Extraction Higher in Progressive Cities or High Amenity Cities?

                                            ABSTRACT

Public finance theories of the median voter’s preferences and local public sector rent extraction
posit that liberal cities and high amenity cities will feature a larger, better paid local public sector.
Compensating differentials theory predicts that real wages will be lower in beautiful states and
localities. Using both Federal and California city level administrative micro data, I study public
sector compensation across space. At the Federal level, California workers are only paid 9%
more than observationally identical workers in Alabama. Given the high California home prices,
such workers are paying for the California amenities. Within California, beach cities hire more
workers but pay them less in real terms. Liberal cities both pay public sector workers more and
employ more of them. Liberal cities have much larger per-capita pension liabilities.

Introduction
        Research in local public finance posits that the public sector will be larger and its

compensation will be more generous in locations featuring unique exogenous amenities because

the rich inelastically demand to live in such areas (Brueckner and Neumark 2014). California’s

beach cities offer a test of this hypothesis. In beach communities ranging from Malibu to Santa

Cruz, there are unique exogenous tied attributes that cannot be found inland or in other states.

Beach cities also feature significant supply side development constraints. The California’s

Coastal Commission imposes stringent housing supply limits on new construction close to the

beach (Kahn, Vaughn and Zasslof 2010). The combination of inelastic demand for housing and

inelastic supply of housing leads to very high home prices and a large per-capita tax revenue

base that can be used to fund the public sector (Gyourko, Mayer and Sinai 2009, Saiz 2009,

Diamond 2017). Zillow housing data indicates that the average beach city’s home features a

sales price that is 60% higher than the price for homes in non-beach cities in the same county.

        Another strand of the local public finance literature has argued that progressive cities will

create more public sector jobs and offer higher public sector pay because such jobs are a type of

redistribution (Alesina and Easterly 1998, Glaeser and Kahn 1999). Progressive cities such as

Berkeley and Santa Monica are well known for supporting policies that redistribute income.

Residents in these areas support greater redistribution (Luttmer 2001). During a time of rising

income inequality, the public sector plays an increasingly important role in providing middle

class jobs.

        This paper uses two administrative data sets (that are not top coded or self reported) to

study the geographic variation in federal and California employee salaries as a function of

location specific amenities and local voter preferences for redistribution. I estimate a basic
Mincer wage regression using repeat cross-sections of the federal employee data. Nominal

wages for federal public sector workers are only 9% higher for California workers than Alabama

workers.

       Using administrative data for all California city public employees over the years 2009 to

2015, I study both the salaries, benefits and the count of public sector jobs by California City.

My data set includes 432 cities. This sample includes 49 beach cities. I find that California’s

beach cities feature 32% higher public employment than observationally identical cities in the

same county in the same year. Public sector earnings are higher in more liberal cities in

California. This is evidence in favor of the taste for local redistribution hypothesis. Within

California, there is no statistically significant difference in the nominal wages of beach city

workers relative to other public sector workers who work in a non-beach city in the same county

in the same year.

       Deflating by local real estate prices, I find that beach city public sector workers are paid a

lower salary than non-beach city public sector workers who work in the same county. Together,

the Federal public sector pay findings for California and the local California findings suggest that

public sector workers in the most beautiful locations pay for amenities on the job because they

are not being paid a wage premium.      These public sector worker findings mirror earlier cross-

U.S work studying the compensating differentials for private sector workers. Similar to the

earlier work of Blomquist, Berger and Hohn (1988) and Gyourko and Tracy (1991), I find that

public sector workers earn lower real wages in more desirable areas. Such public sector workers

pay for the spatially tied amenities that they consume (Rosen 2002).

       Given that California’s public sector workers receive a defined benefit retirement funds,

public sector pay is likely to translate into larger long term obligations to retired workers. In the
final section of the paper, I study how California City actuarial and market pension liabilities

vary across space. I document that beach cities do not have larger liabilities while liberal cities

do have larger per-capita liabilities.

Spatial Compensating Differentials for Federal Public Sector Workers

        To begin to study public sector worker earnings across space, I examine the earnings of

federal executive branch workers across U.S states. Given that California is widely viewed as

offering the best quality of life in the United States, I test whether federal workers employed in

California earn similar salaries as observationally identical federal workers who work in other

states. I use Federal data from 1998 to 2014. The Federal Government has created a micro data

set that includes all Executive Branch employees (https://www.opm.gov/data/).1

        In previous work, Brueckner and Neumark (2014) use the CPS to compare quality

adjusted workers who work in the public and private sector. In contrast throughout this paper, I

will be comparing the earnings and benefits of public sector workers. In this section, I focus on

cross-state variation in public sector pay for federal workers in the executive branch. I do not

model the decision to work for the federal government. Instead, I simply focus on comparing the

earnings of different federal workers who work in different states.

        Observed public sector earnings represent an equilibrium determined both by the demand

by the federal and local government for workers and the willingness of workers to work at a

given salary and the bargaining strength of the union representing the workers. At the Federal

level, public sector unions do not negotiate pay (Gyourko and Tracy 1986). Such unions instead

can lobby through the political process to raise worker pay. The Bureau of Labor Statistics

1
 https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-
guidance/hr-reporting/ghrr07_ch1.pdf
makes recommendations to keep federal pay competitive with private sector pay to minimize

public to private job transitions (Gyourko and Tracy 1986).

       I use the federal pay data to explore spatial compensating differentials in a setting where

public sector unions are not powerful. I estimate repeat cross-section public sector Mincer

earnings regressions. This approach builds on the work by Blomquist, Berger and Hoem (1988)

and Gyourko and Tracy (1991) but rather than taking a parametric stand on what are the key

local public goods (such as climate, crime and pollution), I simply include a state fixed effect for

each state where Alabama is the omitted category. Define worker i in state l at time t. I

estimate:

                                                                     (1)



       In the regressions reported in Table One, I control for the occupation of the worker,

gender, sixteen government ranks, ethnicity and focus on the state fixed effects. The first finding

is the very high R2 in each cross-sectional regression. The R2 is never lower than .95.2 The

second result is the very small male earnings premium across the years. The third finding is the

tiny cross-state earnings differentials. The California coefficient represents the difference

between a standardized Federal worker in Alabama and California. In 1998, the quality adjusted

Federal worker in California earns 3% more than his Alabama counterpart. By 2014, this

differential has grown to 9%.   Based on recent Zillow data, the median value of a single family

home in Alabama is $122,000 while the median value of a home in California is $479,000.

This enormous differential indicates that Federal workers are paying to live and work in

2
 The federal data includes 444 occupations. When I rerun the regression while dropping the
state fixed effects the R2 barely changes.
California. Looking at the other fixed effects no others stand out as large in size. New Jersey

has the largest state fixed effect at 11.3% in 2010 but even this is small in economic terms.

California is widely viewed to have the best quality of life in the nation. These results indicate

that the Federal workers who work in California are implicitly paying to work there.



California Public Sector Worker Earnings and Benefits Data


         In this section, I present new results based on earnings regressions of California city

public sector workers. Throughout this section, I am assuming that city public sector workers

who work in a given county in a given year are perfect substitutes with respect to their skill. If

workers differ with respect to their skill and if the highest quality workers choose to work in the

most beautiful locations, then this would induced a positive correlation such that we should find

that public sector workers who work in beach cities earn a wage premium. In the regressions I

report below, I will be controlling for city size. If workers are of equal quality, then any

observed earnings difference between workers in different cities in the same county is either due

to amenity variation or local union bargaining power.

         I use data for California city workers over the years 2009 to 2015.3 The data provides

information on each worker’s overall salary, total overtime pay and total benefits and the

employer’s city or county and type of work but no other attributes of the worker. In the year

2015, the data report the earnings for 314,565 California city workers. The median worker’s

earnings was $59,038 and the mean was $64,009.         This data set excludes workers in the public

education sector.


3
    http://publicpay.ca.gov/Reports/RawExport.aspx
          To measure local home prices, I use Zillow’s city level Median Home Value Index data

from June of each year.4      To measure each California city’s political attributes, I use data from

the UC Berkeley IGS for 2012 political party registration. My Liberal vote share is defined as

the share of registered voters who are registered as Democrats + Peace and Freedom + Green

Party. I also have collected data on each California City’s population in 2010.

          My final data set includes 417 California cities and 49 of them are beach cities. There are

beaches such as Venice Beach that are not an incorporated city. The beach cities are listed in

Table 2. Consider Los Angeles County. It features eight beach cities and 80 non-beach cities. I

will exploit this within county variation to test for the role of beaches and progressive voter

shares.

          In Table Three, I use year 2000 census tract data and I run demographic regressions to

compare the average demographics in beach cities relative to other cities in the same county.

There is no statistically significant differential in poverty rates or population density between

beach cities and non-beach cities in the same California County. The results in column (4) show

that the Hispanic share is 12.5 percentage points lower in beach cities and the college graduate

share is 10.9 percentage points higher in beach cities relative to non-beach cities in the same

county. Beach cities also feature higher median incomes and much higher median home prices

(see columns 6 and 7).

          In Table Four, I further explore the differences in beach cities and non-beach cities in the

same California County by using the Zillow median home price index as the dependent variable.

Controlling for city population, the average beach city features home prices that are 62% higher

4
    http://www.zillow.com/research/data/
(exp(.483)-1) than the average non-beach city in the same county. This is strong evidence of the

claim that beach cities have unique amenities. As shown in column (2) these cities do not

differentially attract progressive voters. The progressive voter share is higher in bigger cities.



California Public Sector Employment, Earnings and Pension Benefits


       In this section, I will study the public sector’s employment and pay in beach cities and in

more progressive cities. My starting point is to explore the size of the public sector. In the right

two columns of Table Four, I report two regressions where the unit of analysis is a city/year.

Controlling for county/year fixed effects and a city’s population, I find that the public sector’s

count of employees is 23% higher in beach cities relative to observationally identical cities in the

same county. Zax (1998) offers a possible explanation. He argues that public sector unions

seek to improve work conditions for workers by requiring them to work fewer hours and this

creates the possibility that in areas where public sector unions have more clout that more workers

will be hired to complete the same set of tasks. As shown in column (3), liberal cities also have

a larger public sector. A ten percentage point increase in the share of liberal registered voters is

associated with a 10.6 percentage point increase in the size of the public sector. Cities with

higher home prices also have a larger local government. The elasticity with respect to the Zillow

home price index is .45.   Column (4) in Table Four repeats this exercise but this time the

dependent variable the log of part time workers. I define part time workers as those who earn less

than $15,000 a year. In this case the beach coefficient grows to 29%.

       I study how California city public sector pay varies across cities in the same county. A

standard compensating differentials theory would predict that earnings will be lower in high
amenity areas because working in such a city offers access to great amenities. In contrast, the

Brueckner and Neumark (2014) theory of rent extraction would posit that earnings for public

sector workers will be higher there.5

        To study this, I will present two sets of results. In both sets of results set, the unit of

analysis is a person i in city l in county m in year t.




                                         (2)


In this equation (2), the dependent variable is the log of nominal earnings. It is important to note

that I include county/year fixed effects in all of the California regressions reported in this paper.

In addition to presenting estimates of equation (2), I also present estimates of equation (3).




                                                                                                      (3)


        The difference between equation (2) and equation (3) is that in equation (3), I deflate a

worker’s earnings by the Zillow rental index for that city in that year. The dependent variable in

equation (3) allows me to follow Moretti (2014) and to study real wage variation within

California counties. More specifically, Zillow reports the single family home median price for a

California city in each year (this is measured in nominal dollars). I convert this into a rental

expenditure by multiplying it by .075. The dependent variable in equation (3) can be thought of


5
 I know of no publicly available micro data on private sector workers that is geocoded so that
one’s city of work could be identified (i.e a worker works in the City of Santa Monica or the City
of Beverly Hills) that would allow for a private sector earnings regression to be estimated with
such fine geographic identifiers.
as the log of a worker’s real pay. I report estimates of equation (2) and (3) because I recognize

that a worker does not have to live and work in the same jurisdiction but that the spatial

correlation of home prices across space means that the worker will have a longer commute if she

chooses to work in a high amenity beach city but to live far from that area.

       In equations (2) and (3), I include additional explanatory variables such as county by year

fixed effects, the city’s liberal voter share and population as of the year 2000, a dummy

indicating whether the worker works in a beach city and the log of the city’s annual Zillow home

price index.6 The standard errors are clustered by city.   The beach indicator controls for within

county variation in amenities. The beach cities will feature a lower summer temperature and

offer greater beauty and beach access. I include the home price measure because it proxies for

the city’s income and public sector unions are likely to demand cost of living adjustments to

allow workers to earn salaries so that they can afford housing within the jurisdiction.7 The city’s

population controls for urban scale effects and may proxy for the complexity of jobs. A larger

county may have the need for higher quality public sector workers.


6
  I recognize that a weakness of my approach is that I do not have demographic controls at either
the individual level or at the city/year level. While the Census Micro Data do provide place of
work PUMAS, these geographic areas are larger than the cities. This means that there is not a
one to one mapping from place of work identifiers to California cities. I know of no micro data
set that provides the demographic attributes of public sector workers that includes geographic
identifiers such as that the worker works in the city of Santa Monica. The census provides more
geographically refined data on place of residence but in this study I am focusing on place of
work.
7
  Using data for Los Angeles County, Orange County and Ventura provided by Saiz (2009), I
have calculated each city’s share of mountain land. Saiz (2009) argues that housing supply is
more inelastic in these mountainy areas because of the extra construction costs. Diamond (2017)
argues that such inelastic supply enables public sector unions to extract more rents. For the
subset of 96 cities for which I am able to estimate equation (2) using this additional mountain
share variable I find no evidence that all else equal that public sector workers earn higher pay in
cities with a greater mountain share.
       A weakness of the California administrative data that I discuss below is that it does not

have micro human capital controls for age, education, or gender of the workers. In results I

report below, I will stratify by specific function and occupation of the workers. If workers differ

with respect to skill and if the most skilled self select to work in the beautiful beach cities then

this should induce an upward bias on the beach coefficient (for a similar logic in the case of

estimating the value of life using hedonic methods see Hwang and Reed 1992).

       Table Five reports six estimates of equation (2). Controlling for county/year fixed

effects, I estimate a city population elasticity of .22 on annual earnings. As shown across the six

regressions, the beach coefficient is never statistically significant. In column (2), I include each

city centroid’s latitude and longitude. The results are robust to controlling for these geographic

variables. In the remaining columns, I include additional variables and column (6) reports the

full specification. Larger cities and more liberal cities pay more for public workers. All else

equal, a ten percentage point increase in the Liberal voter registration share is associated with

paying local workers 9.2% more. The Zillow home price elasticity is .22 indicating that cities

with higher home prices pay public workers more. What might be important omitted variables?

One important one is public sector union effort in contract negotiations. I view this variable to be

proxied for by the city’s population size and the Liberal share. Such unions are likely to focus

their efforts on large Liberal cities. Under the Brueckner and Neumark (2014) hypothesis, the

beach coefficient should also reflect such bargaining power but the beach results are not

statistically significant. In results that are available on request, I have included interaction terms

between the population size, Liberal and beach variables. These interactions are individually and

jointly insignificant when I re-run an augmented version of equation (2).
        Table Six reports additional estimates of equations (2) and (3) but I now break out the

results by major government categories. The dependent variable is the log of the worker’s

annual earnings. Column (1) focuses on police, column (2) includes only firemen, and column

(3) includes only recreation workers. Across all three job categories, workers in larger cities

earn more. In three of the four regressions, the home price index is positively correlated with

salaries but its coefficient is low.   This suggests that many public sector workers who work in

expensive cities either live in smaller homes in that city or commute from lower home price

cities in the same county. In all four regressions, I fail to reject the hypothesis that the beach

coefficient is zero. Surprisingly, the Liberal variable is no longer positive and statistically

significant for these subsamples.

        Table Seven reports how California city public worker benefits, overtime and pension

attributes vary for city workers within California counties. Beach cities pay lower benefits in

nominal terms (not even deflating by real estate prices). Liberal cities pay higher benefits.

Neither beach cities nor liberal cities pay more in overtime pay.      For 75% of the sample, I am

able to match two attributes of the public sector worker’s pension package. These two attributes

are the annual defined benefit plan and age of retirement. For example a “2% and 60” worker

receives a 2% of his annual highest salary for each year of service and can retire at age 60. So a

worker whose highest salary is $90,000 and who worked for 20 years will receive starting at age

60 an annual payment of .4*90000 per year.        In columns (3) and (4), I run two separate

regressions of the “percent amount” and the “minimum age” at retirement. This minimum age,

which is often 60, determines the earliest age such that a worker can begin to receive his defined

benefit retirement flow. Perhaps surprisingly, I do not find based on the Zillow variable that

higher home price cities feature more generous pensions. I find that beach cities have more
generous pensions. Beach city workers receive an extra .13 percentage point and they retire at

roughly 1 year earlier than other public sector workers in the same county and year.

       In Table Eight, I report a new round of estimates of equations (2) and (3) based on

employees in public education (grades K-12) in 2015. The data report for all workers in the

sector and provide a code for identifying teachers. In Table Eight, I explore the salary and

benefits of workers in the K-12 sector. Liberal cities consistently pay more and offer greater

benefits but I reject the hypothesis that beach cities pay teachers more.




California City Level Pension Obligations


       There is a growing recognition that many cities have major future liabilities due to

defined benefit pension promises made to public sector workers (Novy-Marx and Rauh 2009,

Nation 2010). In this section I use California city level data from 2008 to 2013 to study the

correlates of a larger per-capital pension obligations (see http://www.pensiontracker.org/). In the

Stanford pension tracker data set, two variables reported from 2008 to 2013 are “market liability

and “actuarial liability. Market liability is the present value of future benefits for current

members, discounted at a market rate of return, ranging from 2.82% to 4.82% between 2011 and

2013. The actuarial liability is the present value of future benefits for current members, using

discount rates reported by most systems, typically 7.5%.

       To study the correlates of a city i in county m at time t’s pension obligations, I estimate

equation (4).

                                                                                                 (4)
       The results reported in Table Nine highlight that larger cities and more liberal cities have

larger pension obligations. Beach cities do not have higher pension liabilities. The market

obligations are much larger than the actuarial liabilities in the more liberal cities.



Conclusion


       The public sector is a major provider of middle class jobs. Both the Federal government

and state and local governments employ millions of people. While a large literature has explored

the compensating differentials paid across space for private sector workers, we know little about

how public sector worker earnings vary with spatial amenities. Compensating differentials

theory would predict that they will be inversely related while local union rent extraction theory

would posit that they will be positively correlated.

       Using a Federal level data set, I have documented that federal workers employed in

California are paid only a slight wage premium over observationally identical workers who work

in Alabama. This suggests that federal workers are paying a large premium (via high rent prices)

to live and work in California.

       In contrast to federal workers, there are large differences across space in California city

public sector compensation. California features a large public sector that receives a generous

defined benefit pension plan. This high amenity state features hundreds of cities that differ with

respect to their location and their voters’ demographics and political preferences. Access to high

quality administrative data provides the opportunity to study the correlates of the public sector’s

compensation. Using these newly accessible administrative data, I have documented that beach

cities hire more public sector workers and do not pay workers higher nominal wages. When I
deflate local earnings by a median home prices, I find that public sector workers in beach cities

earn lower real earnings than public sector workers in non-beach cities who work in the same

county in the same year.   Workers in liberal cities do earn more than other public sector

workers in the same county. This result has implications for such city’s aggregate liabilities.
