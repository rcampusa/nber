Production and Learning in Teams

                                         ABSTRACT

The effect of coworkers on the learning and the productivity of an individual is measured
combining theory and data. The theory is a frictional equilibrium model of the labor market in
which production and the accumulation of human capital of an individual are allowed to depend
on the human capital of coworkers. The data is a matched employer-employee dataset of US
firms and workers. The measured production function is supermodular. The measured human
capital function is non-linear: Workers catch-up to more knowledgeable coworkers, but are not
dragged-down by less knowledgeable ones. The market equilibrium features a pattern of sorting
of coworkers across teams that is inefficiently positive. This inefficiency results in low human
capital individuals having too few chances to learn from more knowledgeable coworkers and, in
turn, in a stock of human capital and a flow of output that are inefficiently low.

1     Introduction
The theory of human capital has recognized the importance of learning on the job for
understanding the lifecycle dynamics of wages ever since Becker (1962) and Ben-Porath
(1967). The theory describes the process by which workers learn on the job by means
of a human capital investment function. In some applications (e.g., Ben-Porath 1967),
the investment function is assumed to include the worker’s time as the key input, thus
leading to a trade-off between working and learning. In other applications (e.g., Bagger
et al. 2014), the investment function is assumed to simply depend on whether the worker
is employed or not, thus implying a mechanical process of accumulation. Much fewer
applications, especially empirical ones, consider the quality of coworkers as an input in
the human capital investment function. This lack of attention is especially surprising
considering that academics are well aware of the role played by colleagues in determining
the growth of their own knowledge.
    In this paper, we develop and quantify an equilibrium theory of the labor market
in which the growth of an individual’s human capital is affected by his coworkers. The
theory builds on the search-theoretic models of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) and Cahuc,
Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006)—which have proved successful in explaining the patterns
of workers’ transitions between unemployment, employment and across firms, as well as
the dynamics of individual wages—and on the frictionless models of sorting with evolving
types of Anderson (2015) and Anderson and Smith (2010)—which have explored the
implications of the assumption that the human capital of an individual evolves depending
on the quality of his coworkers. The theory is quantified using a matched employer-
employee dataset of US workers and firms.
    The main finding of the paper is that coworkers matter for the human capital accumu-
lation of an individual and they do so in a non-linear fashion. Specifically, an individual
accumulates human capital at a rate that is increasing in the human capital of his cowork-
ers, when his coworkers are more knowledgeable than he is. In contrast, an individual
accumulates human capital at a rate that is nearly independent of the human capital
of his coworkers, when his coworkers are less knowledgeable than he is. In other words,
individuals catch-up to more knowledgeable coworkers but they are not dragged-down by
less knowledgeable coworkers. In the aggregate, learning from coworkers accounts for 60%
of all the learning on the job that takes place in the economy.
    In the first part of the paper, we develop the theory. We consider a labor market
populated by workers and firms. Workers are ex-ante heterogeneous with respect to their
initial human capital. Firms are ex-ante homogeneous and produce by managing teams of


                                            1
two workers. The firm’s production function may be supermodular or submodular in the
human capital of the two team members. Workers and firms come into contact with each
other as a result of a random search process. When a firm and a worker meet, the firm
hires the worker if the gains from trade are positive—in the sense that the marginal value
of the worker to the production unit of the firm exceeds the marginal value of the worker
in his current production unit (if the worker is employed) or the value of unemployment
(if the worker is unemployed). When a firm hires a worker, the wage allocates the gains
from trade between the firm and the worker according to some given fractions. The wage
remains constant until the worker’s outside option binds because he contacted some other
firm. The human capital of a worker evolves over time according to a stochastic process
which depends on whether the worker is employed or unemployed and, in the first case,
on the human capital of the worker’s colleagues.
   In the second part of the paper, we quantify the theory. Using a matched employer-
employee dataset of US workers and firms, we look at workers who move from employment
to unemployment and then back into employment. We find that, for individuals paid
less than their coworkers in the first job, a 10% increase in the coworkers’ average wage
forecasts a 1.5% higher wage in the second job (conditional on the individual’s wage in the
first job). For individuals paid more than their coworkers in the first job, the coworkers’
average wage does not help forecast their wage in the second job. The logic behind these
regressions is simple. The individual’s wage in the first job is a measure of his human
capital at the start of the job, the coworkers’ wage in the first job is a measure of their
human capital, and the individual’s wage in the second job is a measure of his human
capital at the start of the second job. We focus on people going through an unemployment
spell in between the two jobs, in order to purge the data from heterogeneity in their outside
option when negotiating their wage in the second job. Even so, the correlation between
the coworkers’ wage and the individual’s wage in the second job cannot be interpreted as
the effect of the coworkers’ type on the human capital of the individual. In fact, sorting
may imply some correlation between the coworkers’ human capital and the human capital
of the individual at the start of the first job. To deal with this issue, we use the structure
of the model. We calibrate the model so that it matches an empirical measure of sorting:
the fraction of the wage variance due to differences in the average wage of different firms
and the variance due to differences in the wage of different workers at the same firm.
Additionally, we use information on the relationship between job-to-job transition and
the wage gap between the worker and his coworkers.
   The calibrated parameters reveal that workers catch-up to more knowledgeable cowork-
ers, but are not dragged-down by less knowledgeable coworkers. That is, for workers with


                                              2
less human capital than their coworkers, the accumulation of human capital is increasing
in the coworkers’ knowledge. For workers with more human capital than their cowork-
ers, the accumulation of human capital is independent of the coworkers’ knowledge. The
properties of the calibrated human capital accumulation function tend to generate neg-
ative sorting of workers—that is, low human capital workers being employed alongside
high human capital ones. However, this would result in a counterfactually large fraction
of wage variance within firms. Therefore, the calibrated production function must be su-
permodular, which tends to generate positive sorting of workers and realigns the fraction
of wage variance within firms in the model to the one observed in the data.
   To assess the importance of learning from coworkers in the formation of human capital,
in the production of output, and in the pattern of sorting, we remove the coworkers’ type
from the inputs of the human capital accumulation function. We find that learning from
coworkers accounts for 24% of the stock of human capital held by workers and for more
than 60% of the stock of human capital accumulated by workers on the job. We find
that learning from coworkers accounts for about 20% of output. Finally, we find that
learning from coworkers makes the sorting pattern less positive—in the sense that it
causes high human capital workers to be employed less often alongside other high human
capital workers. To assess the role played by the supermodularity of the production
function, we consider a version of the model in which output is modular in the human
capital of the workers. We find that the supermodularity of the production function has
a negative effect on the stock of human capital and on output. This is so because the
supermodularity of the production function makes the sorting pattern more positive and,
for this reason, reduces the opportunities for low human capital individuals to learn from
more knowledgeable coworkers.
   In the last part of the paper, we examine the efficiency properties of equilibrium. We
prove that the equilibrium is generally inefficient, in the sense that it does not coincide
with the solution to the problem of a social planner. The source of inefficiency is easy
to understand. The marginal value of a certain type of production unit to the planner
includes the output of the unit as well as the entire value of the meetings generated by the
agents attached to the unit (i.e., the firm and the employees). The value of a production
unit in equilibrium includes only a fraction of the value of the meetings generated by the
agents attached to the unit (i.e., a fraction equal to the firm’s bargaining power for the
meetings of the firm and a fraction equal to the worker’s bargaining power for the meetings
of the employees). We also prove that there exists a system of taxes and subsidies that
makes the equilibrium efficient.
   Given the calibrated value of the parameters, we find that the equilibrium pattern of

                                             3
sorting is inefficiently positive. The pattern of sorting is inefficiently positive because,
in equilibrium, a firm too often replaces its worst employee with a higher human capital
worker. Since the pattern of sorting is inefficiently positive, low human capital individuals
do not have enough opportunities to learn from more knowledgeable coworkers and, hence,
the stock of human capital is inefficiently low and so is the level of output. The optimal
system of taxes and transfers effectively removes the firm’s incentive to replace the worst
of its employees with a better worker.
   The paper contributes to the literature on search-theoretic models of the labor market.
Our paper builds on equilibrium models of search on the job such as Postel-Vinay and
Robin (2002) and Cahuc, Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006). Bagger et al. (2014), Menzio
et al. (2016) and Burdett et al. (2018) introduced human capital accumulation into
equilibrium models of search on the job. Our model differs from these works in two
dimensions. First, we assume that a worker’s human capital evolves over time based not
only on experience but also on the quality of his coworkers. The assumption implies that
the joint value of a firm is not simply the sum of the joint value of the firm and each
employee separately. Having lost the additive separability of the joint value function,
we are free to relax other simplifying assumptions. Specifically, we are free to assume a
production function in which a worker’s human capital may interact with the coworker’s
human capital rather than a production function in which a worker’s human capital only
interacts with the firm’s type. Thus, our model speaks to the sorting pattern of workers
and coworkers in production teams rather than to the sorting pattern of workers and
firms. We believe that it is more natural to think that the assignment of an individual
worker is driven by the quality of the coworkers in different firms rather than by the
quality of the firm itself. Lise and Postel-Vinay (2016) consider a version of Postel-Vinay
and Robin (2002) where the skills of an individual evolve over time depending on the
characteristics of the job he holds. Their focus is on understanding the effect of job
characteristics on the skills of an individual. Our focus is on understanding the effect of
coworkers’ characteristics on the human capital of an individual.
   The paper contributes to a recent literature on the diffusion of knowledge. Lucas
(2008), Perla and Tonetti (2014), Lucas and Moll (2014), Jovanovic (2014), Luttmer
(2015), and Benhabib, Perla and Tonetti (2017) develop a variety of models in which—as
a result of bilateral meetings—individuals can catch-up to the human capital of others.
The literature is theoretical and focused on the effect of knowledge diffusion on the growth
rate of the economy. Our paper contributes to this literature by trying to measure the
process of knowledge diffusion among coworkers using data on the relationship between
the wage of an individual and the wage of his past coworkers. Jarosch, Oberfield and


                                             4
Rossi-Hansberg (2018) have a similar goal but implement it using a different theory (a
frictionless model) and different data (a German dataset).
   The paper contributes to the literature on sorting. Within this literature, our closest
predecessors are Anderson and Smith (2010) and Anderson (2015) who study frictionless
assignment problems with evolving types. They consider the problem of assigning dif-
ferent workers to 2-person production teams, given that output depends on the workers’
types, and that the evolution of an individual worker’s type depends on the type of his
coworker. They show that the supermodularity of the production function is not suffi-
cient to guarantee positive sorting, as the function controlling the evolution of a worker’s
type may push towards negative sorting. For instance, this is the case when low-type
workers tend to catch-up to high-type coworkers. Our paper is a quantitative version of
Anderson and Smith (2010) and Anderson (2015). We find that the production function
is supermodular and that learning is such that low-type workers catch-up to high-type
coworkers and high-type workers are not dragged-down by low-type coworkers. Since
ours is a quantitative model, we want to make sense of the workers’ transitions between
unemployment, employment and across employers. For this reason, we assume that the
labor market is frictional rather than frictionless. Ours is not the first paper on sorting
in frictional labor markets (see, e.g., Shimer and Smith 2000, Gautier and Teulings 2004,
Eeckhout and Kircher 2011, Lise, Meghir and Robin 2016, Bagger and Lentz 2018, Lopes
de Melo 2018, Hagedorn, Law and Manovskii 2018). However, ours is the first paper in
which sorting is between workers within teams rather than between workers and firms.
As mentioned above, we believe that this type of sorting is more natural. Moreover, infer-
ring the complementarity between a worker and his coworkers is easier than inferring the
complementarity between a worker and a firm, as one can observe the wage of coworkers
more easily than the profit of a firm.
   There is also a large literature concerned with measuring the effect of peers on academic
achievement. As in our paper, the key measurement problem is the endogenous sorting
of individuals into groups. This literature deals with the problem either by relying on
natural variation that is presumably uncorrelated with the individual’s choice of peers
(e.g., Hoxby 2000) or by carrying out randomized experiments (e.g., Carrell, Sacerdote
and West 2013 or Booij, Leuven and Oosterbeek 2017). Interestingly, their findings about
the effect of peers on academic achievement are qualitatively similar to our findings on the
effect of coworkers on human capital accumulation. As we do, they find that the quality
of peers improves the academic performance of an individual and that the effect is non-
linear. There is a much smaller literature that tries to measure the effect of coworkers
on an individual worker (see, e.g., Mas and Moretti 2009 and Cornelissen, Dustmann


                                             5
and Schoenberg 2017). The literature is smaller because of several additional difficulties,
namely that running experiments is more costly and that wages are not direct measures
of performance. We deal with these difficulties using theory. That is, we use the well-
established theory of search to model wage determination and the process of sorting of
workers into teams.


2         Theory
In this section, we build a search-theoretic model of the labor market in which the produc-
tivity and the human capital accumulation of an individual depends on the quality of his
coworkers. In Section 2.1, we describe the environment and compare it with Postel-Vinay
and Robin (2002), Cahuc, Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006) and with Anderson and Smith
(2010). In Section 2.2, we define an equilibrium. In Section 2.3, we briefly illustrate some
of the features of equilibrium to allow the reader to get acquainted with the mechanics of
the model.


2.1        Environment
Time is discrete and continues forever. In any period, the economy is populated by a
continuum of workers with measure 1 and by a continuum of firms with measure 1. A
worker maximizes the present value of income, discounted at the factor β ∈ (0, 1). At any
point in time, a worker has some level of human capital hk ∈ H, with H = {h1 , h2 , ...hN }
where 0 < h1 < h2 < ... < hN . We refer to k ∈ K ≡ {1, 2, ...N } as the worker’s
human capital type. A worker is in some employment state x ∈ X ≡ {u, K} where
K ≡ {0, 1, 2, ...N }. If the worker is in state x = u, it means that he is unemployed. If
the worker is in state x = 0, it means that the worker is employed by a firm and has no
coworker. If the worker is in state x = 1, 2...N , it means that the worker is employed by
a firm and has a coworker of type x. A worker’s human capital hk is valuable for two
reasons. First, human capital affects the amount of output that the worker can produce
in various employment states (i.e., unemployed, employed on his own, or employed in a
team of workers). Second, human capital affects the growth rate of the human capital of
the worker’s colleagues (i.e., how much he can teach his colleagues).
        A firm maximizes the present value of profits, discounted at the factor β. At any point
in time, a firm is in some state y = (k, `) with k, ` ∈ K.1 If in state y = (0, 0), the firm has
no empoyees. If in state y = (k, 0) for k > 0, the firm has only one employee of type k. If
    1
    We refer to k and ` ∈ K as the employees’ extended types, with the interpretation that an employee
of extended type 0 is a vacant spot on the firm’s team.


                                                  6
in state y = (k, `) for k > 0 and ` > 0, it means that the firm has a team of two employees
of type k and `. The firm operates a production function f : Y → R+ with Y ≡ K × K.
The production function is symmetric, in the sense that f (k, `) = f (k, `). The production
function is such that, if the firm does not employ any workers, it produces no output,
i.e. f (0, 0) = 0. If the firm only employs a worker of type k, it produces f (k, 0) units
of output. If the firm employs two workers, one of type k and one of type `, it produces
f (k, `) units of output. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the firm cannot employ
more than two workers.
   Every period is divided into five stages. At the learning stage, the human capital
of a worker evolves according to a probability distribution function that depends on the
worker’s current human capital k ∈ K and on his employment status x ∈ X. Specifically,
if the worker’s current human capital type is k and his employment status is x, his human
                                                                    P
capital type becomes k+ with probability g(k+ |k, x) ∈ [0, 1], where k+ g(k+ |k, x) = 1.
   At the entry-and-exit stage, a worker exits the labor market with some probability
σ ∈ (0, 1). In aggregate, a measure σ of workers exits the labor market and is replaced by
an equal measure σ of workers who enter the market. A worker who enters the market
has a human capital type k ∈ K drawn from a distribution πk , where πk ∈ [0, 1] and
P
  k πk = 1. A worker enters the market unemployed.

   At the search-and-matching stage, an employed worker becomes unemployed for ex-
ogenous reasons with probability δ ∈ (0, 1). Also, workers and firms come into contact
with each other. In particular, an unemployed worker contacts a randomly selected firm
with probability λu ∈ (0, 1). An employed worker contacts a randomly selected firm with
probability λe ∈ (0, 1). Since the meeting process is random, a worker may meet a firm
employing no workers, a firm employing one worker, or a firm employing a team of two
workers. Similarly, a firm may meet a worker who is unemployed, a worker who is em-
ployed by himself, or a worker who is part of a team. Upon meeting, the firm and the
worker match if and only if the gains from trade are positive. If the firm and the worker
match, the worker becomes an employee of the firm. A fraction γ of the gains from trade
is then captured by the worker and a fraction 1−γ is captured by the firm, with γ ∈ [0, 1].
   The gains from trade are defined as the difference between the joint value of the match
and the outside options of the firm and the worker. The joint value of the match is given
by the sum of the values to the worker, the firm and its current employees when the worker
joins their production unit. The outside option of the firm is given by the sum of the
value to the firm and its current employees from not having the worker in their production
unit. If the worker is unemployed, his outside option is the value of unemployment. If the
worker is already employed, his outside option is given by the difference between the joint

                                            7
value to the worker, his current employer and his current coworkers from being all in the
same production unit and the joint value to the employer and the coworkers from being
without the worker. Note that our definition of gains from trade includes the values to
all the parties attached to the production units affected by the trade: not only the firm
and the worker, but also the firm’s current employees and the worker’s current employer
and coworkers.
   We assume that the wage of a worker remains constant unless it is such that the
worker’s value from staying with the firm is lower than the worker’s outside option—i.e.,
either the value of unemployment or, if the worker has contacted a poaching firm, the net
value of the worker to the poaching firm and its employees—or such that the worker’s
value from staying with the firm exceeds the net value of the worker to the firm and its
other employees. In the first case, the wage is raised to the point where the worker’s value
equals his outside option. In the second case, the wage is lowered to the point where
the worker’s value equals his net value to the firm and its other employees. The first
constraint on the wage guarantees that the worker has a private incentive to remain with
the firm whenever he is more valuable inside than outside the firm. The second constraint
on the wage guarantees that the worker has a private incentive to report to the firm being
contacted by a poaching firm whenever he is more valuable to the poaching firm than to
his current one. Taken together, the constraints on the wage guarantee that the worker’s
behavior is incentive compatible.
   At the dismissal stage, a firm and a worker who are currently matched may voluntarily
separate. The firm and the worker separate if and only if the gains from trade are negative.
That is, the firm and the worker separate if and only if the joint value to the worker, the
firm and the other employee from being in the same production unit is smaller than the
sum between the value to the worker from being unemployed and the value to the firm
and the other employee from producing without the worker.
   At the production stage, matched firms and workers generate output according to the
production function f (k, `), workers receive part of the output as wages, and firms receive
the remaining output as profits. Unemployed workers generate output according to the
home-production function b(k).
   Our model is a version of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002, henceforth PR) and Cahuc,
Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006, henceforth CPR) in which the productivity and the human
capital accumulation of an individual depend on the quality of his coworkers. As in PR
and CPR, workers contact randomly selected firms both while unemployed and while
employed. As in PR and CPR, workers move to a contacted firm if and only if the gains
from trade are positive, where the gains from trade are defined by taking into account

                                             8
the values of all of the parties affected by the trade. In order to capture the idea that
workers learn from their coworkers, our model must depart from PR and CPR by having
a well-defined notion of a firm. We obtain a notion of the firm by specifying a production
function with decreasing returns to labor. We introduce decreasing returns to scale by
assuming that the firm can hire at most two workers. We make this extreme assumption
to keep the number of arguments in the state of the firm manageable (i.e. the human
capital of the two workers). Another difference between our model and PR and CPR
is that, in our model, all firms are ex-ante identical. Yet, the randomness of the search
process together with the decreasing returns to scale in labor are enough to create ex-post
heterogeneity in the value of a particular worker to different firms and, hence, to create a
proper job ladder.
   Our model is a version of Anderson (2015) and Anderson and Smith (2010, henceforth
AS) with search frictions. As in AS, workers produce in teams of two and the output
depends in a general fashion on their human capital. If the production function is super-
modular in the workers’ human capital, production pushes towards positive assortative
matching (PAM) of coworkers. If the production function is submodular, production
pushes towards negative assortative matching (NAM). As in AS, the evolution of the
worker’s human capital depends on the human capital of their coworkers. If the learning
process is such that the coworker with the lower human capital catches up to the one
with more human capital, learning pushes for NAM. If the learning process is such that
the coworker with the higher human capital is dragged down by the one with less human
capital, learning pushes for PAM. The main difference between our model and AS is that,
in our model, workers come to form teams through a frictional search process rather than
by frictionless assignment.


2.2      Definition of Equilibrium
In order to define an equilibrium, we need to introduce some notation to describe the
value functions and the distribution of workers and firms across employment states. We
denote as Uk the value of a worker of type k who is unemployed. We denote as V0,0 the
value of a firm who employs no workers at the production stage. We denote as Vk,0 the
sum of the values to a firm and to a worker of type k from being in the same production
unit (without anybody else). We denote as Vk,` the sum of the values to a firm, a worker
of type k and a worker of type ` from being in the same production unit. The value
functions U and V are measured at the beginning of the production stage. We also find it
useful to denote as V̂ the joint value of production units at the beginning of the dismissal
stage.

                                             9
    Next, we introduce the notation for the stationary distributions of workers and firms.
Let uk denote the measure of unemployed workers of type k, let ek,0 denote the measure
of workers of type k who are employed without a coworker, and ek,` denote the measure
of workers of type k who are employed with a coworker of type `. The distribution of
workers implies a distribution of firms. Let n0 , n1 and n2 denote the measure of firms
                                      P             P
with 0, 1 or 2 employees. Then, n1 = k ek,0 , n2 = k,` ek,` /2 and n0 = 1 − n1 − n2 . The
measures u, e and n are computed at the beginning of the search-and-matching stage.
    We are now in the position to formulate the Bellman Equations satisfied by the value
functions U and V . The value V0,0 of a firm without employees is such that
                      nhP                                                     i         o
         V0,0 = 0 + β     i,x q(i, x)(1 − γ) max{V̂ i,0 − V̂ 0,0 − v(i, x), 0}  + V̂0,0   .                 (1)

In the current period, the profit of the firm is f (0, 0) = 0. In the next period, the
firm contacts a worker of type i in employment state x with probability q(i, x). The
probability q(i, u) is λu ui , the probability q(i, 0) is λe ei,0 , and the probability q(i, j) is
λe ei,j . Conditional on meeting a worker of type i in state x, the firm continuation value
is given by V̂0,0 plus a fraction 1 − γ of the gains from trade V̂i,0 − V̂0,0 − v(i, x), where V̂i,0
is the joint value of the match to the firm and to the worker, V̂0,0 is the outside option of
the firm, and v(i, x) is the outside option of the worker. The outside option of the worker
depends on his employment status x. If x = u, the outside option of the worker is Ui . If
x = 0, the outside option of the worker is V̂i,0 − V̂0,0 . If x = j, the outside option of the
worker is V̂i,j − V̂j,0 .
    The joint value Vk,0 of a production unit consisting of a firm and a worker of type k is
such that
                           n
    Vk,0   = f (k, 0) + βE  σ[V̂0,0 − V̂k+ ,0 ] + δ[V̂0,0 + Uk+ − V̂k+ ,0 ]

                           +     i,x q(i, x) (1 − γ) max{V̂k+ ,i − V̂k+ ,0 − v(i, x), 0}                    (2)
                             hP                                                             i           o

In the current period, the sum of the income to the worker and the profit to the firm is
f (k, 0). In the next period, the worker’s human capital type is k+ , where the probability
distribution over k+ is given by the probability distribution function g. The worker
exits the labor market with probability σ. In this case, the continuation value to the
firm is V̂0,0 and the continuation value to the worker is zero. The worker moves into
unemployment with probability δ. In this case, the continuation value to the firm is V̂0,0
and the continuation value to the worker is Uk+ .
    The firm contacts a worker of type i in employment state x with probability q(i, x). In

                                                       10
this case, the joint continuation payoff to the firm and to the existing worker is V̂k+ ,0 plus
a fraction 1 − γ of the gains from trade between the firm and the contacted worker, which
are given by V̂k+ ,i − V̂k+ ,0 − v(i, x). The worker contacts a poaching firm in employment
state y ∈ Y with probability λe p(y), where p(0, 0) = n0 , p(i, 0) = ei,0 , and p(i, j) = ei,j /2.
Conditional on meeting a poaching firm in state y, the continuation payoff to the worker
and its current employer is V̂k+ ,0 plus a fraction γ of the gains from trade between the
worker and the poaching firm v(k+ , y) − (V̂k+,0 − V0,0 ), where v(k+ , y) denotes the joint
value of the match between the worker and the poaching firm net of the outside option
of the poaching firm, and V̂k+,0 − V̂0,0 is the outside option of the worker. If y = (0, 0),
v(k+ , y) is V̂k+ ,0 − V̂0,0 . If y = (i, 0), v(k+ , y) is V̂k+ ,i − V̂i,0 . If y = (i, j), v(k+ , y) is the
maximum between V̂k+ ,i + Uj − V̂i,j and V̂k+ ,j + Ui − V̂i,j , as the poaching firm needs to
break-up with one of its current employees to make room for the new hire.2
       The joint value Vk,` of a production unit consisting of a firm, a worker of type k and
a worker of type ` is such that

         Vk,` = f (k, `) + βE {                   h                                                i

         +     i,z q(i, z) (1 − γ) max max{V̂k+ ,i + U`+ , V̂`+ ,i + Uk+ } − V̂k+ ,`+ − v(i, z), 0

         +       λ
               y e  p(y)γ   max     v(k + , y)  − ( V̂k+ ,`+  − V̂ `+ ,0 ), 0
           hP                     n                                           oi           o
         +     y eλ p(y)γ   max     v(` + , y)  − ( V̂ k+ ,`+ − V̂ k+ ,0 ), 0    + V̂k+ ,`+ .

                                                                                                          (3)
For the sake of brevity, we will only discuss the differences between expressions (3) and
(2). First, both the worker of type k and the worker of type ` face a probability of exiting
the labor market or moving into unemployment. Second, both the worker of type k and
the worker of type ` meet poaching firms in state y with probability λe p(y) and capture a
fraction γ of the gains from trade in those meetings. Third, when the firm meets a worker
of type i in employment state z, it captures a fraction 1 − γ of the gains from trade, in
which the joint value to the worker, the firm and its employees from being in the same
production unit is the maximum between V̂k+ ,i + U`+ and V̂`+ ,i + Uk+ , as the firm chooses
which employee to dismiss in order to make room for the new hire.
       At the dismissal stage, V̂0,0 = V0,0 as the firm has no employees to dismiss. The joint

    As the reader can infer from the formulation of (2), we assume that the events at the search-and-
matching stage are mutually exclusive at the level of a production unit. That is, either the worker
moves into unemployment, or the worker meets a poaching firm, or the firm meets another worker. The
assumption would be without loss in generality in a continuous-time version of the model.




                                                     11
value V̂k,0 of a production unit consisting of a firm and a worker of type k is such that

                                   V̂k,0 = max {Vk,0 , V0,0 + Uk } .                      (4)

Similarly, the joint value V̂k,` of a production unit consisting of a firm, a worker of type k
and a worker of type ` is such that
                                       n                              o
                          V̂k,`   = max Vk,` , V̂k,0 + U` , V̂`,0 + Uk .                  (5)

The above expressions are easy to understand. The joint value of the production unit at
the dismissal stage is the maximum between the joint value to the members of the unit
from staying together and the joint from breaking up.
   Finally, the value of unemployment Uk to a worker of type k is given by
                     n               hP                                         io
  Uk = b(k) + βEk+ Uk+ + σ 0 − Uk+ +        y λu p(y)γ max   v(k + , y) − Uk + , 0    .   (6)

In the current period, the income of the worker is b(k). In the next period, the worker
exits the labor market with probability σ. In this case, the worker’s continuation value
is zero. The worker contacts a firm in state y with probability λu p(y). In this case, the
worker’s continuation value is Uk+ plus a fraction γ of the gains from trade v(k+ , y) − Uk+ .
   The value functions above pin down the probability with which a worker transits across
human capital and employment states. These transition probabilities are cumbersome to
write, but follow immediately from the value functions. Therefore, we relegate them in
Appendix A and here we only describe the transitions for a worker of type k who is in
employment status x = `. At the search-and-matching stage, the worker is forced to move
into unemployment for exogenous reasons with probability δ. With probability λe p(y),
the worker contacts a poaching firm in state y and, depending on whether the gains from
trade are positive or negative, he may move to the poaching firm or remain with his
current employer. With probability λe p(y), the worker’s teammate contacts a poaching
firm and, depending on the sign of gains from trade, the worker may become employed
by himself or keep his teammate. With probability q(i, x), the firm contacts a worker of
type i in employment status x and, depending on the sign of the gains from trade, the
worker of type k may move into unemployment, be paired with a new coworker of type
i, or remain with the old coworker of type `. At the dismissal stage, the worker may
move into unemployment or remain employed. At the learning stage, the worker’s type
evolves from k to k+ according to the probability distribution function g(k+ |k, x). At
the entry-and-exit stage, the worker exits the labor market for exogenous reasons with
probability σ. Otherwise, the worker reaches the next search-and-matching stage.


                                                  12
   We are now in the position to define an equilibrium for our model.
Definition: A Stationary Equilibrium is a list of value functions {U, V } and a distri-
bution of workers across employment states {u, e} such that: (i) The value functions
satisfy conditions (1)-(6) given {u, e}; (ii) The distribution {u, e} is stationary given the
transitions probabilities implied by the value functions.
   Note that, just as in PR and CPR, the equilibrium of our model is defined without
making any reference to wages. There is a simple intuition behind this property of equi-
librium. First, the hiring decisions are determined by the gains from trade, which are
defined as the joint value to the worker, the poaching firm and its employees from hiring
the worker minus the joint value to the worker, his current employer and his coworkers
from retaining the worker. Second, the joint values are independent of wages because
wages transfer utility at the rate of 1 for 1 from the firm to the worker. Thus, all gains
from trade and all hiring decisions are independent of wages, and so is the stationary
distribution of workers and firms. Yet, we do care about wages, as they play a key role
in our calibration of the model. We refer the reader to Appendix B for the equilibrium
conditions for wages.


2.3    Illustration of Equilibrium
In order to familiarize our reader with the mechanics of the model, we believe it is helpful
to illustrate a sample path for the history of a firm and a sample path for the history of
a worker. Figure 1(a) presents a sample path for the history of a firm. At the beginning
of the path, the firm is idle (i.e., state y = (0, 0)). In period t1 , the firm meets an
unemployed worker of type 1. Since the net value of the worker to the firm is greater than
the value of unemployment, the firm hires the worker and moves to the state y = (1, 0).
In period t2 , the firm meets an unemployed worker of type 2. As the gains from trade are
positive, the firm hires the worker and moves to the state y = (1, 2). In period t3 , the firm
meets an unemployed worker of type 4. The firm finds it optimal to hire the worker as a
replacement for its employee of type 1 and moves to state y = (4, 2). In period t5 , the firm
meets another unemployed worker of type 4. The firm finds it optimal to hire the worker
as a replacement for its employee of type 2 and moves to state y = (4, 4). In period t5 ,
one of the employees of the firm contacts a poacher in state (7, 0). The employee finds
it optimal to leave the firm, which moves to state y = (0, 4). In period t6 , the remaining
employee of the firm moves into unemployment for exogenous reasons. The firm is back
to state y = (0, 0).
   The sample path in Figure 1(a) illustrates several important features of equilibrium.
First, it takes time for a firm to build a team of workers, as it takes time to find each team

                                             13

member. Second, the firm may replace current employees with new hires. Replacement
hiring is a natural consequence of the assumption that the firm keeps contacting workers
even when it has formed a team and of the assumption that the firm faces decreasing
returns to labor. Replacement hiring leads to a process of upgrading of the firm’s workforce
that is analogue to the process of climbing the job ladder for workers. Replacement hiring
also causes endogenous transitions of workers into unemployment. Third, Figure 1 shows
that the firm may lose employees for a variety of reasons. In fact, employees may leave to
move to a poaching firm, they may leave to unemployment, and they may exit the labor
market.
   Figure 1(b) presents a sample path of the history of a worker. At the beginning of
the path, the worker has the second lowest level of human capital (i.e. k = 2) and is
unemployed (i.e., x = u). In period t1 , the worker meets a firm with one employee of
type 6 (i.e. y = (6, 0)). Since the net value of the worker to the firm is greater than the
value of unemployment, the worker is hired by the firm. The worker captures a fraction
γ of the gains from trade, which implies a wage of w = 5.2. In period t2 , the worker
meets a poaching firm with one employee of type 4 (i.e. y = (4, 0)). Since the net value
of the worker to the poaching firm is smaller than to his current employer, the worker
does not move. However, since the net value of the worker to the poaching firm exceeds
the value currently earned by the worker, the worker’s wage is raised to w = 6.3. In
period t3 , the worker meets a poaching firm with one employee of type 7 (i.e. y = (7, 0)).
Since the net value of the worker to the poaching firm is greater than the net value to
his current employer, the worker moves and his wage becomes w = 7.5. In period t4 , the
worker moves up the human capital ladder. However, his wage does not change because


                                            14
his outside option (i.e. the value of unemployment) does not bind. In period t5 , the
firm meets an unemployed of type 4. The firm finds it optimal to hire the unemployed
as a replacement to the worker who, then, becomes unemployed. Finally, in period t6 ,
the worker meets a firm with one employee of type 6. The worker is hired at the wage
w = 5.5.
    The sample path in Figure 1(b) illustrates several important features of equilibrium
wages. In period t2 , we see that the wage of a worker during his tenure with a firm
increases when the worker meets a poacher and the value of the worker to the poacher is
lower than the value to the incumbent, but higher than the worker’s value of remaining
with the incumbent at the previous wage. In period t3 , we see that the wage of a worker
during a particular employment spell may increase when the worker moves from one firm
to another firm. In general, whether the worker’s wage goes up or down upon moving
from one firm to another firm depends on the gains from trade and on the worker’s old
wage. In period t4 , we see that the wage of a worker does not immediately reflect changes
in his human capital. In fact, the wage of a worker only reflects his human capital at
the time he was hired or at the time he last receives a sufficiently attractive outside offer
from a poacher. In period t6 , we see that the wage of a worker does eventually reflect
changes in his human capital. In fact, in period t2 , the worker has human capital h2 and
he moved from unemployment into a firm at the wage w = 5.2. In period t6 , the worker
has human capital h3 and he moved from unemployment into the same type of firm at
the wage w = 5.5.


3     Data and Measurement
In this section, we calibrate the model to the US labor market. To this aim, our main
source of information is a matched employer-employee dataset, which contains information
about US workers and firms. The purpose of the calibration is to measure the learning and
the production functions, objects about which we have little prior knowledge. In Section
3.1, we introduce assumptions on functional forms and review all the parameters of the
model that need to be calibrated. In Section 3.2, we describe the empirical moments used
to calibrate the parameters. In Section 3.3, we report the values of the calibrated param-
eters, interpret their meaning, and illustrate the properties of the Stationary Equilibrium.
In Section 3.4, we use the calibrated model to carry out two counterfactual exercises. In
the first exercise, we shut down the effect of coworkers on an individual’s human capi-
tal accumulation. The purpose of this exercise is to quantify the role of learning from
coworkers in the formation of human capital, in the production output and in shaping


                                             15
the pattern of sorting of workers across firms. In the second exercise, we examine how
the economy would look like if the production function was modular. The purpose of this
exercise is to assess the role of production complementarities between high human capi-
tal workers in the pattern of sorting of workers and, in turn, in the formation of human
capital and in the production of output.


3.1     Parameters
We set the length of a period in the model to be one month. The human capital of
a worker is an hk from the set H = {h1 , h2 , ...hN } where h1 = 1, hk+1 = hk + ∆ for
k = 1, 2, ..N − 1, ∆ > 0 and N = 7. The human capital accumulation process is described
by the function g(k+ |k, x). We assume that g(k+ |k, u) takes the form

                           g(k − 1|k, u) = αu if k > 1, 0 else;
                                                                                         (7)
                               g(k|k, u) = 1 − g(k − 1|k, u).

That is, an unemployed worker moves down the human capital ladder by one step with
probability αu ≥ 0, and otherwise maintains his stock of human capital. The specification
of g in (7) captures the standard view that human capital depreciates during unemploy-
ment.
   We assume that g(k+ |k, 0) takes the form

                           g(k + 1|k, 0) = α0 if k < N , 0 else;
                                                                                         (8)
                               g(k|k, 0) = 1 − g(k + 1|k, 0).

That is, a worker employed on his own moves up the human capital ladder by one step with
probability α0 ≥ 0, and otherwise maintains his stock of human capital. The specification
of g in (8) captures the standard view that workers accumulate human capital by doing.
   We assume that g(k+ |k, `) takes the form
                   (
                      α0 + α1+ max{h` − hk , 0} − α1− max{hk − h` , 0} if k < N,
   g(k + 1|k, `) =
                      0 else;                                                            (9)
       g(k|k, `) = 1 − g(k + 1|k, `).

That is, a worker employed in a team moves up the human capital ladder with a probability
that depends on the human capital of his coworker relative to his own human capital.
Specifically, the probability that the worker moves up the human capital ladder is α0 if
the coworker has the same human capital as the worker. The probability is α0 +α1+ (h` −hk ),
with α1+ ≥ 0, if the coworker has more human capital than the worker. The probability
is α0 − α1− (hk − h` ), with α1− ≥ 0, if the coworker has less human capital than the worker.
The parameter α0 captures again the effect of learning by doing. The parameter α1+


                                             16
captures the idea that a worker might learn more quickly by being in the company of a
more knowledgeable coworker. The parameter α1− captures the idea that a worker might
be hindered by being in the company of a less knowledgeable coworker. As long as the
parameters α1+ and α1− are different, the effect of coworkers on learning is globally non-
linear, which implies that the aggregate amount of learning depends on the composition
of teams in the economy. We restrict α1+ and α1− to be non-negative based on the prior
that a coworker with more human capital can be no worse company than a coworker with
less human capital.3
      The production process is described by the functions b(k) and f (k, `). We assume
that the production function for unemployed workers, i.e. the home-production function,
has the form bhk . That is, we assume that home-production is proportional to human
capital. We assume that the production function for workers employed on their own to
be f (k, 0) = hk . That is, we assume that the output of a worker employed on his own is
equal to his human capital. We assume that the production function for teams of workers
                              1/ρ     1/ρ
is f (k, `) = hk + h` + (hk + h` )ρ . That is, we assume that the output of a team of two
workers is equal to the output of each individual worker plus a term that, depending on
the value of ρ, may be sub or super-modular in the human capital of the two workers.
Note that the output of a firm with two workers always exceeds the output of two firms
each employing one of the two workers.
      The search-and-bargaining process is described by the parameters λu , λe , δ and γ,
where λu is the probability that an unemployed worker meets a firm, λe is the probability
that an employed worker meets a firm, δ is the probability that an employed worker moves
into unemployment for exogenous reasons, and γ is the worker’s bargaining power.
      Finally, the entry-and-exit process is described by the parameter σ and by the prob-
ability distribution πk . The parameter σ is the probability that a worker exits the labor
market. The probability distribution πk describes the human capital of a worker who
enters the labor market. We specialize πk to be a discretized exponential distribution
with shape coefficient χ. We assume that workers enter the labor market at age 21.


3.2       Data
Compared to a canonical model in the vein of PR and CPR, ours has some additional
parameters that need to be measured. Specifically, we need to measure the parameters α1+
and α1− , which capture the effect of the human capital of coworkers on the accumulation
of human capital of an individual, and the parameter ρ, which captures the production
  3
      The parameters α1+ and α1− are also restricted to guarantee g(k+ |k, `) ∈ [0, 1].

complementarity between the human capital of coworkers and the human capital of an
individual. To measure these parameters, we adopt a structural approach. That is,
instead of looking for a “natural experiment” that might allow us to directly measure the
parameters, we make use of the full equilibrium structure of the model to measure the
parameters from the raw data. For instance, the problem with measuring α1+ and α1− is
that the sorting of workers across firms is not random. Hence, observing an individual
with highly-paid coworkers confounds information about the treatment received by the
individual and the individual’s unobserved stock of human capital. In the face of this
confounding effect, one could measure α1+ and α1− by looking for a natural experiment in
which sorting is random. This is the approach typically used in the literature on peer
effects in the classroom (see, e.g., Hoxby 2000). We do not follow this approach. Instead,
we make use of the fact that the model provides us with a theory of sorting, and use the
theory to infer α1+ and α1− from the raw data.
   Let us explain in detail our approach to measuring α1+ and α1− . We use the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database between 2001 and 2008. The LEHD is a
matched employer-employee dataset that covers 95% of jobs in the U.S. private sector. The
LEHD includes identifiers for workers, identifiers for firms, demographic characteristics
of workers, characteristics of firms, the identity of workers employed by firms and their
earnings. We have access to the LEHD between the years 2001 and 2008 for 11 states:
California, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas,
Virginia, and Washington. Even though we only use a 10% random sample of the data, for
each worker in the sample we have summary statistics for the earnings of all his coworkers.
   Using the 10% random sample of the LEHD, we construct a dataset in which the
basic unit of observation is an EUE transition, i.e. a transition of an individual i from
employment at a firm j into unemployment and then back into employment at a different
firm. We refer to this as the EUE dataset. We restrict attention to EUE transitions that
meet the following criteria: (i) individual i is a male between the ages of 24 and 65; (ii)
firm j is a single-unit firm with a number of employees between 2 and 250; (iii) in year t,
individual i was employed at the firm j for the whole year; in year t + 1, individual i was
unemployed for at least one quarter (i.e., he had at least one quarter with less than $1k
of earnings); in year t + 2, individual i was employed for the whole year at a firm different
from j. For each EUE transition that meets these criteria, we record the log annual
earnings wi,t of individual i at firm j in year t, the log annual earnings wi,t+2 of individual
i in year t + 2, and the log of the average annual earnings w−i,j,t of the coworkers of
individual i at firm j in year t. We also record the demographic characteristics of worker
i and the characteristics of firm j. With a slight abuse of language we shall refer to w’s

as wages. Table 1.D in Appendix D contains summary statistics for the EUE dataset.
   We decompose the EUE dataset into observations where the wage of individual i at
firm j in year t is lower than the average wage of his coworkers, and into observations
where it is higher. Separately for the two subsets of the EUE dataset, we run the following
OLS regression
                      wi,t+2 = φ0 + φ1 wi,t + φ2 w−i,j,t + ΦXi,j,t + i,t .             (10)

where Xi,j,t includes dummies for calendar years, dummies for States, dummies for the
1-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code of firm j, firm j size, dummies for the
race and education of worker i, quadratic terms for worker i’s age and tenure. Moreover,
Xi,j,t includes a dummy for the type of firm j, which is constructed by clustering of all
firms into 10 groups based on the mean and the standard deviation of the firms’ wages.
   The main coefficient of interest is φ2 , which measures the relationship between the
wage of the coworkers of individual i in the current job and the wage that individual i
earns in the next job (after going through an unemployment spell). While the estimates
of φ2 do not recover structural parameters of the model, they are related to α1+ and α1− .
In fact, the wage of the coworkers of individual i is a (noisy) measure of the human capital
of the coworkers to whom i has been exposed, and the wage of individual i in the next job
is a (noisy) measure of his human capital after being exposed to those coworkers. We run
the regression separately for individuals whose wage is lower and higher than the wage
of their coworkers, as we suspect that the human capital of the coworkers might affect
the accumulation of human capital of an individual differently depending on whether the
coworkers are better or worse than the individual. We look at the individual’s wage in
the next job because in our model—as in all models with search frictions—the wage in
the current job does not necessarily reflect changes in the individual’s human capital.
We look at individuals who pass through unemployment because we want to eliminate
heterogeneity in outside options. Having eliminated heterogeneity in outside options, the
individual’s distribution of wages in the next job depends exclusively on the human capital
of the worker at the time he is hired. We add the firm’s type in the controls Xi,j,t to purge
the estimate of φ2 from firm-specific effects.
   Table 1 reports the result of the OLS regression (10). Columns (1) and (3) report
the results of the regressions for observations in which individual i’s wage in year t is,
respectively, lower and higher than the average wage of his coworkers. Columns (2) and
(4) report the results of the same regressions when we add the controls Xi,j,t and two lags
of the wage of individual i. From columns (1) and (3), we can see that estimate of φ2
is 0.153 when the individual’s wage is lower than the average wage of his coworkers, and
it is much lower—specifically, equal to 0.02—when the individual’s wage is higher than

the average wage of his coworkers. These estimates imply that, for an individual paid
less than his coworkers, a 10% increase in the coworkers’ wage forecasts a 1.53% higher
wage for the individual in the next job. For an individual paid more than his coworkers,
a 10% increase in the coworkers’ wage forecasts a 0.2% higher wage for the individual in
the next job. From columns (2) and (4), we see that the estimates of φ2 do not change
much if we add the controls Xi,j,t and lagged wages.
     As mentioned above, the estimates of φ2 do not recover the structural parameters
α1+ and α1− . This is easy to understand. Since workers are not allocated to different
firms at random, there will be a systematic relationship between the human capital of an
individual and the human capital of his coworkers. If sorting is positive, the human capital
of an individual will be positively correlated with the human capital of his coworkers. If
sorting is negative, the human capital of an individual will be negatively correlated with
the human capital of his coworkers. In either case, the wage of the individual and the
wage of his coworkers are both (imperfectly) correlated with the individual’s unobserved
stock of human capital and, hence, they will both help forecast the individual’s wage in
the next job. In order to tease out α1+ and α1− from the estimates of φ2 , it is then critical
to calibrate the production function so that the model matches well the pattern of sorting
in the data.
     We measure the sorting of workers by breaking down the cross-sectional dispersion of
wages into the variance of the average wage paid by different firms (between-firm wage
variance) and the average variance of wages paid by the same firm to different workers
(within-firm wage variance). This decomposition of wage dispersion is a good summary
statistic for the sorting of workers across firms. In fact, if firms typically employ workers

                                                                       20
with similar human capital, the wages paid by a firm to its employees will tend to be
similar and, hence, the within-firm variance of wages will be low relative to the between-
firm variance. If, in contrast, firms typically employ workers with different human capital,
the wages paid by a firm to its employees will tend to be different and, hence, the within-
firm variance of wages will be high relative to the between-firm variance. Using the
LEHD, Spletzer (2017) finds that both between and within-firm variance account for
approximately half of the overall cross-sectional dispersion in wages. We calibrate the
parameter ρ—which controls the degree of supermodularity of the production function—
so that the model matches the fraction of within-firm wage variance.
   The parameters α1+ , α1− and ρ determine the value of an individual with a given stock
of human capital in different types of firms and, in turn, the rate at which that individual
leaves different types of firms (i.e., firms with different types of employees). For example, if
workers do not learn from each other (i.e. α1+ and α1− are close to zero) and the production
function is strongly supermodular (i.e. ρ is high), the value of an individual with high
human capital is higher in a firm that employs other high human capital workers than in
a firm that employs low human capital workers. Thus, the individual will be less likely
to leave a firm employing high rather than low human capital workers. In contrast, if
workers learn a lot from each other (i.e. α1+ is positive and large and α1− is close to zero)
and the production function is modular (i.e. ρ = 1), the value of an individual with high
human capital is higher in a firm that employs low human capital workers than in a firm
that employs high human capital workers. Thus, the individual will be less likely to leave
a firm employing low rather than high human capital workers.
   Motivated by the above observations, we construct a second dataset using the LEHD.
In this dataset, the basic unit of observation is an individual i and a year t. We refer
to this as the EE dataset. We restrict attention to observations that meet the following
criteria: (i) individual i is a male between the ages of 24 and 65; (ii) individual i was
employed at the same firm j for the entire duration of year t; (iii) firm j is a single-unit
firm with a number of employees between 2 and 250. For each observation that meets
these criteria, we record the log annual earnings wi,t of individual i at firm j in year
t, the log of the average annual earnings w−i,j,t of individual i’s coworkers at firm j in
year t, and an indicator function EEi,t+1 which takes the value 1 if and only if, in year
t + 1, the individual moves from firm j to a different firm without an intervening spell of
unemployment. Table 2.D in Appendix D contains some summary statistics for the EE
dataset.
   Again, we decompose the EE dataset into observations where the wage of individual i
is lower than the average wage of his coworkers, and into observations where it is higher.

Separately for the two subsets, we run the following OLS regression

                                  EEi,t+1 = ψ0 + ψ1 |wi,t − w−i,j,t | + ΨXi,j,t + i,t .                                                  (11)

Table 2 reports the result of the regression. Columns (1) and (3) report the results of
the regressions for observations in which the individual’s wage is, respectively, lower and
higher than the wage of his coworkers. The main coefficient of interest is ψ1 . The estimate
of ψ1 is −.012 when the individual’s wage is lower than the wage of his coworkers. The
estimate of ψ1 is not statistically different from zero when the individual’s wage is higher
than the wage of his coworkers. These estimates imply that, for individuals paid less than
their coworkers, a 10% increase in the wage of the coworkers forecasts a 0.12 percentage
point decline in the probability that the individual goes through an EE transition next
year. In contrast, for individuals paid more than their coworkers, an increase in the wage
of the coworkers does not forecast any change in the probability that the individual goes
through an EE transition next year. In columns (2) and (4), we see that adding the
controls Xi,j,t and two lags of the wage of worker i does not change much the estimates
of ψ1 .
     We now turn to the calibration of the other parameters describing the accumulation
of human capital of an individual. The parameter α0 denotes the probability that an
individual moves up the human capital ladder when employed with someone who has the
same knowledge as he does. We calibrate α0 by targeting a measure of life-cycle wage
growth. In particular, we target the ratio between the average wage of male workers
aged 54 to the average wage of male workers aged 24. In the pooled 2000-2016 Current


                                                                       22
Population Survey (CPS), the ratio is about 1.9. The parameter αu denotes the probability
that an individual moves down the human capital ladder when unemployed. We calibrate
αu by targeting the correlation between the duration of the unemployment spell of an
individual and the wage that the individual earns once he re-enters employment. In the
pooled 2000-2016 CPS, the correlation is about −7%.
   The calibration of the parameters describing the search-and-bargaining process is stan-
dard. The parameter δ denotes the probability with which an employed worker moves
into unemployment for exogenous reasons. We calibrate δ so that the model matches the
average EU rate in the 2000-2016 CPS (1.1% per month). The parameter λu denotes the
probability with which an unemployed worker contacts a firm. We calibrate λu so that
the model matches the average UE rate in the CPS (22% per month). The parameter λe
denotes the probability with which an employed worker contacts a firm. We calibrate λe
to match the average EE rate in the CPS (1.7% per month). The parameter γ denotes
the fraction of the gains from trade accruing to the worker. We calibrate γ by targeting
a measure of wage loss after an unemployment spell. To this aim, we isolate all workers
who are employed in month 4 of the 2000-2016 CPS, unemployed in months 13, 14 or
15 and employed in month 16. For these workers, we compute the ratio of their wage
in month 16 relative to their wage in month 4. We find that the average wage ratio is
approximately 90%.
   We calibrate the parameters describing the structure of the human capital ladder and
the process of entry and exit of workers into the labor market as follows. We normalize
the lowest level of human capital, h1 , to be equal to 1 and choose the highest level of
human capital, hN , by targeting a measure of the cross-sectional variance of wages. In
particular, we target the ratio between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile of wages
in the 2000-2016 CPS (4.57). We calibrate the shape parameter, χ, of the exponential
distribution for the human capital of workers entering the labor market by targeting the
ratio between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile of wages for workers aged 22 to
24 in the 2000-2016 CPS (2.88). We calibrate the exit rate of workers, σ, so that a worker
spends, on average, 35 years in the labor market.
   We want to make sure that we also match some properties of the dynamics of wages for
individual workers. To this aim, we include two targets about individual wage dynamics.
Using the CPS, we isolate workers who are employed in month t and in month t + 12.
First, we target the average wage growth between months t and t + 12 for these workers,
which we find to be equal to 2%. We also target the variance of the change in the wage
between months t and t + 12 for these workers, which we find to be equal to 0.43.
   Finally, we need to choose a value for the discount factor β. We choose the value of

                                            23
β to be 0.988, which implies a discount factor of 15% per year. It is well-known that
models in the style of PR and CPR generate some negative wages when β is set to a
more standard value of 5% per year and when workers have linear utility in income (and,
hence, an infinite elasticity of intertemporal substitution). Intuitively, when β is high
and workers have linear utility, wages out of unemployment are sometimes negative—as
workers expect large raises when they receive an outside offer and do not need to be
compensated for these large changes in income. We do not want to introduce curvature
in the worker’s utility function, as we would not be able to characterize the equilibrium
by simply computing the joint value of different production units. Instead, to avoid the
problem of negative wages, we choose to set the discount factor β to 15% per year.


3.3    Measurement and Properties of Equilibrium
Table 3 reports the calibrated value of the parameters, the empirical moments used to
calibrate them and the fit of the calibrated model to these empirical moments. The
calibrated value of the parameter ρ is 2.35. Since ρ > 1, the calibrated production
function is supermodular and, as explained before, it pushes the equilibrium pattern of
sorting towards PAM. To better gage the meaning of ρ = 2.35, note that it implies that
the sum of the output generated by one production unit with workers (k, `) = (7, 7)
and another production unit with workers (k 0 , `0 ) = (1, 1) is 5% higher than the output
generated by two production units with workers (k 0 , `) = (`0 , k) = (1, 7). The value of ρ
is the one required by the model to guarantee that half of the variance of wages is due to
dispersion in the average wage of different firms and half is due to dispersion in the wage
paid by the same firm to different employees.
   The calibrated values of the parameters α0 , α1+ and α1− are, respectively, 0.003, 0.018
and 0.0002. The calibrated value for α0 (together with the calibrated value of a step in
the human capital ladder) implies that the expected growth rate of human capital for a
worker of type k = 4 employed with a coworker of the same type is approximately 0.66%
per year. The value of α0 is the one required by the model to match the lifecycle wage
growth. The calibrated value for α1+ implies that the expected growth rate of human
capital for a worker of type k = 4 employed with a coworker of type ` = 5 (which has
15% more human capital) is approximately 1.61% per year. Similarly, the calibrated
value for α1− implies that the expected growth rate of human capital for a worker of type
k = 4 employed with a coworker of type ` = 3 (which has 15% less human capital)
is approximately 0.65% per year. As expected, the calibrated values of α1+ and α1− are
different from the regression coefficients in Table 1 even though the model matches these
coefficients well. Since α1+ is positive and α1− is basically zero, workers tend to catch up

with more knowledgeable coworkers, but are not dragged down by less knowledgeable
ones. As explained in Anderson (2015), this feature of the learning function pushes the
equilibrium pattern of sorting towards NAM.
       The calibrated values of the search parameters λu , λe and δ are, respectively, 0.32,
0.29 and 0.005. Given these values, the model does a pretty good job in matching the
empirical UE, EU and EE rates.The calibrated bargaining power of the worker, γ, is 0.65.
Given this value, the model generates a 70% ratio (compared to 90% in the data) between
the wage before and after an unemployment spell.4
       Given the calibrated parameter values, we now examine the equilibrium policy func-
tions. Figure 2 shows whether a worker of type k (vertical axis) in employment status
x (horizontal axis) is hired by a firm in state y and, in case the firm has two employees,
which one the worker is replacing. Consider a worker with the lowest human (i.e. k = 1)
who is unemployed (i.e. x = u). The policy functions for this worker are shown in the
top-left quadrant of Figure 2. The worker is hired by firms in state (0, 0) or in state
(i, 0). The worker is not hired by firms in state (i, j). A firm in state (0, 0) hires the
worker because, when employed, the worker accumulates human capital (by doing) and,
when matched with a coworker, the worker will have a higher marginal product than in
unemployment.5 A firm in state (i, 0) hires the worker because, when employed with a
coworker of type i, the worker accumulates human capital (by doing and by learning from
the coworker) and has a higher marginal product than in unemployment. A firm with
employees (i, j) does not hire the worker. Hiring the worker requires sending one of the
firm’s employees into unemployment. Since the worker’s productivity on the job (relative
to his productivity in unemployment) is lower than the relative productivity of either em-
ployee, hiring the worker would reduce overall output. Since the worker’s human capital
is lower than the human capital of either employee, hiring the worker would increase the
overall human capital accumulation. However, this benefit is smaller than the cost of
lowering production.
       Now, consider a worker with the lowest human capital (i.e. k = 1) who is employed
on his own (i.e. x = 0). The policy functions for this worker are shown in the second
quadrant in the top row of Figure 2. The worker is not hired by firms in state (0, 0), since
the gains from trade are zero. The worker is hired by firms in state (i, 0), as the marginal
product of the worker when employed alongside a coworker of type i is greater than his
marginal product when employed on his own. The worker is not hired by firms in state
   4
      The model does not match the targeted moments exactly because there are more moments than
parameters.
    5
      Since workers search almost as well on as off the job, the consequences of hiring on the option value
of searching are negligible.

     Figure 2: Equilibrium Policy Functions
(i, j). Intuitively, hiring the worker would have the costly consequence of sending one of
the firm’s employees into unemployment where they would produce less and lose human
capital. This cost is greater than the benefit of allowing the worker to learn not only by
doing, but also from being in the company of a more knowledgeable coworker.
   Next, consider a worker with the lowest human capital (i.e. k = 1) who is employed
with a coworker of type ` = 1, 4 or 7 (i.e. x = `). The policy functions for this worker
are shown respectively in the third, fourth and fifth quadrants in the top row of Figure 2.
The worker is never hired by firms in state (0, 0). This is because productivity and human
capital accumulation are lower when the worker is employed on his own than when he is
employed with a coworker. The worker is hired by firms in state (i, 0) only if i > `. This
is so because the marginal productivity and the human capital accumulation are higher
when the worker is employed with a better coworker.
   The second row in Figure 2 shows the policy functions for a worker with an interme-
diate stock of human capital (i.e. k = 4). First, suppose that the worker is unemployed
(i.e. x = u). The worker is hired by firms in state (0, 0) or (i, 0). These are the same
policies as for a worker of type 1, and the economics behind them is the same. The worker
is hired by a firm in state (i, j) if min{i, j} ≤ 3 or if min{i, j} ≥ 5. These policies are
different than for a worker of type 1, and they deserve some explanation. A firm in state
(i, j) with min{i, j} ≤ 3 hires an unemployed worker of type 4 to replace the worst of
its employees. Since the worker’s productivity on the job (relative to his productivity in
unemployment) is higher than the relative productivity of the replaced employee, hiring
the worker increases overall output. Since the worker’s human capital is higher than the
human capital of the replaced employee, the other employee accumulates human capital
more quickly. These benefits are larger than the cost of the lost human capital accumula-
tion for the replaced employee. An unemployed worker of type 4 is also hired by a firm in
state (i, j) with min{i, j} ≥ 5 to replace the worst of the firm’s employees. The firm finds
it optimal to do so because the worker has more to learn from the firm’s best employee
than the firm’s worst employee.
   Next, suppose that the worker is employed on his own (i.e. k = 4, x = 0). The worker
is not hired by firms in state (0, 0), as the gains from trade are zero. The worker is hired
by firms in state (i, 0), as the value of the worker is higher when he is employed with a
coworker of type i than by himself. The worker is also hired by a firm in state (i, j) if
min{i, j} = 1 or i = j = 2. Intuitively, the firm finds it optimal to do so because the cost
of sending one of its employees into unemployment is lower than the additional output
that the worker can produce with a coworker than on his own.
   Finally, suppose that the worker is employed with a coworker of type ` = 1, 4, 7 (i.e.

                                            28
k = 4, x = `). These policies follow a similar pattern as those for a worker of type 1. That
is, the worker moves when he meets a poaching firm with only one employee who happens
to be better than his current coworker. However, when a worker of type 4 is employed
with someone who is just like him, he also moves to a poaching firm with a single employee
of type 3. This is because the benefit of the worker teaching to an individual of type 3
exceeds the cost of the worker producing with an individual of type 3 rather than 4.
   The third row in Figure 2 shows the policy functions for a worker with the highest
stock of human capital (i.e. k = 7). These policy functions follow the same general
pattern as those for workers of type 1 and 4. There are two exceptions to this pattern.
First, an unemployed worker of type 7 is sometimes hired to replace the firm’s best rather
than the firm’s worst employee. The firm finds this optimal because the worker can teach
more to the worst employee than to the best employee. Second, a worker of type 7 does
not always move from a team to a poaching firm with a single employee who is better
than the worker’s current teammate. This is because the worker can teach more to his
current teammate.
   Taking a bird’s eye view on Figure 2, we see forces pushing equilibrium towards NAM
and forces pushing towards PAM. Transitions of high human capital individuals from
firms employing other high human capital workers to firms employing low human capital
workers push equilibrium towards NAM. These transitions are caused by the non-linearity
of the human capital accumulation function, which implies that a better worker can teach
a worse worker without any consequences on his own human capital accumulation. Firms
replacing low human capital employees with high human capital individuals hired from
unemployment and from firms with incomplete teams pushes the equilibrium towards
PAM. The extent to which firms upgrade their workforce through replacement hiring de-
pends on the degree of supermodularity of the production function (which determines
the productivity gains caused by upgrading) and on the asymmetry of the human cap-
ital accumulation function (which determines the loss in human capital growth caused
by upgrading). Interestingly, some upgrading would take place even with a modular pro-
duction function. This is because the productivity gains caused by upgrading depend
on a comparison between the productivity when employed relative to the productivity
when unemployed for the new hire and the old employee. And the relative productivity
of a worker is increasing in his human capital stock even when the production function is
modular.
   Having examined in detail the policy functions, we can now easily make sense of the
other features of equilibrium. Figure 3 contains the histogram of the unemployment rate
(left panel) and of the monthly transition rates (right panel) for workers with different

human capital. For workers with the lowest human capital, the unemployment rate is
13.5%, the unemployment to employment rate (UE) is about 18%, the employment to
unemployment rate (EU) is 1.7%, and the rate of transition from one employer to another
(EE) is 2%. For workers with more human capital, the unemployment rate is lower, the
UE rate is higher and the EU rate is lower. Indeed, for workers with the highest human
capital, the unemployment rate is about 1.5%, the UE rate is 32.5%, the EU rate is 0.5%
and the EE rate is 0.85%. The UE rate is higher because workers with more human capital
are more frequently hired out of unemployment as replacements for existing employees.
The EU rate is lower because workers with more human capital are less frequently replaced
by new hires and sent into unemployment. Hence, workers with more human capital end
up having a lower unemployment rate.
   Figure 4 is a histogram of the distribution of human capital among workers entering the
labor market (Entering workers) and among the entire population (All workers: baseline).
The distribution of human capital in the population is higher—in the sense of first-order
stochastic dominance—than the distribution of human capital among new entrants. The
difference between the two distributions reflects the amount of human capital accumula-
tion that takes place over the work-life, which is due to the standard learning by doing
mechanism (as captured by the parameter α0 ) and to learning from more knowledgeable
coworkers (as captured by the parameter α1+ ). In aggregate, the stock of human capital
in the population is 60% higher than among new entrants. Or, to put it differently, 38%

                             Figure 4: Human Capital Distribution


of aggregate human capital is accumulated during the work-life.
       Figure 5 shows the average wage for workers of different age (left panel) and the
average human capital for workers of different age (right panel). Consistent with the
data, the model is such that the average wage doubles over the lifecycle. The average
wage increases with age because older workers have more human capital (as they climbed
the human capital ladder), they are employed in firms in which their marginal value is
higher (as they moved towards better jobs), and they capture a larger share of the marginal
value (as they received more outside offers). Figure 5 also shows the lifecycle profile of
the average wage and human capital for workers with different initial conditions.6 Note
that initial conditions have persistent effects. Even after 30 years in the labor market,
there is no full convergence in the human capital and in the wage of workers who entered
the market with different amounts of knowledge.
       The model also does a decent job at matching the dispersion of wages in the data. The
ratio between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile in the overall wage distribution
is around 6, while in the data is 4.5. The dispersion of wages is generated by fundamental
and by circumstantial differences among workers. As a matter of fundamentals, workers
are paid different wages because they have different human capital. As a matter of
circumstances, workers with the same human capital are paid different wages because they
are employed in jobs in which their marginal value is different and because they capture
different fractions of their marginal values. The ratio between the 90th percentile and the
   6
   We only plot the lifecycle for workers entering the labor market with human capital type 1, 2 and 3.
These types account for about 90% of all workers entering the market.

10th percentile in the wage distribution for workers aged 24 is around 4, while in the data
it is 3. There is less wage dispersion among young workers than in the overall population
simply because the 90-10 percentile ratio of human capital among young workers is lower
than in the overall population.
      Finally, we turn to the analysis of the equilibrium pattern of sorting. Figure 6(a) illus-
trates the distribution of coworkers.7 If the equilibrium was PAM, the entire distribution
would lie along the anti-diagonal (the one going from the South West to the North East
corner). If the equilibrium was NAM, the entire distribution would lie along the main di-
agonal (the one going from the North West to the South East corner). The distribution in
Figure 6(a) is neither PAM nor NAM. To understand the equilibrium pattern of sorting,
it is useful to look at Figure 6(b), which shows the distribution of coworkers in equilib-
rium net of the distribution of coworkers that would obtain under random assignment.8
Consider workers with the lowest human capital (k = 1). The equilibrium distribution of
workers of type 1 across coworkers is, relative to a random-assignment, decreasing in the
coworker’s type. That is, workers of type 1 are more than proportionally matched with
low human capital coworkers. The equilibrium distribution of workers of type 4 across
coworkers is, relative to random assignment, negative for all coworker’s types except 6
and 7. That is, workers of type 4 are disproportionately matched with the highest types
of coworkers. The equilibrium distribution of workers of type 7 across coworkers is, net of

      In Appendix D, the reader can find a 3D illustration of the equilibrium distribution of coworkers.

      To construct the distribution under random assignment, we only consider workers employed in teams.

3.4      Counterfactuals
We now carry out two counterfactual exercises, designed to understand and quantify
the role of the two distinctive features of our model—i.e. learning from coworkers and
production complementarities between coworkers—in determining the formation of human
capital, the production of output, and the shape of the pattern of sorting of workers across
firms.

3.4.1    Learning from Coworkers

In the first counterfactual, we set the learning parameters α1+ and α1− to zero, so that all
employed workers accumulate human capital at the same speed irrespective of the identity
of their coworker. The purpose of this counterfactual is to quantify the importance of
learning from coworkers for the accumulation of human capital in the population, the
production of output in the economy, and the equilibrium pattern of sorting between

model.

                        Figure 7: Equilibrium Pattern of Sorting: NLC


       Figure 4 contains histograms for the distribution of human capital among workers en-
tering the labor market, among all workers in the economy in the NLC model, and among
all workers in the economy in the baseline model. Not surprisingly, the distribution of hu-
man capital in the economy is lower in the NLC than in the baseline model. The average
human capital in the NLC model is about 24% lower than in the baseline. This number
understates the importance of learning from coworkers in the accumulation of human cap-
ital. Indeed, the difference between the average human capital in the population and the
average human capital at entry is 60% lower in the NLC than in the baseline model. In
other words, learning from coworkers accounts for 60% of all the stock of human capital
that is accumulated during the work-life!9 Clearly, as human capital is lower in the NLC
model, so is output. Specifically, aggregate output is about 20% lower in the NLC than
in the baseline model.
       Figure 7(a) illustrates the distribution of coworkers in the NLC model.10 Since the
NLC and the baseline models differ with respect to the distribution of worker types
(as shown in Figure 4), comparing Figure 7(a) with Figure 6(a) does not reflect only
   9
      Recall that 38% of the stock of human capital is accumulated during the work-life. Of this 38%, 60%
is accumulated because of more knowledgeable coworkers teaching to less knowledgeable ones.

      We refer the reader to Appendix D for a 3D illustration of the distribution of coworkers for the NLC
and MP models.

differences in the pattern of sorting between the two models. To isolate differences in
the pattern of sorting, Figure 7(b) compares the distribution of coworkers net of random
assignment in the NLC model with the distribution net of random assignment in the
baseline model. From this comparison we see that the distribution has more density
(relative to random assignment) along the 45◦ -line and less density away from the 45◦ -
line in the NLC than in the baseline model. Relatedly, we find that the correlation
between the human capital of coworkers is 30% in the NLC model, while it is only 10%
in the baseline model. Informally, we could say that in the NLC model sorting is more
positive than in the baseline.11
       It is easy to understand why the pattern of sorting is more positive in the NLC model
than in the baseline. The calibrated values of α1+ and α1− imply that the human capital
accumulation function is non-linear. Workers accumulate human capital more quickly
when paired with someone who is better than them. However, workers do not accumulate
human capital less quickly when paired with someone who is worse than them. This
implies that pairing workers with different human capital leads to more human capital
accumulation than pairing workers with the same human capital. In the NLC model, we
make the growth rate of human capital of an individual independent of the identity of his
coworker and, hence, this effect disappears. As a result, the pattern of sorting becomes
more positive. In Appendix D, the reader can find the equilibrium policy function for the
NLC model.

3.4.2      Modular Production

In the second counterfactual, we set the parameter ρ in the production function f (k, `)
to 1, so that the output produced by a team of workers becomes additive in the workers’
human capital. As changes in ρ affect not only the supermodularity but also the level
of the production function f (k, `), we rescale f (k, `) so that the output produced by two
workers of the same type remains the same as in the baseline calibration.12 The purpose
of the counterfactual is to quantify the importance of production supermodularity for
the accumulation of human capital in the population, the production of output in the
economy, and the equilibrium pattern of sorting. We refer to this counterfactual as the
Modular Production (MP) model.

     Anderson and Smith (2018) expose some of the difficulties associated with formalizing the notion of
“more positive” sorting.

     Formally, in this counterfactual the production function is

                      Figure 8: Equilibrium Pattern of Sorting: MP


   Figure 8(a) illustrates the distribution of coworkers in the MP model. To isolate
differences in the pattern of sorting from differences in the distribution of types in the
MP and in the baseline models, Figure 8(b) compares the distribution of coworkers net
of random assignment in the MP model with the distribution net of random assignment
in the baseline model. We immediately see from this panel that the distribution has less
density (relative to random assignment) along from the 45◦ -line and more density away
from the 45◦ -line in the MP than in the baseline model. Relatedly, we find that the
correlation between the human capital of coworkers is only 1% in the MP model, while it
is 10% in the baseline model. Informally, we could say that in the MP model sorting is
less positive than in the baseline.This finding is easy to explain. The calibrated value of
ρ implies that production function f (k, `) is supermodular, which gives firms an incentive
to create teams of workers who have a similar stock of human capital. In the MP model,
we make the production function modular and, thus, we remove this incentive. As a
result, the pattern of sorting becomes less positive. In Appendix D, the reader can find
the equilibrium policy function for the MP model.
   As sorting across coworkers is less positive in the MP than in the baseline model,
human capital diffuses more rapidly from more to less knowledgeable individuals. Figure
4 contains histograms for the distribution of human capital among workers entering the


                                            36
labor market, among all workers in the economy in the MP model, and among all workers
in the economy in the baseline model. The average human capital is about 2% higher in
the MP than in the baseline model. The difference between the average human capital
and the average human capital at entry is 4% higher in the MP than in the baseline model.
In other words, the supermodularity of the production function reduces the accumulation
of human capital during the work-life by 4%. Similarly, aggregate output is 2% higher in
the MP than in the baseline model.


4     Planner Problem and Optimal Taxation
In this section, we solve the social planner problem and characterize its steady state. In
Section 4.1, we show that the stationary equilibrium is inefficient, in the sense that it is
different from the steady state of the planner’s problem. In Section 4.2, we construct a sys-
tem of taxes and subsidies for unemployed workers and different units of production with
the property that the steady state of the planner’s problem is a stationary equilibrium. In
Section 4.3, we show that—given the calibrated parameter values—the equilibrium is such
that low human capital employees are inefficiently often replaced by better workers. As a
result of this inefficiency, the equilibrium pattern of sorting of coworkers is too positive,
the stock of human capital in the economy is too low, and so is output. The optimal
system of taxes and subsidies serves the purpose of discouraging firms from replacing low
human capital employees with better workers.


4.1    Inefficiency of Equilibrium
The value for a utilitarian social planner, evaluated at the beginning of the production
stage, is such that

      S(up , ep )
           P                                 P                                           (12)
    = max k [up (k)b(k) + ep (k, 0)f (k, 0) + ` ep (k, `)f (k, `)/2] + βS(up+ , ep+ ).

The state of the problem is {up , ep }, where up (k) is the measure of unemployed workers of
type k, ep (k, 0) is the measure of workers of type k who are employed without a coworker,
and ep (k, `) is the measure of workers of type k who are employed with a coworker of type
`. Consistency requires ep (k, `) = ep (`, k). The objective of the planner is to maximize
the present value of output discounted at the factor β. At the learning stage, the planner
takes as given the evolution of the workers’ human capital. At the entry-and-exit stage,
the planner takes as given the death and birth of workers. At the search-and-matching
stage, the planner takes as given the meetings between workers and firms. For every


                                             37
meeting between a worker of type k in state x and a firm in state y, the planner chooses
whether the worker should be hired and, if the firm has already two employees, which one
the worker should replace. At the dismissal stage, the planner chooses which firm-worker
matches to break. The planner’s choices determine the state {up+ , ep+ } in the next period.
In Appendix C, the reader can find a complete formulation of the planner’s problem, as
well as the details of the solution.
    We want to characterize the properties of the steady-state of the solution to the plan-
ner’s problem. To this aim, we denote as {u∗p , e∗p } the steady-state distribution of workers
measured at the production stage, and as {u∗ , e∗ } the steady-state distribution of workers
                                                          ∗
measured at the search-and-matching stage. We denote as V0,0 the value of an additional
                                         ∗
idle firm to the planner. We denote as Vk,0 the value of an additional production unit
                                       ∗
with a single worker k. We denote as Vk,` the value of an additional production unit with
a team of workers (k, `). We denote as Uk∗ the value of an additional unemployed worker
of type k. These objects are evaluated at the steady state and, for this reason, we omit
their dependence from the state of the problem. As we did for the equilibrium, we find it
useful to denote V̂ the value of a production unit at the dismissal stage.
                         ∗
    The marginal value V0,0 of an idle firm is such that
                       nhP                                                       i         o

The value to the planner of an idle firm is the sum of the output generated by the firm in
the current period (zero) and the present value of the output generated by the firm from
the next period onwards. In the next period, the firm meets a worker of type i in state x
with probability q ∗ (i, x), where q ∗ (i, u) = λu u∗i , q ∗ (i, 0) = λe e∗i,0 and q ∗ (i, j) = λe e∗i,j . In

this case, the continuation value of the firm is given by V̂0,0 plus the difference between

worker in his current state, v ∗ (i, x).

The first term on the right-hand side of (18) is the output generated by the worker in the
current period. The second term is the present value of output generated by the worker
starting next period. The worker meets a firm in state y with probability λu p∗ (y). When
the worker meets a firm in state y, the present value of output generated by the worker
is U ∗ (k) plus max{v ∗ (k+ , y) − U ∗ (k+ ), 0}.
     The equations for the marginal value of unemployed workers, idles firms and produc-
tion units in the planner’s problem are very similar to the equations for the value of

                                                             39
unemployment, idle firms and production units in the stationary equilibrium. The sole
difference is that the equations in the planner’s problem do not depend on the bargain-
ing powers γ and 1 − γ. In fact, the marginal value of an unemployed worker to the
planner includes the full value of the meetings between that worker and firms (rather
than a fraction γ). The marginal value of an idle firm to the planner includes the full
value of the meetings between that firm and workers (rather than a fraction 1 − γ). The
marginal value of a production unit to the planner includes the full value of the meetings
between the firm associated with that production unit and outside workers (rather than
a fraction 1 − γ), and the full value of the meetings between the workers associated with
that production unit and poaching firms (rather than a fraction γ).
       It is easy to understand the difference between the marginal values in the planner’s
problem and the private values in the equilibrium. At the margin, the value to the planner
of an additional unemployed worker, idle firm, or production unit must include the full
value of the meetings generated by these entities. In equilibrium, the private value of an
unemployed worker, idle firm, or production unit only includes the fraction of the value
of a meeting that is captured by these entities. For the private values in equilibrium to
coincide with the marginal values in the planner’s problem, it would have to be the case
that—in a meeting between two parties—both parties are rewarded with the entire value
of the meeting. Clearly, this is not possible as it requires distributing more resources
than are available. This type of inefficiency is common to models with two-sided search
in which the measure of meetings between two types (say, unemployed workers of type
k and production units with a team (i, j)) is proportional to the product between the
measures of the two types (see, e.g., Kiyotaki and Lagos 2007).
       The above observation suggest that the Stationary Equilibrium is not efficient. For-
mally, let {U ∗ , V ∗ } and {u∗ , e∗ } denote the steady-state value functions and distributions
of the planner’s problem and let {U, V } and {u, e} denote the steady-state value func-
tions and distributions in the Stationary Equilibrium. To see that the equilibrium is not
efficient, it is sufficient to note that—even if {u, e} = {u∗ , e∗ }—the equilibrium values
{U, V } are different from the social values {U ∗ , V ∗ } as they solve a different system of
Bellman Equations. Moreover, since {U, V } are different from {U ∗ , V ∗ }, the equilibrium
policies will be typically different13 from the social planner’s choices and, hence, {u, e}
will also be different from {u∗ , e∗ }.
       We have thus established the following result.
  13
    Of course, it may be possible that—even though the equilibrium values are different from the social
values—their ranking is the same so that the planner’s steady-state distribution is a steady-state of the
market economy. In our numerical examples, we find that this is not the case.



                                                   40
Theorem 1: (Inefficiency of Equilibrium) Any Stationary Equilibrium {U, V } and {u, e}
is inefficient. That is, {U, V } and {u, e} is different from the planner’s steady-state
{U ∗ , V ∗ } and {u∗ , e∗ }.


4.2     Optimal Taxation
We now construct a system of subsidies/taxes for which there is an efficient equilibrium, in
the sense that the steady-state of the planner’s problem, {U ∗ , V ∗ } and {u∗ , e∗ }, satisfies
the conditions for a stationary equilibrium. To this aim, let su (k) denote the subsidy (if
positive) or tax (if negative) paid by the government to an unemployed worker of type k.
Let s0 denote the subsidy paid to an idle firm. Let s1 (k) denote the subsidy paid to a
production unit with one worker of type k. Finally, let s2 (k, `) denote the subsidy paid
to a production unit with workers of type (k, `).
   Consider the subsidy s∗u (k) for an unemployed worker of type k such that
                       n                    hP                 n                    oio
           ∗                ∗            ∗             ∗           ∗           ∗
                                   
Uk = b(k)+su (k)+βEk+ Uk+ + σ 0 − Uk+ +          y λu p (y)γ max v (k+ , y) − Uk+ , 0    .
                                                                                                               (19)
In words, s∗u (k) is a subsidy such that the equilibrium value of unemployment for a worker
of type k—given that the equilibrium distribution of workers and firms is the same as in
the steady state of the planner’s problem and that the equilibrium continuation values
are the same as the planner’s marginal values—coincides with the marginal value of an
unemployed worker of type k to the planner.
    Next, consider the subsidy s∗0 for an idle firm such that
                    nhP                                                            i         o
       ∗
     V0,0 = s∗0 + β     i,x q ∗
                                (i, x)(1 − γ) max{ V̂ ∗
                                                     i,0 − V̂  ∗
                                                              0,0 − v ∗
                                                                        (i, x), 0}   + V̂  ∗
                                                                                          0,0 .                (20)

In words, s∗0 is such that the equilibrium value of an idle firm—given that the distribution
of workers and firms is the same as in the planner’s steady state and that the continuation
values are the same as the planner’s marginal values—coincides with the marginal value
of an idle firm to the planner.
    Similarly, the subsidy s∗1 (k) for a production unit with one worker of type k is
                     ∗
                   Vk,0 = f (k, 0) + s∗1 (k)

The subsidies s∗1 (k) and s∗2 (k, `) are constructed so that the equilibrium value of a produc-
tion unit coincides with its marginal value to the planner, given that the distribution of
workers and firms is the same as in the planner’s steady state and that the continuation
values are the same as the planner’s marginal values.
    Given the system of subsidies s∗ ≡ {s∗u , s∗0 , s∗1 , s∗2 }, the planner’s values {U ∗ , V ∗ } and
the planner’s steady-state distribution {u∗ , e∗ } constitute a stationary equilibrium. By
construction of s∗ , the planner’s values and the planner’s distribution satisfy all of the
Bellman Equations for a stationary equilibrium. Moreover, since the planner’s distribution
{u∗ , e∗ } is stationary and the law of motion for the distribution is the same in the planner’s
problem as in equilibrium, {u∗ , e∗ } also satisfies all of the inflow-outflow equations for a
stationary equilibrium. Notice that the optimal system of subsidies s∗ can be recovered
using equations (19)-(22) and computed using only the planner’s solution, {U ∗ , V ∗ } and
{u∗ , e∗ }, and the bargaining powers, γ and 1 − γ.
    Nothing guarantees that the system of subsidies s∗ balances the budget of the govern-
ment. To address this issue, let T ∗ be given by

      T ∗ = s∗0 n∗0 + k s∗u (k)u∗p (k) + s∗1 (k)e∗p (k, 0) + ` s∗2 (k, `)e∗p (k, `)/2
                    P                                     P                         
                                                                                         2.                       (23)

Given T ∗ , let the system of subsidies/taxes ŝ ≡ {ŝu , ŝ0 , ŝ1 , ŝ2 } be defined as

                   ŝu = s∗u − T ∗ , ŝ0 = s∗0 − T ∗ , ŝ1 = s∗1 − 2T ∗ , ŝ2 = s∗2 − 3T ∗ .                      (24)

In words, T ∗ is equal to the total subsidies paid out by the government to unemployed
workers, idle firms, and production units divided by the total measure of workers and
firms. Then, ŝu is equal to the optimal subsidy s∗u for an unemployed worker net of the
average subsidy T ∗ . Similarly, ŝ0 is equal to the optimal subsidy s∗0 for an idle firm net of
T ∗ . Finally, ŝ1 and ŝ2 are equal to the optimal subsidies s∗1 and s∗2 for production units
net of the average subsidy T ∗ multiplied by the number of agents attached to the unit.
Effectively, ŝ is equal to s∗ net of a per-capita constant T ∗ . Since ŝ is the same as the

                                                         42
optimal system s∗ net of a per-capita constant, ŝ induces the same hiring choices as s∗
and, hence, leads to the efficient allocation of workers and firms. Since T ∗ is equal to the
average subsidy given the system s∗ , ŝ balances the budget of the government.
   We have thus established the following result.
Theorem 2: (Optimal Subsidies and Taxes).
(i) Given the system of subsidies/taxes s∗ in (19)-(22), the steady-state of the planner’s
problem, {U ∗ , V ∗ } and {u∗ , e∗ }, is a Stationary Equilibrium.
(ii) Given the system of subsidies/taxes ŝ in (24), {U, V } and {u∗ , e∗ } is a Stationary
Equilibrium, where U = U ∗ − T ∗ /(1 − β(1 − σ)), V0 = V0∗ − T ∗ /(1 − β), V1 = V1∗ − T ∗ /(1 −
β) − T ∗ (1 − β(1 − σ)) and V2 = V2∗ − T ∗ /(1 − β) − 2T ∗ /(1 − β(1 − σ)). Moreover, the
system of subsidies/taxes ŝ balances the government budget.


4.3    Measuring Inefficiencies and Optimal Taxes
We now compare the equilibrium to the solution of the planner’s problem given the
calibrated value of the parameters. Figure 9 contains histograms for the distribution
of human capital among workers entering the labor market, the efficient distribution of
human capital in the population, and the equilibrium distribution of human capital in
the population. The distribution of human capital is lower in equilibrium than in the
planner’s solution. The average human capital is 2.5% lower in equilibrium than in the
planner’s solution. The difference between the average human capital in the population
and at entry is about 7% lower in equilibrium than in the planner’s solution. Similarly,
output is 2% lower in equilibrium.
   To understand why human capital is lower in equilibrium, it is useful to compare the
equilibrium policy functions in Figure 2 with the planner’s policy functions in Figure 10.
There are three qualitative differences. First, in equilibrium, high human capital workers
who are unemployed are too often hired as replacements of the worst rather than the
best of the firm’s employees. Second, medium and high human capital workers who are
employed on their own are too often hired as replacements of the worst of the firm’s
employees rather than being left on their own. Third, medium and high human capital
workers who are paired with good teammates do not move often enough to firms with
worse employees. All three differences between equilibrium and planner’s policies have
the effect of reducing the time that low human capital workers spend together with more
knowledgeable coworkers and, given the asymmetry of the learning function, lowering the
overall accumulation of human capital. Intuitively, the value of production units made
up of two workers with different human capital is lower in equilibrium because the value


                                              43
                          Figure 9: Efficient Human Capital Distribution


of the knowledge transmitted by the high to the low human capital worker is eventually
captured by poaching firms.
      Figure 11(a) illustrates the distribution of coworkers in the planner’s solution.14 Figure
11(b) compares the distribution of coworkers net of random assignment in the equilibrium
and in the planner’s solution. The figure is clear. In equilibrium, there is an inefficiently
high density along the 45◦ -line and an inefficiently low density away from the 45◦ -line.
This means that in equilibrium there is an inefficiently large measure of teams composed
of similar workers and an inefficiently small measure of teams composed of workers with
different human capital. The correlation of the human capital of coworkers is 10% in
equilibrium and −2% in the planner’s problem.
      Figure 12 shows the system of subsidies that makes the equilibrium efficient and bal-
ances the budget of the government. The left panel shows the subsidies for unemployed
workers of type k and for production unit with a single worker of type k. These subsidies
are large (relative to the flow output) and they are increasing in the worker’s human
capital. The right panel shows the subsidies for production units with workers of type k
and `. These subsidies are negative (they are taxes), small (relative to output), and their
absolute value tend to increase with the average human capital of the coworkers. The
key property of the system is that the subsidies for unemployed workers and for work-
ers employed on their own are increasing in the worker’s human capital. Such subsidies
dissuade firms from upgrading their workforce, which is the main source of inefficiency
 14
      We refer the reader to Appendix D for a 3D illustration of the efficient distribution of coworkers.

of equilibrium. Indeed, if a firm replaces a low human capital employee with a more
knowledgeable new hire, it has to compensate the new hire for the loss of a large subsidy
while the replaced employee who moves into unemployment receives a smaller subsidy.
   The system of subsidies in Figure 12 is designed to make sure that, in any meeting
between a firm and a worker, the private gains from trade coincide in level with the
planner’s gains from trade. Given this design, the system of subsidies guarantees that
the socially efficient distribution of workers and firms is a stationary equilibrium of the
market economy. However, the system is also highly invasive. A less invasive system can
be obtained by finding hiring subsidies/taxes to make sure that the private gains from
trade coincide in sign with the planner’s gains from trade.
   Figure 13 reports the optimal hiring subsidies and taxes conditional on the worker’s
state—i.e. his human capital and his employment status—and on the firm’s state—i.e.,
idle, operating a production unit with a single employee or a production unit with two
employees. The three rows in Figure 13 report the hiring subsidies and taxes for a worker
of type 1, 4 and 7. The five columns report the hiring taxes and subsidies for a worker
who is unemployed, employed on his own, or employed with a coworker of type 1, 4 or
7. Each cell defined by the intersection of a row and a column, reports the hiring taxes
and subsidies if the firm in state (ı̄, j̄). A green dot means that the hiring is subsidized.

                         Figure 12: Optimal Subsidies and Taxes


A green triangle pointing up (down) means that the hiring is subsidized to replace the
firm’s best (worst) employee. A red dot means that the hiring is taxed so that it does not
take place. A red triangle pointing up (down) means that the hiring is taxed in a way to
induce the firm to replace the firm’s best (worst) employee.
   Glancing at Figure 13, one immediately notices that the system does not prescribe
any subsidies or taxes for firms considering hiring workers of type 1. The private gains
from trade between a firm and a worker of type 1 always have the same sign as the
planner’s gains from trade and, thus, the equilibrium hiring decisions are efficient even
without hiring subsidies or taxes. The system prescribes some subsidies and taxes for
firms considering hiring workers of type 4. For instance, a firm with an employee of type
1 and another employee of type 4 or 5 needs to be dissuaded from hiring a worker of type
4 currently employed on his own. A firm with a single employee of type 2 or 3 needs to
be given a subsidy to hire a worker of type 4 currently employed with another worker of
type 4. The taxes and subsidies for firms considering hiring a worker of type 7 are more
prevalent. For instance, firms with employees of type 1 and 7 need to be dissuaded by a
tax from hiring an unemployed worker of type 7. Firms with an employee of type (2, 6)
need to be faced with a tax in order to be dissuaded from replacing the best employee
and, instead, replace the best employee. Frims with a single employee of type 1 or 2 need

equilibrium.


5     Conclusions
We develop a version of the search-theoretic equilibrium model of the labor market of
Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) in which production involves teams of workers and in which
a worker’s human capital accumulation depends on the human capital of his coworkers.
The model implies a theory of how workers with different human capital sort themselves
into different teams, and a theory of how a worker’s wage is affected by his human capital,
his coworkers’ human capital and the extent of competition in a frictional labor market.
The theory allows us to infer the properties of the production function and of the human
capital accumulation function using a matched employer-employee dataset of US workers
and firms. We find that the production function is supermodular. We find that the
human capital function is non-linear. Namely, if a worker is less knowledgeable than his
coworkers, his human capital grows faster the better are his coworkers. If a worker is more
knowledgeable than his coworkers, his human capital grows at the same rate irrespective
of the quality of his coworkers.
    Having estimated an equilibrium theory, we can run proper counterfactuals. We find
that learning from coworkers accounts for 60% of all of the human capital that is accumu-
lated by workers on the job. We find that the supermodularity of the production function
has a negative effect on the stock of human capital and on output by making the pattern
of sorting more positive. Finally, we study the efficient assignment of workers to pro-
duction teams, taking into consideration both the supermodularity of production and the
asymmetry of learning. We find that the efficient sorting of coworkers across production
teams is less positive than in the data, allowing for more learning opportunities for low
human capital workers and, consequently, for a higher aggregate stock of human capital
and higher output.
    Much work remains to be done. From the perspective of theory, it would be important
to extend the model to allow firms to operate production teams with more than two
workers. The difficulty in carrying out this extension is the growth in the dimensionality
of the state space of the firm. The reward from this extension is a more direct mapping
between the notion of coworkers in the model and in the data. We experimented with this
extension using a directed search model in the spirit of Menzio and Shi (2011) and Schaal
(2017), but we still needed to keep the number of human capital level low. Second, it would


                                            49
be interesting to extend the model to allow for ex-ante differences in the productivity of
firms. Since our model generates, because of search frictions, ex-post differences in the
value of a worker to different firms we did not need to pursue this extension to match
data on EE transitions. Third, it would also be interesting to find out whether a simple
system of taxes and subsidies—in particular a system that does not require knowledge
of the human capital of different workers—can bring the economy close to the efficient
allocation. From the perspective of measurement, it would be interesting to dig deeper into
the properties of the human capital accumulation function. For instance, we would want
to know whether the effect of coworkers in an individual’s human capital accumulation
function is affected by the distance between worker and coworkers in terms of race, gender,
age and education.

A      Equilibrium Laws of Motion
Let u and e denote the distribution of workers across employment states at the beginning
of the current search stage. In order to formally express how this distribution evolves over
time, we need to introduce some notation to describe the equilibrium policy functions.
Specifically, let hy (k, x) denote the probability that a firm in state y ∈ Y hires a worker
of type k ∈ K in state x ∈ X. The probability hy (k, x) is 1 if the marginal value of
the worker to the firm, v(k, y), is greater than the value of the worker in his current
employment state, v(k, x). Otherwise, hy (k, x) is zero. Also, let ri,j (k, i) denote the
probability that, conditional on hiring a worker of type k, a firm in state (i, j) ∈ K × K
replaces employee i. The probability ri,j (k, i) is equal to 1 if V̂k,j + Ui > V̂k,i + Uj , it is
equal to 0 if V̂k,j + Ui < V̂k,i + Uj , and it is equal to 1/2 if V̂k,j + Ui = V̂k,i + Uj .
    Let up and ep denote the distribution of workers across employment states at the
beginning of the production stage. At this stage, the measure up (k) of unemployed workers
is given by

                 up (k)
                      n           hP                            io
               = u(k) (1 − λu ) +    y λu p(y)(1 − hy (k, u))                                 (25)

The first term on the right-hand side is the measure of unemployed workers at the begin-
ning of the search stage who either did not contact a firm or contacted a firm but were
not hired. The second term is the measure of workers who were employed on their own at
the beginning of the search stage and lost their job for exogenous reasons. The last term
is the measure of workers who were employed with a coworker of type ` at the beginning
of the search stage and either lost the job for exogenous reasons or were replaced by a
new hire.
    At the beginning of the production stage, the measure ep (k, 0) of workers employed
on their own is given by

The first term on the right-hand side is the measure of workers who were unemployed
at the beginning of the search stage and who were hired by a firm in state (0, 0). The
second, third and fourth terms are the measure of workers who were employed on their
own at the beginning of the search stage and remained in the same employment position.
The last term is the measure of workers who were employed with a coworker of type ` at
the beginning of the search stage and who were either hired by a firm in state (0, 0) or
who lost their coworker to a poaching firm or to unemployment.
   At the beginning of the production stage, the measure ep (k, `) of workers employed
with a coworker of type ` is given by

The right-hand side includes all the ways in which a worker finds himself employed with a
coworker of type ` at the production stage. First, the worker could have been unemployed
and been hired by a firm in state (`, 0) or hired by a firm in state (`, s) as a replacement
for s. Second, the worker could have been employed by himself and been hired by a firm
in state (`, 0), by a firm in state (`, s) as a replacement for s, or his employer could have
hired a worker of type `. Third, the worker could have been employed with a coworker
of type ` and the team had survived. Fourth, the worker could have been employed with
a coworker of type s and ended up, because he moved or the firm replaced his coworker,
with a coworker of type `.

                                                      54
     Let ud and ed denote the distribution of workers across employment states at the end
of the period (i.e., after the dismissal stage). The measures ud (k), ed (k, 0) and ed (k, `)
are given by
                                                              P
                  ud (k)        = up (k) + ep (k, 0)dk,0 (k) + ` ep (k, `)dk,` (k),
                                                             P
                  ed (k, 0)     = ep (k, 0)(1 − dk,0 (k)) + ` ep (k, `)dk,` (`),        (28)
                  ed (k, `)     = ep (k, `)(1 − dk,` (k))(1 − dk,` (`)),

where dy (k) denotes the probability that a firm in state y fires an employee of type k.
The above expressions are easy to understand.
     Let ug and eg denote the distribution of workers across employment states at the end
of the learning stage of next period. The measures ug (k), eg (k, 0) and eg (k, `) are given
by                                             P
                              ug (k)       =       s   g(k|s, u)ud (s),
                                               P
                              eg (k, 0)    =       s   g(k|s, 0)ed (s, 0),              (29)
                                               P
                              eg (k, `)    =       s,t   g(k|s, t)g(`|t, s)ed (s, t).
In words, the measure of unemployed workers of type k at this stage is equal to the sum of
the measures of unemployed workers of type s at the previous stage whose human capital
type goes from s to k. The measure of workers of type k employed on their own is the
sum of the measures of workers of type s employed on their own whose human capital
type goes from s to k. The measure of workers of type k employed with a coworker of
type ` is the sum of the measures of workers of type s employed with a coworker of type
t who transition from s to k and from t to `.
     Finally, let u+ and e+ denote the distribution of workers across employment states at
the end of the entry and exit stage. The measures u+ (k), e+ (k, 0) and e+ (k, `) are given
by
                           u+ (k)         = (1 − σ)ug (k) + σπ(k),
                                                              P
                           e+ (k, 0)      = (1 − σ)eg (k, 0) + ` σeg (k, `),            (30)
                           e+ (k, `)      = (1 − 2σ)eg (k, `).
     The distribution u+ , e+ is also the distribution of workers across employment states
at the beginning of the search stage of next period. Thus, the distribution is stationary
if and only if the following inflow-outflow conditions hold

                                          u+ (k) − u(k) = 0,
                                          e+ (k, 0) − e(k, 0) = 0,                      (31)
                                          e+ (k, `) − e(k, `) = 0.

B       Wage Equations
Let Ŵk,0 (w) denote the value for a worker of type k who is employed at the wage w and
does not have a coworker. Similarly, let Ŵk,` (w) denote the value for a worker of type k
who is employed at the wage w and has a coworker of type `. The value functions Ŵk,0 (w)
and Ŵk,` (w) are measured at the beginning of the dismissal stage. The value functions
Wk,0 (w) and Wk,` (w) are measured at the beginning of the production stage.
    The value functions Ŵk,0 (w) and Ŵk,` (w) are given by

                      Ŵk,0 (w) = max{Uk , min{Wk,0 (w), V̂k,0 − V̂0,0 }},                (32)

and
                      Ŵk,` (w) = max{Uk , min{Wk,` (w), V̂k,` − V̂`,0 }}.                (33)

In words, Ŵk,· (w) is the maximum between the value of unemployment to a worker of type
k and the lowest between the value to the worker of staying with his current employer at
the wage w and the marginal value of the worker to the production unit operated by the
firm.
   The value function Wk,0 (w) is given by
                            n
    Wk,0 (w) = w + βE Ŵk+ ,0 (w)
       h                i     h                   i

 +       λe p(y) max{Ŵk+ ,0 (w), min{v(k+ , y), γv(k+ , y) + (1 − γ)v(k+ , 0)}} − Ŵk+ ,0 (w)
        y
                                                                                          (34)
In the current period, the worker is paid the wage w. At the exit stage of next period, the
worker leaves the labor market with probability σ. In this case, the worker’s continuation
value is 0. At the search stage, the worker moves into unemployment with probability δ.
In this case, the worker’s continuation value is Uk+ . The firm contacts a worker of type i
in state x with probability q(i, x) and hires him with probability hk+ ,0 (i, x). In this case,
the worker’s continuation value is Ŵk+ ,i (w). The worker contacts a poaching firm in state
y with probability λe p(y). In this case, three different situations may arise depending
on the value of the worker to the poaching firm, v(k+ , y), the value of the worker to the
incumbent firm, v(k+ , 0) = V̂k+ ,0 − V̂0,0 , and the value to the worker of being employed
at the incumbent firm at the wage w, Ŵk+ ,0 (w). If v(k+ , y) ≤ Ŵk+ ,0 (w), the worker
remains with the incumbent at the wage w. Hence, his continuation value is Ŵk+ ,0 (w).


                                              56
If v(k+ , y) > Ŵk+ ,0 (w) and v(k+ , y) ≤ v(k+ , 0), the worker remains with the incumbent
but his wage is increased to match his outside option. Hence, his continuation value is
v(k+ , y). If v(k+ , y) > v(k+ , 0), the worker moves to the poacher and captures a fraction γ
of the gains from trade. Hence, his continuation value is v(k+ , 0) + γ[v(k+ , y) − v(k+ , 0)].
   Similarly, the value function Wk,` (w) is given by
                             n
     Wk,` (w) = w + βE Ŵk+ ,`+ (w)

The above expression is similar to the previous one. Therefore, we shall only point out the
differences between (35) and (34). First, the coworker may exit the labor market or move
into unemployment. In this case, the worker’s continuation value is Ŵk+ ,0 (w). Second,
the coworker may be hired by a poaching firm. In this case, the worker’s continuation
value is also Ŵk+ ,0 (w). Third, when a firm hires a new employee, the continuation value
of the worker depends on whom the firm replaces. If the firm replaces the coworker, the
worker’s continuation value is Ŵk+ ,i (w). If the firm replaces the worker, his continuation
value is Uk+ .


C      Planner’s Problem
The problem of the social planner is

      S(up , ep )
           P                                 P
    = max k [up (k)b(k) + ep (k, 0)f (k, 0) + ` ep (k, `)f (k, `)/2] + βS(up+ , ep+ ),       (36)
          h,r,d


subject to the law of motions (25)-(30). The planner’s choice variables are: hy (k, x) which
is the probability that a firm of type y ∈ Y hires a worker of type k ∈ K in employment
state x ∈ X; ry (k, i) which is the probability that a firm of type y = (i, j) ∈ K × K
replaces the employee i with a worker of type k; dy (i) which is the probability that a firm
of type y = (i, j) fires an employee of type i.
