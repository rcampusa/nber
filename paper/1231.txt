                         Food   Stamps as Money and Income

                                     ABSTRACT


         Food Stamps represent nearly $11 billion of personal income in the
United   States. The coupons that are issued to represent the purchasing power

available to recipients are also reserves for the commercial banking system.

This study asks how closely these coupons are substitutable for what is

usually considered as money, and how well Food Stamps function as a fiscal

stabilizer (whether they increase consumption more than does ordinary

income). The results, based on estimates for 1959—1981, suggest that Food

Stamp coupons are perfectly substitutable for Ml, and a revised money—supply

series including "Food Stamp Money" is included in an Appendix. Estimates of

consumption functions indicate that the MPC out of income in the form of Food

Stamps is higher than that out of ordinary income. Taken together, the

results suggest that the Food Stamp program is an automatic fiscal and

monetary stabilizer——under its provisions, both the money stock and disposable

income are increased during a recession.

I. Introduction



         The Food Stamp program in the United States has grown into one of the

largest noncategorical income maintenance programs run by the Federal

government. In 1982 nearly $11 billion worth of stamps were paid out to

households containing 22 million members. Food Stamps have become the

negative income tax that was never enacted. They are generally available,

offer a minimum guarantee, and are reduced by some fraction (now .82) for each

dollar of additional countable income the household obtains from other

sources.

         Unique among income maintenance programs, Food Stamp benefits are paid

not in the form of checks, cash, or reimbursements to vendors, but rather in

the form of specially printed Stamps that eligible recipients obtain at

certified disbursement outlets near their homes. These stamps in turn are

used to purchase qualifying commodities. (Until 1979 recipients were required

to exchange cash for Food Stamps with a larger face value——the so—called

purchase requirement.) Thus, Food Stamps serve two economic functions: they

provide extra income to (some) consumers, and they also function somewhat

like   money, in that they serve as a medium of exchange for (at the very least)
food transactions. In this study we examine the dual aspects——"moneyness and
incomeness"——of this unusual program.

        This analysis was motivated by the following considerations. First,

despite the use of Food Stamps as a medium of exchange, Food Stamp money

(which is different from Food Stamps issued, as we explain in the next

section) is not included in any of the money series currently published by the

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. To the casual observer this

exclusion is puzzling, because Food Stamps are used as substitutes for
                                      2




currency or coin in cash transactionsJi That Food Stamp money is excluded

from the money stock should be even more startling to professional economists,

for Food Stamps serve not only as a medium of exhange but also as high—powered

or base money. Food Stamps held by banks (deposited by businesses) and Food

Stamps deposited by banks at the Federal Reserve can be used as official

reserves. Hence, Food Stamps are functionally equivalent to currency and coin

for reserve purposes. That makes Food Stamps, de facto, high—powered money.

       Second, Food Stamps have been shown to add little to the amount of food

consumed by recipients (see Clarkson, 1976, and MacDonald, 1977) and to

improve only slightly, if at all, the nutritional value of the food that is

purchased (for example, Whitfield, 1982). This being the case, the income

that is freed up by the receipt of Food Stamps must either be spent on other

commodities or. saved. If the stamps are treated like ordinary income, partly

saved and partly spent, we may infer that the program's sole function is

redistributive—--shifting lifetime income from the average Federal taxpayer to

recipients of the program. On the other hand, if it is treated differently

is allocated completely toward additional spending——we may infer that the

program enables recipients to smoothe their lifetime consumption by

maintaining spending during those periods of below—normal income when they

receive Food Stamps.V If this is the case the program offers consumption—

smoothing as well as income redistribution as its justification. It does not,

according to the evidence, meet its original goal of increasing the amount and

nutritional content of the recipients' food consumption; but it may still help

meet the new goal of consumption maintenance that has gradually devolved onto

II.       Data and Estimation



           The quarterly Food Stamp Money data used in this study were constructed

from monthly data on Food Stamp issuances (FSI) and Food Stamp redemptions

(FSR)..i Monthly Food Stamp redemptions were constructed by interpolating

linearly annual data on Food Stamp destructions.              Given these data on

issuances and redemptions, Food Stamp Money (FSM) in month t is defined as:



 FSM =      S       + .5 FSR                                         (1)
      t         t                t'


where S is the dollar amount of Food Stamps outstanding at the end of month

t, and     FSRt is      the average amount of Food Stamps redeemed (used up) in t (so

that we can assume .5 FSRt is outstanding on average during t). S is defined

as:




 St =S t—l +FSLt ,                                                   (2)


where FSLt is the dollar amount of new issuances in t less the amount of those

new issuances used up that period, i.e.,



 FSL = FSI —           FSR       .
                                                                    (3)
    t     t                  t



The series on FSM for 1959—1981 is shown in Appendix A.

           Food Stamp income, FSY, is the difference between FSI and the purchase

price of the Stamps. (Beginning in 1979 the purchase price was zero.) Thus

we measure Food Stamps as money by our estimate of FSM, and as income by FSY,

the net accretion to personal income provided by this program. Table 1

presents the values of FSM and FSY, along with Ml and disposable income (less

Food Stamps) for the fourth quarters of 1959—81. As the data make clear, the

program's growth In the early i97Os rapidly increased its potential for

affecting the money stock, and thus our ability to track the demand for

money. So too, it implies that, to the extent Food Stamps are received by

people whose marginal propensities to consume out of current income are unity

because of liquidity constraints, one must separate FS? from other income to

specify consumption functions correctly.

       The questIons of interest In this study are the extent of the

"moneyness" and "incomeness" of Food Stamps. To examine the role of Food

Stamps as money, consider a general short—run adjustment equation describing

the demand for money:




 1nMX1nM1+yX+c ,                                                 (4)


where M is a measure of the stock of money, X is a vector of variables,

X and y are parameters to be estimated,       c is an error term, and the subscript

denotes a lag. Without discussing the specific form of the money—demand

equation (the measure of the stock of money or the vector of variables

included in X), we can rewrite (4) to include Food Stamp Money as:



 ln[M+czFSM} = X   ln[M1 + a FSM1] +      +     ,               (4')
                                           6



where a is a measure of the "moneyness" of Food Stamps, 1 > a > 0. The

estimate of a will indicate the extent to which holders of money view the

outstanding stock of Food Stamps as a substitute for what is ordinarily

defined as money. If a = 1, FSM is performing the same functions, in terms

of households' and businesses' demand for money, as N.

            Equation (4') is estimated using data covering 1959:II—1981:IV. The

disturbance term is specified as c =             + u, where u is assumed to be white
                                           pc1
noise. To derive the parameter estimates in (4') the likelihood function

describing the equation (presented in Appendix B) is maximized by searching

the grid of values of a on the closed interval [0,1].

            Consider now how income in the form of Food Stamps affects consumer

spending. Assume that nonrecipients of Food Stamps, 1—F of the population,

have (1—OF) of total disposable permanent income YP—FSY, where 0 is the ratio

of Food Stamp recipients' other income to per—capita disposable income.

Assume, following Hamermesh (1982), that nonrecipients spend according to:



 C =         + a1 [YP — FSY] + a2W,                               (5)
       a0



where YP is real permanent disposable income, W their real wealth, and C their

real consumption. We assume that all wealth in held by nonrecipients, a

reasonable assumption given the asset limitations on eligibility for the

program.

            Define the fraction of recipients who can borrow easily or who have

savings that enable them to smoothe lifetime consumption as 1—          .   The

fraction [1—1F of the population will consume Out of their permanent income
                                           7




(including the Food Stamps that they consider to be part of permanent income)

exactly as the nonrecipients whose behavior is described in (5). They receive

 [1—J0F of YP—FSY, and [1—p] of FSY.

           The remaining fraction of Food Stamp recipients,    ,   has income so low

relative to its permanent income that additional dollars in the form of

ordinary income or Food Stamps enable them to smoothe lifetime consumption by

one dollar for each dollar of additional Food Stamp or other income. Such

people, F of the population, receive FSY of total Food Stamp income

and 0F of [Y—FSY], non—Food Stamp income in the entire economy, and spend all

of it.

           Accounting for the behavior of all three groups—--nonrecipients,

recipients who are capable of smoothing consumption, and those who are not——

aggregate consumption is described by:



 C =
       a    [l—pFJ + a1{[YP—FSY][l—0F} + FSY[1—]F}                 (6)
           + a2W + OF[Y—FSY} + F FSY + 8

where & is an error term appended to the aggregation of spending by the three

categories of income recipients in the economy. Equation (6) is estimated by

nonlinear least squares, also over the period 1959:III—1981:1V, and also under

the assumption that the error term follows a first—order autoregression. No

time series is available on 0; but it is likely, given the eligibility

requirements for Food Stamps, that 0 << 1. Based on survey evidence for

several years, we assume 0 is constant at •3.i The estimate of           from (6)

provides a measure of the fraction of recipients of Food Stamps whose ability

to smoothe consumption spending is enhanced by the receipt of income in the

form of Food Stamps.

III. Estimates of the "Moneyness' of Food Stamp Money



          The test of the "moneyness" of Food Stamp Money is, as described above,

the test of the hypothesis that a in (4') above equals one. The first step is

to specify some explicit functional form for money demand. Unfortunately,

there is no single money demand specification that enjoys a consensus among

economists (.see Hafer and Hem, 1979). Consequently, we present results for

three well—known specifications of the demand for money. These are the

Goldfeld (1976), Friedman (1978), and Hamburger (1977) specifications.

          Formally, we estimate the following money—demand equations for various

values of a over the period 1959:I—1981:IV, and for two subperiods, 1959:1—

1974:1 and 1979:II—1981:IV:

term government bonds.!] Equation (7) is the Goldfeld specification, (8) is

Friedman's and (9) is Hamburger's. In addition to results based on (7)—(9),

estimates using equations like (7)—(9), but with a measure of the yield on

consols (see Amsier, 1984), are also presented.

       The equations were estimated for subperiods for two reasons. First,

Food Stamp Money is relatively unimportant before 1974 (see Table 1). Second,

it is well—known that conventional money—demand functions such as (7)—(9)

exhibit some instability after 1973. Hafer and Hem (1982, p. 11) have argued

that the apparent instability is due to a once—and—for—all—level shift in the

intercept of the money—demand function around 1974:11. To account for this

shift we have included a dummy variable for the period l974:II—198l:IV in the

regression for the whole sample period. As is standard in the money—demand

literature, each equation was estimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt procedure.

The estimates of the bm, ci and d1 are close to those that have appeared

elsewhere.

       Table 2 presents the values of the log—likelihood function for each of

the three money—demand specifications in the different subperiods, for

aO and czl.    The numbers in parentheses are t—statistics testing the null

hypothesis that a=O against the alternative that           Two results stand

out. In all cases except two (the Goldfeld equations for the first subperiod)

the log—likelihood function is larger for a1 than for aO (and in fact

reaches its peak in the interval [0,1] at a1 ).    Also,   the t—statistics

indicate that in some cases one can reject the hypothesis that a0, i.e.,

that the Food Stamp Money is not money, albeit at fairly low confidence

levels. Based on this evidence, it seems reasonable to conclude that Food

Stamp Money is money.

         We have shown that Food Stamp Money acts like Ml, but is not Included

in any current definitions of money, and that Food Stamp Money begins to grow

rapidly around 1974 (see Table 1). Perhaps Food Stamp Money is the "missing

money" economists have been searching for since Goldfeld (1976).&' The

fraction of "missing money" that might be accounted for by Food Stamp Money is

presented in Table 3. Column (2) of Table 3 displays the average annual

amount of (nominal) missing money, defined (as is frequently done) as the

static forecast error of the Goldfeld money—demand equation from 1974 to

1979.!" Column (3) displays the average annual amount

of nominal Food Stamp Money. The last column is the ratio of Food Stamp Money

to missing money. While Food Stamp Money does not account for all the missing

money, it clearly accounts for a sizeable part of it.



IV.    Estimates   of the "Incomeness" of Food Stamps



        Before presenting estimates of (6), the equation that allows us to

infer the fraction of Food Stamp recipients who spend each dollar of Income,

we estimate a simple equation describing consumption:



 C =
       a+a     [Y—FSY] + aW +
                                 a FSY + XC1+   6'.          (10)




Both (6) and (10) are estimated over the entire period and over each of the

subperiods used in the previous section. The estimates of (10) are presented

in the first three columns of Table 4. The parameter estimates other than a

are fairly standard and quite in line with those of previous work examining

aggregate consumption. The estimates of a, measuring the propensity to spend

out of Food Stamps, always exceed the estimates of af, the spending propensity

out of other disposable income. (The difference is significant in the

equation estimated over the entire sample.) This implies that Food Stamp

recipients do behave differently on average from other consumers, for they

spend a greater fraction of their incomes. This finding parallels that of

Hamermesh (1982) on spending Out of unemployment insurance benefits.

       The estimates of (6), presented in the final three columns of Table 4,

are not very satisfactory.12! Though the estimates of the spending

propensities out of income and wealth are sensible, the point estimates of

    the fraction of Food Stamp recipients who spend their entire incomes, are

far above one.1.!.' Constraining the MPC   out   of Food Stamps to be one for some

recipients, given that the estimates of (10) suggest it greatly exceeds one,

produces these strange results.

       The difficulties with the estimates of (6) clearly prevent us from

attaching great confidence to conclusions we draw about the "incomeness" of

Food Stamps. Nonetheless, the estimates of a3, the propensity to spend out of

Food Stamp income (in (10)), and of , the fraction of recipients who spend

all their income (from (6)), imply that this type of transfer income is more

likely to be spent by its recipients than is a dollar of disposable income

that is received by people other than Food Stamp recipients.



V. Conclusion



       The results presented in this paper indicate that Food Stamp Money acts

like Ml and therefore must be included in definitions of money. It should be

noted, however, that Food Stamp Money is not the same as Food Stamps issued.

All stamps issued are not redeemed immediately; consequently, the stock of

outstanding stamps must be carried forward in calculating Food Stamp Money.

One important implication of the "moneyness' of Food Stamps is that, when the
                                          15




amount of Food Stamps issued rises in a recession, the true money stock rises

more rapidly than that published by the Federal Reserve. Thus an automatic

fiscal stabilizer is also an automatic stabilizer of the money supply.

         Income in the   form of Food Stamps is spent   in at least as great a

proportion   as other components of disposable personal income. Other studies
have   demonstrated that Food Stamps are relatively ineffective in meeting their

goal of increasing food consumption, but effective in redistributing income.

Our findings suggest they achieve the additional important result of enabling

recipients, many of whom have temporarily low incomes, to maintain consumption

nearer to their lifetime average consumption. While not an initial goal of

the program, consumption smoothing is an additional argument in the program's

favor in its capacity as a welfare measure. So too, the results indicate

that, to the extent Food Stamp payments increase during a recession, the high

propensity to spend them enables them to function as an effective automatic

fiscal stabilizer of aggregate demand. Food Stamps represent large transfer

payments that vary cyclically and that inherently directly change aggregate

demand through the markets for both goods and money. In a macroeconomic

context the Food Stamp program is both fiscal and monetary policy.1V

          The concentrated log—likelihood function for (4') is:


     £    —N/2   [in (2it)+1] —N/2 in[SSE/N] + lnJ1

where SSE is the sum of squared errors from least—squares estimation of (4')
after the correction for autocorrelation; a has been fixed at a particular
value; N is the number of observations; and

      —
      [M1+aFSM.]*
where * denotes the adjustment for autocorrelation.

    in     = — N ln(l—p) — N £n[M±aFSMI ; the last term Is just the mean   of   the
i
dependent variable in (4').

   There are frequent reports in the popular press of this use. For example,
one official of the Department of Agriculture (which administers the program
on the Federal level) stated (Time, August 23, 1982), "The [Food Stamp]
coupons are a second currency. Anything you can buy with money, from
electronics to houses to sex, you can buy with Food Stamps." The article
continues with reports that Federal agents have used coupons to buy boats,
cars, a gun with a silencer, marijuana and even a $35,000 house.

   Bane and Ellwood (1983) demonstrate the continuing flow of households into
and out of poverty. Since such flows presumably also exist into eligibility
for Food Stamps (which is based partly on income level relative to the poverty
level), it is correct to infer that many recipients' incomes are transitorily
low.

   One senator noted, "I have seen the necessity for [Food Stamps].
Especially in times of severe economic crises, the need is all the greater.
Statement of Patrick Leahy, Hearings of Senate Subcommittee on Agricultural
Research and General Legislation, October 7, 1975, p. 49.

   Monthly issuances of Food Stamps over the period covered in this study were
provided to us by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

   Annual destruction data can be found in the Annual Reports of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

   See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service,
Characteristics of Food Stamp Households, 1975, 1976, 1979 and 1980, for
evidence showing that 80 percent of recipients have other income that places
them below the poverty line. The poverty line is well below half the average
income for equal—sized households.

11 All the data except M1B and the Food Stamp data came from the FMP and
Citibase data banks. Shift—adjusted M1B was taken from Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, "Revised Money Stock Data—March 1982." Data on F
are from Social Security Bulletin, Annual Statistical Supplement, 1981,
p. 78. All the data are available from the authors.

   The term derives from conventional money—demand functions' consistent
overestimatilon of the amount of money (Ml) in circulation since 1974. This
overestimate has been labelled the "missing money."

.2_i The Goldfeld equation used to generate these forecasts is (7), estimated
over the period 1959:11—1974:1.

121 YP is the exponential of the optimal forecast of log Y, estimated as:

                    log    = log   _   + .002820   ,   t   8.33.
                                      20




    Equation (6) was also estimated with lagged consumption included as an
additional independent variable. This modification did not qualitatively
change the results reported in the text. Similarly, allowing G1 lowered ,
but the point estimates still exceeded one.

    Blinder—Solow (1974, p. 4) state, "[A] transaction is pure fiscal policy
if it is financed entirely with taxes, so that the public debt does not
change, or if the debt—financed part of the expenditure does not alter the
proportions of outstanding government obligations (including high—powered
money)." By these criteria Food Stamps clearly are a mixed policy.
