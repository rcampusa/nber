Do Bank Insiders Impede Equity Issuances?

JEL No. G21,G28,G32

                                         ABSTRACT

We evaluate the role of insider ownership in shaping banks' equity issuances in response to the
global financial crisis. We construct a unique dataset on the ownership structure of U.S. banks
and their equity issuances and discover that greater insider ownership leads to less equity
issuances. Several tests are consistent with the view that bank insiders are reluctant to reduce
their private benefits of control by diluting their ownership through equity issuances. Given the
connection between bank equity and lending, the results stress that ownership structure can shape
the resilience of banks--and hence the entire economy--to aggregate shocks.

1. Introduction

        There are strong linkages between bank equity and economic stability. As reviewed by
Thakor (2014), banks with more equity tend to lend more, create more liquidity, and have
higher probabilities of surviving crises. Baron, Verner, and Xiong (2019) show that adverse
shocks to bank equity predict contractions in lending and output, while Berger and Bouwman
(2013) and Jorda et al. (2017) discover that lower bank equity ratios are associated with slower
recoveries following crises.1 Extensive research also stresses that bank equity can foster

stability by mitigating excessive risk-taking by banks and absorbing adverse shocks to bank
assets (e.g., Boot and Greenbaum 1993). These connections between bank equity and the
resilience of the economy to aggregate shocks highlight the value of understanding the factors
that shape the differing degrees to which banks issue new stock to replenish bank equity in
response to crises. The comparative incentives and influence of differing owners are one
potential factor influencing stock sales.
        Research offers conflicting perspectives on the impact of ownership structure on stock
issuances following adverse shocks to bank equity. In the presence of large private benefits of
control, a bank's controlling owners may resist new stock issuances to protect those rents
(Barclay and Holderness 1989; Doidge et al. 2009). From this "dilution reluctance"
perspective, greater insider ownership will reduce stock sales, potentially making the economy
less resilient to aggregate shocks. In contrast, other research suggests that banks with greater
insider ownership can more effectively coordinate the actions of stakeholders with differing
interests during crises, (e.g., Chakraborty and Gantchev 2013), allowing such banks to sell
more stock than banks with less insider ownership. The overall impact of insider ownership on
stock sales in times of crisis, therefore, is an open empirical question.
        In this paper, we evaluate the role of insider ownership in shaping U.S. banks' sale of
stock in response to the 2008 global financial crisis, which adversely bank valuations and put

 Theory explains how reductions in bank equity can reduce lending by increasing the risk premium paid by banks,
reducing banks' ability to collateralize their assets, and hindering banks' ability to commitment to effective
monitoring (e.g., Holmstrom and Tirole 1997; Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist 1999; Gertler and Kiyotaki 2010;
He and Krishnamurthy 2013; Brunnermeier and Sannikov 2014; and Rampini and Viswanathan 2018).



                                                                                                             1
pressure on banks to raise new capital. We compile a unique database on the ownership

structure and equity issuances of private and public banks. We hand-collect annual data on the
ownership of 566 U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs). We define insiders as bank directors
and executives, as reported in banks' regulatory FR Y-6 filings. Furthermore, we compile data
on stock sales by each bank. Using these data, we explore how insider ownership shapes banks'
stock issuances following the onset of the financial crisis.
       There are two distinct periods of bank equity issuances following the collapse of Bear

Stearns, the failure of Lehman Brothers, and the placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
into government conservatorship. First, the U.S. Treasury started the Capital Purchase Program
(CPP) in Q4/2008 that encouraged financial institutions to sell preferred stock to the Treasury.
The program triggered a temporary surge in preferred stock sales in Q4/2008 and Q1/2009.
Second, following Q1/2009, the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) ("stress
test") results encouraged banks to issue common equity and/or make other adjustments to
satisfy capital regulatory requirements (e.g., Bayazitova and Shivdasani 2012). Banks' sales of
common stock increased markedly after Q1/2009. Given our focus on the potential dilution of
control through stock sales, we are most concerned with common stock--and not CPP-induced
preferred stock sales to the Treasury. Thus, we focus on the post-Q1/2009 period while
controlling for bank issuances of preferred and common stock before Q2/2009, but note that
our results are robust to including earlier quarters.
       We employ three empirical tests to assess the relationship between insider ownership
and equity issuances. First, we conduct cross-sectional analyses of common stock sales and
insider ownership during the period from Q2/2009 through Q1/2011. We measure "insider
ownership" as the proportion of the BHC's stock owned by insiders and calculate "common
stock sales" as the total amount of funds raised through common stock sales as a proportion of
bank equity in Q2/2008. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions while controlling for
an array of BHC-specific and geographic fixed effects. Second, to address concerns about the
potential endogeneity of bank ownership, we employ a "shift-share" instrumental variable (IV)
in the spirit of Bartik (1991) and Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift (2018). Third, we
extend these IV analyses and assess whether the relationship between stock sales and insider


                                                                                              2
ownership varies across banks in ways that are consistent with theories emphasizing that

insider's private benefits of control exert a first-order influence on their reluctance to dilute
those control rights through equity issuances.
       From the OLS analyses, we discover that greater insider ownership is associated with
less common stock sales following the onset of the crisis. The estimates suggest an
economically large relationship. For example, consider two otherwise identical banks, where
the "high" insider ownership BHC has one standard deviation greater insider ownership than

the "low" BHC. The estimates suggest that the "high" insider ownership bank would have
common stock sales as a proportion of bank equity that are about 22% greater than "low"
insider ownership bank. These findings are robust to altering the control variables and to using
different samples of banks. The results are consistent with the idea that insiders are reluctant
to dilute control rights by selling common stock.
       We continue to find that more insider ownership is associated with less common stock
sales when using instrumental variables to better identify the impact of insider ownership on
common stock sales. Specifically, we first identify for each BHC a set of peer banks that are
similar in size but active in different areas of the country, and compute the change in the
average level of insider ownership for these peers. To construct a predicted level of insider
ownership for each BHC, we use insider ownership for the BHC in 2003 and multiply it by the
average growth rate in insider ownership among its peer banks from 2003 through 2008. Under
the assumption that a bank's sale of common stock after the release of the stress-test results in
2009 is exogenous to the change in average insider ownership of peer banks prior to 2009, this
"shift-share" IV approach allows us to identify the causal effect of insider ownership on the
sale of common stock. The 2SLS analyses confirm that greater insider ownership reduces
common stock sales and the estimated effects are very similar to the OLS findings.
       We next conduct two tests of whether--and discover that--the relationship between
ownership structure and equity issuances varies across banks in a manner that is consistent
with the "dilution reluctance" view. By testing whether the IV results hold especially strongly
among banks where insiders are likely to be more resistant to losing their private benefits of
control, this improves our identification strategy. First, we examine whether banks that provide


                                                                                               3
greater private benefits to insiders are also banks that are more reluctant to dilute insider control

through equity issuances following the onset of the crisis. To measure the private benefits of
control, we compute (a) the share of loans to bank insiders and (b) the level of bank opacity,
since greater opacity hinders effective governance by non-insiders, offering greater private
benefits of control (e.g., Jiang, Levine and Lin 2016). We then test whether the negative impact
of insider ownership on equity issuances is stronger among banks offering greater benefits of
control. Consistent with this private benefits view, the impact of ownership structure on equity

issuances is larger among banks that offer more private benefits to insiders, i.e., among banks
that lend more to insiders and are less transparent.
        Second, we examine whether inside owners are more reluctant to dilute their control
rights through equity issuances when the expected positive impact of issuances on the banks is
smaller. Specifically, as the expected benefits from selling new shares in the form of increased
bank stability and market valuations falls, insiders will become increasingly reluctant to issue
stock and sacrifice private benefits of control. According to this perspective, the inside owners
of banks that are harder hit by shocks and hence less likely to benefit from equity injections
will be more reluctant to sell stock. We use two measures of the degree to which each BHC is
adversely affected by the financial crisis. Similar to Bord, Ivashina and Taliaferro (2018), we
use information on BHCs' branch networks and determine BHCs' exposure to declines in
housing prices during the financial crisis. The second measure uses information on BHCs'
investment in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), as the crisis induced market participants to
view these assets as "toxic" and value them accordingly. We compute each bank's holdings of
MBS to gauge its exposure to the adverse shock to the value of these assets.
        We again find evidence consistent with the dilution reluctance view: bank insiders are
reluctant to reduce their private benefits of control by issuing equity, especially when the
positive effects of stock sales are likely to have smaller positive effects on bank valuations. We
find that the negative impact of insider ownership on stock sales is stronger among banks more
adversely effected by the financial crisis.
        Our paper builds on existing empirical evidence on bank ownership structure. For
instance, Saunders, Strock, and Travlos (1990) find that shareholder-controlled banks take


                                                                                                   4
more risks than those controlled by managers, who enjoy large private benefits from the

survival of the bank. Research also shows that bank risk is generally higher in banks with more
concentrated ownership, consistent with theories predicting that owners with substantial cash
flow rights induce banks to increase risk taking (e.g., Laeven and Levine 2009; and Beltratti
and Stulz 2012). Focusing on the global financial crisis, Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2011) find that
banks with larger managerial ownership, if anything, performed worse during the global
financial crisis. We contribute to this literature by analyzing the sale of bank stock following

the onset of the crisis, and linking differences in those to sales to differences in the ownership
structures of banks.
        Our paper complements the examination of European banks by Lepetit, Saghi-Zedek,
and Tarazi (2015). They show that following the global financial crisis, European banks were
more likely to reduce lending rather than raise new equity when (a) the bank's ultimate owner
in a pyramid has control rights that materially exceed cash-flow rights and (b) the bank operates
in a country with weak shareholder protection laws. Our work differs in several ways. First,
rather than examining differences between control and cash-flow rights, we focus on the
influence of inside owners on stock sales. This focus on insiders both complements the study
of European ownership pyramids and is more relevant for U.S. banks, where differences
between control and cash flow rights are less central (e.g., Caprio, Laeven, and Levine 2007).
Second, we focus on issuances of common equity, which is crucial for understanding the role
of the private benefits of control in shaping stock sales following the onset of the global
financial crisis.
        Our paper also relates to recent research by Baron and Xiong (2017), Baron, Verner,
and Xiong (2019), and Baron (2020). This work examines the countercyclical equity issuance
puzzle: banks raise less common equity during credit expansions and raise comparatively more
equity in economic downturns. For example, Baron (2020) presents a model and evidence
consistent with the view that government guarantees to bank creditors help account for why
banks resist equity issuances during economic booms. While also examining the equity
issuance decisions of banks, we focus on testing whether and how ownership structure helps
account for the different equity issuance decisions of banks following a major crisis.


                                                                                                5
       Furthermore, our research contributes to a large corporate finance literature on the

private benefits of control (e.g., Jensen 1986; Jensen and Meckling 1986; and Dyck and
Zingales 2004). Theory provides conflicting views regarding the willingness and ability of
inside owners to have their firms raise funds through equity issuances. As emphasized above,
corporate insiders may be reluctant to dilute their ownership stake and private benefits (Barclay
and Holderness 1989; Doidge et al. 2009). On the other hand, insider control can facilitate the
ability of owners to coordinate to raise equity in times of duress (Chakraborty and Gantchev

2013). This literature, however, primarily focuses on non-financial firms, and stock-exchange
listed firms for which data on insider shareholdings is publicly available. We contribute to this
literature by analyzing public and private firms. This is possible because the FR-Y6 regulatory
filings are available for both publicly listed and privately-owned banks. This offers a unique
setting to study the effects of different ownership structures on equity issuance decisions within
publicly-listed and privately-owned firms, which is the more typical ownership type in the
United States and worldwide.
       Finally, our study speaks to recent policy reforms to bank regulations that have
increasingly emphasized the quality of bank capital not just its quantity (e.g., Hoshi and
Kashyap 2010 and Jiménez et al. 2017). For example, Basel III introduced a minimum common
equity requirement with the goal of ensuring that banks not have a sufficient quantity of capital
also have sufficient amount of the most efficient and effective loss-absorbing liability: common
equity. These regulatory changes, however, have not yet considered ownership structure. Our
work stresses the importance of ownership structure, finding that ownership structure shapes
common equity issuances in response to a crisis and hence affects a bank's resilience to adverse
shocks. This highlights the value of considering ownership structure when designing bank
regulations and assessing banks' abilities to absorb losses and cushion the impact of losses on
the economy.

2. Bank Ownership and Stock Sales: Data and Patterns
          We assemble a unique dataset on bank ownership and combine those data with
information on the issuance of bank stock and other bank traits. We examine domestically-
owned bank holding companies that are organized as stock corporations. Our sample consists
of 566 BHCs with non-missing information on ownership and stock sales.

2.1 Bank ownership

          We assemble a new database on bank ownership from BHCs' regulatory filings (FR Y-
6) for public and private U.S. BHCs. U.S. law requires BHCs to file FR Y-6 reports with
information on the identity and percentage ownership stakes of principal shareholders,
directors and executive officers. We go through each of the FR Y-6 reports compiled by SNL
Financial and manually construct a database on the percentage of each BHC owned by directors
and executives over the period from 2003 through 2008, data permitting.2 We exclude (a)
BHCs with missing data on the sale of common stock or ownership, (b) BHCs owned by a
foreign entity, and (c) BHCs that are not organized as a stock corporation. This yields a sample
of 566. This sample includes public and private banks, which is unusual in corporate finance
given the challenges of collecting such data for large samples of private firms (e.g., Helwege,
Pirinsky, and Stulz 2007; Fahlenbrach and Stulz 2009).
          Insider Ownership equals the percentage of common stock owned by bank insiders,
i.e., directors and executives. For most of the analyses, we measure ownership in 2008, but the
results are robust, as shown in the Appendix, to using Insider Ownership in 2003, as ownership
structure changes little over time.

  The FR Y-6 filings sometimes provide imprecise information ownership by an insider when the holdings are small, e.g.,
indicating that a person owns "less than 0.1% of shares." We used a variety of approaches for addressing this, including setting
such ownership shares to zero or setting aggregate insider ownership shares equal to zero if the summation across all insiders
was less than five percent of total shares. We report the results using this 5% cutoff as our focus is on assessing whether
insiders make decisions about stock sales based on their private benefits of control and many studies use such a cutoff. The
results reported below, however, are robust to using alternative methods.




                                                                                                                              7
2.2 Sales of bank stock

            We collect information on the sale of common (item bhck3579) and preferred stock
(item bhck3577) by U.S. BHCs from regulatory filings FR Y-9C. For most of our analyses, we
focus on sales of common stock over the period from Q2/2009 through Q1/2011. Specifically,
Sale of Common Stock equals the total amount of funds raised by the sale of common stock
over the Q2/2009-Q1/2011 period divided by bank equity capital in Q2/2008, where bank
equity capital is total BHC equity reported in FR Y-9C filings (item bhck3210).3 We winsorize

Sale of Common Stock at the top 1 percentile. In some analyses, we examine a longer time
period and compute the Cumulative Sale of Common Stock at the quarterly frequency starting
in Q2/2007, scaled by bank equity in Q1/2007. We use analogous definitions for cumulative
preferred stock sales and total stock sales.
            As noted in the Introduction, we focus--though not exclusively--on the sale of
common stock from Q2/2009 through Q1/2011 for two reasons. First, we are concerned with
the control rights, and hence the voting rights, of insiders, which naturally focuses our attention
on common stock. Second, we do not want to focus on CPP-induced stock sales to the U.S.
Treasury in Q4/2008 and Q1/2009. As a result, the bulk of our analyses cover the post-Q1/2009
period while controlling for bank issuances of preferred and common stock before Q2/2009.
The results, however, hold, if we also include the Q4/2008 - Q1/2009 period.

2.3 BHC-specific control variables
            We condition on an array of BHC-specific control variables. We obtain other balance
sheet information on BHCs from regulatory FR Y-9C ("Call Report") filings. We compute
these bank characteristics in Q2/2008, which was immediately after the failure of Bear Stearns
and before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of 2008. Thus, we view them as pre-
determined with respect to the onset of the crisis.
            The baseline set of BHC-specific control variables are as follows, where all are
measured in Q2/2008. Equity Capital / RWA equals the ratio of bank equity capital to risk
weighted assets (RWA). ln(Risk Weighted Assets) is the natural logarithm of risk weighted
                           
3
    All of the results hold when scaling by Tier 1 Capital rather than by total BHC equity.




                                                                                                 8
assets. Deposits / Assets is the ratio of deposits to total assets. Loans/Assets is the ratio of loans

to total assets. Other Earning Assets / Assets is the share of other earning assets in total assets.
Income Diversity is defined as one minus the absolute value of (Interest income - Noninterest
income), divided by total operating income. Noninterest income / Operating income is the ratio
of noninterest income to operating income. Dividends / Net Income is the ratio of dividends to
net income. Net Income / Equity Capital is the ratio of net income to bank equity. We winsorize
these control variables at the bottom and top 1 percentile. Finally, the baseline set of control

variables also includes a dummy variable that equals one if the BHC received TARP support
(=1 if BHC received TARP).

2.4. Descriptive statistics and patterns
        Table 1 reports descriptive statistics. On average, insiders held about 33% of a BHC's
common stock in 2008. There is substantial heterogeneity, as the standard deviation is 31%.
Indeed, 13 BHCs (= 2.3% of our sample) report that insiders do not hold any ownership in the
BHCs, while 23 BHCs (4% of our sample) are fully owned by bank insiders. While insiders
hold less than 7.5% of all shares for a quarter of all BHCs (bottom quartile), a quarter of all
BHCs report that insider hold at least 54%. Sale of Common Stock over the Q2/2009 ­ Q1/2011
averaged about 7% with substantial cross-bank differences as the standard deviation is 17%.
The average ratio of bank equity to risk-weighted assets (Equity Capital/RWA) in Q2/2008 was
11.4%, suggesting that the average BHC was well capitalized as the crisis began.

        2.4.1 Insider Ownership
        Ownership structure is stable over time. Figure 1 displays the boxplot of insider
ownership for each year (Panel A). The interquartile range is quite stable over time indicating
that the distribution of insider ownership remains similar, though there is a slight decrease over
time, with median insider ownership of 28% in in 2003 and 24% in 2008. Panel B explores this
more where we plot the insider ownership of a BHC in 2008 against its insider ownership in
2003. The linear fit is represented by the dashed line, indicating a strong and positive
correlation between the insider ownership in 2008 and 2003. The coefficient estimate of a




                                                                                                    9
regression of insider ownership in 2008 on insider ownership in 2003 is 0.92 and statistically

significant at the 1% level.

       2.4.2 Sale of Stock
       Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative sales of common and preferred stock from Q2/2007
through Q1/2011. The sale of preferred stock surged in Q4/2008 and Q1/2009, as banks were
encouraged to sell preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury as part of the CPP. After that, there
were exceedingly small amounts of preferred stock sales. In contrast, sales of common stock

rise throughout the period, with issuances accelerating after Q2/2009.
       Figure 3 documents the negative relationship between Sale of Common Stock from
Q2/2009 to Q1/2011 and Insider Ownership. Specifically, we first group BHCs into decile
bins based on Insider Ownership, so that the first bin contains BHCs in the lowest Insider
Ownership decile and the tenth bin contains all BHCs in the highest decile of Insider
Ownership. For each bin, we then compute the average Sale of Common Stock across BHCs in
the bin and the average Insider Ownership. We plot these observations in Figure 2, illustrating
the negative correlation between Sale of Common Stock and Insider Ownership.
       Figure 4 documents the evolution of common stock sales from Q2/2007 through
Q1/2011 while differentiating banks by the degree of insider ownership. To construct the
figure, we first estimate the following regression using quarterly information at the BHC-level,
from Q2/2007 through Q1/2011:

!"#"$%&'()+%$),-!,##,.+&,/0!,# = $%
                                 #&$(4$,# 5# + 4',# 7'8:.;'<)=!  5# ) + @!,# ,(2)


where!"#"$%&'()+%$),-!,##,.+&,/0!,# is the cumulative sale of common stock by

BHC i from Q2/2007 through quarter t, scaled by bank equity capital in Q1/2007,
7'8:.;'<)=! equals one if BHC i has above the median Insider Ownership and zero
otherwise, and 5# is a dummy variable that equals one in quarter t, and otherwise equals zero.
Thus, the vector, D, simply represents time-fixed effects for the 16 quarters from Q2/2007
                               B 1,t represents the estimated average Cumulative Sale of
through Q1/2011. Consequently, 4
                               B 2,t is the estimated difference between this estimate for the
Common Stock in quarter t, and 4



                                                                                             10
average BHC and BHCs with above the median values of Insider Ownership. Figure 3 plots
B 2,t for each quarter as well as the 99% confidence interval after standardizing 4
4                                                                                 B 2,t, so that they

represent the change in cumulative common stock sales for a one standard deviation increase
in insider ownership.
        As shown, there is a notable and statistically significant divergence in Cumulative Sale
of Common Stock for BHCs with above the median levels of Insider Ownership relative to the
average BHC in the sample after Q1/2009. Although the high-insider ownership BHCs tend to

sell less common stock than other BHCs throughout the sample period and the estimated gap
in common stock sales between high- and low-insider ownership BHCs starts to widen in
2008, the estimated difference does not become statistically significant until Q2/2009, which
is after the CPP-induced sales of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury. Taken together, Figures
1-3 offer patterns that are consistent with the view that banks with greater insider ownership
sell less common stock following the onset of the crisis. To control of other factors, improve
identification, and provide direct evidence on the view that bank insiders are reluctant to have
their banks sell common equity and dilute their control over their banks because it would
reduce the ability of those insiders to extract private rents, we now turn to OLS, IV, and split
sample analyses.


3. Ownership and the Sale of Common Stock
3.1 Econometric model: OLS
        We evaluate the relationship between the sale of common stock and ownership
structure over the period using the following cross-section regression in an approach similar to
Beltratti and Stulz (2012) and Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2011):

            +%$),-!,##,.+&,/0 = C + 4:.;'<)=DE.)=;'F + G ( H + I + @,                            (1)

where G ( is composed of BHC-specific traits, and I is a set of Federal Reserve District fixed
effects. We include these fixed effects to account for potential unobservable heterogeneity in
bank supervision and regulation across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts. We classify a
BHC as belonging to a particular district based on the location of its headquarters. We


                                                                                                  11
                                        B and H
standardize the estimated coefficients, 4     J , to facilitate interpretation of the estimated

magnitudes. Specifically, the standardized coefficients indicate the estimated number of
standard deviation changes in the dependent variable associated with a one standard deviation
change in the explanatory variable.
       Table 2 reports regression results using different controls. Column (1) conditions on
the baseline set of BHC-specific control variables defined in Section 2.3. To these baseline
controls, column (2) adds the change in risk-weighted-assets (Change in RWA) from Q2/2009

through Q1/2011. Since banks may sell stock or reduce RWA to meet regulatory capital
requirements, we control for the change in risk-weighted assets over this period to assess the
independent connection between insider ownership and stock sales. To the baseline controls,
column (3) adds the change in the ratio of bank equity to risk-weighted assets (Change in
Equity/RWA) from Q2/2008 through Q1/2009. We include Change in Equity/RWA to address
the possibility that the relationship between ownership and equity issuances after Q1/2009
depends on stock sales--including regulatory-induced stock sales--during the initial months
of the crisis. Finally, column (4) includes all control variables simultaneously.

3.2 Results: OLS
       As shown in Table 2, BHCs sell less stock when insiders own a larger proportion of the
BHC. The results are robust: Insider Ownership enters negatively and significantly at the one-
percent level in all four specifications; and the estimated coefficient Insider Ownership hardly
changes when using different control variables. Furthermore, the estimated relationship is
economically meaningful. For example, the estimates indicate that BHCs with one standard
deviation greater Insider Ownership tend to sell about 9% less of a standard deviation common
stock than otherwise similar BHCs following the 2009 stress-tests. To put this in dollar terms,
consider both a BHC with "high" insider ownership, which we will define as 0.5 standard
deviations above the sample mean level of insider ownership, and an otherwise similar BHC
with "low" insider ownership, which we will similarly define as having 0.5 standard deviations
less insider ownership than the sample mean. The estimated coefficient on Insider Ownership
indicates that in the high insider ownership bank, sales of common stock as a proportion of



                                                                                             12
total bank equity will be 1.5% lower in the high insider ownership BHC relative to the low

insider ownership bank (1.5=16.71*0.089. ). This is large since average common equity sales
were 7% of bank equity.
       Focusing on the non-ownership control variables, we note the following. First, the
results in Table 2 are robust to controlling for the large array of BHC-specific features,
including Equity Capital / RWA, ln(Risk Weighted Assets), Deposits / Assets, Loans/Assets,
Other Earning Assets / Assets, Income Diversity, Noninterest income / Operating income,

Dividends / Net Income, Net Income / Equity Capital, and =1 if BHC received TARP), which
helps in mitigating omitted variable bias concerns. Second, the correlation between Insider
Ownership and Equity Capital / RWA is both low (-0.048) and insignificant, suggesting that
the degree of insider ownership is not a proxy for bank capitalization. Third, larger banks--as
measured by Ln(RWA)--sell more common stock as a fraction of bank equity. This is not
surprising since larger banks tend to face few barriers to conducting seasoned equity offerings
and following the stress-test results, larger banks faced stronger regulatory pressures to issue
new common stock. Fourth, the Change in RWA (from Q2/2009 through Q1/2011) enters
positively and significantly: banks that expanded after the crisis also issued more common
stock during that period.

3.3 Estimation strategy: Instrumental variables (IV) based on a shift-shares approach
       Although the OLS regression results show a negative and statistically significant
relationship between the share of bank equity owned by insiders and the sale of common stock,
omitted variables could account for these findings. For example, unobservable differences in
the ability of inside and outside investors to monitor bank managers could explain both the
degree of insider ownership and the BHC's access to equity markets and hence common stock
sales following 2008.
       To better identify the impact of ownership structure on BHC sales of common stock,
we construct a Bartik-type shift-share instrumental variable for Insider Ownership. Bartik
(1991) developed an approach to capture the exogenous component of local employment
growth. He interacted pre-determined local industry employment shares with national industry



                                                                                             13
employment growth rates. Under the assumption that these national growth rates are exogenous

to local industries, this interaction term can plausibly serve as an instrumental variable for local
employment growth (Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift, 2018).
       Following this approach, we start by identifying 30 peer-banks for each bank b. The
peer banks (a) have no overlap in their branch network with bank b (Levine, Lin and Wang,
2017) and (b) are similar to bank b with respect to total assets. We then compute this peer
group's average growth rate in Insider Ownership between 2003 and 2008. Finally, to construct

a bank-specific instrument for bank b, we multiply b's value of Insider Ownership in 2003 by
the average growth rate of b's peer banks' Insider Ownership between 2003 and 2008. This
"shift-share" instrumental variable then captures for each bank b its "predicted" level of insider
ownership. Under the assumption that stock sales by bank b from Q2/2009 through Q1/2011
is not otherwise related to changes in the insider ownership of the bank's peers from 2003
through 2008, this instrumental variable is a valid instrument for insider ownership for bank b.
We call this Bartik-type instrument, Predicted Insider Ownership.
       In Table 3, we present the IV results in Panel A, the first-stage findings in Panel B, and
the reduced form results in Panel C. For each panel, we provide the estimates using the same
four sets of control variables from Table 2.

3.4 Results: IV
       As shown, the IV results confirm the OLS findings: BHCs with more insider ownership
sell less stock during the Q2/2009 to Q1/2011 period than other banks. Insider Ownership
enters negatively and significantly across all four specifications. Moreover, the IV coefficients
are similar to the OLS estimates from Table 2. The first stage regression results show that there
is a positive and statistically significant link between the predicted level of bank b's insider
ownership share (Predicted Insider Ownership) and the bank's actual degree of insider
ownership share (Insider Ownership). The reduced form regression results also indicate that
the instrumental variable, Predicted Insider Ownership, is strongly negatively associated with
the sale of common stock by banks.




                                                                                                 14
       By instrumenting for insider ownership, we ameliorate concerns that some third factor

is shaping both insider ownership and stock sales. Our findings on stock sales are consistent
with the idea that inside owners are reluctant to issue equity and dilute their ownership stakes
in order to preserve their private benefits of control. We now differentiate among banks to test
more directly whether such "dilution reluctance" drives the relationship between stock sales
and insider ownership.

3.5 Dilution reluctance

        We next test whether the relationship between insider ownership and stock sales varies
across banks in a manner that is consistent with the view that bank insiders are reluctant to
reduce their private benefits of control by issuing equity. In particular, we differentiate banks
by the degree to which insiders enjoy private benefits of control. We then test whether the
negative relationship between insider ownership and stock sales is stronger among high
private-benefit banks. These tests provide additional information on the mechanisms linking
ownership structure and stock sales, which also improves identification.
       To differentiate banks, we use two measures of the private benefits of control. The first
measure--insider lending--gauges the degree to which banks extend credit to bank insiders
i.e. executive officers, directors, principal shareholders etc. This information is provided for
all commercial banks, and we aggregate this information at the BHC level and calculate the
share of insider loans in a BHC's loan portfolio in the first quarter of 2009. On average, about
1.7 percent of a BHC's total loan amount in our sample consists of loans to bank insiders. We
split the sample based on the median share of insider loans and consider BHCs that have an
above median level of insider lending ("High" insider lending) to offer more private benefits
to inside owners than other banks (i.e., "Low" insider lending banks).
       The second indicator of the private benefits of control--bank opacity--measures the
degree to which bank insiders have the latitude to exploit their control of the bank to extract
private benefits. To measure bank opacity, a large literature, reviewed by Dechow, Ge and
Schrand (2010), compares banks' observed loan loss provisions with predicted loan loss
provisions obtained from a statistical model. These "abnormal" accruals of loan loss provisions



                                                                                              15
are indicative of greater bank opacity as they reflect greater earnings management by bank

managers. Following Jiang, Levine and Lin (2016), we construct abnormal loan loss provision
accruals and split the sample into high and low opacity banks by whether they have "abnormal"
accruals above or below the sample median. We split the sample of banks into those with above
the median levels of abnormal loan loss provision accruals--"High" opacity BHCs--and those
with below the median levels--"Low" opacity BHCs.
       As shown in Table 4, we find evidence consistent with the dilution reluctance view:

bank insiders were more reluctant to have their banks sell stock during the crisis when the
private benefits of controlling a bank were larger. That is, the negative impact of insider
ownership on stock sales is larger among banks that offer more private benefits of control to
insiders. In Panel A of Table 4, we split the sample by "Low" and "High" insider lending
banks, and split the sample by "Low" and "High opacity banks in Panel B. We again present
the results using different combinations of control variables. Across the different splits, we find
that in banks that offer greater private benefits to insiders--High insider lending and High
opacity banks, the degree of insider ownership is more negatively associated with stock sales.
That is, when the private benefits of control are higher, banks are more reluctant to dilute those
control benefits through equity issuances.

3.6 Adverse Shock to Equity
       We next test whether the impact of insider ownership on stock sales by banks is larger
among banks hit harder by the financial crisis. We conduct this test to shed additional empirical
light on the importance of the private benefits of control in shaping bank issuances of stock. In
particular, we take that perspective that there are costs and benefits to insiders from having the
bank sell stock following the onset of the crisis. One potential benefit to insider owners is that
common stock sales augment the bank's capital cushion, increase the viability of the bank, and
boost the value of insiders' shares. One potential cost to insiders is that such stock sales reduce
their control over the bank and the private benefits that they can extract. When adverse shocks
materially reduce the likelihood that common stock sales will boost the value of bank shares,
then inside owners will become more focused on preventing equity issuances that will dilute



                                                                                                16
their control and hence reduce their abilities to extract private benefits. From this perspective,

banks in which insiders hold larger proportions of equity will become more intensely focused
on resisting equity issuances when their banks are hit with large, adverse shocks.
       To conduct this test, we use two measures of the degree to which banks were adversely
hit by the financial crisis. First, following Bord, Ivashina and Taliaferro (2018), we use
information on BHCs branch networks and determine BHCs' exposure to declines in housing
prices. To do this, we combine information on the location of bank branches with data on

changes in house prices in each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) between Q2/2007 and
Q4/2008. This yields information on the exposure of each BHC, through its branch network,
to declines in housing prices. About a third of all BHCs do not report branches in MSAs that
experience a local downturn during the financial crisis. The other two thirds of BHCs have
branches in areas that experience house price declines. We separately examine each of these
two types of banks.
       The second measure of the degree to which banks were adversely affected by the crisis
focuses on their investment in mortgage backed securities (MBS). The expansion of the U.S.
mortgage market and the ability to securitize mortgages and sell them in financial markets led
to a reduction in lending standards and thus MBS (Keys et al., 2010). Capital regulation,
however, considered MBS less risky, incentivizing banks to invest in them. Concerns regarding
the quality of mortgage-backed securities intensified after the collapse of Bear Stearns due to
the bank's heavy investment in these securities, deeming these assets toxic. We split banks by
whether they have above the median exposure to MBS as share of their total assets in Q1/2009
and call them "High" MBS exposure banks, and banks with below the median exposure, e.g.,
"Low" MBS exposure banks.
       Consistent with the view that insiders value their private benefits of control of banks
and are therefore reluctant to sell stock even during a major financial crisis, we find that the
impact of insider ownership on stock sales is more negative among banks hit hardest by the
crisis. In Panel C of Table 4, we report regression results where we split banks by whether they
are present in areas that experience a reduction in house prices during the financial crisis or
whether the banks were not active in those areas. In Panel D of Table 4, we report results where


                                                                                               17
we split banks depending on their exposure to MBS. We find that insider ownership leads to a

reduction in banks' sale of common stock, especially among banks that (a) are active in areas
that experience a reduction in local house prices and (b) depended more on MBS when the
mortgage crisis hit. These findings indicate that when adverse shocks reduce the expected value
of banks' equity, bank insiders become focused on extracting private benefits from the bank,
so that insiders with larger shares of equity more effectively resist bank equity sales.



4. Conclusions
         In this paper, we construct a unique dataset on the ownership structure of banks to
examine the impact of insider ownership on equity issuances. Consistent with the view that
inside owners are reluctant to lose their private benefits of control by diluting that control
through equity issuances, we find that the share of insider ownership is negatively associated
with equity issuances after the onset of the financial crisis. This suggests that the private
benefits of control--and hence the ownership structure of banks--shaped how U.S. BHCs
responded to the global financial crisis. Our results highlight an important channel through
which ownership structure affects capital buffers and hence the resilience and stability of
banks.

        This table reports results from 2SLS regression at the BHC-level for different subsamples. The dependent variable in columns is the total sale of common stock over the quarters Q2/2009 to Q1/2011, scaled by equity capital in Q2/2008. All
       regression models include control variables as indicated. The analysis in Panel A splits the sample between banks with high/low insider lending. The analysis in Panel B splits the sample between banks with a high, i.e. above sample median,
     level of loan opacity. The analysis in Panel C splits the sample between banks with branches in areas that experienced a drop in house prices during the Financial Crisis. The analysis in Panel D splits the sample between banks with a low/high,
   i.e. above sample median, share of MBS investment. Coefficients are standardized and represent economic magnitudes, i.e. the change in the dependent variable's standard deviation by a one standard deviation change in the independent variable.
                                                    Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and reported in parentheses below. *, **, *** mean significance at ten, five, and one percent, respectively.

   The figure plots the total sale of common stock over the quarters Q2/2009 to Q1/2011, scaled by equity capital in Q2/2008. We group BHCs into ten decile
   bins depending on their level of insider ownership and compute the average total sale of common stock for each bin. Dots represent the average total sale of
                                            common stock for BHCs in each bin.The dotted line represent the linear fit.

         Figure 4: Differential effect on cumulative sale of common stock by insider ownership

   The figure plots the differential effect of insider ownership on the cumulative sale of common stock over the quarters Q2/2007 to Q1/2011. The coefficients
     are obtained from a regression of the cumulative sale of common stock in a quarter, scaled by Equity Capital in Q1/2007 on a set of quarter fixed effects
   and the interaction of these quarter fixed effects with an indicator variable, taking on the value of one if insider share is above the sample median. The figure
         plots the coefficient on these interaction terms for all quarters as well as the 99 % confidence interval for each estimate where standard errors are
                                                                        heteroskedasticity robust.

   This table reports results from an OLS regression at the BHC-level. Coefficients are standardized and represent economic magnitudes, i.e. the change in the
