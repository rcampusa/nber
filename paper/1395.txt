                 Major Changes in Cyclical Behavior
                                ABSTRACT

    Various structural, institutional, and policy changes have contributed to

the evolution of business cycles, since World War II business expansions have

been much longer and contractions much shorter than before. Over nearly 200

years of u.s. history expansions have been long relative to contractions when

prices had upward secular trends, and shorter when price trends were down. The

rising price trend since the 1930's fits this pattern, although we find no

association between the rate of inflation during each business cycle and the

relative duration of the phases. Shifts in the industrial composition of

employment, in labor—force participation, and in the distribution of personal

income have all contributed to the post—1945 moderation of cyclical

amplitudes. The variability of economic change was low by historical standards

in both 1948—69 and 1969—81, although the inflation rate was much higher and

real growth on the average lower after 1969. The recent long—term inflation is

attributable mainly to the new persistence of upward price movements in

business cycle contractions rather than to more rapid price increases during

expansions. But prices have always been sensitive to the degree of severity of

business contractions, and they still are. The same is true of short—term

interest rates, although they became more sensitive during 1949—82 than

before. Despite the deep changes in the economy, many basic characteristics of

the business cycle remain unchanged, notably the timing relationships among

groups of leading and lagging indicators.

     In   the long stretch of time covered by business cycles, the economies of

the industrialized world underwent many profound changes of structure, insti-

tutions, and modes of operation. Business cycles continued to have much in

common as the most durable and pervasive form of short—term motion of these

economies, but they also changed significantly. This study seeks to identify

and analyze some of these changes. We concentrate on the longer and relatively

well-established developments in the United States.

     Sections I and II review some historical facts and hypotheses concerned

with types of change in cyclical behavior. Next we take a long—run view of the

durations of cyclical phases, note the shifts in the relative length of expan-

sions and contractions (III), and relate them to changing trends in prices (Iv).

Section V examines the amplitudes of cyclical movements in production and

employment during the last hundred years. There follows an analysis of

structural shifts in employment and their cyclical effects (VI); trends and

cyclical changes in unemployment and labor—force participation (VII); and the

consequences for the business cycles of the altered composition of personal

income, reflecting the expansion of government, transfer payments, etc. (VIII).

  discussion of the relationship between growth and variability of economic

change (Ix) completes this part of our report.

     The remaining sections deal with changes in particular categories of cycli-

cal indicators. Of particular interest here is the behavior of wholesale or

producer prices CX) and interest rates (XI). Also, we examine the consistency

of timing of the leading, coincident, and lagging indicators over as long a time

period as the data allow (XII). Finally, we present our conclusions and

suggestions for further research.

        I. Business Cycles and Growth: Background and Some Hypotheses

     Business cycles defined as recurrent sequences of persistent and, pervasive

expansions and contractions in economic activities are at least as old as the

modern industrialization and growth processes in the principal capitalist

countries. The earliest evidence of their presence, from British and U. S.

business annals and statistics, reach back into the eighteenth century.

     The impressively high long—term growth rates of the era are well documented

by the series of decade averages that reveal upward trends in employment,

output, capital, productivity, and per capita consumption (see., e.g., Kuznets,

1971; U. S. Department of Commerce, 1973). However, over shorter periods,

growth of the major private—enterprise economies was very uneven. Each decade

witnessed at least one contraction of aggregate economic activity in each coun—

try, but more typically two and sometimes three. This refers to all countries

covered by the business annals ('rhorp, 1926) and the NBER business cycle chrono—

logies (Burns and Mitchell, 1946).1 Most of these setbacks were mild but some

were serious. A contraction was always followed by an expansion, which as a

rule would consist of a recovery to the highest levels previously attained and a

phase of net growth ending in a new record high ("peak") of activity, only on a

few occasions did a peak fail to exceed the preceding peak. Similarly,

successive troughs usually reached higher levels, except when a particularly

weak recovery or deep depression occurred. Thus overall growth was achieved

through expansionary spurts punctuated every few years by mild but generalized

slowdowns or recessions and at longer irregular intervals by major depressions.

     During this epoch, the economies, societies, and political systems involved

changed profoundly in many respects. There is substantial agreement among those

who studied the subject intensively that business cycles are "a product of

culture . .   . found   only in modern nations where economic activities are
                                           —3—



 organized mainly through business enterprises and where individuals enjoy

 considerable freedom in producing, pricing, trading, and saving or investing"

 (Burns, 1968, p. 228).2 It is therefore plausible to look for important changes

 in business cycles as a result of the changes in the structure of production,

markets, institutions, and policies.

      It is also possible to argue that the influence runs partly in the opposite

direction and to see in the development of business cycles a major instrument

for changes in the economy and society. Marx predicted a trend toward intensi-

fication of crises as capital—labor ratios increase, workers are displaced and

pauperized, and profit rates fall, but his predictions were belied by the spread

of prosperity and the capacity of capitalism and democracy first to survive and

then to avoid severe depressions and bouts of high unemployment. Keynes worried

about whether investment will absorb saving at full employment in countries

growing in wealth, where capital accumulation lowers the return to investors.

Hansen moved further, expecting weaker booms and deeper slumps to result from

reduced opportunities for investment and increased propensity to save in "mature

economies" with slower population growth. History dealt as harshly with these

new "secular stagnation" hypotheses as it did with the earlier ones.3 Yet they

are revived in various forms whenever sluggish business conditions prevail for

some time, as in the recent period of so—called stagflation.

     Conversely, in times of substantial stability and growth such as the mid—

1920s and 1960s in the   United   States, the idea tends to gain ground that busi—

ness cycles are becoming "obsolete" or are being "ironed out" by better public

and business policies. In 1921—29, the Federal Reserve System "took——and

perhaps even more was given——credit for the generally stable conditions that

prevailed, and high hopes were placed in the potency of monetary policy as then

administered"   (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963, p. 240). In the mid—1960s, many
                                      —4—




economists believed that the new use of discretionary fiscal policy was on its

way to "dethroning the cyclical model" (Heller, 1966; see also R. A. Gordon,

1969, pp. 26—29).

                            II. Three Types of Change

     It is useful to distinguish three types of change in the cyclical behavior

of the market—oriented economies:

        1. long—term or secular trends;

        2. discontinuous or episodic changes; and

        3. cyclical chanqes.

The hypotheses noted in section I envisage a gradual intensification or a

gradual moderation of business cycles, and hence concern the first type. These

are presumably irreversible changes or trends that can be projected.

     The second type are temporary changes observed in particular periods. They

may or may not continue and may or may not be reversed.

    The third type refers to "cycles of cycles." Here the NBER—designated

business cycles are viewed as subdivisions of longer major cycles or as mixtures

of several distinct types. Four patterns, named for the economists who have

investigated them in detail, are found in the literature:

        1. The Kondratieff (about 48 to 60 years). These "long waves" have

           been associated with large movements in the level of prices and

           perhaps also with major technological innovations, hut they do not

            show up in the volumes of production and consumption. Too few of

           such swings have been observed to prove or disprove their existence

           conci,' ively.

       2. The Kuznets (15 to 25 years). These cycles have been associated

           with construction of buildings and transport facilities (highways,

           rail lines, etc.), growth of population and labor force, urban
                                      —5—



            development, and business formation. Here there is more supportive

            evidence of an historical nature.

        3. The Juglar (about 7 to 10 years). These are the "major" business

            cycles, such as the Great Depression of the 1930's, that have

            received a great deal of attention in academic literature.

        4. The Kitchin (about 3 to 4 years). These- "minor" or "40—month"

            business cycles are often related to fluctuations in inventory

            investment.

     Schumpeter (1939, vol. I, ch. v) developed the much—discussed scheme of

three Kitchins per Juglar and six Juglars per Kondratieff. Burns and Mitchell

(1946, ch. 11) reported largely negative or inconclusive results from tests of

the former hypothesis for the United States. More generally, they found that

long—run cyclical changes rarely had a dominant influence on the short—run

cyclical behavior of a sample of U. S. series on general business activity,

prices, production, investment in capital goods, and yields and the volume of

trade in security markets.

     Business cycles have certainly varied greatly in amplitude, diffusion, and

duration, and important distinctions can be made between major and minor cycles,

e.g., with respect to the relative roles and behavior of monetary aggreqates,

fixed investment, and inventory investment. But these matters will not occupy

us here. There is little evidence of periodicities in the occurence of groups

of major and minor cycles. However, we shall consider, in the light of present-

ly available data, one old hypothesis related to the Kondratieff cycles, namely

that business cycle expansions have tended to be   nger (and larger?) and

contractions shorter (and smaller?) during the upward phases of the long waves

in prices than during the downward phases.
                                         —6—



       This paper, then, will focus in particular on the "secular" changes in

cyclical behavior, a category that would naturally seem to deserve most atten—

tion. However, the secular and the discontinuous changes are not necessarily

clearly differentiated. Not all trends can be safely projected and not all

changes labeled secular may prove to be irreversible.


          III. Durations of Cyclical Phases Before and After World War II

       Studies of business cycles in the pre—World War II era have not been able

to document major changes of either secular or discontinuous type. Tests by

Burns and Mitchell (1946, oh. 10) gave little or no support to the view that

substantial   long—term changes occurred in the durations and amplitudes of cycli-
cal movements in the   sample   of long U. S. time series. Mills' (1926) hypothesis
that   the cycles tend to get shorter in stages of rapid growth also failed to be

confirmed by these tests. Comparisons of cycles before and after 1914 (then

often alleged to have marked a "break" in American business history) indicated

more basic similarities than differences, although the fluctuations during the

period between the two world wars were unusually large.

       Such major changes of systematic nature as can be observed in aggregate

measures and particular aspects of cyclical behavior refer principally to com-

parisons between the period after World War II and the earlier era. As shown in

Table 1, the eight contractions of 1945—82 were on the average much shorter, and

the eight expansions much longer, than the corresponding phases in each of the

three subsets with equal numbers of consecutive business cycles that together

span the preceding century (lines 1—4, columns 3 and 5). In 1846—1945,

the mean duration of expansions was 30 months, that of contractions 20 months;

in 1945—82, expansions averaged 45 months and contractions 11 months.

                                        Table 1
                                       —7—




      The proportions of time that the economy spent declining dropped from 41%

 in 1846—1945 to 20% in 1945—82 (column 9). These results are altered but

 little, to 45% and 25%, respectively, when five cycles are omitted that include

 the long wartime expansions and the relatively short postwar contractions

 (column 10). The mean durations of the pre—1945 and post-1945 peacetime

expansions are 26 and 34 months; contractions, 21 and 11 months.

     A few of the mildest contractions in the NBER chronology of the 19th cent-

ury cycles may have been actually episodes of below—trend but still positive

growth rates, that is, pronounced retardations rather than absolute declines

(Zarnowitz, 1981). That is, the chronology may have (inadvertently) recognized

some growth cycle slowdowns rather than recessions, which would tend to make

expansions and contractions more nearly equal in length (see Moore and

Zarnowitz, section VIII, in this volume). But allowing for this possibility

would not significantly alter our conclusions. The proportions of time in

contractions for peacetime cycles, recalculated on this assumption, would be 40%

pre—1945 and (an unchanged) 25% post—1945.

     Contractions became more uniform in length after World war ii (column 6).

Expansions became less uniform but this is chiefly the effect of the wars, all

but one of which occurred in the last two of our four periods (column 4).

     With regard to the total cycle durations, neither the means nor the stan-

dard deviations indicate any significant trends. Expansions lengthened and con-

tractions shortened drastically but cycle lengths remained about the same
(columns 7 and 8).

     One of the implications of these findings is that contractions have become

more predictable as to length than they were in earlier times. For example, if

we take two standard deviations as the likely range, this was eight months in

the period 1945—82. Added to the mean of 11 months, this makes 19 months the
                                        -8—



pracical upper limit. In fact, no contraction in this period lasted more than

17 months. Before 1945, the estimated ranges was 26 months, yielding an upper

limit of 46 months, which was not exceeded even in the Great Depression (43

months).


              IV. Business Cycle phases and Long—Term Trends in prices

     Between 1789 and 1932, wholesale and consumer prices in the tlhited States

have followed alternating upward and downward trends (Table 2). The long up-

swings lasted between 21 and 25 years, the long downswings varied more, from 12

to 32 years. These movements largely cancelled each other over the entire

stretch    of more than 140 years, so that the level of prices at the bottom of the
Great Depression was not much higher than when George Washington took office.
The half—century since 1932, however, witnessed the longest, largest, and most
continuous inflation on record. Except in the recessions of 1937—38 and

1948—49, no significant price—level declines occurred in this period. Wholesale

prices increased by a factor of almost 9, consumer prices by a factor of 7 (cf.

columns 4—7 of the table).

                                       Table 2

     Apart from the secular trends, the comprehensive price indexes show gen-

erally procyclical short—term movements. Before 1932, they rose during most

business expansions and fell during most business contractions, conforming in

this sense about three quarters of the time.4 In periods of upward trend, the

cyclical rises in prices were on the average large and the declines small; in

periods of downward trend, the opposite situation prevailed, i.e., the rises

tended to be small and the declines large (columns 8 and 9). But after 1949

prices kept increasing even wh the economy declined, although virtually every
major slowdown and recession was associated with a temporary reduction in the

inflation rate.
                                      —9—




     To be sure, the long—period averages in Table 2 conceal a very large amount

of variation over time, both between the wartime and peacetime episodes and

among the latter. Nonetheless, it is important to note that over the last fifty

years as a whole inflation became a grave problem not because it was unusually

high during expansions but because, unlike in earlier times, it was only slowed,

not reversed, during contractions. The booms have not grown more inflationary

hut the deflationary slumps have disappeared. Indeed, the average percentage

increase per year in wholesale prices is 1.8 for the ten recessions of 1937—82,

substantially higher than the 1.2 figure for the entire 193 year period covered

in Table 2.

     In his introductory chapter to Thorp's Business Annals (1926, pp. 65—66),

Mitchell observed that the ratios of "prosperous" to "depressed" years have beers

systematically higher in periods of rising trends in wholesale prices than in

periods of declining trends. For the United States and England, the former

ratios averaged 2.7 and 2.3, the latter 0.8 and 0.6, respectively. About twenty

years later, armed with better and longer chronologies, Burns and Mitchell

confirnied the hypothesis that long swings in prices were associated with the

relative length of business cycle expansions and contractions (1946, pp. 437—438

and 538). The results based on their data for Great Britain, France, and

Germany are presented in Table 3, sections B, C, and 0. Section A shows more

detailed findings for the United States, based on longer and updated records

(see Moore, 1983, ch. 15).

                                    Table 3

     In each period of rising trend in prices, expansions last ' on the average

much longer than contractions, in most instances more than twice as long. In

each period of falling trend in prices, expansions tended to be either about as

lonq as contractions (this is so for the United States) or considerably shorter
                                     —10—




than contractions (for the other countries). These contrasts are both regular
and large (Table 3, columns 2, 5, and 7).

     As a result, the relative frequency of expansions has been greater in the

long upswings of prices, that of contractions in the long downswings (cf.

columns 1 and 4). Hence the total phase durations and their ratios add further

emphasis to the showing of the corresponding statistics for the average phase

durations (columns 3, G, and 8).

     Prices have risen strongly in wartime expansions, but the relationship doc-

umented above does not rely mainly on this fact. When the five major wars of U.

S. history are excluded (as in lines 2—5 of the table), the contrast between the

periods of upward and downward price trends is not much diminished.

     How should the association between the price trends and the relative dura-

tion of business cycle phases be interpreted? With prices in the short run

being less than fully flexible, fluctuations in aggregate demand, whatever their

causes, will be met in part by output movements, in part by price adjustments.

As a result, cyclical changes in output and prices will tend to be positively

correlated. Beyond that, actual and expected price—level rises may temporarily

stimulate economic activity if they are perceived as favorable movements in

relative prices and profits, and analogously price—level declines may be dis-

couraging if taken as signals of adverse changes in the same variables. But

these can only be very short—lived effects insofar as they depend on mispercep-

tions of general for relative price movements due to information lags. Propaga-

tion mechanisms that may amplify and prolong the consequences of such errors

have been suggested, however, and views on the matter are still divided, as

reflected in the recent debates on the equilibrium models of business cycles

(Zarnowitz, 1984). But few have argued that long—run trends in the level of

prices have clear and lasting effects on real activity, or that secular infla—
                                      —11—



tion is necessary for economic growth. There is essential agreement that the

long price movements reflect mainly trends in money and credit creation which

have no definite, permanent effects on the evolution of the economy in real

terms.

     Indeed, there appears to be no association between the rate of inflation

during each business cycle and the relative length of expansion versus contrac-

tion. The E/C ratios for the two cycles between 1953 and 1960 (3.9 and 3.0)

were not unlike the ratio for the 1973—80 cycle (3.6), but inflation averaged a

little over one percent per year in 1953—60 and 9 percent per year in 1973—80.

GNP in constant dollars advanced at similar average annual rates in the two

periods (2.6% and 2.8%), while unemployment increased from 4.9% in 1953—60 to

6.6% in 1973—80. As is well known, growth in the supply of money and credit

accelerated sharply in the intervening twenty years; this resulted in more in-

flation and higher interest rates without stimulating the economy and reducing

unemployment.

     Prices tend to move up briskly when expansions gather steam, particularly

in the boom phases at high levels of capital and labor utilization; they often

used to decline and now typically rise more slowly in business contractions,

particularly long slumps. This reflects both the cyclical fluctuations in

aggregate demand and the typical reactions of businessmen. In a recession,

costs are cut, profit margins are pared, and discounts are given to move heavy

inventories or prevent their costly accumulation. Failures increase and going—

out—of—business sales at low prices multiply as well. Wages rise more slowly

and are red-.d here and there under the pressure of increased layoffs and unem—

ployment. Costly overtime work is cut back or eliminated. Consumers become

more economical and cautious, especially about borrowing and spending on durable

goods. All of this works in the direction of lower prices or at least lower
                                      —12—



inflation rates. Thus it is not surprising that the trends are toward less in-

flation (or more deflation) in periods during which business contractions are

relatively long and frequent, and that the converse applies to periods dominated

by expansions (see also Moore, 1983, chapters 14 and 15).

      Thus it is not the long inflations that should be credited with shortening

recessions and lengthening expansions; rather the opposite chain of influence

deserves to be considered, in combination with the multiplicity of factors that

would historically account for the shifts in the relative duration of business

cycle phases. These include money and credit trends and financial innovations;

changes in the structure of production, employment, and markets; changes in

economic policies, institutions, and regulations; and major external shocks such

as wars, financial crises, large failures, explosions and collapses of basic

commodity prices, gold discoveries, etc. To apportion these influences to the

observed shifts in the nature of business cycles would surely be an important

but massive research undertaking which cannot be attempted here.


            V. The Reduced Severity of Recessions Since World War II

      The limitations of the available time—series data make it difficult to

measure the amplitude of business cycles, particularly over long historical

periods for which there ar few monthly or quarterly statistics as comprehensive

as such current indicators as real GNP, personal income, manufacturing and trade

sales, employment, etc. To compare the size of recent expansions and coritrac—

tons with those of the more distant past, about the best we can do is to use

indexes of business activity or production and nonagricultural employment (Table

4).

                                     Table 4

      These comparisons are inevitably crude because of compositional shifts in

the available measures of business activity and employment.5 In particular,
                                       —1 3—




factory or manufacturing employment (used before 1929) is typically more

variable over the business cycle than total nonagricultural employment which

inludes a large and rising share of the relatively stable services (see next

section) •   But such differences in the data probably account only in part for

the large contrasts observed between the averge percentage amplitudes in Table

4. These measures are much smaller for 1945—82 than for 1912—45 or 1914—45.

The cyclical movements in busines activity and employment were also on the

average smaller in 1885—1912 or 1891—1914 than in the period during and between

the two world wars, but by much lesser margins.

     The ranking of the three subperiods is the same for expansions and

contractions but the relative differences between the average amplitudes are

greater for contractions. The exclusions of the wartime cycles does not alter

the qualitative findings just summarized (its main consequence is to reduce the

average expansion amplitudes for the periods concerned). When the amplitudes of

expansions and contractions are added without regard to sign, the results once

more confirm the shifts toward smaller movements of production and employment

after 1945, for both all and peacetime cycles (columns 1, 3, and 5).

     The cyclical movements in the series covered were in general less variable

in 1945—82 than in the earlier periods, as indicated by the standard deviations

of the individual amplitude measures (columns 2, 4, and 6). This applies

strongly and without exceptions to the comparisons with 1912—1945 or 1914—1945.

    What these measures suggest, then, is that business contractions have been

on the average milder in the post—World War II era and also that their depth

varied less across the recent cycles than it did in earlier times. These

findings parallel those on the shorter and more uniform durations of the recent

contractions as reported in section III above.

    The moderation of business cycles, manifest in the relatively brief, mild,
                                        —14—



and infrequent recessions of the 1950s and 1960s was clearly an international

phenomenon. Extraordinarily long and vigorous expansions occurred in Japan,

West Germany, France, and Italy. One presumed reason lies in unique initial

conditions. The end of the war found F'urope and the Far East economically in

stages of unprecedented exhaustion. Yet the war left behind not only the ruins

of much of the physical capital of industry and commerce but also huge backlogs

of unutilized and skilled human resources and unsatisfied demand. What followed

was an era of Great Reconstruction: first a restoration of sound currencies and

free markets, then rapid growth of employment, output, investment, and trade.

Cyclical setbacks assumed for some time the form of retardations of growth

rather than absolute declines. The U. S. economy, starting after the war from

so much higher levels, intact and very strong, grew more slowly than Japan and

Western Europe (other than the United Kingdom).6 Here mild contractions

continued to recur, although the expansion in the 1960s persisted beyond all

previous experience and expectations.

     This record suggests the hypothesis that higher rates of real growth, which

prevailed in many countries in the first quarter century after 1945 under condi-

tions favoring capital formation and international trade and development, tend

to be associated with less cyclical instability. We shall examine the U. S.

evidence on this point in section IX below.

     nother type of partial explanation relies on structural changes that make

the contemporary highly developed economies less recession prone. Trends in the

industrial composition of employment illustrate such changes (Section VI).

Shifts in the structure of personal income provide another example (Section

viii). Here post—depression reforms concerning taxes and transfer payments

which act as "built—in stabilizers" have played an important role.7

     There are still other general hypotheses which are by no means incompatible
                                     —15—



with those noted above. Probably the one most discussed is that discretionary

demand management has become more sophisticated and effective in reducing

cyclical instability. This is obviously a critical issue but also one very

difficult to test. Most observers would likely agree that some successes were

scored by U. S. monetary and fiscal policies in the 1950s and 1960s but that the

record was mixed and marked by increasing errors on the inflationary side. The

topic will not be pursued here.


        VI. Structural Shifts in Employment and Their Cyclical Effects

     The share of U. S. employment accounted for by agriculture dropped from 48

percent in 1869 to 21 percent in 1929 and 4 percent in 1970. Business cycles

have contributed to major swings in food prices but they have weak effects on

the number of persons engaged in, and total output of, farming. Business cycles

are to a large extent a product of industrialization. Despite the great

importance of the strong downward trend in agricultural employment, we shall

concentrate on shifts in the industrial composition of nonagricultural

employment, for two reasons. (1) In recent times, the changing nature of

business cycles has been strongly influenced by these shifts, much less so by

the developments in agriculture, partly because the percentage employed in

farming, though still declining, has already reached very low levels.    (2) Over

the longer run, the huge shift away from agriculture would overshadow the trends

we wish to examine.

     Table S shows that in total nonagricultural employment, the combined share

accounted for by manufacturing, mining, construction, and transportation,

communications, and public utilities was stable in 1869—99 at about 56% but

declined steadily to 48% by 1929. In the five cycles between the peaks of 1929

and 1957, that share fluctuated in th& narrow range of 43%—46%, but in the next

five cycles, 1957—81, it fell steadily from 42% to 33%. The gainers included
                                              —16—




trade, insurance, real estate, personal and business services, and government——

all service industries in the broad sense. This sector as a whole employed 44%

of all persons engaged in nonagricultural production in 1869, 51% in 1929, and

67% in 1979—81 (cf. columns 9 and 10 in Table 5).

                                            Table S

        In the present context, the importance of this strong trend in the composi-

tion of employment rests on the fact that the rising industries have been much

less recession—prone than the dclining industries. The net result was a sub-

stantial reduction in the sensitivity of total employment to cyclical

fluctuations in aggregate demand.

        Table   6 provides the evidence. The average drop in employment during the
recessions of 1948—82 varied from 10% per year for durable manufactures to           4—5%

for the other sensitive industries: nondurable manufactures, mining, construc-

tion, and transportation, etc. In trade, the declines averaged less than 1%,

and in services, finance, and government employment actually increased by about

2%, so these industries have been more resistant to cyclical declines (column 3).

                                             Table 6

       When the first       four post—World War I    contractions (1948—60) are separated

from    the last four (1970—82), some shifts in detail are observed but the same
division between the relatively        recession—prone and recession—proof industries

holds    (columns 1   and   2). Indeed,   employment   in most of the latter decreased
much less or increased much more during the recessions of 1970—82 than during

those of 1948—60.

        If the 1959 distribution of employment among the nine uajor industries had

prevailed in the four recessions of 1948—60, the average reduction in nonagri-

cultural employment would have been (other things equal) 2.5 percent. For 1970—

82, the corresponding estimate is 2 percent, for all eight contractions 1948—82
                                         —17--




it is 2.3 percent. With the 1969 distribution, the reductions would have been

2.3, 1.8, and 2.0 percent for 1948—60, 1970—82, and 1984—82, respectively. With

the 1982 distributions, the estimates are 1 .7, 1 .0, and 1 .3 percent.

       Between 1929 and 1959 shifts of this type were probably much less impor-

tant, as Table 5 suggests. Now we see that they had significant effects between

1959 and 1969 and much stronger effects between 1969 and 1982. Will they endure

as   a source of employment stabilization in the future? Ten years ago the U. S.
Bureau of   Labor Statistics made projections to 1985 which assumed that the share

of government and private service industries would continue to increase. Their

most recent projections to 1995, however, imply a cessation (but not a reversal)

of the overall shift toward the more recession—proof industries (Table 6, column

7). The rise in personal and business services is expected to be offset by a

relative decline in government employment.

      The expansion of the share of government in the economy persisted so long

that even many who deplore this development regard it as nearly inevitable

("Wagner's Law"). Yet it is not a natural, irreversible tendency and forces

opposed to it may be getting stronger.

      The demand for services generally is often hypothesized to be more income—

elastic than the demand for goods, but Fuchs (1968, pp. 3—5) noted that the

proportion of services in total output was the same in 1965 as in 1929. He sug-

gested that the shift of employment from Industry to Service is explained

largely by the higher labor requirements in the latter sector. Output per

worker grew much more slowly in the production of services than in the produc-

tion of goods.8 But real output of services, and therefore productivity, is

difficult to measure and often poorly estimated. The notion of a continuing

shift into less productive industries and occupations seems worrisome and hard

to reconcile with competitive markets. In the current controversy on new
                                          —18--




industrial policies, proponents urge a government—supported

"reindustrialization" drive which, they claim, would make the u. S. economy more

productive and more competitive internationally. If this reverses the trend

described above, however, the consequences for cyclical stability may offset

some of the benefits.


VII. Trends and Cyclical c.hanges in unemployment and Labor—Force Participation

        Although the risk of losing a job has been reduced by the shift in the

industrial composition of employment, the unemployment rate fluctuated around a

rising trend since the late 1960s. In this period shifts of product demand and

derived labor demand between specific markets, industries, and occupations were

accelerated by several developments, notably the intensification, fading, and

end of the Vietnam War; the oil price increases; the swift spread of new prod-

ucts and technologies (computerization); the decline of some old industries such

as steel prompted in part by increasing competition from imports. The unusually

large intersectoral shifts contributed to the increases in unemployment (Lilien,

1982). In addition, other noncyclical factors probably operated in the same

direction. The composition of the labor force shifted toward greater participa-

tion by women and teenagers, groups with relatively high rates of labor market

turnover and unemployment. Higher unemployment benefits and wider coverage have

probably added to the average time spent in job search and hence to the      average
duration     and rate of unemployment. At the same time, the percentage of the
working—age population employed has risen, reaching a peacetime record high in
1979.
        'i   the recession of 1981—82, the highest attained rate of unemployment was
10.8%, exceeded only by the maximum rate reached during the major depressions of

1920—21 (not much higher) and 1929—33 and 1937—38 (which were extraordinarily

high). On the other hand, the      increase   in the unemployment rate in 1981-82 was
not particularly large. Jobless rates in recent contractions were generally

much higher than in previous contractions of comparable size, 1923—24 and 1926—

27. This can be seen clearly in Table 7, which compares the duration, depth,

and diffusion of tJ. S. business cycle contractions since 1920, using measures of

production, employment, and unemployment.

                                    Table 7

     The measures are highly but far from perfectly correlated (see the matrix

of the correlation coefficients in Table 7). Of course, unemployment changes

and levels are inversely associated with the declines in real GNP, industrial

production, and nonf arm employment. The measures of depth or amplitude (columns

2—6) are most closely related to each other, but the correlations involving

duration and diffusion (columns 1 and 7) are also significant.

     Comparisons of these and other statistics suggest that four mild recessions

occurred during the 62 years covered in the table, one in the 1920s (1926—27),

and three since 1960 (1960—61, 1969—70, and 1980). There were six sharp

recessions, all but one (1923—24) in the post-World War II period (1948—49,

1953—54, 1957—58, 1973—75, and 1981—82). The three major depressions go back to

1920—21 and the 1930's: the "Great Depression" of 1929—33 was in many respects

unique, and by far the most severe according to all measures. The 1945

recession was also quite particular because of its timing (end of World War II)

and nature (transition back to peacetime production). It was brief and mild in

terms of unemployment, sharp in terms of the decline in industrial production.

     The ranks in Table 7, column 8, based on the averages of the ranks of the

entries in each of the columns 1—7, ao-'e with the above classification. The

only ambiguity refers to the sui generis 1945 reconversion episode.

     An important caveat should be entered at this point, namely that there is

no way to construct a really satisfactory single measure of the severity of
                                       —20—



recessions. Cyclical movements are complex and differentiated in terms of

duration, diffusion, and depth. Some are relatively short but large and

pervasive, e.g., the business contraction of 1937—38; others are of similar

length but small and less widely spread, e.g., the recessions of 1960—61 and

1970. The use of average ranks is a crude approximation procedure, which is

further aggravated by the gaps in the data. Nevertheless, the results appear to

be sensible in that they agree with much broader evidence from historical and

statistical studies. We have experimented with other data without finding any

good reasons to alter our conclusions.9

       Coming back to the unemployment rate, it is the change in, rather than the

level of, this variable that deserves most attention as an indicator of relative

cyclical performance. The level attained during a recession is influenced in

part by the level reached during the preceding expansion——i.e., it combines a

measure of the weakness of the preceding expansion with the severity of the re-

cession. Moreover, the level is influenced by trends in the age—sex composition

of the labor force, as illustrated by the following results from a BLS study.0



                          Estimates of unemployment rate based on constant
           Unemployment   distribution by age—sex of the labor force
year           rate       1957 weights                  1967 weights

              (1)               (2)                           (3)
1959           5.5              5.4                           5.8
1969           3.5              3.1                           3.4
1973           4.8              4.1                           4.5
1977           7.0              6.0                           6.7



       The rise in unemployment rate between 1959 and 1977 would have been much

smaller if the age—sex composition of the labor force had remained as it was in

1957 or in 1967. Over the short periods encompassed by recession, however,

these demographic changes are much less consequential, hence the change in the
                                         —21—



rate during a recession is less affected by these shifts and more by factors

related to the severity of the recession itself.

     In addition, it is important to consider the sensitivity of the labor force

itself to changing market conditions and the implications this has for the

interpretation of the unemployment measures. In a recession, some additional

workers enter the labor force to bolster declining family incomes. At the same

time, some unemployed, frustrated in their job search, withdraw from the labor

market. Indeed, when the prospects for finding work at good wages appear to be

poor, they may not even compensate for the expected search costs, so some would—

be new entrants or reeritrants will not even commence looking for jobs. Here as

elsewhere, then, income and substitution effects can coexist in practice as well

as theory, and   the empirical   question is which prevails. The evidence is that

the civilian labor force, apart from its dominant upward trend, tends to respond

positively to business cycles. That is, the "discouraged workers1' effect

generally outweighs the "added workers" effect.

     The elasticity of the response of the labor force to cyclical changes in

the demand for workers is in the aggregate not high, perhaps about 0.2 on the

average (Mincer, 1966, p. 88). Much more sensitive are those groups that are

typified by relatively weak (but growing) attachment to the labor force, namely

women and youth (especially working wives and students). On the other hand, the

participation rate of adult men declined fairly steadily from 89% in 1948 to 78%

in 1983. Among older men, age 45 to 64, earlier retirement became financially

more attractive and increasingly frequent in the 1960s and the downward movement

in labor force participation accelerated in the 1970s (e.g., it was 92% in 1960,

90% in 1968, and 86% in 1984; see Bednarzik and Klein, 1977, p. 8).

     it has been suggested that, when combined, all these shifts in composition

"imply an over—all trend toward an increasingly sensitive, variable, and flex—
                                               —22—




ible   labor force" (Mincer, 1967, P. 17). As the labor—force responsiveness of a

group rises, the cyclical amplitude and conformity of its measured unemployment

rate declines. Entries and re—entries become more frequent during expansions

when search costs are low and job conditions favorable. Entry rates decline and

withdrawals rise when business is sluggish, reducing the labor force. }ence the

change in unemployment may understate the true loss of potential employment and

output. According to some indirect estimates, based on regressions of the labor

force on cyclical indicators such as the employment—population ratios, the

"hidden unemployment" was large indeed under relatively adverse labor—market

conditions (several million people in the early 1960s). But the estimates

indicate a heavy concentration of this phenomenon in the categories of

ItsecondaryiP workers who spend a relatively high proportion of time outside the

labor force. Many of these people time their decisions to enter or withdraw in

reaction to changes in labor demand as well as supply and other relevant

factors. Still,    to   some extent the labor force variation reflects also the

tendency for discouraged workers to disappear in business expansions and

reappear in contractions (Mincer, 1966, pp. 100—105; 1967, pp. 16_20).h1

       The percentage of the working-age population employed is very differently

affected by these factors than is the unemployment rate.          In 1983, for example,

almost   exactly the same percentage of the working—age population (1 6 years and
over) was employed as     in    1973, namely   58.3%. (In these calculations, employment

includes   resident Armed      Forces.) Other data, such as real personal income per

capita or real compensation per hour, indicate that both years were about

equally prosperous, but the unemployment rate in 1983 was nearly twice as high

as in 1973, 9.5% compared with 4.8%. If calculated as a percentage of the

working—age population instead of the labor force, unemployment was more than

twice as high, 6.1% compared with 2.9%. What happened was that a massive shift

occured in the disposition of the population to seek jobs. This pushed up the
                                           —23--




 unemployment rate but did not signify any great change in the availability of

 jobs per capita, which is measured by the employment percentage. Since the two

measures do not always give the same message regarding employment conditions, it

is important to consider both in evaluating the severity of recessions.


          VIII. Changing Sources of Personal Income and the Business Cycle

      According to annual estimates by Creamer (1956, p. 126), personal income in

constant dollars fell during five business contractions and rose during three in

the period 1910—38. The average of these changes was —5.0 percent. Correspond-

ing annual measures for the eiqht business contractions of 1948—82, based on the

present Department of Commerce data, show a reverse picture: three declines and

five rises, averaging +0.7 percent. Hence, real income has become far more

stable during business cycles since World War II than before.

      The composition of personal income by major types and sources shows that

several long—term shifts have contributed to this increasing stability (Tables 8

and 9). Wage and salary disbursements of government rose most of the time,

accounting for S to 6 percent of total income in the business cycle peak years

1913 and 1929, but more than twice as much——il to 14 percent——in the peak years

of 1953—8 1 •   Transfer   payments rose most strongly and persistently, from less

than 1% of the total in 1929 and before to 19% in 1981     •   The relative decline in

farmers' income, from 10% in 1913 to 1% in 1981, was slow in the first half of

the period covered, rapid in the second half. Nonfarm proprietors' income also

fell decisively in relative terms, from 15% to 4%. Wages and salaries in the

private sector, by far the largest component of personal income, increased from

48% in 1913 to 58% in 1953, then fell back again to 48% in 1981.

                                         Table S
                                         —24—




     of   the   types of property income, the shares of two show downward trends:

dividends (6—7 percent in 1913—17, 2—4 percent thereafter) and, particularly,

rent (from 11% down to 1% between 1913 and 1981). The proportion of interest

income fluctuated roughly between 3% and 6% in the peak years 1913—53 but grew

from 6% in 1960 to 8% in 1969, then rapidly to 13% in 1981 during the period of

high inflation.



     Table 9 classifies these types of income into two groups: those that have

been relatively recession—proof and those that have been recession—prone. In

general, the categories whose shares increased have been relatively recession—

proof (interest, rental income) or even countercyclical (transfers), while the

categories whose shares drifted mostly downward have been generally recession—

prone (proprietors' incomes and wages of private workers). Income of government

employees and transfer payments did not decline even in the severe depression of

1937—38 and neither did rent, while the downturn in interest income was moder-

ate. Although dividends fell sharply in 1937—38, they often resisted the milder

recessions in the post—World War II period (but note their drop in 1981—82).

Labor income in the private sector typically declined at least moderately in

recessions, mainly due to wages. It should be noted that the measures for 1937—

38 and 1948—49 (columns 1 and 2) are based on data in current dollars, the

measures for the 1948—80 averages and 1981—82 (columns 3 and 4) on data in

constant dollars. It was, of course, necessary to adjust the recent figures for

the effects of high inflation which masked the cyclicality of the nominal income

series during most of the post—World War II era.

                                        Table 9

     Suppose the cyclical changes in each of the sources of personal income were

as observed and taken to be independent of the shifts in the distribution of the

aggregate. How would the changes in the composition of income by sources influ—
                                      —25—



 ence the movements of total income under this assumption? The answer given by

 the estimates in the bottom section of Table 9 is "strongly." For example, had

the relative importance of the main categories of income been the same in 1981

as in 1948, the reweighted decline of real personal income during the 1981—82

recession would have been 4.3 percent instead of the actual 7/10 of one percent

(column 4). rjsing the 1948 weights would have doubled the relative amplitude of

the average decline in real personal income in the seven recessions of 1948—80,

from the observed 1.1 to the estimated 2.3 percent (column 3). Conversely, the

1937—38 decline, which was actually 7.7 percent, would have been ceteris paribus

only 4.1 percent under the distributional conditions of 1960 and 1 .2 percent

under those of 1981 (column 1)!

     To be sure, hypothetical calculations of this type must be interpreted with

great caution. The critical assumption that the amplitude of income change for

each category is independent of the compositional shifts could be undermined by

various factors. For example, transfer incomes may support consumption but

their strong upward trend, with its implication of rising tax burdens, may at

some point damage business confidence and investment. The rising share of

interest income reflects increasing and high interest rates, which again can

have strong adverse effects on government finance, security markets, and, most

important, real capital formation by business firms and households. The

expansion of government employment, in relative as well as absolute terms,

contributes to the taxpayers' burden. And there are still other possible

complications which the simple global estimates in Table 9 neglect: it may be

 'ortant to separate the effects of changing compensation rates and input

volumes and to take account of finer distinctions, e.g., the relative importance

of durables, nondurables, and services in generating personal income. These

qualifications were already made by Creamer and Moore in 1956.

    Nevertheless, as projected in that volume nearly thirty years ago, fluctua-
                                        —26—




tions   in income that accompany business cycles did moderate significantly, and

there can be little doubt that the trends in the composition of personal income

by major types and sources made a substantial contribution to this development.12


                 IX. Growth Rates and Variability of Economic Chanqe

        Although it is true for the period since 1945 as a whole that contractions

have become shorter and milder, there is nonetheless a useful distinction to be

made between the first two decades and the next one. In the 1950s and 1960s

high long—term growth rates prevailed in the U. S. economy as well as among its

major trading partners. Domestically, high inflation was not yet perceived to

be a persistent and grave problem with no easy, apparent solution, and neither

was high unemployment so perceived. Looking back, contemporaries had little

doubt about the contrast between these economically rather placid and prosperous

decades and the turbulent times that followed, dominated by seemingly

uncontrollable inflation, more frequent and serious recessions, energy problems,

and financial instability.

        To put such impressionistic comparisons on firmer ground, Table 10 divides

the U. S. economic record since 1903 into six periods each covering from two to

four complete business cycles measured from peak to peak. Three of these show

average annual growth rates in real GNP (g) varying from 3.4 to 3.9 percent:

1903—13, 1923—29, and 1948—69. The other three are characterized by

considerably lower long—term growth ranging from 2.4 to 2.8 percent per year:

1913—23, 1929—48, and 1969—81 (column 7)•13

                                       Table 10

        To measure relatively high aiid low economic stability, we use standard

deviations of the annual growth rates in real GNP () .       It   turns out that

variability in growth was generally greater in the slower growth periods

(columns 7 and 8). In addition, the more recent periods in both groups showed
                                                    —27—



less variability than the earlier periods, confirming the point made above

regarding the reduced severity of recessions since World War 11.14

       It is also of interest to observe that the proportion of time spent in con-

traction was 15% in 1948—69 and 24% in 1969—81 •                   Even this last figure is much

lower than the corresponding statistics for the earlier periods (cf. columns 4—6).

These measures indicate no correspondence between the average growth rates and

the relative duration of contractions. Thus in 1903—13 and 1923—29, when growth

was relatively high, the percentage of time accounted for by business contrac-

tions exceeded that in 1929—48 and 1969—81, periods with lower growth.

      Strong inflationary trends prevailed in 1913—23 and 1969—81, when monetary

aggregates expanded rapidly but real growth was relatively weak. In the other

periods, inflation was fairly moderate or absent. The following tabulation

shows the    average    annual growth rates (%) in real income, the stock of money,

nominal income, and the implicit price deflator (g, m, y, and                        p,
respectively.15 The periods with relatively high real growth                         (on   the left) had

on the average lower m, y, and p rates than the periods with lower real growth

(on the right).

                      X. Changes in the Cyclical Behavior of Prices

     Reference cycle patterns provide a simple and useful device for describinq

the movements of a series during buiness cycles. The series is divided into
                                       —28—



segments, each of which covers one business cycle dated from the initial to the

final trough. A pattern consists of nine averages, one for each of the consecu-

tive stages of the cycle. Stages I, V, and IX are three—month periods centered

on the initial trough, peak, and terstinal trough of a business cycle, respec-

tively. Stages II, III, and IV cover successive thirds of the expansion,(trough

to peak), and stages VI, VII, and VIII cover similar portions of the contraction

(peak to trough). All measures are in "reference cycle relatives," that is,

percentages of the average standing of the data during the given business cycle.

The procedure   retains the intra—cycle trend but eliminates the inter—cycle trend
because the average relative for each cycle is 100. It   should   be noted that
reference   cycle stages differ in duration as do the individual business

cycles. For certain purposes, therefore, such as comparisons of leads and lags

at turning points, measures in fixed calendar—time units may be preferable. But

an analysis of the patterns can be very revealing in some contexts. This is so

in particular with respect to the identification of any major and persistent

changes in broadly defined cyclical movements, which is our concern here.

      We have plotted and inspected 30 reference patterns for U. S. wholesale

prices, one for each of the complete business cycles since 1854. The first

impression is one of great variability, but a closer analysis helps to explain

the   main differences and bring out the more persistent traits. The intra—cycle
portions   of the longer trends are often strong enough to have pronounced and

readily visible effects. Thus in 1854—61 a downward local drift came to

dominate the longer upswing in prices, and then between 1864 and 1896 there was

a long downswing which however flattened temporarily in 1885_91.16 Accordingly,

the seven patterns covering the periods 1854—61, 1867-85, and 1891—97 have clear
                                        -29—



downward tilts. Between 1896 and 1920 prices tended to move up, with some

 levelling off in 1910—14. This left an impress upon the several corresponding

patterns. The weakness of prices in 1920—32 shows up in the downward-tilted

patterns for this period, and their subsequent upward trend in the upward—tilted

patterns for the post—1933 cycles.

        Major wars had huge effects on the behavior of prices. The patterns for

1861—67 (stages I—iv) 1914—19 (i—VI), and 1945—49 (I—IV) show the surging

inflations of the Civil War and World War I and the slower, more suppressed

inflation of World War II. The inflations of the Korean and Vietnam wars are

much less conspicuous in the patterns for 1949—54 (III—v) and 1961—70 (III—

IX). After the Civil War, a strong deflation followed immediately; after World

War I, prices first stabilized but then fell sharply in the 1920—21 depression;

but no strong downward movements in the price level trailed any of the later

wars.

        The most important findings are as follows. Virtually all business cycle

contractions through 1938 were associated with some declines in prices during at

least some of their stages. When the trend was down, these declines would often

start during the expansions and last longer, hut they would also typically accel-

erate after the peak stage (v). When the trend was up, the rising segments of

the patterns tended to be larger and longer, frequently starting before the

trough and extending beyond the peak, but the contractions would still witness

some significant price—level declines (mainly between stages VI and IX). The only

early patterns which show very weak and irregular price movements, in the 1885—91

period, refer o two short and marginal cycles, an interlude of relative stabil

ity separating major fluctuations dominated by strong deflationary developments

in the early 1880s and 1890s.

     The more recent cycles present a sharply contrasting picture. The brief
                                      —30—



and peculiar end—of—the—war contraction of 1945 was accompanied by essentially

flat wholesale prices. This year saw the end of wartime price controls. The

last contraction during which prices fell significantly occurred in 1948—49.

The Korean expansion saw new partial wage and price controls and had a phase in

1951 during which prices declined considerably, but in the ensuing contraction

they merely stabilized after a new bout of wartime inflation. The stability

persisted through most of the 1954—57 expansion, too, but prices started rising

again moderately late in the 1957—58 contraction and during the short recovery

of 1958—60, which alarmed many observers since there was little evidence of

excess demand. This ended with the recession of 1960,and several years of

relatively stable prices followed. With the intensification of the Vietnam war

in the mid—1960s, a new and much more intensive round of inflation began, which

the 1970 recession and the 1971 wage and price controls slowed down but a little

and for a short time. After the series of supply shocks in 1973—74 (sharp rises

in prices of food, oil, and other raw materials worldwide, termination of ti. S.

price controls, and after—effects of the switch to floating exchange rates),

inflation accelerated strongly late in the 1973—75 recession and again in the

mid—stages of the 1975—80 expansion, partly due to new supply shocks. It took a

protracted period of poor business conditions in the early 1980s (two

contractions separated by a weak one—year recovery) to reduce the pace of infla-

tion substantially. As a group, the post-World War II patterns, marked by an

absence of any major absolute declines in prices, are strikingly different from

any comparably large subset of earlier patterns where deflation associated with

business contractions was the rule.

     By averaging the individual reference patterns stage by stage over some

sufficiently long period, one may hope to bring out the typical features in the

cyclical behavior of the variable concerned. The assumption underlying the pro
                                      —31—



cedure is that such persistent traits indeed exist; the more valid this premise

is, the more useful the method.

     The upper panel in Chart 1 shows five average reference cycle patterns

based on the measures for the overall wholesale price series used in Chart 1.

The first pattern, for the seven cycles of 1867—97, reflects weak rises during

expansion and strong declines during contraction: the typical behavior in a

period of long—run downward trend in prices. The second, for the five cycles of

1897—1914, when the long drift was up, shows a longer and stronger rise and

weaker decline. The third, for 1919—38 (5 cycles), shows very large and more

symmetrical cyclical movements, with a relatively small downward tilt. The

average for the 17 cycles, 1854—1938, omitting the war—related episodes, is a

nearly symmetrical, slightly downward—tilted pattern rising between each of the

stages I—V and falling between each of the stages V—IX. In clear contrast, the

averages for the seven cycles 1949—82 describe a steadily rising pattern,

althouqh one whose slope is definitely lower in the contraction segment V—IX than

in the expansion segment I—V. In this period, the contractions were associated

with a lower, but not a negative, rate of inflation. Similar results for the

period since 1919 are obtained from an analysis of the index of wholesale prices

for industrial commodities only (omitting farm products and foods). The average

reference patterns for 1919—38 and 1949—82 closely resemble their counterparts

for the all-commodity index.


                                     Chart 1


    Cagan (1975, p. 90) concluded that:

        The failure of the aggregate index of wholesale prices to
        decline in the recessions of 1954 and 1958 and then again
        in 1961, which contrasted with the sharp declines of
        previous recessions, was a new phenomenon.
                                        —32—




 Our results confirm this observation on the basis of longer series than those

 used by Cagan (his measures cover the period 1891—1970, ours 1854—1982).

     It has 'been suggested that the post-1969 change in the observed behavior

was due to the convergence of downward rigidities due to the increased market

power of firms over prices and of labor unions over wages. Whether such

developments did in fact occur on a sufficiently large scale has been

questioned by some authors but accepted by others (Cagan, 1975, p. 90; DeLong

and Summers, this volume). Another hypothesis is that following the Employment

Act of 1946 the successive administrations demonstrated their commitment to

combating   unemployment so that people came to believe that contractions long or
severe enough to generate any persistent deflationary movements would be effec-
tively prevented.   This explanation, which appears to be generally consistent

with the evidence, is closely related to the more recent emphasis on the effect

of a credible policy posture on expectations of changes in the price level

(Feliner, 1980).

     It is difficult to measure anticipated rates of inflation, but their role

is undoubtedly basic. Cagan compared the average annual rates of change in

wholesale prices during the successive expansions and contractions (to be de-

noted E and C) and computed the differences C — E.      This procedure amounts

to using the preceding expansion rates as (admittedly rough) proxies for the

anticipations. In Table 11, we bring Cagan's results up to date. After 1949,

prices ceased declining during contractions: the signs of C change from

negative to positive (see columns 3 and 7). The differences C — E     have con-

sistently negative signs in the seventeen cycles from 1891 to 1958 (columns 4

and 8). The C rates, even where positive or zero as in 1945, 1953—54, and

1957—58, were smaller than the E rates. In the     four cycles between 1958 and
1980, however, the C —   E   differences turned positive as well.17 The price
                                           —33—



response measured in these terms declined consistently in each of the       six
successive business cyles 1945—75. Only in 1980—82 did C — E         result in a

negative sign, marking a decidedly disinflationary phase (column 9).

                                         Table 11




       The wholesale price data make it clear that the magnitude of the post—

world War II inflation in the United States was due, not to an intensification

of upward price pressures during business expansions, but to the increased

length of expansions and the new persistence of such pressures during

contractions. The average percentage increases of prices per year were very

similar in the prewar and postwar expansions (6.3 and 6.4 percent during 1891—

1945 and 1945—82, respectively), but very different in the prewar and postwar

contractions (-6.4 and 3.3 percent, respectively).

       Prices have been very sensitive to the severity of business contractions.

In 1891—1945, the wholesale price index fell at an average rate of 15% p.a. in

the five major depressions (MD), at 4% p.a. in the four severe recessions (SR),

and at 6/10 of 1% p.a. in the four mild recessions (MR). The corresponding

average differences C — E,        in percentage points, are —21, —12, and —6. In

1945—82 there were no major depressions, but in the five severe recessions the

price index rose 2% p.a., and in the three mild recessions it rose 5% p.a.

The C —      E   differential was —6 for the five SR and +1 .6 for the three MR.

Thus   in   both periods prices were responsive to the severity of business de-

clines, but it is clear that the response to recessions of comparable severity

decreased substantially.

       Detailed studies of wholesale price changes in the nonwar recessions of

the 1.920s and 1948—70 (Cagan, 1975) indicate that these results are riot attrib-

utable to the changing composition of the index. However, many raw materials
                                       —34—



prices retained their usually high cyclical sensitivity.

     In a recent analysis of a broad spectrum of price and wage series for

selected periods (1900—14, 1923—29, and 1949—66), Schultze (1981) argued that

until the 1960s low inflation "norms" in the nature of inert rules of thumb

dominated price—level expectations and behavior. In his comments, Feliner

(1981, pp. 577—581) disputed this hypothesis partly on the ground that

Schultze's sample includes mainly years in which prices had a mild upward trend

(in 1923—29 there was a slight downward drift). Had longer and more continuous

price series been used, they would have demonstrated more flexible behavior and

supported the concept of more "rational" expectations. Indeed, the pre—1920

patterns (see Chart 1) seem to us to be broadly consistent with this view.


              XI. Changes in the Cyclical Behavior of Interest Rates

     Short—term interest rates historically exhibited cyclical movements vary-

ing from moderate to very large relative to their average levels. During busi-

ness cycles containing major booms or slumps and affected by financial crises,

large monetary disturbances, or wars, fluctuations in rates have often been

huge and sudden. Financial markets are particularly sensitive to all types of

factors influencing business conditions, so it is well known and not surprising

that short rates are typically more volatile than most other important variables.

This is well established by an analysis of 27 reference cycle patterns that

covers more than 120 years of U.S. business history.

     The patterns for commercial paper rates, 1858—1932, show clear procyclical

movements, consistent with the simple notion that the demand for credit tends to

increase   relative to supply in expansions and decrease in ccractions. The

single major exception was the long but slow 1933—37 recovery from the worst

recorded depression, during which short rates continued to drop sharply.

However, the characteristic timing of the rates was predominately lagging,
                                      —35—



particularly at peaks. Rough coincidences prevailed only at the peaks of 1860-

73 and 1923—29. At troughs, the timing was on the average lagging as well but

much less consistently so. A few of the patterns (1861—67 and 1888—91 in

addition to those related to the depressions of 1920—21 and the 1930s) are quite

different from all the others.

     The patterns for the 3—month Treasury bill rate in the seven business

cycles 1949—82 have very large amplitudes which bespeaks heightened sensitivity

to cyclical influences.18 They rise sharply during expansions and fall sharply

during contractions but with much variability in timing. Thus their highest

standings are in stages IV (for the 1958—61 cycle), V (1949—54, 1961—70, and

1980—82), VI (1954—58 and 1975—80), and VII (1970—75). of   course,   in the post—

World War ii period interest rates generally had rising long—term trends; these

were mild in the 1950s and 1960s and strong thereafter, reflecting mainly the

course of inflation and the corresponding adjustments of price expectations. In

basis points, the fluctuations in interest rates were very small until the late

1960s, then steadily increasing to very large size. It is interesting to note

that the amplitudes of the corresponding patterns do not show a similar trend.

That is, relative to their average values in each cycle the movements of bill

rates have been about the same in recent cycles as in the 1950s and 1960s,

whereas in terms of basis points they were small in the early years when the

levels of the rates were low and large in the late years when the levels of the

rates were high.

     The average reference cycle patterns in chart 2 bring out the shifts in

amplitude and timing. There is a near symmetry of movement in the diagram for

the four earliest cycles covered (1858—79). The averages for the eleven cycles,

1879—1919, show a rise from stage II to VI—Vil and a contraction between stages

VII and II, that is lags at both peaks and troughs. The pattern for the five
                                                —36—



cycles of 1919—38 is strongly downward—tilted, with a rise between stages III

and V only (a long lag at troughs). These movements have been large enough to

put a strong imprint on the overall averages (compare the patterns for 1919—38

and 1859—1938). In contrast, the diagram for the Treasury bill rate in seven

cycles, 1949—82, shows a very large rise between stages I and VI, and a somewhat

smaller decline in the contraction stages VI—IX. The average swing in bill

rates since 1949 has been much larger than the average swing in commercial paper

rates before 1938.

                                               Chart 2

        It   is   common knowledge that long—term interest rates fluctuate much less

than    short—term rates; it is perhaps not so well known that they do not conform
as well to business cycles. Both properties can be inferred from a comparison
of the corresponding reference patterns. In 1900—1914, for example, the only
large    cyclical movements evident in high—grade industrial bond yields are those

associated with the crisis and severe depression of 1907: first a rise in

stages uI—vu of the 1904—08 cycle, then a decline continuing through most of

the recovery from that depression. A somewhat similar sequence occurred in

connection with the depression of 1920—21 and the subsequent recovery. The

large irregular movements in the great contraction of 1929—33 with a late peak

in stage VIII (1931), and the long, first rapid then slow decline throughout the

1933—38 cycle are also notable episodes.

       The corporate bond yield patterns for the post—World War II years contain

some very large shifts, mostly upward. The timing of these movements has varied

widely, .:i.th rises occurring between the following stages in each consecutive

cycle.


Cycles:           1949—53   1954—58   1958—61     1961—70   1970—75   1975—80   1980—82


Stages:             I—V       1—VI      I—IV       h—Vu     Ill—VIl   111V1 VIII—VI
                                       —37—



Consistent with the generally rising trend in yields, lags occurred more

frequently at business cycle peaks than at troughs.

                                      Chart 3

       The average reference patterns in chart 3 provide a bird's eye view. The

overall amplitudes of movement in long rates have increased greatly between

1900—38 and 1954—82,but it is the strong upward trend in the recent period that

accounts for this change. Allowing for the trend would tend to eliminate this

difference. The intra-cycle drift tended to be down in the period between the

world wars, strongly up in the last thirty years.

       Cagan (1966), comparing the behavior of a broad group of interest rates

before World War I, the 1920s, and the 1950s, noted that they may have become

increasingly sensitive, conforming to moderate business cycles with larger

amplitudes and shorter lags. Our reference cycle patterns are not inconsistent

with this result. b1e 12 indicates that a shift in timing toward shorter lags

and more frequent leads did occur in the early post—World War II period (1945-

60), but that later the lags reasserted themselves. In 1961—82 the lags were

generally longer than in 1919—29, for example. The lags of bond yields behind

bill rates also increased between these two periods (compare the first and

fourth lines in the "Averages" section). On the whole, lags have prevailed

heavily in the timing at troughs for both bills and bonds, but at peaks bills

usually led while bonds lagged. The individual timing comparisons show a high

degree of dispersion.


           XII. Changes in the Timigof Leading and Legging Indicators

      Since the 1960s, a collection of economic indicators that systematically

lead, coincide with, or lag business cycle turning points has become widely us. -

in   current economic analysis. The selection of these indicators has been based

upon historical measures of the kind employed earlier in this paper, as well as
                                      —38—



upon historical measures of the kind employed earlier in this paper, as well as

upon hypotheses of economic behavior that yield plausible explanations of the

observed leads and lags. Here we examine the historical record of two of the

selected groups of indicators with respect to their timing at business cycle

peaks and troughs.

     The longest available record of the timing of the leading and lagging indi-

cators during business cycles covers nearly a century. In Table 13 the median

leads or lags of specific groups of indicators are shown for each business cycle

turn between 1885 and 1982. The indicators in the leading group show an

unbroken record of leads, while those in the lagging group lag at all except two

peaks and three troughs. Moreover, when the turns in the lagging group are com-

pared with the opposite turns in the business cycle, they lead at every turn,

and by longer intervals than the leading indicators do. The economic relations

between the lagging and the leading indicators are such as to make these results

reasonable, according to the considerable literature that has been devoted to

the subject (for a summary and list of references, see Moore, 1983, ch. 21).

     From 1885 to 1938, the timing record is based upon 75 leading and 30 lag-

ging indicators, the classification having been determined in 1950. Since the

classification was based on the prior record, it is not surprising that the

leading group led and the lagging group lagged. But the consistency over the

entire period was not controlled by the method of classification, nor was the

relation between the opposite turns in the lagging and leading groups. For the

period 1948 to 1982, the record was based upon twelve leading and six lagging

indicators selected in 1975. Again the prior record was examined in maki'q the

selection. As has been shown elsewhere, however, the behavior of a group of

indicators selected in 1950, without benefit of the subsequent record, was quite

similar during 1948—75 to the record shown in Table 13 (Moore, 1983, ch. 24).
                                            —39—



        At business cycle peaks the average length of lead of the leading group,

 1885—1982, was seven months, with a standard deviation of six months. At

troughs the mean and standard deviation were about half as large, four and three

months,    respectively. There is   some evidence in the table   that   the leads at

peaks   have   become longer and the leads at troughs shorter since 1948 than before

(see    below).
        The lags of the lagging group average five months at peaks and seven months

at troughs, with standard deviations of four and five months, respectively.

When the turns in the lagging group are compared with the opposite turns in the

business cycle, the leads that emerge are quite long, averaging 21 months at

peaks and ten months at troughs. They are also quite variable, with standard

deviations of twelve months at peaks and eight months at troughs.

       What Table 13 reveals, then, is an almost unbroken sequence of turning

points during successive business cycles over the past hundred years. In view

of our finding in section III that the principal shift in the length of business

cycle phases took place after World War II, it is of interest to examine the

sequence before and after 1945, as in the following summary:


                                                             Average Interval in Months

     Each of the intervals into which the business cycle contraction is broken

by these turning points has become shorter, on average, while each of the inter-

vals that constitute the business cycle expansion has become longer. This in

itself supports the finding of a major shift in the length of business expan-

sions vis—a—vis contractions, since the intervals between the indicator turning

points (though not their sum) are independent of the business cycle chronology.

     One other noteworthy feature of Table 13 is the evidence that the lengths

of the leads or lags at successive turning points are positively correlated. The

correlation coefficients (r) are as follows:


                                              All                  Excluding
At Business Cycle peaks, 1887—1981         Observations          1933 and 1937

  Trough in Leading and Trough in Lagging       +.34                   +.35


     The correlations are not high, but they are all positive, and they are

about as high when opposite turns are compared as when like turns are compared.

This gives some support to the hypothesis that cyclical influences run from the

lagging to the leading indicators as well as from the leading to the lagging

indicators (see Moore, 1983, ch. 23).

     Apart from the shift toward shorter recessions and longer expansions and

the associated shift in the intervals between turns in the indicators, the most

notable feature of the record is the absence of major changes in the timing

relationships among the groups of indicators.


                           XIII. Summary and Conclusions

     1 •   Business cycle expansions in the United States became much longer and
                                      —41—



 recessions much shorter after World War II than before. From 1846 to 1945,

 expansions were one and a half times Tas long as recessions. From 1945 to 1982,

 they were four times as long. Recessions also became more uniform in length.

Total cycle durations from peak to peak or trough to trough show no significant

trend.

     2. Historically, expansions have been long relative to recessions when the

long—run trend in prices was upward, and shorter when the price trend was

downward. This is mainly because expansions generate more upward pressure on

prices than recessions do. However, we find no association between the rate of

inflation during each business cycle and the relative duration of the phases.

     3. Business cycle recessions after World War II have been much less severe

than before, as indicated by comprehensive measures of employment, production,

and real income. Shifts in the industrial composition of employment, changes

relating to unemployment and labor—force participation, and trends in the

distribution of personal income by major sources and types have all contributed

to that moderation.

     4. Inflation was much higher in 1969—81 than in 1948—69, while real growth

on the average was lower. In the past, periods of relatively low long-term

growth tended to have relatively high variability of annual growth rates.

However, the variability of economic change (measured by standard deviations of

real GNP growth rates) can be judged low by historical standards in both 1948—69

and 1969—81.

     5. The average rates of inflation were very similar in the U. S. expan-

sions before and after 1945 but much higher in the po-war than in the prewar

contractions. The inflation of recent decades can be attributed principally to

the (novel) persistence of upward price pressures in contractions, not to an

intensification of such pressures in expansions. Wholesale prices have
                                     —42—



continued to show considerable sensitivity to the degree of severity of business

contractions.

     6. Short—term interest rates moved with very large relative amplitudes,

high positive conformity, and variable timing in the business cycles of 1949—82.

Before World War I their movements tended to be smaller relative to the cycle

average, and they often had long lags at turning points. Long—term rates

continued to lag behind the short rates most of the time, and to show much

smaller amplitudes of movement and lower conformity to business cycles.

     7. The longest available record of the cyclical timing of leading and

lagging indicators covers nearly a century. Apart from a shift towards shorter

recessions and longer expansions, and the associated shift in the intervals

between turns in the indicators, the most notable feature of the record is the

absence of major changes in the timing relationships among the groups of

indicators.

     We conclude that various structural, institutional, and policy changes con-

tributed to the evolution of business cycles. The process is continuing. There

have been important changes, yet the most basic characteristics and many outward

manifestations of the business cycle remain much the same (as illustrated by the

timing sequences of the indicators). The cyclical processes are sometimes

stretched out and sometimes compressed, depending on long—term trends in growth,

inflation, etc., as well as the nature, size, and frequency of outside

disturbances.

     More intensive research is very much needed on each of the topics we could

address but briefly in this overview. In addition, there are other aspects of

the changing nature of business cycles that we had to exclude. The most import-

ant of these are international. For example, greater conformity of U. S. exports
                                     —43—



to business cycles in recent times has been noted by Mintz, 1967, and Moore,

1974. Business cycles, and even major fluctuations in positive growth rates,

appear to be rather integrated among the industrialized trading countries. The

full implications of this fact remain to be analyzed.

                                         NOTES

1.   The annals begin in 1790 for England and the United States, in 1840 for

France, in 1853 for Germany,   in   1867 for Austria, and in 1870 for twelve other

countries on four continents. They end in 1925 (Thorp, 1926) and in 1931

(Thorp, 1932). The NBER chronologies start in 1792, 1834, 1840, and 1866 for

Great Britain, U. S., France, and Germany, respectively. See Moore and

Zarnowitz, 1984, in this volume, for more detail.

2. In contrast, seasonal (daily and annual) cycles, although influenced by

custom, e.g., the timing of holidays, are in large measure part and parcel of

the natural environment of man. Centrally directed or collectivist economies

suffer from various types of instability induced partly by nature (e.g., varia-

tions in harvest) and partly by government and societal actions (e.g., political

purges; planning errors; imposition, resistance to, and relaxation of price and

other controls). In reaction to such disturbances, the overall growth rates of

these systems can vary widely over time, but such fluctuations are very differ-

ent from business cycles, just as closed centralized economies are fundamentally

unlike open market or "mixed" economies.

3. Consider also the classical theories of stationary state and the law of his—

torically diminishing returns, as well as the Maithusian population principle,

in the light of the great increase in the average standard of living in the

densely populated countries of Western Europe and Japan. A hundred years after

Maithus, Veblen anticipated a convergence of modern economies to a chronic state

of mild depression. Keynes sympathized with the intuitive underconsumption

hypotheses of Malthus and Hobson as forerunners of his theory of deficient

effective demand. For appraisals of current interest, see Mitchell, 1927, ch.

IX; Keynes, 1936, ch. 23; Haberler, 1964 (1937), ch. 5; and Burns and Mitchell,

1946, pp. 382—383.

 4. The monthly index of wholesale prices (Warren—pearson, 1854—1891, and BLS,

 1891—1933) rose in 13 out of 20 expansions and fell in 17 out of 20 contrac-

 tions. Snyder's monthly index of the general price level, covering a broad

 assortment of prices (1861—1933) rose in 15 out of 18 expansions and fell in 13

 out of 19 contractions. See Burns and Mitchell, pp. 98—101. For confirming

detailed evidence on the behavior of wholesale prices since 1891, see Cagan,

 1975, pp. 56—57.

5. The Axe—Houghton index (used for the 1885—91 cycles) is based on pig iron

production, imports, bank clearings outside New York City, and traffic revenue

per mile for selected railroads. The Babson index (for 1891—1920) is a base—

year weighted aggregate of seasonally adjusted physical volume or constant-

dollar series, with coverage expanding from 11 to 33 components. it includes

manufactures, minerals, agricultural marketings, construction, railway freight

ton—miles, electric power and foreign—trade volume, weighted by value—added. The

Federal Reserve Board index of industrial production (1920—82) initially includ-

ed about 50 series. Its coverage increased over time to more than 200 series

representing output in manufacturing, mining, and public utilities. The index

of factory employment for 1891—1911 is based on data for Massachusetts, New

Jersey, and New York (Jerome, 1926). The Bureau of Labor Statistics index of

factory employment (1913—1982) is based on a national sample of cooperating

national establishments. The BLS series on nonagricultural employment (used

after 1933) is based on monthly reports from a very large number of establish—

ments (some 160,000). (For more detail, see Moore, 1961, vol. II; U. S.

Department of Commerce, 1977.)

6. For example, the average annual growth rates of real GNP in 195''—69 were

3.9% for the United States, 6.8% for West Germany, and 5.3% for France. Japants

output grew 9.7% per year in 1952—69, Italy's 5.6% per year in 1951—69. The

corresponding average for the United Kingdom, 1950—69, was 2.7%. See U. S.

7. Similarly, deposit insurance is believed to have strengthened public con-

fidence in the financial system and prevented runs on the banks that were a

major feature of the crises and some depressions in the pre—Worid War II era.

On the other hand, there are some new sources of instability in this area, such

as recurrent disintermediation, credit controls, and "credit crunches;"

financial innovations and fluctuations in the demand for money and credit; and

the uncertainties of current moves to relax banking and related regulations.

R. Thus the average annual rates of change in output per worker were 2.2% in

Industry and 1.1% in Service (3.4% in Agriculture). The classification here is

much the same as in Table 6, but Industry includes government enterprise

(Service always includes general government). The corresponding statistics for

1959—82 are Tndustry 1 .9% and Service 0.9% (based on BLS employment and BEA

output data).

9. In particular, attempts to close the gaps. in ranks run into problems of com-

parability. The declines in factory employment (BLS) rank the contractions of

1920—21, 1923—24, and 1926—27 in agreement with the labels MD, SR, and MR,

respectively (they are, in percent, —31.1, —13.7, and —5.3). But factory em-

ployment has larger amplitudes than total nonagricultural employment. For

example, the declines in 1929—33 were —43.0% and —31 .6% respectively; in 1937—

38, -21.2% and —10.8%. Real GNP also declined strongly between the years 1944

and 1946 (by some 16 percent), but changes in the composition of output in this

period of transition from wartime to peacetime production make it difficult to

interpret this development.

 11. Over larger periods, labor force growth may respond directly to favorable

 economic conditions, using the data in form of changes in percentage points per

 decade, Easterlin demonstrates that the contribution of net migration and

 participation—rate changes to labor force growth is inversely associated with

 the unemployment rate. For 1880—1965, the correlation is —0.83 (Easterlin,

 1968, pp. 151—153 and 257).

 12. For further evidence, particularly concerning the role of government expen-

ditures and transfer payments, see Beck, 1980, and Cullity, 1983.

 13. See Zarnowitz (1981, pp. 476—480) for a discussion of how these periods

were selected, references to related literature, and an attempt to push the

comparison back to 1882.

14. Both 1913—23 and 1929—48 include large wartime expansions as well as major

depressions (with the latter outweighing the former as regards growth effects

but all contributing to high variability).

15. The measures for 1903—48 are calculated from annual data listed in Friedman

and Schwartz, 1982, Table 4 (following p. 121). They refer to the sum of cur-

rency held by the public plus adjusted deposits at all commercial banks;

national income or net national product; and the corresponding implicit price

deflator. The measures for 1969—82 are based on data on M2, GNP, and IPD as

given in the Economic Report of the President, February 1984, Pp. 220, 224, and

291.

16. For the chronology of the "long waves" in prices, see Table 2. On the

shorter "local" trends superimposed on these waves, see Burns and Mitchell,

1946, pp. 438—44" with Chart 65.

17. It should he remembered that these measures are averages in percent per

year. Taking into account the different durations of expansions and contractions

and the lengthening lags in prices, it is still true that some disinflation
                                      F- 5




accompanied or followed each of the recessions concerned.

18. Treasury bill rates have become a particularly important and sensitive

indicator of money market conditions. Commercial paper rates have somewhat

different characteristics than they used to have (Selden, 1963) but their

reference cycle patterns since 1949 bear a fair family resemblance to the

Trasury bill rate patterns.

retardations rather than recessions and included, along with the preceding and following
phases, in long expansions: 6/1869—12/1870; 3/1887—4/1888; 6/1899—12/1900. For detail, see

          = Wholesale Price Index. U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics index, 1896—1982; Warren
and Pearson index, 1789—1894 (spliced to the BLS index at 1890).

     Ccpi = Consumer Price Index. Estimated by the BLS by splicing, several indexes together,
namely: 1800—1851, Index of Prices Paid by Vermont Farmers for Family Living; 1851—1890,
Consumer Price Index by Ethel D. Hoover; 1890—1912, Cost of Living Index by Albert Rees; 1913
date, BLS. See Handbook of Labor Statistics (1971, p. 253). We estimate the 1789 figure by
splicing the Warren Pearson wholesale price index to the Vermont price index at 1814 (see
Historical Statistics of the United States, U. S. Department of Commerce, 1975, pp. 201—202).
The figure for these early years are rough approximations only.

     aThe percent changes in employment during recessions are computed from

three month standings of seasonally adjusted data centered on business cycle

peak and trough months. Simple averages are used; expressing the figures on a

per year basis would not alter the results significantly. (The average

durations of the recessions were: 1948—60, 10 months; 1970—82, 12 months;

1948—82, 11 months.) The measures are based on the data from the establishment

survey (jobs) of the 3. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

     bThe data used to compute these distributions are based on the establish-

ment survey but include also self-employed and unpaid family workers (but not

paid household employees). The total number of jobs represented in the

distributions are (in thousands): 1959, 59,640; 1969, 76,584; 1982, 97,865;

and 1995 (projected) 123,667. See Personick, 1983, Table 2, p. 26. The

"moderate growth projection" for 1995 assumes average annual growth rates of

employment of 1.8 percent from 1982 to 1990 and 1.5 percent from 1990 to 1995.
