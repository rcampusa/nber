                 Incentives 4cr the Homogenization of Time Use



                                   ABSTRACT



     n increasing variety of phenomena involve the mixing of market work and

leisure, or market work and home production, both by individuals and across

household members. The growth of vacations, holidays and days absent from

work; the rise in part—time employment and the reduction in macni ighting; and

the convergence between the sexes of labor—force participation rates and of

time spent in household production, are all demonstrated by data for a number

of developed countries. This phenomenon, an increasing consumption of

mixed leisure, is examined in the context c-f a model in which the consumption

of one commodity reduces the market wage. 14 income dominate substitution

effects, as time—series evidence on the demand for leisure suggests they do,

higher full incomes will increase the demand for mixed leisure. Similarly,

greater differences between tax rates on market work and on mixed leisure will

also increase the demand for the latter.

     IAhether the growth of mixed leisure has resulted from changing tax

incentives or increased full incomes is not clear, but some weak formal

evidence for the latter cause is presented. The implications a-f expanded

consumption of mixed leisure for earnings inequality andfor the welfare

effects of unemployment are discussed, and some approaches to testing the

theory c-f the demand -for mixed leisure are suggested.

1. Introduction


     Keynes' well—known prediction about the path of labor supply has hardly

come to pass in the adulthood of his contemporaries' grandchildren. Either

the gold Adam0 is much stronger than Keynes imagined (people's tastes differ

sharply from what he bel ieved them to be), or other incentives have changed.

The average workweek has not dropped to 15 hours, though there is some

evidence (Beckerman, 1978) that the average amount of market work

Q.L adult fell slightly in most industrial ized countries from the early 1950's

at least up through the early 1970s.

     What is more interesting than this (fairly slow) rate of growth in

per—capita leisure is the enormous range of changes in patterns of leisure.

In this study I present evidence of the variety of these changes, each of

which can be characterized as evidence of an increase in people's

interspersing leisure and market work. I then discuss a simple theory that

can incorporate the changing incentives that can account for them and that has

expi icit predictions for future changes in patterns of consumption of

leisure. Moreover, the unifying view it provides of the use of time in

industrialized societies offers impl cat ions for changes in the inequality of

earnings and in the burden of unemployment.


11. Changes in the Allocation of Time


     The supply o-f labor to the market expresses itself along a variety of

margins. Elsewhere (Hamermesh—Rees, 1984:) we have categorized these as the
choices of participation, of hours of work given participation, and of effort

per hour of work. While all three obviously come from the same maximizing

decision, this hierarchy provides a useful way of examining how the allocation

of time to the market has changed in industrial ized countries. In this

section we thus examine data from a variety of sources on changes in time use

in the last thirty years.

     Table 1 presents labor—force participation rates for adult men and women

in 1959 (for most countries) and 1981. The pattern for adult women is striking

and both well known and widely studied. Except for Japan and (barely) Austria

the data show an increased fraction of adult women are working in the market.1

What is less well known is that the fraction of adult men who are in the labor

force has declined in each of these countries. There has been a trend toward

convergence of time allocated to the market by the two sexes.

     Examining the allocation of time during the work year for those persons

in the labor force we see from Table 2 that paid days off (public and other

hol idays: have increased. Also, the amount of vacation tim? available to

regular workers has risen. The payroll cost figures for the United States

suggest the increased consumption of vacation time is not so sharp as the data

from Canada and the United Kingdom on its availability would imply; however,

both do indicate that workers are interspersing weeks of paid work with weeks

of paid leisure to a greater extent than they did 25 years ago.

     Perhaps the biggest change in time allocation has been the decline in

scheduled hours of work per workiriQ person. As Table 3 shows, this deci me is

not merely the result of the interaction of labor supply and technology: The

fraction of workers holding second Jobs has decl med in the industrial ized
                                        2
countries   for which data are available. Similarly, though clearly somewhat

more the result of an interaction of supply and demand, Table 4 indicates that

there has been a rise in part—time work in the past 20 years. Finally, even

within manufacturing Table 5 shows that scheduled weekly hours have fallen in

most countries. The small changes in the United States and Canada, which had

relatively short hours in the late 1950s, suggest the existence of some,

perhaps only temporary, lower 1 irnit to the scheduled workweek in this sector.

     The evidence in Tables 3—5 may merely indicate the predominance of income

over substitution effects in the demand for leisure. However, it should be

considered in conjunction with Beckerman's (197B p.    15) evidence of a very

slow increase in the consumption of leisure per adult (and an actual decl me

in the United States1 Canada and France) between the early 1950s and the

1970s. Viewed in this way1 the decl ne in scheduled hours imp] ies that the

incidence of market work among the adult population in any given week has

increased, but the weekly duration of market work has deci med.

     One might expect that declines in morbidity rates would have led to

decreases in absenteeism. As Table 6 shows, except in the United States the

opposite has been true.' Taylor (1969) shows similar upward trends for the

United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Italy from 1950 to the middle 1960s. This

surprising trend may partly reflect the reduced cost of absenteeism, as limits

on paid sick leave have increased (see Doherty, 19?9:. Even if it does,

though, the greater prevalence of this fringe benefit may itself be partly the

outcome of workers' desires to alternate leisure with market work, partly the

result too of rising tax rates on earned income.   It is especially interesting

to note the increase in the United States between the two business—cycle peaks

in the 1970s in the rate of unexcused absences not resulting from illness

This rise is not likely to be contaminated by any changes in the cost to the

worker of being absent or in underlying morbidity rates.

     Even within a day there have been clear changes in how people allocate

their time between market work and work in the household. Table 7 presents

data on this aspect of labor—market behavior for five countries. Perhaps the

clearest example of the changes that have occurred is shown for Norway: During

the 1970s the average man sharply reduced the time spent at market work, but

opposite was true: Hours of market work rose somewhat, while hours of homework

deci med sharply. The same relative increase in homework as a fraction of

total work among men, and decline among women, is observed for the United

States, Canada and the United Kingdom as well. Only in Japan did this change

in the relative burdens of home and market work not take place, though men did

increase the fraction of work time performed in the home. That women did not

reduce the share of home work in their total effort may be related to the

unusual trend in female labor—force participation in Japan that we noted

stemmed from the rapid diminution of the fraction of women working in the home

on market act ivit ies.

     The information in Tables 1—7 covers a variety of aspects of labor—market

behavior as completely as the available sources of data allow, Many different

facets of behavior interact to produce the outcomes described in these

tables. Two unifying threads appear to run through all this information,

however: People in developed countries are increasingly mixing market work

with leisure or nonmarket work; and the burden of market work has increasingly

become spread more evenly across the adult population.


III. The Demand for Mixed Leisure


     Let us examine a simple formal model that might enable us to explain the

apparent trend toward a smoothing out over short periods of time and within

households of the burden of market work. Consider a world in which there are

two commodities, each produced by a combination of time and purchased goods,

arid in which there are no taxes. Let the typical worker's utility during a

year be:


(1) U =    uz ,z?: ;   U'. >0, W <0.


t4e assume that household production of the 2. is characterized by:


                                       —4—
 (2) 2 = g. <X.                !    i=1 ,2,


 where the X. are the inputs of purchased goods into the production of 2., and

 the t. are inputs of time. The total time available to the worker is

 Tt 4-t +t , where t                 is time spent on market work.
       1    2 w                 w
           Thus far this is nothing more than the standard model of household

 production of Becker (1971). The novelty is in the assumption about the goods

 constraint. We assume that the worker's earnings depend on hours worked, t,

 and the wage rate w1 which is a decreasing function of time devoted to the

 commodity 22. The money budget constraint facing the worker is thus:


 (3) Zp.X.=t w(t )i-J
            w i  2


 where the p. are the prices of the goods used in producing the 2., and I is

 unearned income.

           In this model consumption of commodity 2 reduces the hourly wage rate.

 Commodity 2 may be viewed as on—the--job leisure (what Schrank <1978) refers to

 as schmoosing); as days off spent in recreation; as home work of someone who

 does not specialize in home work; or as any commodity that requires that goods

 be combined with time off from market work on a frequent basis.                    I call a

 commodity like this a mixed commodi. That time devoted to producing such

 cc'rnrnodities reduces the market wage rate (dw/dt,,<O) seems reasonable; it may

 be    that ww( t2)          is also characterized by wH <0, though that need not be true

 for    our results to follow.

           Utility      <i: is maximized subject to the household production functions
 '2),      the goods constraint (3) and the time constraint. The conditions for a

 maximum can be written as:

                         —                                        = 0

                             X[p1ôX1/ôZ1

                                                                  dw/dt2J} Z2 = 0
                  {u2                             wôt2/ôz2


—5—
       where x   is    the value in utH ity terms of a one—unit increase in the full

       income of the worker.           I-f the worker produces both of the commodities,

       equations (4) reduce to
                                  p2 X2 /Z2 +   wôt2 /jZ2 — t   dw/dt,
                        Iii                                 w
       (5\        IT

                       2'l    =                                      2

                                        p1X1/ôZ1 + wôt1/ôL1

             Equation (5) differs from the standard conditions for a maximum by its
       inclusion of the expanded price of commodity 2. In addition to the price of

       goods purchased and the direct price of time devoted to its production,

       increased consumption of this commodity also reduces the wage rate received

       from market work, and thus the value of the worker's time in its other uses.

       The -full price of a mixed commodity is greater than that of an

       otherwise identical standard commodity because of the effects of its

       production on the value of time.

             Consider the effect of an increase in unearned income on consumption of

       the two commodities. Assuming neither is inferior, a rise in unearned income

       will by (4) make the worker more likely to consume both commodities. More

       interesting predictions can be made if the worker is already consuming at

       least some o-f both commodities.             I-f leisure is a superior good, so that t

       decreases as I increases, the full price of 22 relative to that of an

       otherwise identical commodity (same marginal time and goods intensity, and

       same goods price) will decrease. Under these assumptions the right side of

       (5 reduces to one plus the term t dw./dt2 divided by the price of commodity 1.

       Unless w' and dw./dt, are large in absolute value1 our conclusion follows. In

       this case workers will increase their relative consumption o-f the mixed

       commnodi ty.

             The effect of an exogenous increase in the wage rate, essentially a

       vertical shift in the function w=w(t,)1 depends on slope o-F the uncornpensated

       supply curve of labor. If, as time—series evidence suggests1 income dominate

       substitution effects1 the fall in t will lead, following the argument above,


—6--
to a relative increase in consumption of the mixed commodity compared to

otherwise identical commodities. If the dominance of the income effect is not

too great, the rise in earnings will also lead to an absolute increase in the

amount of the mixed commodity that is consumed. If substitution effects

dominate, so that t increases at each value of t , the relative demand for 2
                   w                            2                            2
wifl fall; but the absolute amount will probably rise as workers' full incomes

are higher. In sum, a growing consumption of mixed leisure is the natural

concomitant of an increase in total consumption of leisure; Both will occur

if income dominate substitution effects.

     This discussion explains the phenomena presented in Section II as the

result of income effects overcoming the extra cost of consuming the mixed

commodity. With higher unearned income, or with inccrne effects that dominate

substitution effects on leisure, the fall in the wage rate that is induced by

increased consumption of the mixed commodity becomes less of a deterrent.

This leads to an increase in its relative consumption; but so long as it is

desired, workers will consume more o-f it, other things equal, when there is an

exogenous increase in their full incomes. Essentially, the (costly) ability

to mix leisure or home work with market work provides another margin along

which the effects of higher income operate.

     The formal model abstracted from the existence of differential taxation

of earnings and mixed leisure. Obviously, to the extent the former is

increasinqiy taxed, while the latter is not, the incentive to consume mixed

leisure is increased. The oft—noted rise in marginal tax rates in most

developed countries in the postwar period may thus explain part of the

phenomena under discussion, particularly in the context of a one—person

household (see Woadbury, 1983). Thus it may, in addition to the role of income

effects, be partly responsible for the growth of part—time work, absences and

vacation time.

    The phenomena are best understood in the context of the entire
household1s decisions about allocating time. As we have seen, the

representative worker, about whom the explanation was expi Ic I tly built, now

spends fewer hours in the market and consumes more mixed leisure. The

household has also used its increased full income to purchase more mixed

leisure for men, who previously consumed relatively little mixed leisure. The

only difficulty comes in applying this explanation to changes in time use by

women. Clearly, t   has increased for them; whether their relative consumption

of mixed leisure has fallen or not cannot be determined from available data.

It is likely, thought that their absolute consumption of this commodity has

increased along with that by men1 so that both sexes are mixing leisure and

market work more than they did earl ier in this century. Changing rates of

taxation do little to explain changes in the division of market and home

production between the sexes within a household. Here the changed incentives

produced by the effect of a rise in full income in the presence of a fixed

endowment of time for each household member that we have stressed seems to be

the best explanation of this part of the record.

    This explanation of the broad range of facts describinq the use o-f time

can be trivial ized by equating it to a demand for variety. It is true that

higher income will lead to the consumption of more different commodities1 as

corner solutions become less likely.4 However, our theory implies something

more than this namely that an increase in the consumption of leisure that is

occasioned by higher income will be accompanied by an increase in the mix in

of leisure with work. This could not be predicted by a demand for variety;

and only our formulation could predict a relative increase in the mixing of

leisure and work that accompanies a reduction in the fraction of time devoted

to work.

    At first glance our argument may seem like the obverse of Rosens (1983)

demonstration that increased utilization of human capital leads to an increase

in specialization. The arguments are formally somewhat similar, in that


                                     —8—
relative reductions in time spent working are accompanied in our model by

relative increases in the amount of mixing of work and leisure. However, they

deal with entirely different sets of issues. Rosen's argument centers on a

choice about optimal investment and thus is exp1 ici tly interternporal ; the

argument here deals with optimal consumption and is basically static.


IV. Direct Tests of the Hypothesis


     It is quite difficult to Qo much beyond the broad patterns sugQested in

Section II by the aggreqate data. Most o-f the interesting hypotheses

suggested by the notion of mixed leisure are better tested on micro data.

Therefore this Section presents one, fairly weak test of the hypothesis using

aggregate data, then outlines several tests that could be performed on micro

data. It is worth noting first, though1 that the common finding (e.g. Oaxaca,

1973) that part—time workers receive lower hourly wages than do otherwise

identical (same work experience and formal education) full—time workers is

consistent with the assumption underlying our model that dw/dt2<Q.

     A formal, though still weak test of the assumption that mixing reduces

the real wage rate can be conducted by examining the effects of the increased

convergence of participation rates of men and women over some period of time,

such as that presented in Table 1. The extent of convergence can be measured

as the change in:


(8) DEY =                  +
            ILFPRM_LFPRI       ILFPRF_LFPRI

where LFPR is the participation rate measured as a fraction, and the

subscripts M and F refer to the two sexes. In situations where participation

rates are converging, JDE) will be more negative in those countries where

convergence is more rapid.
                           .5
     Increased convergence, which is one manifestation of an increased

consumption of mixed leisure, will reduce real wage rates (dw/dt,<O). 4e


                                          —9—
  should thus expect a positive cc'rrelation between 40EV and the growth rate of

  real wages.6 Lirifortunately, good measures of that growth rate are not

  available for many countries; we rely instead on the growth rate of per—capita

  real income, JJGNP, between 1960 and 1981. Since other factors, partftularly

  the rate of capital—deepening1 affect this growth rate1 we hold 4ENERGY, the

  rate o-f growth of energy consumption per capita1 constant in order to isolate
                                                                          7
  the effect of increased mixing on growth rates. Also included is the change

  in the aggregate participation rate, JLFPR, under the assumption that more

  workers in a given population will produce a higher real GNP per capita. All

  growth rates are measured as fractions.

        The equation to be estimated is



       4GNP=aQ+a1JDE.+a74ENER0Y

+a34LFPR.


 Table 8 presents the estimates of (7) for the fifteen countries for which

  participation data are shown in Table 1, then for smaller samples.8 (Spain is

  deleted because it could not be clearly classified as a developed economy at

  the start of the period; Austria is deleted because the participation data

  begin with 1968, much later than the rest of the sample.) Not surprisingly,

  the contrc'l variable for capital—deepening has a positive impact on the growth

  rate of per—capita real GNP, as does the growth c-f the aggregate participation

  rate. What is interesting -for our purposes is that in those countries in

 which JDEV is more              negative,    reflecting greater convergence in participation

  rates, the growth rate of real 3NP is slower. This                             is    true for the entire

  sample arid for the two            restricted       samples for which results are             presented.9
 The results may            partly   reflect a       change   in the average amount of human              capital

  embodied in       the     labor force, as the relative importance o-f inexperienced
  female workers          in    the labor    force    increases. We           cannot    distinguish that

on]>' weak evidence that increased mixing does come at the cost               cf    a reduction

in the real wage.

        Better tests of specific irnpl icat ions of the hypothesis require the use

of time—budget surveys that also contain information on such economic

characteristics as wage rates and other income of household members. Fruitful

approaches to using such data would seem to 1 ie in the direction of

distinguishing among otherwise identical workers those for l,Jhofli the extra cost

o-f mixed leisure, dw/dt2 is lower than average. Thus, for example, one would

expect that self—employed workers have better infc'rrnatic;ri cm            the    effect o-f

mixed leisure on their wage rate than do employees' supervisors for whom

monitoring is costly; the sel-f—emplc'yed would be able to consume mixed leisure

in such a way as to produce a smaller reduction in hourly wages than could

employees with the same amount cf human capital. We should therefore find

self—employed workers interspersing leisure with work more than otherwise

similar employees. Similarly, employees whose wage per hour at work depends

solely on their own effort will consume more mixed leisure, since they

presumably are better able to reduce its effects on their wages than are other

workers. This implies that otherwise identical piece—rated workers will mix

leisure more than viill workers who receive an hourly wage. To test these

hypotheses one might compare absentee patterns or study tine use at the

V. Impi icat ions for the Labor Market


        In   this   Section we examine the implications of the existence and

increased importance of the demand for mixed              leisure for various aspects of
labor—market behavior. The first of these is the effect on the compensating
wage differential that firms must pay otherwise identical workers to induce

them    to take Jobs involving       rigid   ,"crk schedul ing.10 As we   have seen,

increases        in full   income lead   \cmrkers to demand more mixed leisure. Ore

                                               —   11 —
consequence is that the supply of workers to Jobs that offer rigid schedules

is reduced. Assuming that technology does not reduce the marginal cost of

making schedules less rigid by as much as workers' trade—offs tilt against

such schedules, the compensating dif-ferential offered by the market rises.

       Substantial evidence on a variety of wage differentials <see

Hamermesh—Rees, 1984) shows that workers with higher full incomes use part of

those incomes to avoid disarnenities. The compensating differentials that

exist for those disamenities thus serve to equal ize in part the distribution

of earnings. Our theory predicts that the increased demand for mixed leisure

will lead to an increase in the compensating differential necessary to attract

workers to Jobs on which it is difficult to consume mixed leisure. This will

occur whether the growth of mixed leisure is induced by workers' increased

willingness to trade off mixed leisure for earnings as their full income

increases or the consumption of mixed leisure is induced by            increased marginal
tax rates on market work. If this happens, it           will lead   to a reduction in

earnings inequality below what would otherwise occur, as those workers located

in   rigid   jobs increasingly come from     the   lower tail of the distribution 0-f

full incomes. Insofar as most income inequal i ty         stems from   inequality of

earnings, this change implies that income inequality too will be reduced by

the growth of demand for mixed leisure.

      A second consideration is the effect of the growth of mixed leisure on

the loss in utility associated with unemployment.            Unemployment can be viewed

as. in Ashenfelter <1980:), as a constraint on labor supply <in our model, as a

constraint on time devoted to household production). In particular, workers

are constrained to devote more time to household production than they

otherwise would, t <t *, where
                     w w          t   * is    the amount of pure work chosen at an

unconstrained maximum. The constraint on hours of work relaxes the time

constraint facing the household and tightens the income constraint.

Households shift production to relatively more time—intensive commodities.H


                                        — 12 -
        The existence of mixed leisure provides another marQin alonQ which the

constrained household can adjust when t        is forced below t *     Because the

constraint increases the relative scarcity of income, workers will substitute

aQainst mixed leisure iii       order to increase their hourly waqe rate. Thus a

 labor—supply constraint will decrease the relative consumption of the mixed

commodity compared to otherwise identical commodities. The abil ity         to
substitute in this way reduces the util it>' loss imposed by the constraint. s

with other adjustments, such as other household members entering the labor

force in response to enforced reductions in hours worked by one household

member4 decreases in the relative product ion of mixed leisure are a way

households can ease the burden of unemployment. The scope for such reductions

depends on the length of spells of unemployment and on the ease of changing

the amount of mixed leisure that is consumed per time period. If spells are

of su-f-ficier,t length to allow some scope for this phenomenon, the increase in

the consumption of mixed leisure in the past 30 years suggests an additional

reason why the burden      o-f a given insufficiency a-f aggregate demand has
decreased.

VI. Conclusions


        There   is a broad trend in developed economies toward the consumption c-f
what we have called mixed leisure. This commodity includes any leisure or home

production that is interspersed——during a day, a week or a ::'ear—--with market
work. Whether this trend will continue will depend on whether          the underlying

incentives      that have brouc1ht it about continue. These incentives include the
effect of increased full income acting upon the       tastes of people for wham

income    effects or leisure demand dominate substitution effects, and on changes
in the relative rates of taxation of market work, mixed leisure        and home

production.      Even without   the trends in these incentives,   though, the amount
a-f   mixed leisure consumed can change as technolon>' changes. Especially if

                                          — 13 —
workers' freedom to schedule their hours of work increases, so that the wage

loss attendant on consuming mixed leisure declines, we should see still more

evidence of this phenomenon.

     To the extent that the growth of mixed leisure has resulted from higher

full incomes, the loss of market production implied should not be deplored.

Rather, through household util it>' maximization famil es have chosen to trade

off production in the market for the consumption of leisure that is mixed with

market work. Even if the growth of mixed leisure stems from changing

tax/transfer incentives (higher marginal tax rates on earnings and the

riontaxation of mixed leisure:), it is not clear that welfare is worsened. To

the extent that the transfers financed by the taxes (broader sick pay, for

example) reflect the social expression of households' demands for mixed

leisure, the net effect of the combined tax/transfer poi icy on welfare may be

positive. Only if the changing difference in relative tax rates on market

work and mixed leisure is used to finance expenditures other than those that

increase the demand for mixed leisure may we conclude that the induced

substitution of mixed leisure for market production represents a reduction in

welfare. The issue here is exactly analogcus tn the discussion of the

relative importance of higher incomes and incentives in Social Security

schemes in reducing market work among older persons. As Martin Janssen shows

in this volume, it is by no means clear from the empirical work that Social

Security has had a major effect.

     Obviously what has been offered here is merely a unifying way    of   looking

at what otherwise seems to be a jumble of diverse phenomena in labor markets.

The notion that increasing full incomes, or changing tax rates, will lead

households to mix market work and leisure, cr market and home work, does

explain the facts, and it has interesting implications for such other aspects

of labor—market behavior as earnings inequal it>' and the util it>' loss that

results from unemployment. Whether the theory proposed is valid can really

                                     -   14 -
           only be tested on microeconornic data. We have offered several possible tests

           of the theory others, such as that presented by Heinz K&nig inhis comment.

           can be developed. With sufficient testing on micro data the validity of the

           hypothesis may be tested. The relative importance of changes in full incomes

           and changinq tax incentives in stirnulatinQ the growth 0-f the demand for mixed

           leisure can be determined too.

1. Even the data on Japan are somewhat misleading, as they show total
participation, including those employed in work for the market performed at
home When only work outside the home is included, the participation rate of
Japanese women is also seen to have risen

2. In some of the countries for which the data are presented the comparisons
are between business—cycle peaks, implying that this is not merely a cyci ical
phenomenon.

3. The comparability of the data for the U.S. to those for other countries is
questionable, as the U.S. data, uni ike the others, are based on the monthly
CPS.

4. See Jackson (1984) for some very clear evidence on this.
5. If participation rates are diverging over time in some countries and
converging in others, JDEV will be a bad measure of convergence. In only one
of the 15 countries shown in Table I do they not converge, so this is not a
problem here.

6. Clearly there is some simultaneity here, as we have shown that higher real
wages will increase convergence if income effects on the demand for leisure
dominate substitution effects. If we had data on unearned income across
countries over time we could treat the simultaneity issue properly. Absent
that, we assume that our one—equation model is identified by another equation
that includes changes in unearned income as an exogenous variable.

7. Berndt—Wood (1979), among others, have shown that energy arid capital are
p—complements in production; thus the growth of energy use per capita is a
proxy for the growth of the capital—labor ratio.

8. The energy and GNP data are from World Bank, LJI 1± RE±;
1983.

9. These results do not reflect out] iers; rank correlations of JDEY and JGNP
are also significantly positive in each of the three samples.

10. Empirical evidence of such a differential is provided by Lucas (1977) and
Duncan—Stafford (1980::.

11 . See Grossman (1973) for ev i dence on th i   phenomenon from the Lin i ted
States.
