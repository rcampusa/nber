Financing Consumption in an Aging Japan: The Roles of Foreign Capital Inflows and
Immigration

JEL No. F2, F3, F4

                                           ABSTRACT

We project the impact of demographic change on Japanese capital flows by simulating the impact

of population aging on Japanese saving and investment rates. As aging depresses saving rates, in our

baseline projections, we show that by 2015, foreign capital inflows will comprise about 15 percent

of Japanese output. A distinguishing feature of this paper is that we compare the capital flows that

occur without immigration to the capital inflows that would occur with immigration of 400,000

people annually. With the larger labor force from immigration and the larger induced capital

accumulation, output will be 22 percent higher by 2020, and 50 percent higher by 2040. The higher

output means that less capital needs to be imported; by 2015, Japan will be importing only 8 percent

of its output.

 1. Introduction.

           Over the next several decades, Japan’s population will be aging rapidly. In 1955, only

 5.5 percent of the population was 65 years or older; by 1998, 16.2 percent were elderly.

 Projections imply large increases in the elderly in the next 20 years; by 2015, 25 percent of the

 population will be 65 or above. Declining fertility is the principal source of the changing

 demographic patterns (Takayama, 1998). In the years following the Second World War, the

 total fertility rate in Japan rose to about 4 by 1950. However, fertility declined sharply during

 the 1970s and 1980s. It was 2.1 per household in 1974, but 1.4 per household by 1997. The

 total fertility rate is expected to remain at about 1.4 over the next several decades.1 Moreover,

 Japan has typically allowed only a small number of immigrants, who, especially in English-

 speaking countries, have helped to keep the population young.

           A key question is how consumption in an aging population can be sustained. The

 elderly consume, but do not supply the labor that leads to higher output. Thus, as the

 population ages, the share of consumption in output increases. If domestic output is

 insufficient to sustain consumption in an aging population, capital must be imported. In this

 paper, we revisit the impact of demographic change on Japanese capital outflows and inflows.

 We show that the aging population will decrease both saving and investment rates, but the

 decline in saving rates will be more severe, leading to current account deficits and foreign

 capital inflows. In our baseline projections, we show that by 2015, foreign capital inflows will

 comprise about 15 percent of output.

           We project the impact of demographic change on Japanese capital flows by simulating

       1

Japan: 2001-2050,” which is based on the 2000 population census.

the impact of aging on Japanese saving and investment rates. In our simulations, we adopt the

standard small-country, open capital markets, Ramsey optimal growth model. Specifically, we

follow Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers’ (1990) modifications to the Ramsey growth

model, in examining the impact of changing demographics on saving and investment. Our

main innovation is that while Cutler et. al.’s work focused on the closed-economy, we focus on

the open-economy, so that capital inflows into Japan can be explicitly modeled.

        Past work projecting the impact of demographic change on Japan’s saving-investment

balance are voluminous; see for example Horioka (1991, 1992), Oishi and Yashiro (1997),

Auerbach et. al. (1989), Miles and Cerney (2001), McKibbin and Nguyen (2001) and many

others. The distinguishing feature of our work is that in our projections, we compare the

capital flows that will occur without immigration, to the inflows that occur with immigration.

Consistent with the United Nation’s recommendations, we assume that from 2005 to 2040,

Japan will allow 400,000 immigrants annually. With the larger labor force from immigration

and the larger induced capital accumulation, output in 2000 will be 22 percent higher by 2020,

and 50 percent higher by 2040. The higher output means that less capital needs to be imported.

In our projections with immigration, by 2015, Japan will be importing only about 8 percent of

its output. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first paper to simulate the effect of

increased immigration into Japan, on that country’s saving-investment balances.

       The benefits of immigration into Japan are a hotly debated topic. While in recent

centuries, Japan has virtually allowed no immigrants, immigration has been massive in some

previous centuries. Some anthropologists believe that the import of wet-rice cultivation, and of

iron and bronze tools and implements from China and Korea during the Yayoi period (400
                                                                                                  4

B.C. to 300 A.D.) were accompanied by massive or at least modest immigration from those

two countries (Seki, 2000). Japan’s population at the beginning of the Yayoi period was

estimated to be between 75 and 250 thousand; the population grew 70-fold during the Yayoi

period. Some anthropologists also believe that during the Kofun period (300 A.D. to 700

A.D.), Korean, but not Chinese, immigration was extensive (Diamond, 1998). These Korean

immigrants brought Buddhism, writing, horseback riding, and new ceramic and metallurgical

techniques.

       Our simulation model also requires that we project government finances. We show that

the aging of the population will worsen government finances, as healthcare and social security

spending soar. In our baseline simulations, we show that Japanese taxes would need to increase

from 28 percent of GDP to almost 50 percent of GDP by 2040 to cover the current Japanese

government net debt, and the future government spending. With immigration, social security

and healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP will be lower, meaning that future tax

increases can be lower. We show that with immigration, the Japanese tax-GDP ratio would

need to increase to only 45 percent by 2040.

       This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the demographic

changes undergoing in Japan, and present the Japanese government’s demographic projections.

We then show how Japan’s future demographic profile would improve when 400,000 annual

immigrants are allowed. In Sections 3 and 4, we digress briefly to describe the institutional

characteristics of the Japanese social security system. We show that in practice, the Japanese

social security accounts are inextricably intertwined with the general budget of the Japanese

government; and that it is difficult to separate the Japanese social security accounts from the
                                                                                                  5

 general government budget. This justifies the assumption in our model that there are no

 dedicated social security payroll taxes; and that all taxation can be summarized by a lump-sum

 distortionary tax. In Section 5, we simulate the impact of demographic change on future

 Japanese saving and investment rates, government deficits, and net capital inflows, both

 without and with immigration. Section 6 concludes.



 2. Aging, Immigration, and Support Ratios.

           Figure 1 plots the Japanese government’s projections of the country’s population and

 the percentage of the total population that is elderly.2 Japan’s population is expected to decline

 from the 2000 peak of 124 million to 122 million by 2010, and then gradually decline to about

 100 million by about 2050. The labor force (age 20-64) is projected to fall from 75 million in

 2000 to 50 million in 2050.

           The percentage of the population over the age of 65 has grown rapidly, especially since

 1980, and now stands at about 15 per cent. By 2020, that percentage should approach 28

 percent, and by 2050, 33 per cent. These rates of population aging are much higher than in

 other countries. For example, in the U.S., only about 15 per cent of the population will be

 above the age of 65 by 2025.




 Immigration into Japan.



       2
        The figures for 1955-99 were calculated from data presented in Japan’s Statistical
Yearbook. The figures from 2000-2050 were calculated from the medium projections of the
population by age group presented in the Ministry of Health and Welfare (2002).
                                                                                                    6

           Between 1970 and the mid-1980s, Japan annually allowed between 20 and 30 thousand

 immigrants.3 During the late 1980s and early 1990s, because of the severe shortage of labor,

 annual immigration increased to about 70 to 90 thousand, but that number declined in recent

 years. In terms of stocks, Japan’s immigrant population numbered 1.5 million, or 1.2 percent of

 the population, with perhaps another 500 thousand in illegal immigrants in 1997. This is

 contrasted with the United States, which in the same year, had a stock of 26 million legal

 immigrants, or 9.7 percent of the population. Annual flows of legal immigrants to the U.S. is

 about 1 million (0.4 percent of the population), with an additional estimated illegal immigrant

 flow of 1 million.

           The United Nations Population Division (1998) projects that to keep the size of the

 Japanese population constant at today’s level of 125 million, Japan would need an average of

 400,000 immigrants per year between 2005 and 2050. In our projections of the Japanese

 population structure with immigration, we assume that 200 thousand men and 200 thousand

 women immigrate annually. They are assumed to be equally divided between the age groups of

 20-24 and 25-29. We also assume that all 20-24 year old immigrant couples have 2 children

 each within 5 years of their arrival in Japan.

           Under these assumptions, Figure 2 depicts the total population and the population over

age 65, with immigration. With immigration, the population peaks at 2015 at 135 million and

stays at about that level.4 The labor force is kept robust with immigration. The labor force is

projected to fall from 79 million to about 74 million in 2050.


       3
        The data on immigration are from Papademetriou and Hamilton (2001)
       4
        Our population projections are somewhat higher than the United Nations projections,
because we assume higher immigrant fertility rates.
                                                                                                7

       By 2050, the immigrants and their decedents will comprise about 18 percent of the total

population of the country. As immigrants reach age 65 after 2040, the elderly population

increases somewhat. The proportion of those over the age of 65 reaches 25 percent in 2020, and

29 percent in 2050. Thus, even with this immigration, the population of Japan will be

considerably older than in the United States.



The Support Ratio.

       Demographic shifts affect the economy’s consumption opportunities because they

change the relative sizes of the self-supporting and dependent populations. Following Cutler,

Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers (1990), we summarize these changes by the support ratio,

denoted by   α , which we define as the effective labor force, LF, divided by the number of
consumers, CON,

                                      α = LF / CON .

       The first issue in measuring the support ratio concerns the relative consumption needs of

people at different ages. We assume that all people have identical resource needs so that:

                                                99
                                      CON =     ∑N
                                                i =1
                                                       i,




where N i is the number of people of age i.


       The second issue concerns the effective labor force. We assume simply that all people
                                                                                                     8

aged 20-64 are in the labor force, while individuals 19 and under or 65 and over are not5:

                                                  64
                                          LF =   ∑N.
                                                 i = 20
                                                          i




This measure is used by the Japanese government in projecting the future labor force.

           Figure 3 plots the support ratios without (LF) and with immigration (LFIM).6 As the

population falls, the support ratio declines under both scenarios, but the decline in the support

ratio is steeper without immigration. Without immigration, the support ratio falls from 1.0 in

2000 to 0.86 in 2025 and 0.80 in 2050. With immigration, the support ratio falls from 1.0 in

2000 to 0.89 in 2025 and 0.86 in 2050.



3. Aging and the Japanese Social Security System.

           The Japanese social security system is two-tiered. The first-tier is the universal pension,

which provides a flat basic pension, currently averaging about 50 thousand yen. Enrollment is

mandatory for all Japanese residents, including immigrants, between the ages of 20 and 60. An



       5
         This is obviously a heroic assumption. The labor force participation rate of 20-24 year
olds is about 75 percent, because of continued attendance in college. Also, a significant fraction
of women between the ages of 25 and 64 (about 30 percent) are not in the labor force. In an
earlier paper, (Dekle, 2000), I calculated a labor force measure that recognizes that both human
capital and labor force participation rates vary by age and gender. I compared the support ratios
using the two labor force measures, and found that the support ratios have very similar patterns,
especially after 1995 (Dekle 2000; Figure 3). Given the similarity of the two support ratios, we
focus on the simpler support ratio above.
       6
         As the referee correctly points out, the quality of the immigrants may be low. Given the
lower quality of immigrants, more immigrants may be necessary. On the other hand, we have
shown above that differences in human capital do not significantly affect patterns in the support
ratio. Since in our model, the effect of demographics is entirely summarized by the support ratio,
the lower human capital of immigrants may not greatly impact our simulation values.
                                                                                                     9

interesting feature of the universal pension plan is that 1/3 (½ by 2004) of the benefits are paid

from the general budget of the government. The second-tier covers most employees, and

contributions are wage related. Presently, contributions are 13.6 percent of annual income,

shared equally between employee and employer. Average monthly benefits are about 180,000

yen. The Japanese social security system has built up a sizable trust fund–about 30 percent of

GDP–but is essentially a “pay-as-you-go” system.



Problems with the Japanese Social Security System.

Intergenerational Inequality.

           One characteristic of pay-as-you-go social security systems is that when the population

ages, the elderly receive more from the system than they pay into the system. In turn, younger

generations pay more into the system than they receive from the system. The main reason why

pay-as-you-go social security leads to intergenerational inequality is that when population

growth rates decline, taxes must increase or benefits must decline to keep social security intakes

approximately equal to payouts. Thus, in the face of an aging population, the Japanese

government has repeatedly raised payroll taxes and cut social security payout ratios in an

attempt to keep the future system intact.7

           These policy changes have hurt future generations. Takayama and Kitamura (1999)

identified large intergenerational imbalances in Japan, with future generations expected to pay

about 3-4 times more in net taxes and social security contributions than the generation currently

in retirement. Hatta and Oguchi (1999, p. 5) calculate that people born in 1935 receive about

       7
        For example, social security payroll taxes as a percentage of income was 3 percent in
1979, and 17.4 percent in 2002. It is projected to be 26.2 percent of income in 2035.
                                                                                                10

3.8 times what they paid; and people born in 2010 receive only about 60 percent of what they

paid.



Unfunded Social Security Liabilities.

         Another consequence of slowing population growth under pay-as-you-go social security

is the accumulation of unfunded government liabilities. Although the government has in recent

years--especially in 1999-- raised payroll taxes and reduced future benefits, unfunded liabilities

have continued to accumulate. The government bases its future projections of the social security

balance on assumptions regarding future demographics, income growth, and interest rates.

Based on these assumptions, the government determines its projected payroll taxes and benefits;

so as to keep the annual flows of social security intakes and payouts approximately equal.

However, some analysts have argued that the government’s assumptions are over-optimistic,

and that the projected payroll taxes and benefits will lead to annual deficits (Nishizawa, 2003;

Chand and Jaeger, 1996).

         The present value of these annual deficits do not appear on the government’s balance

sheets, and are called unfunded social security liabilities. Chand and Jaeger (1996) estimate the

present (2000) value of Japan’s unfunded social security liabilities as 110 percent of GDP.

Hatta and Oguchi (1999) estimate the present value of unfunded liabilities as 140 percent of

GDP. On an optimistic note, the IMF estimates that the 1999 government pension reforms have

reduced government unfunded social security liabilities to about 30 percent of GDP (IMF,

2000).

         There are several reasons for the continued accumulation of unfunded liabilities.
                                                                                                    11

First, the government’s demographic projections have consistently underestimated the pace of

future population aging; because of rapidly declining fertility rates, and lengthening life-spans.

The total fertility rate has declined from 2.1 per household in 1975 to 1.33 per household in

2001. Meanwhile, male life expectancies have increased from 72 in 1975 to 78 in 2001. Since

demographic projections are based on current fertility rates and life-spans, adverse movements

in these variables make demographic projections over-optimistic. Based on these demographic

projections, tax rates have turned out to be too low, and benefits, too high, resulting in large

unfunded liabilities.

           Second, is government’s inability to get a good interest rate on the social security trust

fund. The government’s projections assume a 4.5 percent interest rate on the social security

trust fund. Since there were relatively few aged until now, the social security system ran

persistent surpluses, and the trust fund reached 150 trillion yen (30 percent of GDP) by end-

2002. Until 2001, these funds were by law invested in government investment projects through

the fiscal investment and loan program; and earned the interest rate on government bonds,

which recently yielded about 0.7 percent. Since 2001, the social security trust fund has been

allowed to invest in financial markets, although asset allocations have been legally prescribed.8

Given the weakness of Japanese financial markets, the fund earned a minus 2.5 percent in 2001.

It appears unlikely that the government will be able to earn rates of return approaching 4.5

percent, which means less income from the social security trust fund; and larger unfunded

liabilities.

           Finally, there has recently been a sharp increase in non-payments of social security

       8
         The prescribed asset allocations are 68 percent domestic bonds; 12 percent domestic
stocks; 7 percent foreign bonds; 8 percent foreign stocks; and 5 percent domestic deposits.
                                                                                                   12

payroll taxes and other social security contributions. As in other countries, participation in the

social security system in Japan is mandatory.9 However, Nishizawa (2003, p. 63) calculates that

nearly 40 percent of those required to participate in the social security system fail to pay taxes

or contributions. These non-payers include the unemployed, the self-employed refusing to pay

contributions, and those with incomes so low that they are excused from paying contributions.

The existence of these non-payers results in a increase in unfunded liabilities.



Recently Enacted or Proposed Social Security Reform Measures.

           Recent social security reform measures have focused on reducing the intergenerational

inequality, and unfunded social security liabilities. In 1999, the Japanese government enacted

their latest social security reform measures. These reforms: 1) cut the future level of benefits

across the board by 5 percent in real terms ; 2) scheduled a gradual increase in the age of

eligibility of social security benefits from 60 today to 61 in 2013 and 65 by 2030; and 3)

eliminated the automatic indexing of social security benefits to increases in the real wage.

Japanese authorities have claimed that without these reforms, payroll taxes would need to

increase to 35 percent by 2025; but with the reforms, payroll taxes would need to increase to

only 28 percent.

           Many private sector analysts have argued that these measures do not fundamentally

resolve the problems of the social security system. As pointed out above, the government’s

demographic assumptions appear over-optimistic; with more realistic assumptions, payroll taxes



       9
         However, not everyone paying contributions is eligible to receive social security
benefits. Current law says that if the total payment period is less than 25 years, the participant is
not eligible to receive full benefits
                                                                                                    13

will have to increase substantially, leading to greater intergenerational inequality, and larger

unfunded social security liabilities. Overwhelmingly, private sector analysts recommend a shift

from the current pay-as-you-go system to a fully-funded system.

       Hatta and Oguchi (1999) are perhaps the strongest proponents of this shift to a fully-

funded system. In shifting from the current pay-as-you-go system to the fully-funded system,

they recommend the following process. They first recommend that the government fully fund

the amount of unfunded social security liabilities by issuing bonds. Their reasoning is that the

funding of these liabilities are not just the responsibility of future wage earners, but also the

responsibility of all citizens. In fact, they recommend that these bonds be covered by increased

consumption taxes, which would be levied on the elderly as well. Next they recommend that the

benefits of future retirees be cut by 20 percent; and that future payroll taxes be lowered to make

the system actuarily fair. The portion of the benefits of the current retirees that should have

been paid by payroll taxes on the currently working are thus unfunded and should be covered by

increased consumption taxes.



4. Social Security and Overall Government Spending in Our Model.

       Our approach differs from the traditional approach in modeling the Japanese social

security system. First, unlike in Hatta and Oguchi (1999), Nishizawa (2003), Japanese Ministry

of Welfare and Labor (2001) and others, we do not estimate the amount of unfunded social

security liabilities. To do so would require separately projecting social security benefits, and in

particular, dedicated social security payroll taxes. Thus, in our model, we do not differentiate

between dedicated social security payroll taxes and other forms of taxation. Our view is that in
                                                                                                  14

practice, Japanese social security accounts cannot be separated from the overall Japanese

government budget.

        Some of the social security benefits, and much of the excess social security payroll taxes

(i.e., social security trust fund) are today inextricably intertwined with the general government

budget. As noted, as much as 50 percent of the benefits of the basic pension will be (from 2004)

subsidized from the general government budget. In addition, most analysts expect that as

unfunded liabilities mount, this rate of subsidy will increase. For example, as mentioned, Hatta

and Oguchi (1999) recommend that all of the currently projected unfunded social security

liabilities should be paid for by the general government budget (consumption taxes).

        Moreover, part of the social security trust fund (about 80 percent) is mixed in with other

government borrowing-- like postal saving deposits--to finance the massive Fiscal Investment

and Loan Program. Hoshi and Doi (2003) estimate that over 50 percent of government funds in

FILP are irrecoverable, which means that some of the social security trust fund is irrecoverable.

Money to replace these irrecoverable loans must come from the general government budget.

        Second, unlike in Hatta and Oguchi (1999) and Takayama and Kitamura (1999), we will

not be concerned with the redistributive effects of the social security system, and the

intergenerational inequality that arises from the system. In our model, we assume that Japanese

households are Ricardian. If the elderly raise their bequests to completely offset the costs to the

young of the higher burden of social security, then the higher burden of social security has no

redistributive effects.

        Our model only requires that we project overall government spending patterns by age

group. In our projections, we focus on the three largest social expenditures: social security,
                                                                                                 15

healthcare, and education. For social security, we divide average social security expenditures in

1996-99 by the population over age 60. For healthcare, we allocate average healthcare spending

in 1996-99 to different ages, using the age-specific expenditure patterns reported in Ishi (2000).

For education, we divide total education spending in 2000 by the population between the ages 5

and 20.

          For healthcare and education, we assume that age-specific expenditure patterns remain

at the same real level between 2000 and 2040. For social security, we assume that the age of

eligibility gradually increases from 60 to 65 in 2030, but once eligible, the age-specific benefits

remain the same as today in real terms (in accordance with the 1999 reform). That is, if the

average 67 year old receives 180 thousand yen in social security benefits in 2000, an average 67

year old receives the same inflation adjusted amount in 2035. Other government spending,

mainly defense, policing, and administration, are assumed to always equal the average 1996-99

ratio to GDP of 5.6 percent.

          Demographic shifts can significantly alter the patterns and overall levels of government

spending. Tables 1 and 2 depict the projections of total government spending in 1995 yen and as

a share of projected GDP without and with immigration. Without immigration (Table 1),

government spending rises from 25 percent of GDP in 2000 to 28 percent in 2015, and 33

percent in 2035. While education spending is projected to decline, healthcare, and especially

social security spending, are projected to increase sharply, as the population ages. In particular,

in 2035, the population over 65 increases significantly, leading to sharp increases in social

security and healthcare spending.

          With 400,000 annual immigrants (Table 2), government spending rises from 25 percent
                                                                                                 16

of GDP in 2000 to 27 percent in 2015, but falls thereafter to 22 percent in 2040. Government

spending as a proportion of GDP falls, because while immigration raises the level of

government spending somewhat, immigration sharply boosts the level of Japanese GDP,

resulting in a fall in the ratio of government spending to GDP. The immigration-induced

increase in the labor force and in capital accumulation raises the projected Japanese annual real

GDP growth rate between 2000 and 2040 from 0 percent without immigration to 1.1 percent

with immigration. These growth rates mean that output in 2020 will be 22 percent higher by

2020, and 50 percent higher by 2040 with immigration.

           With immigration, the absolute levels of health care and education spending increase, as

immigrants also require healthcare and especially, education services for their children. The

absolute level of social security spending increases after 2035 as some of the immigrants start to

retire.



5. Demographic Change, Government Deficits, and Optimal Capital Flows.

           Here we simulate the impact of aging and of immigration on future Japanese saving and

investment rates, and government spending and deficits. In our simulations, we adopt the

standard small-country, open capital markets, Ramsey optimal-growth model (Barro and Sali-i-

Martin, 1995, Ch. 3). Specifically, we closely follow Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers’

(1990) modifications to the Ramsey model, in examining the impact of changing demographics

on savings and government deficits.10 With the model, we can examine how a society can

          10
         The Ramsey model assumes that households are dynastic–they care about their
children’s and grandchildren’s welfare (utility) as much as their own. Of course, an important
implication of dynastic households is that Ricardian equivalence holds; government debt does
not affect the intergenerational distribution of wealth.
                                                                                                         17

adjust its saving, investment, capital inflows, and government deficits, in response to changes in

demographic variables, summarized by the support ratio.



(i). Behavior of Firms.

        We begin with the production function of a representative firm that uses both private

and public capital as inputs:

                                 y t = k$ t γ m
                                              $ t γ α 1− λ e ht                           (1)


where y t is gross output per population (capita), k$ t is the private capital stock per effective


            $ t is the public capital stock per effective population, and
population, m                                                                  h is the constant rate of
labor augmenting technical progress. We assume constant returns to scale in private and public

capital, so that (1 − λ ) = 2γ . In the above production function, public capital is essential for the


productivity of private capital–ie., public capital is not wasteful. This goes against conventional

wisdom regarding the wastefulness of recent public investment in Japan. In our production

function, we are mostly concerned with the productivity of public capital over the long run

(over decades), and public investment was certainly productive in Japan in the past (1960s and




       There is a large literature testing whether the dynastic model is applicable for Japan(for a
review, see Horioka, 2001). The dynastic model can be contrasted with the life-cycle model, in
which households do not care about their children. Thus, in the life-cycle model, households
bring down their wealth (dissave) in old age. On the whole, the empirical tests support the
dynastic model, and reject the life-cycle model. The Japanese elderly, on average, leave large
bequests to their children, and this appears to be motivated by altruism towards the next
generation.
                                                                                                           18

‘70s), and may be productive again in the future.11

         Note that when k$ t , m
                               $ t and the support ratios are constant, output per capita also grows

at a constant rate h. When the support ratio is falling, however, output per capita grows at a

slower rate than h.

         The supply of private capital available to the firm depends on the global capital market;

the marginal product of capital must equal r +          δ , where r is the gross international real interest

rates, and    δ is the rate of depreciation. We have:
                                                                       v
                                 k$ t = ( r + δ )(avα 1t − λ ) −1 m
                                                                  $ 1t − v ,                         (2)


and thus private investment per capita is:

                                        &
                                 i$t = k$t + (nt + h + δ ) k$t .                                     (3)


where n t is the population growth rate Thus, the paths of private capital and private investment


are solely determined by the real interest rate, the rates of growth of the labor force and

population, technical progress, and the path of public capital.

         The government adjusts the level of public capital by changing the public investment

rate, $jt :




        11
          It is difficult to predict the future efficiency of public investment. Japan, however, lags
behind the U.S. in public research and development ( R & D), including R & D in universities.
Branstetter and Nakamura (2003) argue that greater public R & D spending can boost Japanese
growth. Thus, future government public capital, especially R & D that is embedded in public
capital, may be productive.

(ii) Behavior of Consumers.

         The consumption rate is determined from “forward-looking” household behavior.

Assume that households wish to maximize their lifetime utility, U, given by12:

                                     c1−θ nt − ρt
                                      ∞

                               U=∫          e e dt                                  (5)
                                 0 (1 − θ )



where c is consumption per capita, 1 / θ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and   ρ is

the pure rate of time preference.

         The budget constraint for households (in per-capita terms) is:

                                                           qτ t2
                        a&t = α t wt + (r − nt )at − τ t −                          (6)
                                                            2


where   at is total assets per capita, which is comprised of private capital, government bonds,



        12
         In an insightful paper, Barro (1974) showed that Ricardian equivalence can prevail in
the overlapping generations model with bequests, even though each individual is mortal. Even
though each individual cares directly only about his immediate descendant, this is enough to link
him to all future generations. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002, p. 175-177) presents the exact
conditions that are required to collapse the overlapping generations model to the single
representative agent model, as in our paper. Thus, the infinite-horizon utility function, (5) is
consistent with our earlier definition of the support ratio, in which agents die when they reach
100 years.
                                                                                                         20

and foreign assets, which are perfect substitutes in international portfolios; w t are wages; and


τ t is the lump-sum tax imposed on each person each period by the government.           This lump-sum


                                                qτ t2
tax also imposes a “deadweight” welfare loss of          per person.
                                                 2


        It can be shown (see Appendix) that consumption per capita also always grows at h.

Thus, while consumption per capita grows at h, when the support ratio is declining, output per

                                                                       ct
capita tends to grow at less than h (see ii). The consumption rate,       is rising, lowering the
                                                                       yt



private saving rate.



(iii) The Government Budget Constraint and Government Behavior.

        Each period, the government issues government bonds of,        b&   to cover shortfalls in tax

revenues:

                       b&t = (r − nt )bt − τ t + gt + jt                                  (7)


where   bt is government bonds outstanding per capita.   The increase in government bonds per


capita is higher, the larger is the primary fiscal deficit, which is the difference between tax

revenues per capita, and the sum of government consumption gt and public investment              jt per
                                                                                                  21

capita. As in Cutler, et. al. (1990), we assume that gt is determined by age-specific patterns of


government consumption, as presented in Tables 1 (without immigration) and 2 (with

immigration).13

         It can be shown (see Appendix) that the government will choose to levy a per capita

lump-sum tax of τ t that grows at the rate of consumption per capita growth, h. The government


must then satisfy the following intertemporal budget constraint:

                           ∞                    ∞

                        τ 0 ∫ e R t dt = b 0 + ∫ (g t + jt ) R t dt
                               ht
                                                                                     (8)
                           0                    0




where   b0 is the government debt outstanding per person today, and Rt is a discount factor.   This


budget constraint says that the present value of tax revenues must equal the present value of

government consumption plus public investment. If government tax revenues are insufficient to

cover government spending today, then in the future, tax revenues must exceed government

spending for the government to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint.

        As in Clarida (1993), we assume that the government maximizes lifetime household

utility (5), with respect to ct and $jt subject to the constraints. We simulate the model using


plausible parameter values, projected future support ratios without immigration, LF, and with

immigration, LFIM, and future rates of population and labor force growth without and with




        13
         We also assume that gt either yields no utility to households, or that government
benefits do not affect the household’s optimal choice of private consumption.
                                                                                                     22

immigration.

        In the simulations, we allow support ratios and rates of population and labor force

growth to change every five years. Details of the simulation are given in the Appendix. For

comparability with actual National Accounts Data, we express our simulations in terms of ratios

to GDP. We calibrate our model so that the starting year (2000) corresponds to the average of

the actual data between 1996-99. For the initial government debt-GDP ratio, we use the ratio of

net debt-GDP, inclusive of the social security net assets (=45 percent of GDP). We account for

net future social security unfunded liabilities by explicitly incorporating future social security

benefits and contributions into our model.



(iv) Projections of Optimal Government Deficits and Capital Flows: Without

Immigration.

     Table 3 presents our projections without immigration. Private saving rates decline about

10 percentage points until 2010, and then decline rapidly from 2010 to 2040. This pattern is a

result of shifts in the support ratio and increases in tax rates, which reduce disposable income.

Although consumption per capita always grows at a constant rate of h (=1.2 percent), as the

support ratio falls, output per capita growth is lower. This raises the consumption rate and

lowers the private saving rate. Essentially, consumers are seeking to smooth their consumption

when income is growing very slowly by lowering their saving rates.

       Under tax smoothing, taxes per capita increase at a constant rate, while output per capita

grows at a slower rate; thus the tax-GDP ratio rises over time. However, the actual tax rate in

the starting year (average, 1996-99) at 28 percent of GDP, is lower than what is necessitated by
                                                                                                  23

tax smoothing (33 percent) and the satisfaction of the government’s intertemporal budget

constraint. That is, unless current tax rates are increased, the government will not be able to

satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint. We allow taxes per capita to increase more rapidly

between 2000 to 2015, and then smooth increases in taxes per capita from 2015 onwards. The

sharp increases in tax rates between 2000 and 2015 also contributes to the decline in private

saving rates, by lowering disposable income. By 2040, tax rates need to increase to almost 50

percent of GDP, for the government to recoup its current outstanding net debt of 45 percent of

GDP, and to cover its increased future spending.

       Government saving rates rise from about 1-2 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 11

percent in 2040, owing to increased tax receipts. Private and public investment rates gradually

fall over time, as the need to equip workers with capital equipment declines. Because of high

government saving and falling public investment, the fiscal surplus (government saving minus

public investment) turns positive after 2020. Consequently, the government net debt-GDP ratio

increases until 2020, and falls thereafter.

       The decrease in private saving is sharper than the increase in government saving,

resulting in a fall in total saving between 2000 and 2040. The total saving rate declines from

about 30 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2015, and then rises to 15 percent in 2040, as the

government saving rate rises. The total investment rate declines from 28 percent in 2000 to 25

percent in 2015, 23 percent in 2030, and 22 percent in 2040. Thus, the decline in total saving is

sharper than the decline in total investment, leading to larger current account deficits. Japan’s

current account surplus is projected to become negative in 2005, and sharply negative from then

onwards. Part of Japan’s domestic consumption will be financed from international capital
                                                                                                   24

inflows from about 2005. By 2015, foreign capital inflows are projected to be 15 percent of

Japan’s GDP. This ratio declines to about 8 percent by 2040, as government saving increases..



(v) Projections of Optimal Government Deficits and Capital Flows: With Immigration.

       Table 4 presents our projections with immigration of 400,000 people a year. Private

saving rates decline about 8 percentage points until 2010. The decline in private saving between

2010 and 2040, however, is milder with immigration than without, owing to improvements in

the support ratio, especially after 2015. By 2040, private saving rates decline to about 7 percent

of GDP.

       With immigration, the growth in GDP is higher, and projected government spending as a

percentage of GDP is smaller, meaning that tax rates can be lower. However, even with lower

tax rates, the actual tax rate in the starting year (average, 1996-99) at 28 percent of GDP, is

below what is necessitated by tax smoothing (33 percent), and the satisfaction of the

government’s intertemporal budget constraint. Thus, again, we allow taxes per capita to

increase more rapidly between 2000 to 2015, and then smooth increases in taxes per capita from

2015 onwards. By 2040, tax rates need to increase to only 45 percent of GDP-- instead of

almost 50 percent without immigration--for the government to satisfy its intertemporal budget

constraint.

       Government saving rates rise from about 1-2 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 12

percent in 2040, owing to increased tax receipts. Private and public investment rates gradually

fall over time, but the decline is less rapid with immigration, as the labor force stays roughly

constant from 2005. The government net debt-GDP ratio increases until 2020-25, and falls
                                                                                                    25

rapidly thereafter.

       The decrease in the private saving rate is larger than the increase in the government

saving rate, resulting in a fall in the total saving rate between 2000 and 2040. The total saving

rate declines from about 30 percent in 2000 to 16 percent in 2020, but bounces back to 19

percent by 2040, as government saving rises. Total investment declines from 28 percent in 2000

to 24 percent in 2030-40. The current account deficit, while worsening to 10 percent of GDP in

2020, improves to a deficit of only 5 percent of GDP by 2040, as the government saving rate

increases.



6. Conclusion.

       Many previous papers (Horioka (1991, 1992), Oishi and Yashiro (1997), Auerbach et.

al. (1989), Miles and Cerney (2001), McKibbin and Nguyen (2001) and others) have projected

the impact of demographic change on the Japanese saving-investment balance and on capital

inflows, although papers projecting future Japanese government budget balances are fewer.

Despite the variety of methodologies and modeling assumptions, most earlier papers–like our

paper–project declining saving and investment rates, with saving rates declining faster than

investment rates, leading to current account deficits and capital inflows. On the whole, the

previous papers predict deteriorating government budget balances, unless there is drastic fiscal

reform. The proposed fiscal reforms in the previous papers range from tax increases to cuts in

social security benefits and public investment. In our paper, we have focused on tax increases.

     A unique feature of our work is that we also examine scenarios in which the government

allows sizable immigration (400,000 immigrants per year from 2005 to 2040) into Japan. We
                                                                                                26

show that with immigration, Japan’s projected capital inflows as a percentage of GDP will be

much smaller, since the higher labor force will be able to raise Japan’s GDP, to help sustain its

growing elderly population. With the larger labor force from immigration, Japanese output in

2020 will be 22 percent higher by 2020, and 50 percent higher by 2040. Finally, with

immigration, social security and healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP will be lower,

meaning that future tax increases can be smaller.

Appendix:

        For convenience, we carry out the analysis in terms of effective population. The data for

the population, n t and the labor force, z t (and therefore, α t ) are available only every 5 years.


Thus, we assume that n t and z t discretely change only every five years; within any 5-year


interval, say 2005 to 2010, n t and z t are assumed to be constant. From 2050 onwards, we


assume that the values for 2050 hold.

        From (1), real wages per effective population are:

                                          w$ t = (1 − γ ) y$ t

        In addition, we assume that there are adjustment costs to adjusting public capital,

reflecting political lobbying costs, and bureaucratic implementation lags,

                                                     χ $j
                                adj cos ts = $jt (1 + ( t )) ,                        (A1)
                                                       $t
                                                     2 m




where χ reflects the costs of adjustment.

        The government (or optimal planner) maximizes (5), in terms of effective population,

with respect to (4), (6), (7), (8), and (A1).



Optimal Consumption.

        The optimal path of consumption per effective population is:

                                 c&$ 1
                                    = *( r − ρ − θ g) .
                                 c$ θ
                                                                                                                       28

         To prevent consumption per effective labor from approaching zero asymptotically, we

assume that r = ρ + θ g , so that consumption per effective population is flat, or that


consumption per capita grows at rate h. For h, we take, 0.012 (from Jorgenson and Nishimizu,

1978). Consumption per effective population at time 0, c$ (0) , (in our case, the year 2000),


depends in a complicated way on the parameters of the lifetime utility function, and the entire

future paths of n t , α t , τ$ t , g$ t , $jt , w
                                                $ t , the parameters r, h, and the starting values, a$ 0 ,and b$ 0 .


Rather than calculating c$ (0) , we assume that the actual level of consumption per capita


between 1996 and 1999 (in the data) was at or near the optimal level. (Of course, we are not

assuming that the Japanese economy was in steady-state between 1990-1999; we are only

assuming that consumers were optimizing in 1996-1999).



Optimal public and private investment, output.

         The optimal path of public capital per effective population is:

                             &$
                             m       1 φ
                                t
                                  = ( ( t − 1) − ( n t + h + δ )) ,                                    (A2)
                             m$t     χ µt



where µ t is the marginal utility of total assets, and φ t is the marginal utility of public capital.


Investment in public capital raises utility by raising output; on the other hand, investment in

                                                                                φt
public capital lowers utility because total assets decline. Thus,                  represents the shadow value
                                                                                µt
                                                                                                   29

                                  µ& t = ( r − n t − h)µ t                               (A3)

                                                                   − 1) 2

                              $ t , we discretize (A2), (A3), and (A4), and simulate the path of

µ$ t , φ$ t , and m
                  $ t forward, for plausible parameter values. For the parameters used in the


simulations, we take values culled from the literature. For γ , h, δ , r , and χ , we use 0.20,


0.012, 0.13,0.05, and 6. These values are fairly standard, except that since we have no

empirical data for the adjustment speed of public capital, we took the value 6 from the private

capital adjustment cost literature (Hayashi, 1982).

        Our simulation strategy is to start from 2000 (from the actual values in the data, 1996-

99), and simulate forward using the values of n t and α t . We imposed the condition that


φ (0) = µ (0) , and chose a value of φ (0) so that the path of m
                                                               $ t did not vary much from

m

                                                                             $ t , φ t , and
5 years. As it turned out, given our parameter values, new steady states for m


µ t were reached in about 5 years for all n t and α t .

       Finally, from the path of m


(1)) can be calculated . Thus, we can calculate the private and public investment rates, which

are depicted in Tables 3 and 4.



Optimal Government Taxes.

       It can be shown that c$ (0) is maximized when τ$ t is constant (Barro, 1979). That, is, the


government maximizes the path of consumption (and of utility) when lump-sum tax taxes per

effective population are constant, or that taxes per capita are growing at the rate h.

       Satisfaction of the government’s intertemporal budget constraint (8) means that the

present value of lump-sum taxes per effective population is equal to the present value of

government spending per effective population:

                                      ∞               ∞

value of τ$ , from our estimated (exogenous) path of g$ t (from Tables 1 and 2), and our


simulated path of $jt (from above). In practice, we truncate the integral at 2050, since beyond


that, g$ t and $jt are discounted to the extent that they are negligibly small. By dividing τ$ t by


y$ t , we obtain the tax rate. Finally, from c$ t (above), g$ t , $jt , y$ t and τ$ t , we can calculate the

private and public saving rates that are depicted in Tables 3 and 4.
