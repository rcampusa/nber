The Geopolitics of International Trade in Southeast Asia

                                         ABSTRACT

Motivated by the historically tense geopolitical situation in Southeast Asia, we simulate the
potential closure of key maritime waterways in the region to predict the impact on trade and
welfare. We generate initial (unobstructed) and counterfactual (rerouted) least-cost maritime
paths between trading countries, and use the distances of these routes in a workhorse model of
international trade to estimate welfare effects. We find heterogeneous and economically
significant reductions in real GDP, and show the magnitude of welfare loss is directly correlated
with military spending as a proportion of GDP, suggesting nations may be responding to
economic security threats posed by such potential conflicts.

1       Introduction

     Among other economic and environmental benefits, oceans are vital for the transport of
an overwhelming share of world trade. The long-held principle of the "freedom of the seas"
is crucial for safe and frictionless international movement of maritime cargo. At present,
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) is the international legal
framework around the freedom of the seas, establishing guidelines for resource extraction,
trade, and sovereignty over the oceans (UNCLOS, 1982). Importantly, the UNCLOS gives
nations territorial claims on waters up to 12 nautical miles offshore, but allows transit passage
(also called "innocent passage") for all countries' military and civilian ships through both
territorial waters and the high seas beyond.1
     In recent years, however, numerous geopolitical tensions and threats by state actors
seem to potentially impede freedom of movement through international waters. The Strait
of Hormuz, through which twenty percent of global oil supply flows, has witnessed multiple
attacks on oil tankers in 2019 amid the escalating confrontation between Iran and the United
States. In Southeast Asia, several nations have disputes over island chains in the South China
Sea. The efforts of China to transform offshore reefs and shoals into artificial islands and
build naval bases, as well as the "Freedom of Navigation Operations" by the U.S. and British
navies, have further heightened uncertainty in the region.2 These tensions were reflected by
a stand-off between Chinese and Vietnamese navy ships on July 2019 over geological surveys
in disputed waters.3
     This paper investigates the impact of a potential long-run disruption of navigation


1
    The principle of `freedom of the seas' dates back to a treatise by Dutch philosopher Hugo Grotius titled
    Mare Liberum (The Free Sea) published in 1609. In 1918, Woodrow Wilson argued for it as one of his
    Fourteen Points for peace negotiations after World War I (Wilson, 1918). The UNCLOS was signed 1982
    and most recently amended in 1994. The convention has been ratified by 167 states. To this date, a
    number of countries including the United States, Israel and Turkey refuse to sign the convention.

through the Southeast Asian sea lanes on trade and welfare. In particular, we simulate
a complete shutdown of maritime shipping through the South China Sea and all the
east-west passages in the Indonesian archipelago, causing shipping between the Pacific
and Indian oceans to reroute south of Australia. We do so by solving for the shortest
actual and counterfactual maritime trade routes between existing ports and the associated
sea distances using GIS software. Using the increased distances in a quantitative general
equilibrium model, we calculate the trade and welfare effects of moving from the initial to
the counterfactual state. Depending on parameterization, the average welfare loss from the
disruption of regional maritime trade ranges from 6.2 to 12.4 percent for the countries in
the East Asia, South East Asia, and Pacific regions. For these countries, the magnitude
of real GDP losses is also correlated with their military spending as a proportion of GDP,
suggesting that they respond to the perceived risk and cost of a possible conflict.
     Antecedent work on the rerouting of maritime trade falls into two lines. The first uses
the opening and closure of major canals as quasi-natural experiments to causally estimate
the effect of trade on incomes (Feyrer, 2009; Maurer and Rauch, 2019). The second line uses
these events to estimate distance elasticities of trade and quantify equilibrium trade and
welfare effects (Hugot and Dajud, 2016, 2017). To our knowledge, we are the first to apply
quantitative trade analysis to counterfactual scenarios involving the South China Sea.4



2       Data

     We limit our analysis to the 50 largest world economies according to the 2015 World
Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) data plus four economies relevant to the region
of interest but not in the top 50 (Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan). Removing

    Noer and Gregory (1996) provides an extensive documentation of the geography of Southeast Asia as it
    pertains to international shipping and discusses hypothetical scenarios involving the closing of key choke
    points in the region from an economic and military point of view.

the region assumed to be unnavigable in the counterfactual analysis. The dashed lines in the bottom panels are the maritime
routes between the ports of Los Angeles and Visakhapatnam. The solid lines connect London and Nagasaki. The bottom left

three landlocked countries from this group (Switzerland, Austria, and Czechia), we are left
with 51 economies which make up over 92% of world GDP.
     The geographic data on sea boundaries and port locations come from Natural Earth.5
For 41 countries, we use the largest sea port as the only point through which that country
engages in maritime trade. Ten countries in our sample have coasts on separate seas, so we
endow them with two ports.6

    These countries are Australia, Canada, Colombia, France, India, Israel, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
    and the US. Note that we place Russia's secondary port on the Black Sea, not the Sea of Japan or the
    Sea of Okhotsk, as there is limited overland transportation across Siberia. Largest ports for the countries
    in the sample are chosen according to World Port Rankings 2015, a dataset produced by the American
    Association of Port Authorities, available for download at www.aapa-ports.org/unifying/content.aspx?
    ItemNumber=21048.




                                                             3
     Figure 1 shows the 61 ports and the region that we focus on in our counterfactual exercise.
We use GIS software to calculate the shortest sea routes between all pairs of ports. In the
counterfactual scenario, we close the circle on the right panel to navigation. We choose
this "closed" zone to capture a scenario in which a large swath of the South China Sea the
waterways connecting the Pacific and Indian oceans are inaccessible due to conflict or other
military action. In particular, we do not allow trade through the passages along the northern
coast of Australia. The bottom panel of Figure 1 provides an example of how the closure
impacts the sea routes between two sets of ports. In our counterfactual scenario, almost
all of the trade that normally travels through the Malacca Strait or the South China Sea
instead passes south of Australia, substantially increasing the distance, and thus the trade
costs, between affected countries.7
     In the counterfactual, all maritime trade involving a port in the circle as source or
destination ceases. There are nine countries whose only ports are entirely within the closed
area: Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, and Vietnam.8 These countries are assumed to be completely cut off from maritime
shipping. They can still trade overland, but only with their neighbors, i.e., we assume away
airborne and transit overland trade beyond contiguous pairs. For example, Thailand?s port
is in the blocked area. In the counterfactual, it continues trading with its neighbors Malaysia,
Myanmar and Cambodia. Of these three neighbors, Myanmar?s port is not in the conflict
zone. We do not, however, allow Thailand to trade with third countries (such as the EU or
Japan) by re-routing through Myanmar.
     In addition to geographic data, we use the 2015 bilateral World Trade Flows data, which

    The waterways involved are the straits of Malacca, Sunda, Lombok, Ombai and Torres as well as the
    passage to the east of Timor Leste. Located between Australia, Indonesia and New Guinea, the Torres
    Strait is not a viable alternate route to the Malacca strait because it is not navigable by large vessels due
    to coral reefs and its very shallow depth.

    We refer to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China and Taiwan as countries
    because data on separate trade flows are available.

Feenstra's website.9 , 10 We also use data from Costinot and Rodr´

World Bank to calculate the share of expenditure on tradable domestic goods.11 Data on
shared borders and languages come from CEPII (Head et al., 2010). Finally, we use data on
military expenditures and conflict from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
and the Correlates of War Project (Sarkees and Wayman, 2010), respectively.12



3        Model

      As shown by Arkolakis et al. (2012), henceforth ACR, welfare losses due to higher trade
costs in a set of workhorse models of trade can be calculated using a sufficient statistic
under the same assumptions that make these models admit a structural gravity equation
describing bilateral trade flows. The sufficient statistic is the expenditure share of country
i on its domestic goods, ii . Changes in trade costs--in our case induced by increased
port-to-port distances or the shutdown of a country's maritime access--lead to changes in
countries' expenditure shares on purchases from all countries, including themselves. Given
the elasticity of trade with respect to trade costs , welfare change for each country is then
given by:
                                                                1

                                        ^ i  Wi =          ii         1
                                        W                           =^ ,                                 (1)
                                                                      i
                                             Wi            ii

where Wi and Wi are the welfare levels in country i before and after the change in trade
costs, respectively. Similarly, ii and ii are domestic expenditure shares before and after

10
     Since there is no data on trade flows by mode of transportation between a large sample of countries, we
     assume that all trade observed between non-neighboring countries in the data is seaborne. Given that
     the majority of world trade is maritime, this simplification is reasonable. We assume that trade between
     neighboring countries is overland and is thus not impacted by the closure of sea lines.

trade cost changes, respectively.
    In what follows, we assume an environment satisfying the restrictions in ACR, so that
the value of goods imported by country n from country i is given by

                                                   Yi Xn
                                          Xni =      ·   ·t ,                                 (2)
                                                   i n ni

where tni  1 is the cost of trade between the two countries, Yi is the income of country i,
and Xn =         i   Xni is the value of an importer's expenditure on all source countries. i and
n are the "multilateral resistance" terms capturing the general equilibrium forces:

                                          t iX                            tn Y
                                 i =               and n =                     .
                                                                           

Assuming away trade deficits, countries' incomes equal their exports in equilibrium:


                                             Yi =            Xni .
                                                      n


    Expenditure shares are in turn given by ni = Xni /Xn . Finally, a fixed supply of labor
Li is the sole factor of production in each country, so that labor earnings equal total income:
w i L i = Yi .


3.1      Estimating trade costs

    In order to solve the model and calculate its welfare implications, we first need to specify
and estimate trade costs tni and tni in the initial and counterfactual states, respectively. We
start with the canonical form:


                                                    I cont     I lang   I self
                                   tni = distni · b1
                                                     ni
                                                        · b2 ni · b3 ni ,                     (3)




                                                     6
where distni is the sea distance between countries n and i, and  is the distance elasticity of
                              cont      lang
trade costs. Dummy variables Ini   and Ini   are equal to one if the countries are contiguous
                                                                               self
and share a common language, respectively, and zero otherwise. Dummy variable Ini
capturing border effects is equal to one if n = i, and zero otherwise.
   We substitute equation (3) into (2), take logs and, following standard practice, estimate
the resulting equation with importer and exporter country fixed effects to capture the
multilateral resistance terms:


                                                  cont           lang           self
  ln(Xni ) = an + ai + ·  · ln(distni ) + · b1 · Ini   + · b2 · Ini   + · b3 · Ini   + ni .   (4)
                         =


   Bilateral distances used in the estimation of (4) are unconstrained sea distances associated
with the shortest maritime path between countries' ports. The problem of empirical zero
trade flows, which is incompatible with the standard gravity equation (4), is less acute in
our sample of the largest economies. Of the total 2,601 (= 512 ) possible combinations, only
17 flows are zero in the 2015 data that we use. Still, we estimate equation (4) using both
OLS and PPML specifications. In the OLS estimation, we use the 2,584 observations with
non-zero trade flows. In the PPML estimation, the dependent variable is in levels and zeros
are included. We also estimate (4) using only the sub-sample of non-contiguous pairs, so that
our use of sea distances is consistent with our assumption that all trade between contiguous
countries, and only trade between contiguous countries, is overland.
   Table 1 reports the results. The coefficient estimates are in line with the values typically
obtained in the literature (Head and Mayer, 2014). The coefficients on log of distance
estimated using PPML are significantly smaller (in absolute value) than the coefficients
estimated using OLS. This result is also consistent with the literature and the design of
PPML. In what follows, we report results using the parameters from column (3), the
PPML regression with all countries, as our preferred specification. Since  captures the
responsiveness of trade costs to increased sea distances in our counterfactual, using the

smallest elasticity among our estimates yields a conservative lower bound on welfare effects.
   Note that the closure of Southeast Asian waterways only impacts sea distances in the
specification of trade costs (3), but not the other bilateral variables. The change in trade
costs to the power of the trade elasticity from the baseline to the counterfactual is therefore
given by:

simulated increases in sea distances, we obtain bilateral t
to solve the model in changes and to predict the welfare effects.

4     Results

    Table 2 reports, for various values of the trade elasticity , the welfare effects of moving
from the initial to the counterfactual state for the 19 countries in our sample that are in
the World Bank's East Asia, South East Asia and Pacific regions. Since they are located in
the impacted region, these countries also rank at the top of welfare losses for all            values.
Maritime trade ceases for nine countries because their ports are located within the blocked
region: Cambodia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,




                                                9
Thailand, and Vietnam.13
      As expected, the nine countries with their ports located within the blocked region incur
the largest losses. For the baseline value of             = -5, Taiwan experiences a predicted real
income loss of 34 percent. The effects on Japan and Korea are between 2 and 3 percent.
Two countries outside this region also incur sizable welfare costs: we predict United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia to contract by 5 and 3 percent, respectively. Being important
exporters of oil to the region, the cessation of trade has a large impact on these countries.
      Note that the global heterogeneous increase in trade costs could in principle result in
welfare gains for some countries. For instance, countries with limited trade ties to the
impacted region could have potential market share gains in third markets due to higher
costs of shipping between the impacted region and these third markets. Remarkably, every
single country in our data except Ireland sees a welfare loss in the baseline simulation.
This result is driven by both the fact that the countries that lost maritime trade ties are
substantial contributors to global trade, and also that a vast amount of trade passes through
the Southeast Asian waterways specifically because alternative routes are significantly longer.
      Considering the wide-reaching and substantial welfare effects implied by a potential
closing of the South China Sea and surrounding straits, it is not surprising that large
countries in the region, such as China, might exert a greater political or military presence
there. Since the mid-1990s, China has been consolidating claims in the South China Sea
and especially increasing jurisdiction over maritime rights. Since the mid-2000s, the pace of
that consolidation has increased (Fravel, 2011). Our results do not suggest a clear incentive
for China to close the Malacca Straits or other parts of the South China Sea: it incurs a
welfare loss around one percent if the elasticity of substitution             is between -3 and -5, but

     Note that overland trade with adjacent countries continues. That is, all pairs for which the contiguity
     dummy in the trade cost estimation equals one can still trade with each other. We do not allow transit
     trade with non-neighboring countries.

a slight welfare gain for        = -7.14 More broadly, our results emphasize the possibility of a
large country maintaining control over the region by imposing substantial costs on smaller
countries.
      Given the high welfare losses attributed with a closure of the Southeast Asian seaways,
it is conceivable that countries standing to lose most from a potential conflict in the region
would spend more heavily on defense and security. To check this, we use the SIPRI Military


14
     The source of this welfare gain is the terms of trade effect due to increased trade costs imposed on its
     regional trade partners. For instance, Hong Kong's trade with all countries other than China ceases in
     the simulation.

Expenditure Database and calculate the 2001-2018 average military expenditures of the
countries in Table 2 as a percentage of their GDPs. Hong Kong is the only country for which
separate military expenditure data are not available. For the remaining 18 countries in the
region, we test whether a higher predicted welfare loss due to an interruption of maritime
trade is associated with a higher military expenditure in an effort to deter such a scenario.
We do so by projecting military expenditures as a share of GDP on the absolute values of
simulated percentage welfare losses, i.e., the values in Table 2 for                  = -5. We control for
distance to the Malacca Strait and its interaction with the predicted welfare loss since the
effect is expected to be stronger for nearby countries. We also control for whether a country
is engaged in an intra-state or a regional inter-state conflict beyond 1999 that may be a
direct factor in high military spending.15
      Table 3 reports the estimates from an OLS specification in columns (1)-(2) and a WLS
specification in columns (3)-(4) using country population as weights. In columns (2) and
(4), we also control for the size of the country. Evidently, higher predicted GDP reductions
are associated with higher military expenditures, and more so for countries that are closer
to the Malacca Strait, the epicenter of a potential conflict. Figure 2 presents the added
variable plot of the relationship between military expenditures and simulated welfare losses
corresponding to the specification in column (1) of Table 3. The relationship is robust to
excluding each observation at a time, with the exception that the coefficient of interest is
imprecisely estimated in the OLS specification when Singapore is excluded from the dataset.
      The magnitude of the impact is economically important as well: using the results from

     We use the latest versions of the Inter-, Extra- and Intra-State Conflict Datasets from the Correlates of
     War Project. A country's conflict variable assumes the value of one if it is involved in a conflict that has
     either ended after 1999 or is still active. Among the interstate conflicts, we drop Australia's involvement
     in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars since it is not a regional conflict that will cause a sustained military
     expenditure for Australia. On the contrary, we treat South Korea as in a regional conflict since it still has
     not signed a peace treaty with North Korea, and the current armistice frequently turns into a low-level
     confrontation in the Korean peninsula. As a result, the conflict dummy equals one for the following set
     of countries and zero for the others: Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Philippines, Indonesia, and
     South Korea.

column (1), for a country at the average distance that is otherwise not experiencing a conflict,
a one standard deviation increase in predicted GDP loss due to a conflict of the type that
we simulated (about 8.8 percentage points) increases military expenditure as a percent of
GDP by 0.31 percentage points, compared to the average military expenditure/GDP ratio
of 2.03 percent. As to the interaction effect, a simultaneous one standard deviation increase
in predicted GDP loss and a one standard deviation decrease in log distance increases the
dependent variable by 0.62 percentage points.
   Given the sample size and the nature of the exercise, we do not claim to demonstrate
a causal relationship. There are multiple considerations that factor in to military spending
decisions, such as perceived threats and alliances.              Still, the relationship is intriguing
considering how unrelated these data may at first seem.

5       Discussion

    Motivated by the historically tense geopolitical situation and the current political climate,
we simulate the potential closure of key maritime waterways in Southeast Asia in order
to predict the impact on regional trade, global trade, and GDP. We generate initial and
counterfactual least-cost routes between countries, and use the distances of these routes to
solve a conventional model of international trade estimating the potential welfare effects.
We find heterogeneous and economically significant reductions in real GDP. We also show
that, for countries in the region, the magnitude of welfare losses is directly correlated with
military spending as a proportion of GDP, suggesting that these countries may be responding


                                                              14
to the economic security threats posed by such a potential geopolitical conflict. Our results
illustrate the importance of maritime trade through the Southeast Asian seas, and the strong
economic incentives behind political and military movements.
   There are a number of limitations to our study. One may question the plausibility of a
simultaneous closing of all the critical waterways linking the Indian and the Pacific Oceans
through the north of Australia, forcing all maritime trade to go along Australia?s southern
coast. Only closing the Malacca strait and allowing navigation through other passages
would mechanically decrease the welfare impact by shortening re-routed distances. All such
scenarios are equally speculative. We present one particular case with a large-scale regional
impact, but admit that alternative scenarios are possible.
   A related and important limitation is that we do not observe the modal distribution of
trade by sea, by land, or by air. Heterogeneous differences in transportation methods across
countries would impact the results. Despite the historically relevant threat of maritime or
overland embargoes, air transport is a viable--yet more expensive--way of continuing to
trade for countries whose international access may be constrained. The importance of this
alternative has been demonstrated in the 1948 Berlin Airlift and by the response of Qatar
to the overland embargo by Saudi Arabia in 2018.
   Another limitation is the aggregate nature of the trade model used in the analysis. Trade
in certain goods and commodities is harder to substitute for some importing countries,
especially when it involves energy imports. The importance of energy imports for the region
is reflected by the large GDP losses for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in our
scenario, and the fact that territorial disputes in the South China Sea are partially motivated
by search for offshore hydrocarbon energy deposits. One avenue for future research would
be conducting counterfactual exercises using a multi-industry model, to account for the
importance to the gains from trade of critical industries with low elasticity of substitution
(Ossa, 2015).
   Despite the limitations, our results show that there are large and economically important


                                              15
gains from maritime trade through the Southeast Asian waterways. Geopolitical events that
increase insecurity in critical maritime regions could have substantial welfare effects. We
provide evidence consistent with the idea that these perceived threats could set in motion a
rapid arms race for the countries involved.
