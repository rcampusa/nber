                         Optimal Inflation Policy


                                ABSTRACT


     This paper considers the problem of optimal long run monetary policy.

It shows that optimal inflation policy involves trading off two quite

different considerations. First, increases in the rate of inflation tax

the holding of many balances, leading to a deadweight loss as excessive

resources are devoted to economizing on cash balances. Second, increases

in the rate of inflation raise capital intensity. As long as the economy

has a capital stock short of the golden rule level, increases in capital

intensity raise the level of consumption. Ignoring the second considera-

tion leads to the common recommendation that the money growth rate be set

so that the nominal interest rate is zero. Taking it into account can

lead to significant modifications in the "full liquidity rule." Inter-

actions of inflation policy with financial intermediation and taxation are

also considered. The results taken together suggest that inflation can

have important welfare effects, and that optimal inflation policy is an

empirical question, which depends on the structure of the economy.

      The widely accepted "Natural Rate" hypothesis implies that
monetary policy can have no long run effect on the level of employ-
ment. The unemployment rate deviates from the natural rate only
when economic actors are "fooled" by the rate of inflation. In

the long run, it is not possible to cause rational agents to

systematically under (over)estimate the rate of inflation, so

the level of employment must return to.its natural level. Some
have interpreted these results as implying that monetary policy
has no long—run real effects. For example, Sargent and Wallace
(1975) write, "In the rational expectations version of tEe model,

one deterministic money supply rule is as good as any other,
insofar as concerns the probability distribution of real output."
However, as Fischer (1978) has d.em6nstrated, monetary policy does
have real effects when inflation's long run impact on capital intensity

is considered A faster rate of monetary growth raises the rate of inflation,

leading individuals to economize on cash balances, and raising

aggregate capital intensity through the Tobin effect. Since
monetary policy has real effects, acceptance of the rational

expectations hypothesis alters but does not eliminate the problem

of optimal monetary policy.
      The long run monetary policy problem involves trading off
two quite different considerations. First, increases in the rate
of inflation tax the holding of money balances, leading to a

deadweight loss as excessive resources are devoted to economizing

on cash balances. Second, increases in the rate of inflation
                              —2—



raise capital intensity affecting steady state consumption. As
long as the economy has a capital stock short of the golden rule

level, increases in capital intensity raise the level of consump-
tion. Ignoring the second of these factors leads to Friedman's
 (1969) recommendation that the rate of money growth be set so
that the nominal rate of interest is zero. Feldstein (1977), using

the same basic framework, has argued that the cost of excessive

inflation can be very large. Neither of these analyses consider
the impact of inflation on capital intensity. Studies of optimal

capital accumulation typically neglect the optimization of money
balances. This paper attempts an analysis of optimal monetary
policy in which capital intensity is explicitly considered within
the context of a simple monetary growth model. The analysis is
then extended to examine how optimal inflation policy is affected

by the presence of inside money, taxation, and a government
budget constraint.

      Section I outlines the basic model, a variant of Tobin's

(1965) formulation of the monetary growth problem, and uses it to
derive an explicit solution for the optimal rate of inflation. The

model differs from Tobin's in that money holding is treated as a

consumption good and its demand is derived from utility maximization.

In Section II, the role of inside money and the implications of

paying interest on money balances are examined. The impact of
capital income taxes on the optimal rate of inflation, as well

as the problem of indexing taxes, is considered in Section III.
Section IV discusses the implications of the government budget
                               —3—



constraint, and the revenue gains from inflationary finance.

The fifth and final section summarizes the results of the paper
and discusses their implications.


I.   The Model

      In this section a variant of the Tobin (1965) monetary

growth model suitable for examining optimum monetary policy is
outlined. Since only the problem of finding the optimal steady
state path is considered, the dynamics of expectation formation

and convergence to equilibrium are ignored.
      As is standard in the literature, we assume that population

growth is given by

                     N =
                           N0ent                (1)


In numerical examples it will be convenient to treat n as the
growth rate of labor measured in efficiency   units, that is,
the sum of the rates of population growth and labor augmenting

technical change. The fraction of the population in the labor
force is assumed to be constant.

      Production is described by an aggregate production function
with constant returns to scale. The relationship between per

capita output and capital stock is given by


                     y=f(k)                     (2)


with ft>O and f"<O. Depreciation is ignored to highlight the

essential features, though none of the qualitative results would
be affected by its inclusion.
                                  —4—



      Along a steady state growth path, k is constant. All
output not invested is consumed. It follows immediately that

per capita consumption is:

                    c =    f(k)   —   nk                  (3)


We will make extensive use of the golden rule relationship apparent

from (3). Increases in capital intensity raise per capita steady
stat consumption so long as f' - n         >   0.   A maximum level of consump-
tion is achieved where f' = n along the golden rule path. When k is

further increased, f' <    n, andper capita consumption is reduced. It
will be assumed throughout the paper that f' >            n, so consumption is
below its maximum sustainable level. It should be emphasized that
when the utility of money balances is considered, achievement of maxi-
mum consumption may be neither necessary nor sufficient for welfare
maximization.

      Following Tobin, we assume that savings are a fixed proportion
of disposable income.1 None of the results in the first two sections
would be altered by allowing the savings rate to depend on the real
rate of interest. Savings are represented by

                   s =                              (4)


      Disposable income is equal to national income, less the

fall in real money balances due to inflation, 1IM/P, (where II is

the rate of inflation), plus the value of government transfers

of newly printed money (DM/P). Disposable income is therefore

                  = Y    + (a   - 1I)M/P            (5)
                              —5—



where a is the rate of money growth, DM/M.

      Along a balanced growth path, monetary velocity is constant.
This insures that the rate of inflation equals the excess of the

rate of money growth over output growth or

                     Tt=a-n                       (6)


Using (6), (5) can be rewritten in per-capita terms as


                    yd =y+nm                      (7)


where m represents per—capita holdings of real money balances.
      In order to close the model, the demand for real money

balances must be specified. The conventional approach is to let
the money-capital ratio depend on the nominal rate of interest.
Since inflation's role as a tax on money balances is of central

concern here, this approach is rejected in favor of one based
on utility maximization.

      In making steady state welfare comparisons, it is postulated
that money holdings are chosen so that at each instant a concave

utility function U(c,m) is maximized. Theutilityfunctionhastheproper-
ty that:    Urn> 0 and that: lim U. = for i = c ,m.2 It is also assumed
                            i÷O
that real balance satiation occurs, that is U2(c,m)      0 for m
sufficiently large.3 These conditions insure that both consump-
tion and money holding occur in all steady states. By holding
an extra dollar,    individuals forego consumption equal to the
nominal interest rate i, which they could have earned by holding
their wealth in the form of capital. It follows that money hold-
ings will be chosen to satisfy:4
                                             —6—



                               U2(c,m) = itJ1(c,m)                          (8)

                                                    .5
It is assumed that U is homothetic, and that all individuals

have identical utility functions. These conditions imply:

         m=L(j)c                           limL=t                           X9)
                                           i0

That is, the ratio of individual money holdings to consumption
varies with the nominal interest rate.

      Competition insures that factors are paid their marginal
products. The interest rate, which equals the nominal return
to capital is,

             i =   r      +   11   =   V   (k) +   Ti                      (10)


      All savings must be absorbed in money or capital holdings.

Hence the requirement for equilibrium growth is

                              s=nk+nm                                      (11)


where s represents per—capita savings. Using (4), (7), (9) , (10)
and (11), the steady state condition for the model may be derived
as

      cyf(k) —   nk   —       (1 —     cy)nL[ft(k)      +   1T][f(k)   —   nk] =   0   (12)


      By differentiating (12) we can find the impact of inflation

on steady state capital and money holdings. The effect of
a change in the rate of inflation on capital intensity is given by
                                              —7—




     dk —
            of'
                                  (1 —        )nLt   (f —   nk)
                  — n — (1 —      ainL(f'       —    n) — (1 —    cr)nL'f"(f   —   nk)   (13)



The denominator of (13) is unambiguously negative so long as
af' < n <     V.     This assumption, holding that capital intensity
is below the golden rule level but above the point where f' =
is   maintained throughout the paper.6 The numerator is unambiguously
negative. Hence the model exhibits the Tobin effect, an increase
in the rate of inflation raises steady state capital intensity.7

       Equations (4), (7) and (11) imply that changes in capital and

money holdings are related by the identity

                      din   —   aft   -   n     dk
                                (1 —      a)n   i                      (14)

Hence, under the condition noted above, that cf' — n <                             0, money
and capital holdings move in opposite directions. Since they
are alternative portfolio assets, this is to be expected. An
increase in the rate of inflation thus reduces per-capita real

money holdings.

       At this point we are ready to consider the problem of
optimal monetary policy in this simple model. In subsequent sections
more realism is adnieveci as itiside mOney anci taxation are introduced

into the model. Equation (6) demonstrates that the problem of cnoosing

an optimal growth rate of money is equivalent to the cnoice of an
optirtal rate of inflation. We will be concerned here only with the

comparison of steady states. Problems of transition are ignorect. How-
ever, Feldstein (1977) has argued that it is always desirable to drive

the inflation rate to its optimal level regardless of the initial
                                       —8—



conditions and transition costs. The maximand is steady state
utility which can be represented by

      tJ(c,m) =    tJ(f   —   nk,   L(f' + Tt)(f —   nk))       (15)


It remains only to specify the policy instruments at the govern-
ment's disposal.

      We first consider the case in which the government can

control both the rate of inflation 11, and the level of the steady

state capital stock k, by controlling capital formation. This
second instrument might be taken to represent the capabilities

of open market operations or public investment. In this case, the
first order conditions for maximizing (15) are


  U2L' (.)r(f —    nk)J=      0                                          (16)

                — n) + tJ ((V —        n)L   + L'f"(f —     nk)) =   0   (17)


Condition (16) implies that U2 =             0, which along with (8) indicates
that H = —r, so the nominal rate of interest is zero. This is

the same result found in Friedman (1969); however, his paper

does not make clear the dependence of this monetary rule on
the simultaneous optimization of the capital stock.

      Equation (17) implies that V - n = 0 since U2 = 0.                  This

is the famous golden rule. When both capital intensity and

liquidity are subject to control, optimality requires full
liquidity and golden rule capital intensity. It is clear then
that H =   -n   and so (6) implies that ct = 0 is required in order

to maximize steady state utility. That is, the money supply
                                        —9—



should be fixed, allowing prices to fall at a rate equal to the

economy's growth rate. This result closely parallels Samueleson's
(1958) finding that a constant money stock is optimal in a

consumption loan economy. It is also in accordance with Friedman's
(1969) actual policy prescription.

      The analysis so far has assumed that the monetary authority

can simultaneously optimize the rate of inflation and the capital
stock. A more realistic assumption is that the monetary authority
takes , the private savings rate, as given, and can control only
the rate of inflation. 8           In this case, the full liquidity golden
rule optimum described above will not, in general, be feasible.
Optimal monetary policy becomes a second best problem.
      The full impact of a change in inflation on steady state
welfare may be found using (8):

                 dU   —
                      -            ,dc + •dm
                          U1                                   (18


Substituting from equations (3) and (14) into (18) yields:

         dU_ dk
         dlI   dfl             —   n)   + (V   +1I)y-f'
                                               n(l — a)
                                                          _    —
                                                                      (19)

Given the assumption made above, that f' >                n, we see that opti—
raality requires a capital stock below the golden rule level.
The second term in (19) reflects the "liquidity cost" of pushing

the capital stock towards the golden rule level. The welfare

gain from raising capital intensity to its first best level is
insufficient to offset the loss from reduced liquidity.
                                        —10—



        Solving (19), we can find the optimum rate of inflation:


                    =   (f'   —   n)n(l   —    a) —
                                                           (20)
                              n   — af'

This equation makes clear a strong virtue of the approach adopted

here. The optiiral rate of inflation can be expressed in terms of
observables and does not depend on the form of the utility func-
tion.       In particular, the elasticity of the money demand func-
tion does not enter the expression for the optimal rate of
inflation.

        The first term of equation (20) reflects the increased

capital intensity brought about by inflation. When capital is
optimized, at the golden rule level, it equals zero, and so (19)
implies the familiar zero nominal interest rate rule. In the
plausible case where f' >          n,   and capital intensity is too low,
a higher rate of inflation is implied. The larger the divergence

from the golden rule, the greater is the optimal rate of inflation.
        Feldstein and Summers (1977) present evidence that the U.S.
capital stock is well below the golden rule level. The net

marginal product of capital f' is estimated to be about                     in

contrast to an output growth rate of about .03.10 Assuming
a =   .1,   which is consistent with the observed capital output ratio
of 3, (20) implies that the optimal rate of inflation is -.005.
This is consistent with a nominal return to capital of about .105,

significantly above the zero nominal interest rate rule. These
conclusions are quite sensitive to the parameter values chosen.

Table 1 presents the optimal rate of inflation for various values
of f', a, and n.

a =   .15, V =    .05          —.009       —.027       —.023


       While   the   exact rate of inflation which should be set as' a

target varies with the parameter values, it is almost always well
above the full liquidity level. Indeed with a =       .15,    and n =   .02,
the optimal inflation rate is very large, 17.2%. The existence
of the Tobin effect seems to be an important factor in deter-

mining the optimal rate of inflation. Surprisingly however, its
magnitude does not affect optimal monetary policy.11 These calcu-
lations indicate that considerationof capital intensity effects can

lead to significant modifications in the full liquidity rule. Below

we explore the implications of taxation and the existence of outside

money for the optimal monetary policy problem.


II. Inside Money
       The standard monetary growth model treats all money as
an asset to the private sector, and liability of the public

sector. Inside money, provided by financial intermediation, is
ignored. Inside money holdings are taxed, and hence reduced by
inflation. Since inside money is a liability of the banking
system, the revenues accrue to banks rather than to the government.

However, the Tobin effect involves only the substitution of capital
                               —12—




for   outside money. It would therefore seem likely that the extent
of intermediation would affect optima-I monetary policy.

       In order to consider inside money, we modify the basic

model of Section I by allowing for financial intermediation. In
particular, we distinguish inside money, m1, the liabilities of
banks, and outside money, m0, the government's liabilities. It is
assume that individuals are indfferent between holding money
in its inside or outside form. Banks accept individual demand
deposits and then use the funds to purchase capital.       We can
represent the balance sheet of the private sector in per—capita
terms as follows:


                            Households
         Assets                                  Liabilities

                                                       1


       Total   private net worth is unaffected by the presence of
inside money since it is an asset to the household sector, and
                                      12
a liability to the banking sector. Initially we assume that house-

form; (currency) and that banks hold a fraction r of demand
                                          —13—



deposits in the form of cash reserves. It follow that outside
money represents a fixed fraction v =                                   of total money
                                                                    d
holding.

      The steady state condition (11) must be modified to take
account of inside money. It becomes

                           s=nk+vnm                                     (21)


This reflects the fact that only outside money is a source of

net worth. Using (21) the balanced growth condition (12) may
be altered to take account of inside money as follows:

           f — nk — (1 —    )nvL(f'             + II) (f — nk) =    0    (22)


where it is recognized that only the increase in outside money

is treated by households as disposable income. This condition
is the same as (12) except that it takes account of the fact that

financial intermediation makes it possible for savings to yield
money services, and simultaneously be channelledinto real
capital formation.

      Maximizing steady state utility as in the preceding section
yields a condition for the optimum rate of inflation:

                             —             (1
                 11*   =
                             n   —

                                                 —
                                                     a/V   —   fI
Comparing (23) and (20) we see that the "capital creation" term
is smaller by a factor v, the proportion of outside money. This
is because an inflation induced reduction in inside money holdings

does not increase capital intensity. It is also clear that the
                                   —14—



presence of inside money reduces the optin1 inflation rate.
      In the U.S., the monetary base, or outside money stock,
represents about 1/3 of M1, and about 10% of M3, the money stock

including savings accounts, at commercial banks and savings and
loans. Even using the narrower money stock defintion, consi—
deration of inside money significantly reduces the optini rate
of inflation. For the parameter values assumed earlier, and a
value of v =      1/3,   the optimal rate of inflation is -.068 rather

than -.005, as calculated above ignoring inside money. Table 2
presents a calculation of optinal inflation for various parameter

values. Almost all plausible assumptions imply the optimality
of a negative rate of inflation, though not necessarily a negative
rate of money growth. The Tobin effect cannot be used to justify
rates of inflation which approach current levels once inside money
is considered.

      It   is frequently proposed that interest be paid on money

holdings. This suggestion is justified as eliminating the
                                    —15—



distortion due to the taxation of money balances. With interest
at rate ii   paid     on all money balances, steady state condition (22)
becomes:


   f(k) —    nk   —   (1 —   )nvL(f'(k)   +   i — 1i)(f(k)   —   nk)=   0    (24)


after modifying (9) to let money holding depend on the differences

between the return on money and capital. It is clear from (26)

that capital intensity depends only on the differences between
  and II.    Hence in this model, inflation is completely neutral
and has no welfare effects if all money balances are fully indexed.

However, payment of interest on currency is not feasible, or at
least not normally proposed, so it is useful to consider the case
where interest is paid only on inside money holdings.
      In order to study the effect of allowing interest to be

paid only on inside money, it will first be useful to study the
consequences of changes in v. Changes in v can result either
from changes in the household propensity to hold currency or

banks' reserve holdings. Differentiating (22) with respect to
v yields:


    dk —          L(f — nk) (1 — am
    dv   f' — n — (1 —  )nv[L(f' — n) +             L'f"(f—nk)]             (25)


This expression is unambiguously negative, under the maintained
assumptions. Since inside money does not represent wealth to the
private sector, it does not displace capital. Hence the substi-
tution of inside for outside money raises capital intensity.
                                           —16—




Using equation (21), it can be shown that

                    din   —   -dk     (af' - n)
                                                                           (26)
                    dv        dv (1 - cy)nv


Hence a reduction in the proportion of outside money raises real
money holdings as well as capital intensity. The welfare effect

is therefore unambiguously posiUve. Using (18) along with (26),
we find


                   =    -1.(f'    —   n+          + 'ii) (ef'   —
                                                                    n))      (27)
              dv       tLdv                    n(l -

which is unambiguously negative. It follows immediately that there
are gains from increasing financial intermediation. If we assume
that L' =    0, an approximation to their magnitude can be found.
Using the parameter values assumed above, and taking iT as .06,
dtj/dv =                  This figure implies that a reduction in the
           .029ct31.
proportion of outside money from 1/3 to 1/6, corresponding to a

doubling of financial intermediation, would raise welfare by about
$5 billion based on current U.S. values of L =                            .3 and c = $1
trillion. This calculation does of course ignore the direct costs
of intermediation)3
        If interest is paid on inside money but not on outside money,
inflation will change the proportion v of money held in the outside

form. In this case, inflation will have real effects even with
indexation. The change in steady state welfare resulting from a
change in the rate of inflation may be written as:


                          dU U+ u              3v
                          dli —            v                                  (28)
                                                                       V
                              —17—




The first term of (28) is zero, as long as    = 1.   The second term
is positive, since an increase in the rate of inflation will promote

intermediation, whichas (27) shows, raises welfare. Fully indexed
inflation's only real effect is to raise the proportion of inside
money, and so it is desirable. Under these conditions there is no
optimal rate of inflation. Inflation should be raised until outside
money is wrung entirely out of the economy.
      It has thus been shown that the welfare effects of steady state

inflation in an economy with inside money depend critically on the
nature of indexation. If no interest can be paid on inside money, a

negative rate of inflation is optimum. If however, inside money yields

are indexed, optimal policy may call for very high rates of inflation.


III. Inflation and Taxation

      This section begins consideration of the influence of taxation

on optimal inflation policy. Four separate interactions of inflation

and taxation may usefully be distinguished. First, inflationary
finance is a source of government revenue and so, ceteris paribus,

makes possible a reduction in other distortionary taxes. Second,
inflation, by altering the size and composition of output will
change the size of the real tax base. Third, as emphasized by Green
and Sheshinski, inflation affects tax collections by altering the
effective tax rate on capital income in a non—indexed tax system.

Fourth, as stressed by Feldstein (1976), inflation may substantially

reduce after tax yields, leading to large effects on savings and port-
folio decisions. While the interaction of taxes and inflation may reduce
                                —18—



incentives for capital accumulation, taxation of interest

income does tend to offset the inflation tax on money balances.
In this section, the last of these interactions is analyzed. The
first three are taken up in the next section.

      The appropriate way to model the taxation of capital income
is not at all clear. Feldstein (1976) and Green and Sheshinski

assume that all capital is financed by corporate debt. As Feld-
stein and Summers (1978) demonstrate, the assumption of all debt

corporate finance may be very misleading. Observed interest rates
are more consistent with the view that at the margin, debt accounts
for only about one third of corporate capital. Moreover almost

half the capital stock is non-corporate, consisting largely of
residential housing. Its tax treatment is radically different
than that of corporate capital.

      A full analysis of the impact of capital income taxation
on the size and composition of the capital stock is far beyond

the scope of this paper. We assume that the net impact of the
tax system is to tax the real return on capital, f' (k), at rate

t1 and the return due to inflation at rate t2. The after tax
return to capital as a porfolio asset is then


          in = (1 —   t1)f'   (k) + (1 —
                                           t2)Tt        (29)

It is important to understand that the values of t1 and
t2 are to be interpreted as averages of the very different
effective tax rates on the real and inflationary parts of various

forms of capital income. The non—indexed character of our tax
system does not imply that t1 =     t2.     In order to illustrate this
                                     —19—



point, and to shed light on realistic interpretations of the model,
we derive below effective tax rates, t1 and t2, under various
assumptions about the nature of capital.

        Consider first the model of Feldstein and Green and Sheshinski
in which firms finance all capital investment through the sale of
bonds to individuals. Here firms equate the nominal return from
capital to its nominal cost

              (1 —   T)f'   (k) + II = (1 —   r)i             (30)


where r is the corporate tax rate. Individuals pay tax at a rate
® on nominal interest income. Substituting from (30) the after
tax return to debt holders is found to be:

                                              —
            in = (1 —   ®)f' (k)   + (1 —
                                                  HI          (31)


Hence in this case t1 = G, the individual income tax rate. The

tax on inflationary income, t2, in the all debt world is at rate

  :- which      is negative as long as the corporate tax rate exceeds
the individual rate. The tax treatment of owner occupied housing

is quite similar to debt financed corporate capital. The difference
is that homeowners deduct interest payments at the individual rate
while creditors pay taxes at the corporate rate. Capital gains on
homes are taxes at the individual level.

       The results in an all equity world are radically different.
We assume that a fixed proportion                 y of operating profits ft (k)
are retained by the corporation, and taken by individuals in the
form   of   capital gains, taxable at rate 9g• The remainder are
paid out in dividends taxable at rate 0. Individuals are taxed

at the capital gains rate on the appreciation of their equity,
                                            —20—



due to inflation. In this case the nominal after tax return to
individuals is


     in = 1 — (1 — (1            T)(1   —      — (1 —
                                                        r)Gg))f'   + (1 —
                                                                            Gg)l•[
                                                                                         (32)


Equation (32) implies that while both inflationary and real gains
are taxed, real gains are taxed at much heavier rates. The effec-
tive rate of tax on real gains t1 is 1 - (1 - T) (1 —                        — (1    -
                                                                                         Y)Og)i
while inflationary gains are taxed at a rate of only                      Gg In an
economy with mixed debt and equity finance, the effective tax rates

on real and inflationary capital income are weighted averages of

the expressions derived above, with weights being the shares of
capital financed by debt and equity.

         The real and inflationary capital income from different
sources are taxed at very different rates. Effective tax rates

are presumably some average of rates on the different forms of

capital income. It is difficult to estimate such effective rates.
In particular, the sign of t2 is unclear. Inflation reduces tax

liabilities on debt financed corporate capital, and on housing,
but increases liabilities on equity. The absence of replacement
cost depreciation also causes inflation to raise effective tax
rates.

          In the presence of taxation, steady state condition (22)
becomes:

             f —   nk   —   (1   —
                                     a)nvL(i ) (f — nk)=    0      (33)


where it is assumed that all revenues are returned to households
in   a   lump sum manner. It is immediately apparent that any combi—
                                        —21—



nation of changes in It, t1 and t2 which leaves in unchanged, also

does not affect steady state capital intensity or money holding.

The optimum value of in is therefore independent of the tax

system. Increases in in will increase capital intensity, while

decreases will reduce capital accumulation. Thus if taxes may be
adjusted, optimality can be achieved at any rate of inflation.

Likewise, any tax effects may be undone by changing the rate of
inflation.

      Since the optimal value of in does not depend on the tax
system, it is apparent that


      in =   V (k)   + rr*    = (1 —
                                        t1)f' (k)     + (1 —
                                                               t2)It    (34)


or

                        =    11*   ÷ t1f'(k)
                                   1 —
                                       t2                        (35)




where ff* represents the optimal rate of inflation with no taxes.

Equation (37) implies that the optin1 rate of inflation rises with
       A greater tax on real capital income tends to encourage money

holding at the expense of capital. Increased inflation offsets this
distortion. The effect of an increase in t2 on the optimal rate of
inflation is ambiguous. If It +                           0, increases in t2 raise
                                            t1f'(k)   >

the optimum rate of inflation, else they decrease it. On balance,

it appears likely that the conclusions of the previous section must

be modified upwards to take account of taxes, though lacking esti-
mates of t1 and t2, it is impossible to say by how much.
                                          —22—




         Optimal     rates of inflation for various combinations of tax
parameters are      presented in Table 3, for the standard case consi-
dered in previous         sections. For all reasonable combinations of
tax parameters, the optImal rate of inflation is negative. -The

presence of capital taxes cannot justify positive inflation. It
is important to note, however, that the optimal rates found here are

far above those implied by the zero nominal interest rate rule.

                                   Table 3

                Optimal Inflation with Taxation
                               =      0           —.2         .2

                     .4             —.028         —.023      —.035


         Equation (36) may also be used to evaluate proposals for
indexing the ta system. It is often suggested that neutrality

and optimality require that t2 =             0, so real tax liabilities are inde-
pendent of the rate of inflation. This is not OptiIrai. in our model.

If t1 is fixed, t2 should vary with the rate of inflation so that
in =   i*.    The greater the rate of inflation, the larger is the

optimal value of t2. Not only should capital income due -to inflation
be taxed, the tax rate should rise with the rate of inflation. This
result follows from the need to offset the inflation tax on money
balances.
                                —23—




           These results reflect the fact that in this model capital

intensity depends basically on portfolio allocation. The assumption
of a constant savings rate eliminates any tax effects on the rate

of accumulation. While relaxation of this assumption would be
valuable, little could be said without more definitive empirical
evidence   than is now available. The direction of the real interest
rate effect on savings is ambiguous on theoretical grounds, since
substitution and income effects oppose each other.    Moreover, the
effect of inflation on the real after tax return to savers is
unclear. In the debt finance and owner occupied housing cases

considered above, increases in inflation actually raise the real

after tax return. The opposite result occurs with equity financed
corporate capital.

        So far it has been assumed that tax revenues are distributed

in a lump sum fashion. Government revenue needs have been ignored
as have the distortionary effects of alternative sources of revenue.
In the next section we explicitly introduce a government budget
constraint.

IV. Inflationary Finance as a Revenue Source

          This section first considers the revenue yield from the

inflation tax and then studies how the optimal rate of inflation is

affected by the existence of a government budget constraint. The
revenue yield from increases in inflation has received much atten-

tion in the literature. Cagan (1956) argued that to maximize its
revenue, the government should raise the rate of inflation to the

point where money had unitary demand elasticity. Friedman (1972)
showed how this condition must be modified to take account of econo-

mic growth. Both these contributions ignore inflation's effect on
revenue from pre—existing taxes. While Feldstein (1976) and Green and
Sheshinski. (1977) have considered these revenues, their analyses neglect
the effect çf inflation on the size of the monetary base stressed

by Friedman and Cagan.             The model developed in previous sections
permits simultaneous consideration of all these issues.

          In this section we assume that all real income is taxed at

an effective rate t1and that the inflationary part of capital
income is taxed at rate t2. Total tax revenue T is

                T = (II +   n)vm + t1f     +
                                               t2kir
where   the first term represents the revenue yield from printing

money. By differentiating (36), the revenue impact of changes in
the rate of inflation may be calculated. Using the steady state
condition (22) and letting          =                  we find that


         = vm   + t2k   +   [(II + n)v +   (t2 + t1f')]           (37)
                                   —25—



The sign of this expression is indeterminate even with specific

assumptions about the values of t1 and t2. It is however clear
from (22) that inflatjon's effect on revenue from other taxes

dwarfs any revenue derived directly from inflation. Consider only
the second term of (37). In the U.S., k /vrn          40. Hence if
 t2I >.   .025,16 this term will be more important than the first
term which reflects the direct revenue gain from inflation.

          Even in a fully indexed tax system, t2 = 0, inflation has

an impact on income tax revenues represented by the term
            in (37).    Using the parameter values assumed above
  = —.45.     The interest elasticity of demand for money in the U.S.
is estimated to be about .3 (by, e.g., Goldfeld, 1974), implying that
   = —1800 billion. An income tax rate of 40% implies that an

extra point of inflation raises revenue by about $325 million.

While this is not a large effect, it is comparable to the direct

revenue from the inflation tax. Starting with an inflation rate of
6%, the values assumed above imply that an extra point of inflation
raises revenues from the inflation tax by about $460 million. Again,
it is important to realize that both these effects are very small

relative to the revenue effects on the non—indexed parts of the
tax system.

          Phelps (1973( has argued that a high rate of inflation may be
optimal because raising revenue through the inflation tax makes
possible reductions in other distortionary taxes. As the above
discussion makes clear, this argument is dubious since if t2 < 0,

inflation may reduce revenues requiring increases in other distor—
                 17
tionary taxes.         In   our model it is possible to calculate the
                                           —26—



       ratio of the welfare loss to the revenue yield from increases

in the rate of inflation. The calculation here improves on past
calculations of this sort in that the welfare consequences of

inflation—Induced changes in capital intensity and the full
revenue implications of changes in inflation are incorporated. In
finding the optimal rate of inflation, the excess burden from
inflationary finance can be compared to that from alternative
revenue sources.

             The revenue raised from increases in the rate is given by

equation (37). The welfare cost of changes in the rate of inflation
is:


         =
             U1(f'     — n +     [(1   —
                                           t1)f'   + (1 —
                                                                t2)rt)[t        a)nv       (38)


To measure welfare loss in consumption units, U1 is set equal to 1.

                                                                                             t.

      The first column illustrates what is apparent from the
previous discussion. When t2 < 0, increases in inflation reduce
revenues, as well as welfare. In this case, consideration of the
revenue constraint will reduce the optimal rate of inflation. In
the case t2 =   0, where the tax system is indexed, inflation does
not appear to be a viable revenue source. Even at an inflation
rate of zero, the welfare loss from increases in inflation approaches

half the revenue gain. At current rates of inflation, the welfare
loss is about twice the revenue gain. These figures must be

compared with loss from increases in other tax instruments. While

such estimates are difficult to make, it seems clear that the loss
from increases in income tax rates is much smaller than the losses

implied by moderate rates of inflation. The analysis here thus
confirms Phelps' conclusion that consideration of inflation policy
in the context of the government's public finance problem can

substantially alter the optimum rate. However, the results
here emphasize the importance of taking account of inflation's
effect on revenues from pre—existing taxes.
      In the case where t2 =   .2,    inflation is a viable revenue
source. Even at 8% inflation, the welfare loss—revenue ratio is
a very moderate .21. This reflects the fact that when the tax
system is not indexed, inflation will have very large revenue

effects. With a non-indexed tax system, the optiiral rate of

inflation may be very high though the probab1e responsiveness of
savings to very low real yields limits the potential of inflationary
finance.

V. Conclusions and Implications

        The results presented here show that at least in certain

circumstances the full liquidity rule may be a very poor guide

for inflation policy. The effect of monetary policy on capital
intensity must also be considered. This can lead to substantial
increases in the optimal rate of inflation. The results imply that
the presence of taxes- may further increase the optimal rate of
inflation. It is also shown that dynamic considerations change

entirely the nature of the optimaJ- public finance problem in which
the government chooses among inflation and other revenue sources.

        This analysis of optimal long run inflation policy could
usefully be extended in several directions. Most importantly,
the analysis here has relied entirely on comparison of steady

states. This procedure ignores issues surrounding the transition
to an optimal path. The steady state character of the analysis
also precludes any consideration of unemployment. It would be
valuable to consider the monetary policy problem-in an explicit
optimal control framework. The model employed here has relied on
ad-hoc formulations of savings behavior. Altering the assumptions,
or using a savings function derived from utility maximization, might
alter the conclusions. Finally, it would be useful to explore in
more detail the effect of inflation on the composition of the capital

stock. Section III implies that inflation may significantly

exacerbate distortions already present due to differential taxation

of corporate and non—corporate capital.
        It is not likely, however, that theoretical analysis can

shed much-light on the optImal rate of inflation, until more
                            —29—



empirical evidence is available. Reliable estimates of the impact
of inflation on capital formation do not yet exist.   Likewise, little
is known about the effect of inflation on financial intermediation
or on effective tax rates. Until these gaps in our empirical

knowledge are filled, calculations regarding optimal inflation

will remain highly speculative exercises.

1. A natural alternative assumption would be to allow the savings
    rate to vary as individuals maximize an intertemporal utility
    function. If the horizon is infinite, Sidrauski (1967) showed
    that the rate of money growth has no effech on steady state
    capital intensity. Barro (1974) has argued that            inter-
   generational bequest motives make the infinite horizon assumption
    tenable. Drazen (1977) notes several considerations including
    corner solutions, liquidity constraints, and the non-fungibility
   of human capital, which suggest that a finite saving horizon is
   a more reasonable assumption. In this case, as Diamond (1965)
    showed, there is no reason to assume that the capital stock will
   be driven to the optimal level. Our assumption of a fixed, not
   necessarily optimal savings rate, a, captures this phenomenon.
    It also comports with observed constancy of the American savings
   rate (David and Scadding, 1974).
     A constant savings rate out of disposable income can result from
     utility maximization ina two—period overlapping generations
     framework under quite restrictive assumptions. If the elasticity
     of substitution between present and future consumption is one, a
     constant share of first period income will be saved. Typically,
     the share of total income received by the young generation will not
     be constant. If, however, the production function is Cobb—Douglas
     as well, labor and hence the young, will receive a fixed share of
     real output so savings can be expressed approximately as a constant
     fraction of income. An approximation is still involved since the
     savings rate will depend on which generation receives the transfers
     of newly created money.
2.   Specification of a utility function containing   real
                                                       money balances is
     a simple way of explaining why individuals hold money. An analysis
     of conditions under which this procedure is legitimate may be found
     in Fischer (1974). The existence of such a utility function is
     implicit in past analyses of inflation's welfare cost, which employ
     the money demand function to measure the value of money services.
3.   It is plausible that individuals derive utility from the holding
     of capital apart from any return which it renders. This possi-
     bility is excluded from consideration here.

4. Samuelson (1947), p. 117—122, derives an equivalent first order
    condition for real money balances in a somewhat more general
    context. The equation in the text follows directly from the ob-
    servation that the "price" of holding money in terms of foregone
    consumption is the interest rate.

5. This condition is sufficient for the existence of a steady state path.
6. This condition is sufficient but not necessary for the negativity
    of the denominator. It is satisfied by most plausible combinations
    of parameter values. The same condition arises in Sidrauski's (1967)
    consideration of inflation's effect on capital intensity.
                                 —31—



 7. This result is a property of many but not all monetary growth
     models. Levhari and Patinkjn (1968) show that inflation may
     reduce capital intensity, when savings out of the "imputed real
     income" from money balances and money as a factor of production
     are allowed for. A general discussion of the conditions under
     which inflation raises capital intensity may be found in Dorn—
     busch and Frenkel (1973).

 8. This conclusion is motivated by the separation of fiscal and
     monetary authorities, the multiplicity of targets at which policy
     instruments must be aimed, and the observed constancy of the
     savings rate over the past 70 years.

 9. Actual real interest rates are far less than this for a host of
     reasons, the most important of which are taxation and the exis-
     tence of equity finance. These issues are discussed in detail in
     Feldstein and Summers (1978).

10. This figure represents the growth rate of output, which is partially
     due to technical change. The maximum steady state welfare criteria
     used here does lose some of its appeal when technological change is
     introduced.

11. This is essentially because both the "capital intensity" and "money
     balance" effect are proportionaa to the reduction in real money
     balances brought about by inflation.
12. Note that the value of private ownership claims on financial
     intermediarieswill in a steady state, equal the value of the
     capital owned by intermediaries.

13. The analysis obviously has implications for various forms of
     banking regulation, i.e., reserve requirements, but this topic
     is not pursued here.



14. The results in this and the next paragraph follow immediately from
     total differentiation of (36).

15. Note that the notation has changed from that of the preceding section.
16. Recall that the sign of t2 depends on assumptions about how capital
    is financed.

17. The argument is not clear—cut even within Phelps' static framework.
     Money holding is likely to be a substitute for leisure. Since
     leisure cannot be taxed, this creates a presumption that it should
     be subsidized, as long as there exist other taxable goods more
     complementary with leisure and revenue needs are not too great.
