              A   Goodness of Fit Test of alal Labor Market Theory


                                    ABSTRACT

we subject our dual labor market model to a goodness of test fit and ccmpare
the results with those obtained using a single equation model with a carplex
error structure. The dual labor market does an excellent job of predicting
the wage distribution except for failing to explain bnching at       $7 .50 and
$10.00 per hour. The null hypothesis that the     model is correct cannot be
rejected   at the .05 level. In contrast, the wage distribution predicted by

the single labor market model differs significantly fran the observed

distribution.

I. Introduction

      In a recent     paper (Dickens and Lang, 1985), we tested the dual labor
market view by estimating an endogenous switching model of wage setting with
unknown regimes. While the paper has been well received, certain criticisms
have led us to undertake additional tests of the model. In the next section
we surrrnarize our initial results and outline the maj or criticisms -- the
most important being that our results were artifacts of our distribotional
assumptions. In the third section, we describe the results of a goodness of
fit test of our distribjtional assumptions. The paper ends with a brief
conclusion.


II. Results and     Criticisms
      In our 1985 paper we assumed that there were two sectors of the labor

market,   the primary and    secondary sectors, with the wage of worker i       given
by



(1) lnw=XjBjÃ·ejj                                 j=p,s.


Sector of nployrrent was determined by a "switching" equation given            by


(2)   y*XB+e1>O
if and    only   if the individual is iiployed in
                                              primary sector. Sector of
                                                     the

ployment was not assumed to be known. Instead, under the assumption that
the error terms were jointly normally distrihited, the three equations (1 ) -
(2) were estimated by      maximum liicelihood.

      CIr   results were   very suportive   of   the dual   labor   market view. The
                                                                                      2

dual labor market rrrx3el significantly outperformed a standard log wage
equation with a haToskedastic error term.' The wage equation coefficients
corresponded closely to the predictions of the dual labor market mcx1el. In
addition, we showed    that   given assumptions about between group differences
in the disutility of secondary sector ployment, it was possible to test
whether blacks face nonprice barriers to primary sector anployment. The
results   were   supportive of the existence of nonprice barriers.
     Critics have raised two important      and   closely related points   which we

feel merit   ftirther investigation. The first view can be surrrnarized as

follows: ui always knew that the standard OLS wage equation specification

was too simple and that the true error terms were heteroskedastic. When you

take account of this heteroskedasticity, your results are exactly what I

expect   to find."    In our original paper, we recognized that   our model was
equivalent to assuming a particular (bet probably bizarre) distribetion for
the error term in the single equation model bet argued that in the absence
of our results, such a distribetion would not be suggested. We still
maintain   this position. Although all of the people who have made variants

of the above ccnments have estimated numerous OLS wage equations, none makes

a practice of assuming a heteroskedastic error term. Nevertheless, we

recognize that sare of our critics may have better intuition than ours even

if they have failed to act on it. We therefore carpare our model with a

single equation model which assumes a quite ccnplex heteroskedastic

structure    below.
    The related view can be suitmarized as "Your results rest on restrictive
assumptions about ftnctional form. If your equations are misspecified
for example if there are more than two sectors       or the error terms are   not
                                                                                        3

normally distributed, your tests are incorrect." This argument was made
most   clearly in Heckman   and Hotz (1986). While in our paper, we were quite
specific about recognizing the limitations of our test, in retrospect,          we

may   not have anphasized the potential probls sufficiently. We are not
particularly concerned that the degree of labor market segmentation may
exceed that posited in our work. There is a sense in which dualism as
opposed to more general segntation is unlikely to be more than a useful
simplification.    However,   it is true that our test of nonprice      barriers is

sensitive to assumptions about functional     form.   Any   of   the problaiis listed

above   could account for our rejection of the null hypothesis of no nonprice
barriers.
     To a certain extent this is a criticism of all sophisticated
econa-netric testing of econcrnic theories. More generally, the argument
takes the following form. All models are wrong not just because they are
approxiiiiations to a caiiplicated reality but also because the extent of our
knowledge is inherently limited. Therefore any tests of econanic theories
which rely on models are based on assumptions which we know to be false, and
it is irrpossible to tell whether we are rejecting the false assumptions or
the theory we claim to reject. Hec1uian and Hotz caie close to athracing
this position in their recognition that human capital theory is no more
testable than dual labor market theory (p530). Sunuiers (1987) makes
essentially this argument.
       To the extent that our critics take this nihilistic position, we have
considerable sympathy with their carments and are undertaking new tests
which rely less heavily on a constrained model. Nevertheless, we believe
that sane light can be cast on the usefulness of the test by subjecting the
                                                                                        4

model on which it is based to a standard test of specification to determine
whether the model is clearly incanpatible with the data. The results are
presented below.


II. Goodness of Fit Tests
    The strategy we use in this paper is qpite simple. We begin by
calculating the Moore (1977) goodness of fit test statistic and by visually
ccmparing the predicted and npirical wage distrib.itions for the
unrestricted dual market model using the PSID data set extract fran our 1985
paper which excludes observations fran the SEE) sample. This data set
contains 1696 observations on male heads-of-households.
    We began by using $ .25 intervals b.it discovered that the model failed2
apparently because of its inability to predict the tendency of wages to
cluster at exact dollar values. This result serves to underscore the view
that all models are wrong. However, when we used $1 intervals, we could not
reject the hypothesis that the model was correctly specified at the 05
level. The test statistic was 28.4 which has a probability of exactly .1
with twenty degrees of freedcm. Moreover, as can be seen in figure 1, the
dual labor market predicted distrilxition tracks the &npirical distribition
very well.
     The intervals ranges are less than $1.71, $1.71        to $2.70, ...     $20.71

and up.3     Peaks   appear in   the intervals covering $7 .50 and   $10 .00 per hour
which   are not captured by the model, bit otherwise the model tracks the

aipirical   distrib.ition   ranarkably accurately. Thus we conclude that the

dual labor market model provides a good        representation of   the wage

distribition    except for its inability to account for the attraction of
                                                                                      5

certain round numbers.
       Of course, the fact that the dual   labor    market model represents the
wage distri1ition well does not danonstrate that the heteroskedastic error
models which other people "knew about all along" do not fit the distribition

equally   well.   Since there are undoubtedly   a   large number of such mcxels, it

is a little difficult to know how    to proceed.     Nevertheless, we believe that

the   following approach will generally be viewed as reasonable.
      Cur model used 21 parameters. Cut of a sense of good sport and fair
play, we decided to allow the alternative model 22 parameters, 11 to
describe the regression line and 11 to describe the heteroskedastic
structure of the disturbance term. The first seven terms were obvious --          a

constant and the effects of living in an SMSA, never having been married,
race, schooling, experience arid its square. SalEwhat less obvious but we
thought likely to be chosen by most people were schooling and experience
interacted and race and schooling interacted. For the raTaining two terms,
we chose between interacting race and the experience terms and adding
schooling squared and its interaction with race. The second specification
performs better   in   the sense that the R2 is higher for both the wage
equation and the equation explaining the heteroskedastic structure. We
therefore tested that specification using a goodness of fit test.
     The heteroskedastic single equation model is easiiy rejected. The
Chernoff-LeI-iiiann test statistic is 67.5 with 20 degrees of freedari which is
significant at any conventional level. Moreover, as can be seen frau figure
1, ccvipared with the dual labor market model, the predicted distribution
based on the single equation model conforms notably less wefl to the
aiipirical distribution. While we have not exhausted the set of error
                                                                                 6


distributions which people will have known about all along, we have given
the single equation rrcdel a fair chance, and it has not performed up to the
standards of the dual labor market model. We therefore conclude that the
dual labor market model provides a better description of the wage
distribution than single equation models.


III.   Conclusion

       While   the dual   labor market model outperforms a   reasonable single
equation alternative and "passes" a goodness of fit test, it is clear that
the dual labor market model developed in our paper does not provide a
ccrnplete description of the wage distribution. At the very least, it cannot
account for certain spikes in the distribution. Moreover, it seans likely
that with a sufficiently large data set, even a test based on the wage
intervals used in this paper would allow us to reject the model.
     While we find these results supportive of the dual labor market
description of the wage distribution, they pose a more serious problQrt for
our test of the existence of nonprice barriers to primary sector anployment.
Without considerable Monte Carlo experimentation which would be
prohibitively expensive, it is iimpossible to determine precisely the effect
on our test of apparently minor departures frcm the normality asswiption.
While we recognize this as a lijriitation of our test and that it serves to
underline the importance of pirsuing other avenues for testing the same
hypothesis, it should nevertheless              that this criticism is not
                                         be recognized

particular to our model and test but instead is quite general. It can be
applied to all attanpts to test theories in the context of ccniplex models.
