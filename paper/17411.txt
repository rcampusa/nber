                                            ABSTRACT

While vote-buying is common, little is known about how politicians determine who to target. We argue
that vote-buying can be sustained by an internalized norm of reciprocity. Receiving money engenders
feelings of obligation. Combining survey data on vote-buying with an experiment-based measure of
reciprocity, we show that politicians target reciprocal individuals. Overall, our findings highlight the
importance of social preferences in determining political behavior.

1       Introduction
In most models of democratic politics, politicians compete for votes. How politicians per-
suade voters to vote for them not only underpins our theories of democracy, but is central
for understanding why politicians target goods towards particular groups of voters. The
literature on redistributive politics has suggested several groups politicians might want to
target, such as voters who are ideologically unattached, better organized, or more informed.1
These predictions, however, often arise in models in which politicians can commit to future
policies or compete based on a restricted set of standard policies.2 Yet it is common around
much of the world for politicians to offer goods to specific individuals before an election in
exchange for their votes.3
    There are at least two features that differentiate vote-buying from standard forms of re-
distribution.4 First, it is not an official policy to be judged at the polls, but rather a targeted
attempt to weaken electoral discipline. Thus, vote-buying could potentially undermine the
desired effects of democratic constitutional arrangements. Second, the individual transfers
involved in vote-buying are relatively small, and are delivered personally. While the first fea-
ture underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms that make vote-buying
possible, the second feature suggests that factors governing interpersonal relationships may
play a critical role.
    In this paper, we investigate how vote-buying leverages social preferences. We argue that
vote-buying is sustained, in part, by individuals’ feelings of intrinsic reciprocity.5 Voters
who are offered money or material goods in exchange for their votes reciprocate because
they experience pleasure in increasing the material payoffs of the politician who has helped
    1
      Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) argue that politicians target voters without strong ideological attachments,
whereas Cox and McCubbins (1986) suggest politicians target their core supporters. Other studies have sug-
gested politicians target the well-informed (Grossman and Helpman, 1996), the relatively poor or numerous
(Dixit and Londregan, 1996), or those who can solve collective action problems (Persson and Tabellini, 2000).
    2
      When the assumption of commitment is relaxed, politicians may have to target other groups or implement
inefficient forms of redistribution (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2001; Coate and Morris, 1995).
    3
      For instance, during Thailand’s 1996 general elections, one third of households were offered vote-buying,
with an average offer of $27 (Phongpaichit et al., 2000). In Nicaragua’s 2008 municipal elections, 24 percent
of registered voters claimed to be offered a gift or service in exchange for their vote (González-Ocantos et al.,
2010). One legislative candidate in Taiwan was thought to have distributed up to $3 million.
    4
      Vote buying can often refer to just the specific act of exchanging one’s own vote for material goods.
In this paper, we have adopted a broader definition of vote-buying to also include notions of clientelism,
whereby voters will support candidates who have provided them with particularistic forms of redistribution.
    5
      According to Sobel (2005) and Cox et al. (2007), intrinsic reciprocity is a person’s willingness to sacrifice
his own material well-being in order to increase the payoffs of someone who has been kind to him or to decrease
the payoffs of someone who has been unkind to him. This is contrasted with instrumental reciprocity which
is motivated by forward-looking self-interest.

them.
    To test whether politicians target reciprocal individuals, we combine survey information
on vote-buying experienced in a 2006 municipal election with experimental data on individual
intrinsic reciprocity. In Paraguay, politicians hire respected community leaders in each village
to interact with voters in order to promote their candidacy and offer them money and other
forms of aid in exchange for the promise of their vote. One particularly novel feature of our
data is that we conduct a survey with the actual middlemen who broker the vote-buying
exchanges between voters and politicians.
    We find that middlemen are much more likely to target reciprocal individuals. A one
standard deviation increase in reciprocity increases the likelihood of experiencing vote-buying
by 44 percent. This finding is robust to controlling for a rich set of individual characteristics,
including other social preferences as well as social network architecture. We also find that
villagers targeted for transfers are not significantly closer in the network to the middlemen.
These findings indicate that our measure of intrinsic reciprocity is not proxying for other
mechanisms that would make an individual more likely to cooperate in relationships in
general, or with the middleman in specific. Together, this suggests that we have measured a
non-middleman-specific feature of the voter’s utility function that makes him more likely to
reciprocate in a non-instrumental way, and that this measure of reciprocity is strongly and
robustly correlated with targeted transfers.
    That middlemen are able to target more reciprocal voters is not surprising in the con-
text of these small village economies, where villagers know each other remarkably well. To
demonstrate this, we compare the answers provided by the middlemen about the villagers
with the answers provided by the villagers themselves. We find that the middlemen’s and
villagers’ answers are not only highly correlated for questions regarding observable char-
acteristics (e.g., landholdings and years of schooling), but also for social preferences. For
instance, middlemen are able to predict villagers’ play in a game measuring altruism and
identify whether a person claims he would always punish someone who put him in a difficult
situation.
    Our results are consistent three potential theories. First, because there is no formal way
to contract on votes in an election with secret ballots, politicians and voters may be unable
to credibly commit to an exchange (Robinson and Verdier, 2003). By targeting reciprocal
individuals, middlemen can overcome these commitment problems. Second, middlemen may
be buying the turnout of individuals whose vote they can predict rather than buying the
vote of someone who would otherwise have voted for the opposition. Under both turnout-


                                                2
buying and vote-buying, the reciprocal individual will be the cheapest to purchase. Finally,
vote-buying may be an outcome of a repeated game between the politician and the voter.
Even if voters doubt the anonymity of the ballot, middlemen may want to target reciprocal
individuals because, as Sobel (2005) points out, it will be easier to maintain a repeated game
with mutual cooperation with those who are intrinsically reciprocal. In any case, our findings
provide important evidence that middlemen do target transfers to reciprocal individuals.
    While there is a nascent yet growing empirical literature on vote-buying and its determi-
nants, much of the focus has been on the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of
those who get targeted (e.g. González-Ocantos et al., 2010; Stokes, 2005). No paper to our
knowledge has examined the importance of social preferences and pro-social attitudes in who
gets targeted. The theoretical literature on vote-buying is much more developed than the
empirical literature (Dal Bó, 2007; Dekel et al., 2007; Dixit and Londregan, 1996; Robinson
and Verdier, 2003). However, many studies focus on the consequences of vote-buying on
political competition and welfare. Finally, while the literature in political science does dis-
cuss the importance of reciprocity in maintaining vote-buying (Schaffer, 2007), our study is
the first to test empirically the importance of reciprocity for vote-buying, and politics more
broadly.
    Our paper is also related to an important strand of the experimental economics literature
that explores the extent to which behavior in a laboratory setting can explain behavior
outside the lab. Several studies have shown that behavior in the lab can be predictive of
a person’s decision to, for instance, repay their microfinance loans (Karlan, 2005), donate
to charities (Benz and Meier, 2008), or exert more effort in team production (Carpenter
and Seki, 2011). Our study complements this literature in demonstrating that reciprocity
measured in an experiment is correlated with political behavior in the real world.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background
information on the politics in Paraguay, as well as a brief discussion about why reciprocity
may be an important feature of vote-buying. The data and an explanation of our measures of
vote-buying and reciprocity are presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents the main findings
of the paper along with a discussion of potential mechanisms while section 5 concludes.


2    Background
Paraguay was a dictatorship under the rule of Alfredo Stroessner of the Colorado party
from 1954 to 1989. Until 2008, when an independent bishop won the presidency, the Col-


                                              3
orado party was the longest continuously ruling party controlling the national government
in power at the time. Paraguay is a two-party country, although smaller parties have re-
cently gained popularity. The 2006 elections discussed in this paper saw the election of 66%
Colorado mayors, 30% Liberal mayors, and 4% mayors from other parties. Political parties
in Paraguay are not very ideologically oriented. As a result, political campaigns tend to be
highly personalized (Rizova, 2007).
    When ideological differences are small, vote-buying and reciprocity can have a larger
influence on voting. Political scientists note the importance of reciprocity for sustaining
vote-buying. According to Schaffer (2007, p. 193), “embedding vote-buying within ritual gift
exchange helps engender feelings of obligation among recipients, and can thus lower the rate
of defection.” Likewise Hicken (2007, p. 157) states, “in an attempt to change the cultural
norms that support vote-buying in Thailand, specifically the norm of reciprocity, a senior
Buddhist monk declared that it was not immoral to take money from one candidate and
vote for another.” Dunning and Stokes (2007) find evidence of reciprocity in Mexico where
many initially pro-PRI voters who did not receive gifts decided to vote for the opposition.
    The importance of reciprocity for the effectiveness of vote-buying is also evident in
Paraguay. From July to September of 2005, Transparencia Paraguay (the national branch of
Transparency International) carried out interviews and focus groups regarding the financing
of electoral campaigns.6 We present two quotes suggesting that reciprocity is a well-known
phenomenon when it comes to vote-buying in Paraguay.
           To enable us to obtain votes, we visit families personally and, for sure, right
       then and there, they are going to ask you for a favor. They first ask if you have
       work for one of the members of that family, help for health expenses, purchase of
       medicines, water bills, and electricity. They virtually force you to perform, and
       if you don’t then you don’t get their vote. -Atilio López (Liberal), head of the
       municipal legislature in Capiatá
           And the political operatives do their job with the money, specifically, with the
       money of the candidate. The operative does his work, buying the conscience of
       the voter with money, with alcohol, buying his id card, a little medicine, sugar,
       bread, tea, and in this way he goes buying and winning adherents. -Antonio
       Espinoza, President of the neighborhood committee in Capilla del Monte
   If, as these quotes suggest, politicians rely on an individual’s reciprocity to effectively
buy votes, then the politician has an incentive to target the most reciprocal voters. Of

course, if candidates target reciprocal voters, this assumes they know the voters’ levels of
reciprocity. In these rural settings, candidates do not interact directly with voters, but
use political operatives (operadores polı́ticos), who act as middlemen between the candidate
and the voters. These political operatives tend to be village leaders who know their fellow
villagers well.7 Although there are additional quotes in the Appendix, here is one.
        For the community to conform, the candidate needs an operador polı́tico in the
        field: the operador polı́tico, a professional in politics and leader of his community,
        becomes the backbone of the election campaign. Through operadores polı́ticos,
        candidates can build their network of promises of aid, favors, and meet the ex-
        pectations of the poorest people in the electorate.
    According to Lehoucq (2007, p. 39) the situation is similar in Taiwan and Thailand.
“Candidates circumvented the secret ballot by working with local brokers, who, in the context
of small and tightly knit rural communities, could reasonably predict the behavior of voters.”
Likewise, according to Schaffer (2007, p. 183) in the conclusion of his edited volume on
vote-buying, “as several authors in this volume note, candidates who wish to undertake
even moderately successful vote-buying campaigns need to know which voters are amenable
to having their participation or abstention bought. Gathering this information requires
extensive grassroots organizing, using local people with local knowledge.”


3       Survey and Experimental Data
We use data from a household survey conducted in 2007 and a middleman survey conducted
in 2010. The household survey is the fifth round of a longitudinal study initiated in 1991
by UW Madison, in cooperation with the Centro Paraguayo de Estudios Sociológicos in
Asunción. The original survey randomly selected 300 households based on landholdings
from 15 villages in rural Paraguay.
    In 2002, 187 of the 223 remaining survey households sent a member to participate in
experiments measuring trust, trustworthiness, and risk aversion. By 2007, only 202 of the
original households remained and 248 new households were added to complete 30 households
per village. In 2007, a module was added to capture voting and vote-buying. When possible,
    7
     The use of middlemen for vote-buying has been well documented by anthropologists and sociologists.
Scott (1972) describes how norms of reciprocity and middlemen played important roles in Filipino elections.
Schmidt et al. (1977) presents the classic treatment on the role of brokers as central figures in the operation
of clientelistic systems.



                                                      5
we asked the political module in 2007 to the same individual who participated in the games
in 2002, and succeeded in 140 cases.
    In 2010 we returned to two out of the three departments (covering 10 out of 15 villages)
to interview political operatives. We interviewed 38 of the 43 middlemen working in those
villages. First we asked them if they knew the 30 individuals and they knew 87 percent of
them. For the individuals they knew, we asked questions to measure how well they knew
them (e.g., their spouse’s name, years of education, and hectares of land owned), whether
or not that individual had been offered vote-buying by the middleman’s party or another
party, and how they thought the person would behave in altruism and reciprocity games.


Measuring Vote-Buying and Social Preferences
Municipal elections occurred in November of 2006, the household survey took place between
March and July of 2007, and the middleman survey took place between August and October
of 2010. We have one measure of vote-buying from the household data and one from the
middleman data. In the household survey, respondents were asked whether, during the run-
up to the 2006 elections, any political party offered them money, food, payment of utility bills,
medicines, and/or other goods (excluding propaganda hats, shirts, and posters). In 2010,
we asked the middleman if his party offered each of the 30 individuals money, food items,
payment of utility bills, medicines, and/or other goods, and then separately asked whether
another party offered the individual those same items. The vote-buying variable measured
from the middleman survey is the union of the answers to those two questions, indicating
whether or not the middleman claims that any party offered the individual vote-buying.
    Our measure of reciprocity is constructed from play in the 2002 trust game (Berg et al.,
1995). In this game, the first mover was given 8000 Gs (1000 Gs were worth about 20
US cents at the time of the experiment) and had to decide whether to send nothing, 2000,
4000, 6000, or 8000 Gs to the second mover. Whatever he sent was tripled and the second
mover could keep or return as much as he wanted. Before finding out how much was sent
to him, the second mover was asked how much he would return if he received 6000 Gs, how
much if 12000 Gs, how much if 18000 Gs, and how much if 24000 Gs. Then he had to play
accordingly.
    Second movers may choose how much to return based both on their level of altruism and
on their level of reciprocity. The more altruistic they are, the more they should return in all
four cases. The more reciprocal they are, the more they should return when the first mover
treats them well, and the less they should return when the first mover treats them poorly.

                                               6
We assume that when the first mover sends at least half, the second mover thinks that he has
been treated well. On the other hand, if the first mover sends less than half, then the second
mover thinks he has been treated poorly. To measure reciprocity, we calculate the average
share returned when receiving 12000, 18000, or 24000 Gs (signifying the first mover sent half
or more of his endowment) minus the share returned when receiving 6000 Gs (signifying the
first mover sent only a quarter of his endowment). In this way we subtract out altruism to
have a pure measure of reciprocity.
    Next we take this measure and censor it below 0. A negative value of the share difference
means that the recipient returns a higher share when treated poorly than when treated well.
If we take this seriously, it would suggest that a politician should treat people with negative
share differences poorly. Since transfers from politicians must be non-negative, the worst
thing a politician can do to an individual is give him nothing. Thus, it is optimal to transfer
nothing to people with both negative and zero values of the share difference.
    Since all play was one-shot and anonymous, this measures intrinsic (rather than instru-
mental) reciprocity. We can link the experimental measure of reciprocity from 2002 to
information on vote-buying in 2006 for 140 of the original 187 players. Average reciprocity
is 0.043.


Summary Statistics
We see in Table I that based on the household survey, 26 percent of the full sample claims
to have been offered something in exchange for their votes in the 2006 municipal elections.
The average value of the transfer offered is 48 dollars and the mean is 18 dollars. A day of
labor in agriculture earns between three and four dollars, so this is a sizeable amount. Both
main parties participate in vote-buying. We find that 31 percent of those who self-identify as
Colorado and 23 percent of those who self-identify as Liberales claimed to have experienced
vote-buying. It is also the case that 13 percent of those who are affiliated with neither
main party experienced vote-buying. The amounts offered, conditional on being offered, are
quite similar across parties. Villages contain a mix of Colorados and Liberales: the share
of respondents in a village claiming to be Colorado ranges from 0.37 to 0.83 with a median
value of 0.53.
    Middlemen claim that their party offered something to 33 percent of the individuals in
our sample who they knew, and claim that some party offered something to 46 percent of
the individuals.8 The individual’s report is predictive of the middleman’s report of vote-
  8
      This is the mean over all middlemen’s statements regarding all individuals.


                                                      7
buying at the 5% level after controlling for middleman fixed effects. A regression of the
middleman’s report on the individual’s report, including middlemen intercepts, yields a
significant coefficient of 0.053 (standard error=0.023). Our estimates of both the incidence
of vote-buying and the amount are consistent with several estimates in the literature (Stokes,
2005; Vicente, 2008; Wang and Kurzman, 2007).
    For many of our control variables we have versions from both the 2007 and 2010 surveys.
For example, we know both whether the individual claims to have voted (70% of the sample)
and whether the middleman thinks the individual voted (89% of the individuals the mid-
dleman knew). We also know whether the individual claims to support the Colorado Party
(56%), and whether the middleman thinks the individual would rank Colorados higher than
Liberales on a feeling thermometer (48%). In 2007 we had the individuals participate in a
dictator game choosing how much to give out of 14000 Gs to an anonymous village-mate.
The average amount sent was 5100 Gs. When we asked the middlemen how much they
thought the individuals would give in such a game, the average answer was 4800 Gs.


4       Empirical Results
We begin this section by examining the extent to which middlemen know the individuals. We
show that middlemen do remarkably well in predicting not only the observable attributes of
villagers, but also their social preferences. We then provide empirical evidence that reciprocal
individuals are more likely to be targeted for vote-buying and discuss potential mechanisms
behind this association.


4.1     How Well Do Middlemen Know Villagers?
One of our central premises is that middlemen can infer which villagers are most recipro-
cal. We test this assumption in Table II, which measures the accuracy of the middlemen’s
responses to questions about the individuals. In the first five columns of Panel A, we report
a series of summary statistics based on the share of correct responses by each middleman to
various questions with binary outcomes. In the last column, we report the p-value associated
with a one-sided test comparing the share correct given by the average middleman to the
share correct of someone who knew the sample average but then guessed at random.9 For
    9
    Specifically, for each middleman we drew randomly from a binomial distribution with the sample mean
and computed the share of correct responses. We then averaged across the 38 “middlemen” to compute the
average share correct. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times and computed the p-values associated with


                                                   8
the continuous outcome measures presented in Panel B, we present summary statistics on
the simple correlation between a middleman’s responses and the villagers’ responses. In the
last column, we test whether the average correlation across middlemen is zero.
     The results of Table II indicate that middlemen know the other members of the village
extremely well. For example, the correlation between the middleman’s report of the villagers’
years of schooling and the villagers’ own reports is 0.73. To put this number into context,
according to Ashenfelter and Krueger (1994) the correlation between identical twins’ reports
of each other’s years of schooling ranges from 0.87 to 0.92. Middlemen also do well in
predicting the amount of land households own (an average correlation of 0.68) and can
correctly name the spouses of the other villagers 84 percent of the time.
     As expected, middlemen also accurately predict villagers’ political attributes. On average,
middlemen correctly answered whether or not an individual voted in the 2006 elections 71
percent of the time. The average share correct over middlemen would only have been 56
percent if they had guessed at random based on the sample average. The middlemen also
predict with high success villagers’ political leanings; middlemen correctly identified whether
a villager supported the Colorado party or the Liberal party 77 and 83 percent of the time.
     In addition to the villagers’ observable characteristics, the results from Table II also
suggest that middlemen are able to infer the villagers’ social preferences. For instance, mid-
dlemen correctly predicted whether or not 66 percent of the villagers sent at least half of
their endowment in a dictator game. Moreover the correlation between the middleman’s be-
lief regarding the amount sent and the actual amount is 0.084, which is statistically different
from zero at the ten percent level. Middlemen also correctly predict for 74 percent of the
sample whether or not the person identities himself as not trusting and whether he would
always punish someone who put him in a difficult situation. In both cases, the middlemen
fared significantly better than someone guessing at random would have.
     In sum, Table II provides strong evidence that these middlemen, who have lived in the
village for on average 39 years and have served as middleman for on average 18 years, are
quite knowledgeable about the other members of the village and their basic social prefer-
ences.10 Moreover, given that these middlemen were asked to answer questions about 30
randomly selected villagers, these results may represent a lower bound for the extent to
which middlemen know members of their own patron-client network.
comparing this empirical distribution to the true average across middlemen.
  10
     The ability to provide accurate assessments about others, while impressive, has been documented in
other settings. Takasaki et al. (2000) find that village informants in the Peruvian Amazon can report the
physical and human capital of other villagers quite accurately.

4.2     Vote-Buying and Reciprocity
To examine the relationship between reciprocity and the likelihood that someone is targeted
for vote-buying, we estimate a series of linear probability models:
                               offeredi = α + βreciprocityi + Xi0 δ + i                              (1)
where offeredi is an indicator for whether or not individual i was offered some good in
exchange for his vote. The variable reciprocityi denotes the experiment-based measure of
reciprocity, while the vector Xi represents a set of observable characteristics at the individual,
household, and village level. The error term, i , denotes unobserved characteristics that
determine a vote-buying exchange. All standard errors are robust against heteroskedasticity.
    Table III presents results from estimating variants of Equation (1). Column (1) reports
the unadjusted relationship between whether or not the person claims he was offered goods
in exchange for his vote and reciprocity. The specification presented in column (2) controls
for a rich set of characteristics: gender, age, education level, wealth, number of family mem-
bers eligible to vote, registered voter, believes the ballot is anonymous, has strong political
sentiment, votes by party, supports the Colorado party, and number of registered voters in
the municipality. While several of these variables are themselves equilibrium outcomes and
should arguably not be included as controls, they may serve to proxy for some unobserved
characteristics that might be correlated with reciprocity.
    From the bivariate relationship in column (1), a one-standard deviation increase in reci-
procity increases the likelihood of being targeted by 9.6 percentage points, which represents
a 42.1 percent increase from the average vote-buying experienced by the sample. The results
in column (2) suggest that it is unlikely that politicians are using vote-buying as a signal of
future support to certain groups. The inclusion of additional controls which represent most,
if not all, of the standard socio-economic characteristics emphasized in the redistributive
politics literature (e.g. age, gender, education, income level, strength of party preferences,
etc) has only a minimal effect, as the coefficient (point estimate =1.318; and standard error
= 0.568) remains statistically and economically indistinguishable from the unadjusted esti-
mate presented in column (1). When comparing the impact of reciprocity to the impact of
log wealth, we find that a one standard deviation increase in reciprocity has the same impact
as a 1.8 standard deviation decrease in wealth. Thus, reciprocity is both statistically and
economically significant in predicting political transfers.11
  11
    We also find that reciprocal people, as measured by the experiment, are more likely to reciprocate re-
ceiving vote-buying transfer. We estimate Equation (1) using as the dependent variable whether respondents
who reported being offered and accepting a good from some political party voted for that party. Despite


                                                   10
4.2.1    Robustness

Reciprocity may not be the only social preference affecting vote-buying. Altruism, trustwor-
thiness, risk aversion, or time preference may also influence targeting. For example, voters
may be risk averse as to the true anonymity of their vote. Candidates might also target
trustworthy voters who can be trusted to keep their promise. If these other personal traits
are correlated with our measure of reciprocity, then our estimates are potentially biased. In
column (3) of Table III, we test whether the association between reciprocity and vote-buying
is robust to controlling for these traits. We control for an individual’s level of risk aversion,
time preference, and trust in candidates based on survey data, and altruism based on the
anonymous dictator game conducted in 2007. Controlling for these additional characteristics
does not affect the outcome of interest, as we see that reciprocal individuals are still more
likely to experience vote-buying (point estimate = 1.207).12
    Politicians may also choose to target individuals with larger social networks since offering
something to a well-connected person may induce others to vote for that candidate either
through social learning or conformity. Alternatively, well-connected people may have traits
other than reciprocity that lead them to cooperate more often. Thus, if individuals with
larger social networks are also more reciprocal, then our effects will be overestimated. We
have detailed data on each survey respondent’s social network and so look at three network
variables: the degree is the number of households in the village with which the household is
connected, the clustering coefficient is a measure of how connected the household’s friends
are to one another, and the contagion time is a measure of how long it would take information
to get from the household to everyone else in the village.13 In column (4) of Table III, we
control for all three measures and find that our estimated effect remains unchanged.
    Another concern is if individuals misreport vote-buying in a way that is correlated with
reciprocity. For example, if reciprocal people are more honest or better able to remember
the instances in which such an exchange was proposed then the results may be confounded.
In column (5), we re-estimate the model using as a dependent variable an indicator for
only have 22 observations, and even after controlling for various individual and household characteristics, we
find a strong correlation between reciprocity and voting for the party that bought one’s vote (point estimate
=1.338; robust standard error =0.627).
   12
      Our results are also robust to controlling for whether the person attended a political rally, which could
proxy for someone’s level of civic-mindedness.
   13
      To be specific, the clustering coefficient is the number of links between an individual’s ‘friends’ divided
by the number of links that could possibly exist between them. The path length between two individuals is
the shortest path between them while the contagion time is the path length between the individual and the
person from whom he is farthest away.

whether the middleman claims a person was offered vote-buying by any party.14 Using this
more general measure, we also find a strong and robust relationship between the targeting
of individuals and reciprocity. Although some middlemen may be more likely than others
to admit that vote-buying takes place at all, it is not clear that, conditional on admitting
that vote-buying takes place, they should selectively admit that vote-buying was offered to
specific types of individuals.15 Because our results hold using both the middlemen’s and the
individuals’ statements regarding vote-buying, we are confident that our results are not due
to reporting errors.

4.2.2    Discussion

Overall, our findings suggest that middlemen are much more likely to target reciprocal
individuals. There are four potential explanations for this reduced-form result. First, as
Robinson and Verdier (2003) point out, most standard models of elections would suggest
that vote-buying should not exist. With secret balloting, votes are unobservable and a
politician’s promises are unenforceable. With this double commitment problem, there is
no formal way to contract for votes in an election. One explanation of our results is that
politicians target more reciprocal individuals, and this helps them overcome the commitment
issues associated with anonymous voting.
    A second interpretation of our findings is that politicians actually know which party
voters prefer and are simply paying them to turn out to vote. Politicians will have an
incentive to target more reciprocal individuals even in a model of turnout-buying. This is
because, without reciprocity, a politician will have to pay a voter the cash-equivalent of his
disutility from voting to convince him to turn out. Reciprocal people can be paid less than
their disutility from voting, since the receipt of money will engender in them a desire to
reciprocate. In principle, one could test the turnout-buying model. Middlemen should be
less likely to target either an individual with a high propensity to vote, given that the voter
will vote anyway; or an individual with a low propensity to vote, given that this voter is more
costly to convince to vote. Unfortunately, without a good measure of someone’s propensity
   14
      Note that the unit of observation in this regression is a middleman-individual pair. Thus when estimating
this regression, we include middleman fixed-effects and cluster the standard errors at the middleman level.
   15
      A middleman may have an incentive to under-report his own vote-buying from friends or relatives so as
not to appear guilty of cronyism. On the other hand, middlemen should not have an incentive to selectively
lie about to whom the other party offers money. When we measure vote-buying based only on who the
middleman claims the other party targeted we find that it is still significantly correlated with reciprocity.
(The coefficient is 0.538 with a standard error of 0.235 when using middleman fixed effects and clustering at
the middleman level).



                                                      12
to vote it is difficult to test this alternative mechanism.16
    Another interpretation of our results is that reciprocity is not necessarily enabling politi-
cians to overcome a commitment problem but rather facilitating cooperation in a repeated
game. Table 1 showed that only 54 percent of individuals claim to believe their ballot
is secret. If voting is believed to be observable, then repeated game interactions between
the middleman and the voter might be another channel by which vote-buying is sustained.
However, even if the ballot were not anonymous, middlemen still have an incentive to target
intrinsically reciprocal individuals. As Sobel (2005) points out, intrinsic reciprocity (i.e.,
when a kind act by one individual affects the preferences of another to elicit kindness in
response) can also help sustain cooperation in repeated games, and this would explain the
correlation we find between intrinsic reciprocity, which is measured based on a one-shot
game, and vote-buying.17
    However, the perceived lack of secrecy of the ballot would also allow for the possibility of
instrumental reciprocity (i.e., the strategy by which selfish individuals sacrifice their short
term gains in order to increase their future payoffs). If voting is believed to be observable,
an individual may behave reciprocally with a middleman, not because he is intrinsically
reciprocal, but in order to sustain a long term relationship with the middleman or his party.
But there are three reasons why our results do not reflect instrumental reciprocity. First,
although only 54 percent of individuals claim to believe their ballot is secret, when we
worded the question slightly differently in the follow-up survey, we found that 81 percent of
individuals interviewed thought the ballots are secret and middlemen believe that 93 percent
of individuals think the ballots are secret. Thus, it is likely that the original question
was misunderstood and that the majority of individuals do believe their vote cannot be
observed.18 Second, we do not find any evidence that middlemen target individuals who do
not believe the ballots are anonymous. Third, using data on the middlemen’s social networks
we do not find any evidence that they are more likely to target individuals with whom they
are linked socially.19
  16
      We experimented with using an individual’s distance to a polling station as an instrument to estimate
his propensity to vote. Although distance to the voting booth does predict one’s likelihood to vote, it is still
too weak to use as an instrument.
   17
      Using a one-shot gift-giving game to classify intrinsically reciprocal individuals, Gächter and Falk (2002)
find evidence that reciprocal individuals are much more likely to sustain cooperation in a repeated game.
   18
      In 2007, we asked individuals: “In your opinion, can someone figure out how someone in your polling
place voted?” As we discovered in the field, this poorly phrased question can be interpreted as ‘figuring it
out’ because people know each other’s preferences. In 2010 we reworded the question we asked middlemen to
be: “Do you think that votes are secret?” We also resurveyed a sample of 119 of the original 449 households
and asked them the same question asked to middlemen.
   19
      On the other hand, we do find that the middleman is more likely to choose to play an economic game

                                                       13
    A final explanation is that the correlation we estimate is due to reciprocal voters ap-
proaching middlemen and demanding favors from them. We can test this explicitly because
we asked the middlemen whether each individual requested goods from his party during the
elections. According to these middlemen, 26 percent of our sample approached them for
some good. However, as shown in column (7) of Table III, we do not find any evidence that
reciprocal individuals are more likely to demand vote-buying.


5      Concluding remarks
In this paper, we argue that in rural Paraguay vote-buying is sustained, in part, by intrinsic
reciprocity. Using a novel data-set combining survey data on vote-buying with data on
behavior in experiments, we show that politicians, via middlemen, are 44 percent more
likely to offer an individual who is one standard deviation more reciprocal something in
exchange for his vote than the average individual.
    Overall our findings provide evidence on the influence that reciprocity can have in politics
and highlight the need to re-examine some of the core assumptions underlying standard
voting models. Voters have other-regarding preferences and these preferences may affect
how they vote, and consequently the policies politicians adopt.20 Voters’ social preferences
may explain outcomes that are difficult to rationalize with standard models such as why
people vote or why voters respond to economic growth just prior to an election. And while
recent models incorporating social preferences have provided some useful insights into such
issues (Fowler, 2006; Rotemberg, 2009), more research is clearly needed.
with those individuals with whom he is linked socially. A skilled middleman targets vote-buying to those
whose votes are most cheaply and reliably bought (the reciprocal), while he chooses to play the economic
games with people with whom he interacts socially.
   20
      Although this is the first paper to explicitly test this hypothesis empirically, it is evident in other studies.
For instance, Romer (1996) argues that negative reciprocity can explain the expansion of Social Security in
the U.S. during the 1950’s, and why voters respond to an entitlement payment differently than a transfer.
Recently, Manacorda et al. (2011) show that recipients of a cash transfer program supported the incumbent
government and this support continued on even after the program ended. The persistence of these effects
is difficult to rationalize with a pocketbook voting model or a standard political agency model, but it is
consistent with voter reciprocity. Vicente (2008) conducts an innovative anti-vote-buying campaign and
finds that it reduced the influence of money offered on voting. One interpretation of this result is that the
campaign, which implored voters to vote their conscience, broke the norm of reciprocity.

Notes: The 2007 survey data is based on 449 observations. The 2007 (2002) experimental data is based on the 281 (140) observations in which the same person who
participated in the games answered the political survey. The 2010 middleman data is based on answers given by 38 middlemen regarding 299 individuals for a total of
977 observations. Reciprocity is the average share returned when receiving 24000 18000 or 12000 Gs in the trust game minus the share returned when receiving 6000
Gs, censored below 0. For voting behavior (individual survey, 2007): Political sentiment is 1 if the person says he is a strong party member of either of the two main
parties. Vote by party is 1 if the person says voters ought to always vote for their party even if they don't like their party's candidate. Anonymous ballot is an indicator
for whether the respondent thought someone could figure out how a person in his polling locale had voted. For voting behavior (middleman survey, 2010): Political
sentiment is 1 if the middleman says the individual rates one of the parties higher than 30 (out of 40). Anonymous ballot is an indicator for whether the middleman
thought the individual thought the ballot was secret. Voted is an indicator for whether the middleman thought the individual voted in 2006. Colorado is an indicator
for whether the middleman thinks the individual rated Colorados higher than Liberales on a feeling thermometer. For other controls, altruism is the amount the
individual sent, out of 14000 Gs in an anonymous dictator game. Risk is the number of risky choices made in a hypothetical risk game. Time preferences is the
amount the person would have to be offered in one month rather than accepting 50000 Gs today. Trust is what share of political candidates the person says can be
trusted where 5 is all, 3 is half, and 1 is none. Didn't understand risk game is 1 if the person chose a dominated option. Network degree is the number of households in
the village with which the household is connected, the clustering coefficient is the number links between an individual's “friends” divided by the number of links that
could possibly exist between them, and the contagion time is a measure of how long it would take information to get from the household to everyone else in the
village.

Notes: Panel A reports the average across middlemen of the share of villagers for whom their responses were the same as those given by the middleman. The last column reports
the p-value associated with a one-sided test comparing the share of correct responses from the middlemen to the share of correct responses based on random guessing from a
binomial distribution with a mean equal to the sample average. Panel B reports the average correlation across middlemen between the response of the villagers and those given by
the middleman. The last column reports the p-value associated with a two-sided test that the average correlation across middlemen is zero.

Notes: For each dependent variable listed at the top of each column, the table reports the OLS estimates of the effects of reciprocity. Main controls include: gender, age, education
level, number of family members eligible to vote, log of household wealth, whether the individual is a registered voter, believes the ballot is anonymous, has strong political
sentiment, votes by party, supports the Colorado party, and number of registered voters in the municipality. In columns (5) and (6), the controls when available are based on the
middlemen’s responses, otherwise the controls are based on the individuals’ responses. Columns (5) and (6) include middleman intercepts and cluster at the middleman level. In
addition to the full set of controls, the specifications include: in column (3) measures of altruism, risk, time preferences, trust, and understanding of games; in column (4), the
degree, clustering coefficient, and contagion time from the social network. Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; ***
