Treasury Inconvenience Yields during the COVID-19 Crisis

                                          ABSTRACT

In sharp contrast to most previous crisis episodes, the Treasury market experienced severe stress
and illiquidity during the COVID-19 crisis, raising concerns that the safe-haven status of U.S.
Treasuries may be eroding. We document large shifts in Treasury ownership during this period
and the accumulation of Treasury and reverse repo positions on dealer balance sheets. To
understand the pricing consequences, we build a model in which balance sheet constraints of
dealers and demand/supply shocks from habitat agents determine the term structure of Treasury
yields. A novel element of our model is the inclusion of levered investors' repo financing as part
of dealers' intermediation activities. Both direct holdings of Treasuries and reverse repo positions
of dealers are subject to a regulatory balance sheet constraint. According to the model, Treasury
inconvenience yields, measured as the spread between Treasuries and overnight-index swap
(OIS) rates, as well as spreads between dealers' reverse repo and repo rates, should be increasing
in dealers' balance sheet costs. Consistent with model predictions, we find that both spreads are
large and positive during the COVID-19 crisis. We further show that the same model, adapted to
the institutional setting in 2007-2009, also helps explain the opposite signs of repo spreads and
Treasury convenience yields during the financial crisis.

1        Introduction

U.S. Treasury bonds are generally viewed as some of the most liquid and safe assets in the world.

Their safety and liquidity is reflected in a price premium (Longstaff (2004); Krishnamurthy and

Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)). During periods of financial market turmoil when prices of risky and

illiquid assets fall dramatically due to a flight-to-safety and flight-to-liquidity, the price premium

of Treasuries typically rises (Nagel (2016); Adrian, Crump, and Vogt (2019)). More generally,

Treasury bonds have had negative beta in recent decades, rising in price when stock prices fall (He,

Krishnamurthy, and Milbradt (2019); Baele, Bekaert, Inghelbrecht, and Wei (2019); Campbell,

Pflueger, and Viceira (2019)); Cieslak and Vissing-Jorgensen (2020)).

        Events in March 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis did not follow this established crisis playbook.

Like in many previous periods of financial market turmoil, stock prices fell dramatically, the VIX

of implied stock index return volatility spiked, credit spreads widened, the dollar appreciated, and

prime money market funds experienced outflows. Yet, in sharp contrast to previous crisis episodes,

prices of long-term Treasury securities fell sharply. From March 9 to 23 when the stock market

experienced four halts, the 10-year Treasury yield increased up to 60 basis points, resulting in a

striking and unusual positive correlation between stock and bond returns (see Figure 1). Widening

bid-ask spreads and collapsing order book depth indicated market illiquidity in the Treasury bond

market (Fleming and Ruela (2020)). In direct response, the Federal Reserve (Fed) offered essentially

unconstrained short-term financing to primary dealers for their Treasury positions, but the take-up

was very low.1

        Why was it different this time? Given the Treasury bond market’s outsized role in the financial

system, this stunning deviation from historical correlations in recent decades calls for an explana-

tion. Are the events in March 2020 the canary in the coal mine indicating a fundamental change

in the properties of Treasury bonds away from being a negative-beta flight-to-safety target asset?

Or can the surprising price movements of Treasury bonds be attributed to market dysfunctionality

induced by frictions? Our goal in this paper is to shed light on this question, both empirically and

theoretically.

Notes: This figure plots daily series of the constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) yields in percent, of 3-month
and 10-year maturities (left panel), and of the VIX (right panel), from January 1, 2020 to March 27, 2020.


        We start by characterizing major features of asset price movements and investor flows during

the crucial weeks in March 2020. A simple explanation of the rise in long-term Treasury yields

would be that the enormous fiscal burden of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a shift in inflation

expectations and inflation uncertainty. However, asset price data suggest that this is unlikely. Prices

of inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) fell along with the prices of nominal Treasuries. Inflation-swaps

show no increase in risk-neutral inflation expectations. Prices of inflation caps and floors do not

provide evidence of an increase in inflation uncertainty either.

        An alternative explanation would be that the cyclicality of real interest rates has changed. As

Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2017) emphasize, the negative beta of Treasuries in the decades

leading up to 2020 partly reflects a positive correlation between stock prices and real interest rates.

That March 2020 represents a regime-shift towards a negative correlation cannot be ruled out at

this point. But it would be difficult to come up with an economic mechanism that explains this

shift. In the post-WWII history examined by Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2017), the only

major episode with pro-cyclical bond prices (or, counter-cyclical real interest rates) was the Volcker

disinflation of the early 1980s where the rise of real interest rates in a recession was induced by

contractionary monetary policy intended to crush inflation. This is clearly not what happened in

March 2020.

        We therefore turn to an examination of investor flows to understand whether supply and demand


                                                              2
balances may have interacted with intermediation frictions to give rise to the unusual price move-

ments in the Treasury market. Foreign investors, including foreign central banks and investors in

tax havens, sold about $300 billion (bn) worth of Treasuries, mutual funds sold around $15bn, and

the U.S. Treasury issued about $150bn net. Much of this supply was temporarily accommodated

by broker-dealers, partly through somewhat higher direct holdings, but also indirectly through a

massive expansion of $400bn in repo financing that primary dealers provided to levered investors.

Eventually, starting at the end of March, the Federal Reserve came in and purchased $700bn worth

of Treasury notes and bonds, and the expansion in dealer balance sheets reverted back. The selling

pressure and its eventual accommodation by the Federal Reserve were concentrated in long-term

Treasuries. There was little net selling by foreigners in T-bills and the Federal Reserve did not

expand their T-bill holdings.

   While these are big shifts in the ownership of Treasuries, it is far from obvious that they

could induce substantial increases in Treasury yields in a market that is usually thought to be

extremely liquid. Why didn’t financial intermediaries and agile institutional investors financed by

intermediaries accommodate this supply more elastically? We argue that balance sheet constraints

of dealers played a key role.

   We build on the preferred habitat model of Vayanos and Vila (2020) and Greenwood and

Vayanos (2014) to understand how a negative demand shock for long-term Treasuries can affect

the term structure of Treasury yields. In the preferred habitat model, dealers intermediate the

exogenous demands of habitat investors. Since repo financing was an important part of dealers’

intermediation activities in March 2020, we extend this model to allow levered investors (hedge

funds) to take positions in Treasuries financed by borrowing from dealers in the repo market.

Moreover, dealers are subject to a balance sheet constraint, consistent with the supplementary

leverage ratio (SLR) that dealers are subject to following the reforms adopted after the 2007-09

financial crisis. Importantly, both direct holdings of Treasuries and reverse repo positions that

finance levered investments by hedge funds take up balance sheet space.

   Dealers therefore demand compensation for the shadow cost of balance sheet expansion via

direct holdings (with compensation in the form of higher yield) or repo (with compensation in

the form of higher repo rates). As a consequence, when habitat agents’ desire for direct holdings

of Treasuries drops, the degree to which a rise in yields makes levered investments in Treasuries

                                                3
attractive to hedge funds is limited by the simultaneous rise in repo rates charged by dealers. The

repo friction hurts the demand for Treasury bonds in two ways, first through a more costly current

repo funding, and second via the anticipation of a reduced collateral value of Treasuries in future

financing. Therefore, dealers’ direct holdings and yields need to rise even more in order to clear the

market. In equilibrium then, the yield curve steepens and repo rates rise above frictionless risk-free

rates.

      Empirically, we find support for these predictions. To measure repo rates at which dealers lend

to levered investors, we use the General Collateral Finance (GCF) repo rates (see Fleming and

Garbade (2003)). Much of the activity in the GCF repo market involves large dealers lending to

smaller ones. In this sense, these rates reflect the conditions at which large dealers are willing

to lend against general Treasury collateral (Baklanova, Copeland, and McCaughrin (2015)). We

compare the GCF rate to Triparty repo rates. Most of the financing flow in the Triparty market

involves cash lenders like money market funds lending to large dealers (Baklanova, Copeland, and

McCaughrin (2015)). Consistent with the balance sheet cost explanation, we find that GCF repo

rates substantially exceeded Triparty repo rates at the time when Treasury yields spiked.

      In the model, the rise in long-term yields has two components. The first component is a

heightened risk premium because dealers demand compensation for the interest-rate risk exposure

that the expansion of their direct Treasury holdings entails. The second component reflects the

inconvenience yield induced by the balance sheet cost due to the SLR constraint. To isolate this

second component, we use the dealers’ pricing kernel to price a derivative asset that offers exactly

the same cash-flows as physical Treasury bonds, but without the balance sheet cost. We think of

this derivative asset as an overnight index swap (OIS).2 Practically, the weight imposed by the SLR

constraint on interest rate derivative contracts is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the

weight on Treasury securities, so zero balance sheet cost is a good approximation.

      In line with the model’s predictions, we find that during the two weeks of turmoil, Treasury

yields rose substantially above maturity-matched OIS rates, reflecting the inconvenience yield.

Other measures of the Treasury convenience yield have been eroding since the Great Recession (Du,

Im, and Schreger (2018)). Based on the findings in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012),

the rise in the supply of U.S. Treasuries since the Great Recession could also have contributed to
  2
      The OIS rate can be interpreted as the risk-neutral expectation of the expected Federal Funds Target Rate.


                                                          4
a disappearing convenience yield. Viewed from this perspective, the rise of Treasury yields relative

to OIS rates in March 2020 is a further extension of this phenomenon.

   The inconvenience yield of Treasuries during March 2020 is particularly striking in contrast with

the financial crisis in 2007–09 (or, the Great Recession). Flight-to-safety and liquidity during the

early stages of the financial crisis until mid-2008 pushed Treasury yields below OIS rates. Dealers

came into the financial crisis with a short position in Treasuries. Rather than having to absorb

a supply of Treasuries like in March 2020, dealers were scrambling to obtain more Treasuries. As

a consequence, dealers were willing to lend cash to obtain Treasury collateral in the GCF repo

market at much lower rates—about 70 bps—than they were charged by cash lenders in the triparty

repo market. Unlike in COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, the Federal Reserve took action in 2008 to

increase the supply of Treasuries in the market, for example allowing dealers to obtain Treasuries

against non-Treasury collateral in the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). This seems to have

alleviated the shortage of Treasuries, leading to a closing of the Treasury-OIS and triparty-GCF

rate spreads.

   These empirical patterns in 2007-09 financial crisis (or, the Great Recession) are consistent

with our model, too, but under different conditions. If the dealer sector is short in Treasuries, and

habitat investors demand more direct holdings of Treasuries, consistent with the widespread flight-

to-safety during the financial crisis, then the Treasury-OIS and triparty-GCF rate spreads should

switch signs compared with March 2020, consistent with our empirical observations. Our model

therefore provides a unified account of the very different Treasury and repo market dislocations in

the 2007-09 financial crisis and COVID-19 crisis.

   In summary, the observed movements in Treasury yields and spreads in March 2020 can be

rationalized as a consequence of selling pressure that originated from large holders of Treasuries in-

teracted with intermediation frictions, including regulatory constraints such as the SLR. Evidently,

the current institutional environment in the Treasury market is such that it cannot absorb large

selling pressure without substantial price dislocations or intervention by the Federal Reserve as the

market maker of last resort. Indeed, the Fed announced that it would directly purchase Treasuries

“to support the smooth functioning of markets” on March 15 and 23, which alleviated market stress

(as seen in Figure 1). Consistent with our model particularly, the Fed also announced that it would



                                                  5
temporarily exempt Treasuries from the SLR on Arpil 1.3

       Our theory and evidence can explain why selling pressure had such a strong price impact, but

it does not answer the question of what motivated some large holders of U.S. Treasuries to sell in

March 2020.4 Nor does it answer the question of why dealers, levered investors financed by dealers,

and ultimately the Federal Reserve, had to absorb this additional supply, while other long-term

investors stayed away.

       The fact that the Federal Reserve was able to alleviate the dislocations by substantially tilting

the maturity structure of U.S. government liabilities away from the long-term securities it purchased

towards very short-term liabilities it created (reserves) invites comparisons with emerging-markets

crises where shortening of maturities by sovereign issuers is a typical response to investors’ con-

cerns about issuers’ ability to repay (Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013)). But since neither

inflation nor default risk concerns are apparent in derivatives prices in March 2020, there is little

to suggest that concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation are the underlying cause, although the

“safe” asset status of U.S. Treasuries should be disciplined by fundamental fiscal capacities (e.g.,

He, Krishnamurthy, and Milbradt (2019)).


Related literature. Two related works, Duffie (2020) and Schrimpf, Shin, and Sushko (2020),

also provide some evidence on how the Treasury market has been stressed by COVID-19 recently.

They mainly focus on raising policy proposals that can potentially make the Treasury market

robust to shocks. A number of empirical studies document the change of corporate bond price and

liquidity during the COVID-19 period, including D’Amico, Kurakula, and Lee (2020), Haddad,

Moreira, and Muir (2020), Kargar, Lester, Lindsay, Liu, Weill, and Zuniga (2020), Qiu and Nozawa

(2020), and O’Hara and Zhou (2020).

       An expanding literature studies safe assets’ supply, demand, and convenience premia, including

early studies by Bansal and Coleman (1996), Duffee (1996), and Longstaff (2004), and recent

studies by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012), Bansal, Coleman, and Lundblad (2011),

      The shock that initially triggered a large selling pressure of Treasury bonds during the COVID-19 crisis was
reportedly caused by a scramble for cash. For example, cash is pursued by corporations for payroll and operation, by
foreign central banks for potential fiscal stimuli, and so on. As the prices of Treasury bonds tanked, levered investors
like hedge funds who had been taking arbitrage positions (e.g., between the Treasury cash and futures markets)
conducted “fire-sales” and amplified the initial shock (Schrimpf, Shin, and Sushko (2020)).

Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig (2019), and He and Song (2019), among others.5

        We build our model based on Vayanos and Vila (2020) and Greenwood and Vayanos (2014),

who study the equilibrium Treasury pricing where a risk-averse intermediary sector absorbs exoge-

nous demand/supply shocks from the habitat agents. We introduce Poisson events which capture

temporary (and potentially large) supply shocks in their model, and more importantly the levered

hedge fund sector that borrows from the dealers via the repo market. The endogenous repo spread

(i.e., the difference between the GCF repo lending rates and the Triparty repo borrowing rates) and

its connection to the broad demand/supply in the Treasury market are the major contributions of

this paper. We further provide strong empirical support for these theoretical predictions.

        Our paper is also related to studies of the collateral market of safe assets, including Duffie

(1996), Duffie, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2002), Gorton and Metrick (2012), Krishnamurthy, Nagel,

and Orlov (2014), Bartolini, Hilton, Sundaresan, and Tonetti (2011), Hu, Pan, and Wang (2019),

Song and Zhu (2019), and Lenel, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2019).

        Our paper contributes to the literature of intermediary-based asset pricing à la He and Kr-

ishnamurthy (2013a), especially those that highlight constraints on dealers such as Klingler and

Sundaresan (2019), Jermann (2019), Fleckenstein and Longstaff (2020), Boyarchenko, Eisenbach,

Gupta, Shachar, and Tassel (2018), and He, Khorrami, and Song (2019). See He and Krishnamurthy

(2018) for a recent survey (and Gromb and Vayanos (2010) for a survey on limits-of-arbitrage).



2        Motivating Evidence and Institutional Background

To set the stage for our main analysis, we first provide further evidence on the Treasury market

disruption during the COVID-19 crisis, in addition to Figure 1. The evidence motivates us to ex-

amine the interaction of supply and demand balances with intermediation frictions as the potential

economic mechanism. Accordingly, we also introduce institutional background that is useful for

the development of our institutional trading model of the Treasury market.

    The theoretical literature has modeled several economic channels, such as on information sensitivity, complexity,
and coordination (Gorton and Pennacchi (1990), Caballero and Simsek (2013), He, Krishnamurthy, and Milbradt
(2019), and Farhi and Maggiori (2017)). See Gorton (2017) and Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2017) for two
broad surveys on safe assets.

2.1             Motivating Evidence

A simple explanation of the soaring 10-year Treasury yield would be that the expected fiscal burden

of the COVID-19 pandemic can trigger a shift in inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty.

The left panel of Figure 2 plots weekly time series of two market-based measures of inflation

expectation, the 10-year breakeven inflation rate that equals the difference between the 10-year

CMT nominal and TIPS yields and the 10-year inflation swap rate.6 Both of them fell throughout

the COVID-19 period, especially in March 2020. The right panel plots weekly series of measures

of the inflation uncertainty and the (risk-neutral) probability of a large increase in inflation (of

more than 3%), extracted from 5-year inflation caps and floors by the Federal Reserve Bank of

Minneapolis. We observe that the inflation uncertainty dropped significantly until mid-March, and

increased afterwards. The probability of a large increase in inflation has dropped and stayed low

throughout April, pointing to concerns about deflation rather than inflation.

Notes: The left panel plots weekly time series of the 10-year breakeven inflation rate (that equals the
difference between the 10-year CMT nominal and TIPS yields) and the 10-year inflation swap rate, both in
percentage. The right panel plots weekly series of the (risk-neutral) standard deviation and probability of
a more than 3% increase in inflation that are estimated using 5-year inflation caps and floors. The sample
period is from January 1, 2020 to April 13, 2020.


            We then examine investor flows in the Treasury market to understand the changes in supply

and demand balances, and their potential association with price movements. From the top left

    As in Figure 1, we consider three event dates, 1/30/2020 when the World Health Organization declared the
outbreak of coronavirus a global health emergency, 3/9/2020 when the S&P 500 index declined by 7%, triggering
the first market-wide circuit breaker trading halt, and 3/23/2020 when the Fed announced “its full range of tools”
to support the U.S. economy including unlimited purchases of Treasury securities.


                                                                           8
panel of Figure 3, we observe a net positive issuance of $150bn in March by the U.S. Treasury.

However, foreign investors, including foreign central banks and investors in tax havens, sold about

$300bn worth of long-term Treasuries (middle left panel), while mutual funds sold around $15bn

(bottom left panel). Much of this supply was temporarily accommodated by broker-dealers, partly

through somewhat higher direct holdings (top right panel), but much of it indirectly through a

massive expansion of $300bn in repo financing that primary dealers provided to levered investors

(middle right) before 3/9.7

      Yet, during the week from March 9 to 15 when the 10-year Treasury yield increased most

sharply (see Figure 1), primary dealers’ direct Treasury holdings remained almost flat, while their

reverse repo lending increased by another $120bn. The Fed offered $1.5 trillion repo funding to

primary dealers on March 12 (i.e., they would be able to access the funding at low repo rate),

but the taking was abysmally low. Hence, dealers seem to face certain balance sheet constraints.

Eventually, starting from March 15, the Federal Reserve came in and purchased $700 billion worth

of Treasury notes and bonds, and the expansion in dealer balance sheets reverted back. On balance,

primary dealers’ net cash Treasury positions and reverse repo amounts decreased in March. The

selling pressure and its eventual accommodation by the Federal Reserve were concentrated in long-

term Treasuries. There was little net selling by foreigners in T-bills and the Federal Reserve did

not expand their holdings of T-bills.

      In sum, examinations of asset price movements and investor flows during the crucial weeks in

March 2020 suggest that shifts of fundamental risks are unlikely to have caused the unusual price

movements in the Treasury market. Instead, the large shifts in the supply of Treasuries, primary

dealers’ balance sheet movements, and the nature of the Federal Reserve’s interventions point to an

economic interpretation based on institutional trading with frictions. To understand the relevant

frictions, we briefly introduce some institutional background.


2.2     Institutional Background

In this section, we first outline institutional features of the Treasury and repo markets, especially

the important role of dealers as intermediaries in both markets. We then discuss the key regulations
  7
    Moreover, primary dealers are net borrowers in the repo market. Hence, they take positive market-making
portfolios of Treasuries and fund them with repos. See Appendix B.2 for further details.

the Treasury markets and dealers.8


2.2.1      The Treasury and Repo Markets

The U.S. Treasury market is one of the largest fixed-income markets with an outstanding balance

held by the public of about $17 trillion as of March 2020. The major component is coupon-bearing

Treasuries, about $12.5 trillion, while T-bills comprise the second largest fraction, about $2.6

trillion.9 The secondary cash market of Treasuries maintains an average daily total trading volume

of about $575bn over the period of August 2017 to July 2018, of which coupon Treasuries and

T-bills account for the largest bulk, about 82% and 15%, respectively. About 70% of the trading

volume is concentrated in on-the-run securities, which are most recently auctioned of a given tenor,

while the rest is in off-the-run securities, which consist of all the previously issued securities.10

       Off-the-run securities account for the major fraction—over 95%—of outstanding Treasuries

(Clark, Cameron, and Mann (2016)) and were hit hardest by the COVID-19 market disruption,

though on-the-run securities were also notably affected (Fleming and Ruela (2020)). In contrast

to on-the-run securities that are mainly traded on electronic exchange-like platforms, investors

of off-the-run Treasuries mostly trade over-the-counter with broker-dealers as readily available

counterparties.

       Broker-dealers, especially the primary dealers that are trading counterparties of the Federal

Reserve Bank of New York in its implementation of monetary policy, are important participants in

both the primary and secondary markets of Treasuries. In particular, primary dealers are expected

to participate in all issuance auctions of Treasuries, and have traditionally been the predominant

purchasers at these auctions.11 Dealers are also key intermediaries of the Treasury cash market,

     We keep the details to a minimum, and refer to Fleming (1997), Fleming and Garbade (2004), Garbade, Keane,
Logan, Stokes, and Wolgemuth (2010), and Baklanova, Copeland, and McCaughrin (2015) for additional details on
Treasury and repo markets, Fleming and Rosenberg (2007) on dealers, and Duffie (2018) and Boyarchenko, Eisenbach,
Gupta, Shachar, and Tassel (2018) on post-crisis regulations.

     The rest are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), floating rate notes (FRNs), and Separate Trading
of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS). The outstanding balance is obtained from the SIFMA
(https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-fixed-income-issuance-and-outstanding/).

     The primary dealers’ share of purchases at issuance auctions has been declining over time, though; see Fleming
and Myers (2013) for further discussions. He, Kelly, and Manela (2017) document the role of primary dealers in
understanding the cross-sectional returns of asset prices outside the equity class.

accounting for about 75% of all transactions. In fact, all client transactions, which account for half

of the total $575 billion daily trading volume, go through dealers.12

    When intermediating Treasury trades of clients, dealers need to use their balance sheet to

hold inventories. For example, when investors with Treasuries receive a liquidity shock, they sell

holdings to dealers who take them on their balance sheet as inventories before finding ultimate

buyers. Carrying inventory entails risk for which dealers demand compensation, as in classical

modes of market-making (Ho and Stoll (1981) and Amihud and Mendelson (1980)). However,

given the safety of Treasury securities, the inventory risk is unlikely to be severe. The cost that

particularly interests us arises from balance sheet constraints associated with post-crisis regulations,

which we will review below.

    In addition to selling them outright in the Treasury cash market, investors often post Treasuries

as collateral to borrow cash on a short-term basis, particularly in the repo market. The U.S. repo

market is comprised of two segments, triparty repo and bilateral repo. A triparty repo involves a

third party known as a clearing bank who provides clearing and settlement services such as keeping

the repo on its books and ensuring the execution according to repo terms.13 Differently, in bilateral

repo, the clearing and settlement are managed by each counterparty’s custodian bank. Furthermore,

within the triparty repo market, a special General Collateral Financing Repo Service (GCF Repo)

allows securities dealers registered with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) as netting

members to trade repos among themselves. That is, the GCF repo is mainly an inter-dealer

market, while in the non-GCF triparty repo market (referred to as triparty repo hereafter), broad

cash lenders including money market mutual funds (MMFs), banks, and securities lenders lend cash

to dealers.

    As in the cash Treasury market, broker-dealers are also key intermediaries in the repo market,

transmitting funds from lenders to borrowers who cannot directly deal with each other for certain

reasons.14 In particular, large high-credit-profiles dealers borrow cash in the triparty market from
  12
     The so-called principal trading firms that specialize in electronic and automated intermediation only participate
in the inter-dealer segment.
  13
     In the U.S., tri-party repo services have been offered by Bank of New York Mellon and JP Mor-
gan Chase. The latter announced a plan to exist this business in 2019 (https://www.wsj.com/articles/
j-p-morgan-to-exit-part-of-its-government-securities-business-1469135462).
  14
     Dealers also obtain funding for their market-making inventories in the triparty repo market by posting Treasuries
as collateral assets. This is effectively similar to the strategy of levered investors like hedge funds who finance their
proprietary portfolios through repo funding. The hedge fund sector in our model includes this strategy of dealers
(see Section 3 for details).


                                                           12
cash lenders and lend to small low-credit-profiles dealers in the GCF market. Large dealers also

borrow cash in the triparty market and lend to levered investors especially hedge funds in bilateral

repo markets.15 Hence, both the GCF and bilateral repo markets are used by levered investors to

finance their cash Treasury positions, where the funds are transmitted by large dealers from the

triparty market.

       In addition to the intermediation activity on a cash basis, dealers also conduct intermediation in

the (mainly bilateral) repo market on a security basis, which is often used to source securities and

facilitate short-selling. For example, dealers can lend cash to providers of Treasury securities, and

use the received collateral assets (or provide them to hedge funds) to cover short sales or establish

hedging positions in the cash Treasury market.16 Typical providers of Treasury securities include

pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies who hold large portfolios of Treasuries and

seek to earn extra yield by lending them out. Although securities-driven repo often targets specific

Treasuries, denoted as special repo as in Duffie (1996), it is also used widely to source general

securities when Treasuries are in shortage as a whole. In either case, short-selling incurs costs of

searching for securities and failing to deliver, which can lead to large market disruptions (Duffie,

Garleanu, and Pedersen (2002), Fleming and Garbade (2004), and Garbade, Keane, Logan, Stokes,

and Wolgemuth (2010)). The implementation of the Fed’s TSLF program from March 2008 to June

2009 that lent Treasuries to dealers against non-Treasury collateral suggests that such costs can be

too high for market participants.


2.2.2      Post-Crisis Regulations

As discussed above, dealers’ intermediation activities in the Treasury market are unlikely to pose

severe risks to their balance sheets because of Treasuries’ great safety and liquidity. However, since

the 2007-09 financial crisis, various regulatory reforms of financial institutions and markets have

been proposed, some of which impose constraints on dealers’ balance sheet capacity (Duffie (2018)).

Among them, the most relevant for the Treasury market is the so-called supplemental leverage ratio
  15
     In recent years, repo transactions cleared through the FICC Delivery-versus-Payment (DVP) repo service have
increased, which facilitate cash flow from the triparty repo market to hedge funds. See https://www.jpmorgan.com/
global/research/sponsored-repo for details.
  16
     In this regard, securities lending contracts are economically equivalent to repo for borrowing and lending securities
(Baklanova, Copeland, and McCaughrin (2015)). Dealers who facilitate a hedge fund customer’s short positions, often
known as prime brokers, can rehypothecate collateral assets from other customers’ long positions in the repo market,
or borrow from securities lenders such as pension funds.


                                                           13
(SLR).

   To strengthen the resilience of the global banking system, the Basel III regulatory framework

introduced the SLR as a backstop to risk-based capital regulation. It is defined as the Tier I

capital divided by total leverage exposure irrespective of its riskiness, which is distinct from the

conventional risk-weighted-asset (RWA) capital requirement. The total leverage exposure includes

both on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance-sheet exposures to derivatives. The Basel Committee

proposed a 3% minimum leverage ratio, while U.S. regulators require global systemically important

institutions (G-SIBs) to maintain an SLR of at least 5% on a consolidated basis and at least 6%

for their depository subsidiaries. The rule of SLR was finalized in 2014 and was phased in from

2015 with G-SIBs and other large banking institutions required to make public disclosures related

to the SLR, and was largely implemented in 2018.

   The leverage exposure in the SLR includes the total notional of all cash and repo transactions,

regardless of which securities are used as collateral, hurting the bank dealers’ intermediation ac-

tivities in both cash and repo markets of Treasury securities greatly. As argued by Duffie (2018))

based on a variant of debt overhang proposed in Andersen, Duffie, and Song (2019), “the SLR in-

creases ‘rental cost’ for the space on a bank’s balance sheet.” The announcement of the temporary

exemption of Treasuries from the SLR on Arpil 1, 2020 by the Fed in response to the Treasury

market disruption suggests that this is indeed the case.

   Compared with the constraint on Treasury cash and repo positions, the constraint imposed by

the SLR on standard interest-rate derivatives is minor. Specifically, the off-balance-sheet exposures

to derivatives included in the SLR total leverage exposure are calculated based on the Current

Exposure Method and consisting of the Current Exposure and Potential Future Exposure (Polk

(2014)). For standard interest-rate derivatives like vanilla Libor swaps and OIS that have become

centrally cleared, the CE is effectively zero because the variation margin is posted on a daily

basis. The PFE is defined using a combination of net and gross risk exposures, equal to P F E =

0.4 × Agross + 0.6 × N GR × Agross , where Agross is the adjusted gross notional equal to gross

notional multiplied by a maximum of 1.5%, and N GR is the net-to-gross ratio equal to the net

current mark-to-market value and gross current mark-to-market value. That is, the constraint

imposed by SLR on interest-rate derivatives is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that on

the Treasury positions.

                                                 14
         In addition, we briefly discuss two other regulations—the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and

Volcker rule–that have been progressively put into effect since 2014. The LCR is to ensure that

potential cash outflows over a 30-day period are sufficiently covered by liquid assets.17 Specifically,

it assumes that dealers may lose all of their collateralized funding with terms of less than 30 days

and hence stipulates that they need to hold sufficient cash and high-quality liquid assets to cover

this loss of funding. The Volcker rule prohibits proprietary trading of banks (or financial institutions

with access to FDIC insurance or the Federal Reserve’s discount window) that are financed by low-

cost deposits of the affiliated bank branch. The Volcker Rule exempts hedging, market-making,

and various financial instruments such as foreign exchange and government securities. Yet, the

difficulty in drawing a clear-cut distinction between market-making and proprietary trading has

the potential unintended consequences of reducing bank dealers’ market-making activities. Both

the LCR and Volcker rule may lead to higher funding costs to dealers.



3         The Model

We now show within a model how supply shocks can interact with intermediation frictions to

give rise to the observed Treasury market disruptions. Moreover, the model provides additional

empirical predictions about spreads between different repo rates, swap rates, and Treasury yields

that we examine subsequently.

         The economy in this section is an extension to Greenwood and Vayanos (2014). In their model,

preferred habitat agents trade with arbitrageurs. We separate the arbitrageurs in Greenwood and

Vayanos (2014) into hedge funds and dealers, and introduce a repo market in which the former

group borrows from the latter. Throughout, we use lowercase letters to denote an individual agent’s

choices while uppercase letters denote aggregate quantities.


3.1        Aggregate Shocks and Assets

There are two sources of aggregate risk in this model, following Greenwood and Vayanos (2014).

The first is the stochastic evolution of short interest rate rt , which follows an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
    17
     A companion liquidity regulation is the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) designed to limit maturity transformation.
It requires sufficient stable funding, equity or long-term debt, to cover assets over a one-year horizon.

process


                                       drt = κ (r − rt ) dt + σdZt ,


where {Zt : 0 ≤ t < ∞} is a standard Brownian motion defined on a complete probability space, κ

is the mean-reverting parameter, and σ is the volatility of short-rate.

   The second aggregate shock is Treasury demand/supply shock β̃t , which follows a Markov chain

β̃t ∈ {0, β}. The jump intensity from β̃t = 0 (β̃t = β) to β̃t = β (β̃t = 0) is denoted by ξ0 (ξβ ). We

interpret β̃t = 0 (β̃t = β) as the normal (stress) state; and our model can capture both demand

and supply shocks depending on the sign of β.

   We consider zero-coupon Treasury bonds which mature at the tenor τ ∈ [0, T ]. Denote by Pt (τ )

their endogenous price to be solved in equilibrium.


3.2   Habitat Agents

Following Greenwood and Vayanos (2014) we consider an exogenous demand/supply shock from

habitat agents, so that their holdings of bonds with tenor τ is


                                           Ht (τ ) = −θ (τ ) β̃t ,                                   (1)


where θ (τ ) captures the exposure to the shock. Without loss of generality, let θ (τ ) ≥ 0. The case

of β > 0 corresponds to an exogenous supply shock to the economy, while the case of β < 0 it

represents a demand shock. These habitat agents represent insurance companies, pension funds,

and/or foreign central banks in practice.
             RT
   Let Θ ≡    0   θ (τ ) dτ . We first analyze the model without specifying the function θ (·). Depending

on applications, we later specialize the function θ (·) either to

so that the (negative) demand shock hits the long-end of the curve, or let θ (τ ) = 1 for all τ ∈ [0, T ]

so that the demand shock applies to the entire curve.


                                                     16
3.3     Hedge Funds and Repo

A unit measure of hedge funds in this economy can borrow from dealers in the repo market to

exploit the investment opportunity created by aggregate demand/supply shocks β.
                                                                             e When a hedge

fund borrows one dollar from a dealer by pledging one dollar of Treasury bonds as collateral, she

needs to pay an endogenous repo financing rate of Rt dt.

   Following Greenwood and Vayanos (2014) we assume that each hedge fund solves the following

instantaneous mean-variance objective at time t

                                                       h       i         1       h    i
                                       max Et dGht −                        V art dGht .               (3)
                                     qth (τ )≥0                         2ρh

where dGht is the hedge fund’s trading gain, and ρh > 0 is the hedge fund’s risk-bearing capacity

(or risk tolerance, the inverse of their absolute risk-aversion). Given the repo financing cost Rt

which will be determined in equilibrium, the dynamics of her wealth is given by
                                                                                                  
                            Z T                                                                
                                                                               dPt (τ )
                   dGht =                          qth (τ )
                                                                                                

                                                                               P (τ )   − Rt  dτ.
                                                                                             dt       (4)

                                  hedge-fund holdings, repo demand                     {z     }
                                                                                  trading profit


   For each τ ∈ [0, T ], the hedge fund sector’s repo demand, denoted by qth (τ ), in general depends

on the repo financing cost Rt ; the higher the Rt , the greater the demand. This price-dependence

of repo demand is one of our key contributions relative to Greenwood and Vayanos (2014).


3.4     The Dealer Sector

A unit measure of risk-averse dealers absorb the residual Treasury supply/demand shocks and

provide overnight repo funding to the hedge fund sector.


3.4.1    Dealer’s problem

Following Greenwood and Vayanos (2014) we assume that each dealer solves the following instan-

taneous mean-variance objective at time t:

                                                           h       i       1       h    i
                                       max             Et dwtd −              V art dwtd ,             (5)

where ρd > 0 is the dealer’s risk-bearing capacity, and the dynamics of his wealth, dwtd − wtd rt dt, is

given by

Here, xt (τ ) is the direct holdings of bond τ (in terms of dollars, which could be negative), and

qtd ≥ 0 is the dealer’s reverse repo position (i.e., repo funding provided to hedge funds).

    In Eq. (6), we have defined

                                                        ∆t ≡ Rt − rt ,                                                 (8)

which captures the wedge between the collateralized borrowing rate Rt in the repo market and

the instantaneous risk-free lending rate rt . We do not specify in more detail the funding markets

in which dealers borrow at rate rt . Empirically, we approximate rt with the repo rate from the

triparty market because funding flows in this market are mainly from cash lenders like money

market funds to large dealers. We proxy for Rt with the GCF repo rate because the funding flows

in the GCF are mainly from large dealers to smaller dealers. The wedge between GCF and Triparty

repo rates therefore captures the wedge between the rates at which large dealers lend and borrow

in collateralized funding markets and it corresponds to ∆t in our model. This GCF-Triparty repo

wedge is a riskless profit earned by the dealer sector in equilibrium. In the next section, we explain

the additional balance sheet cost Λt in the dealer’s budget equation (6) that allows this wedge to

exist.

    In the baseline model we rule out “naked” short-selling for our dealers, as required by (7). We

envision that repo is the only channel through which dealers borrow the bonds and then short-sell

them to habitat agents. As a result, xt (τ ), whenever it is negative, has to be bounded by the

dealer’s reverse repo position qtd ≥ 0; this gives rise to the constraint xt (τ ) + qtd (τ ) ≥ 0 in (7). In

practice, dealers can also resort to borrowing bonds in the costlier securities lending market, or even

engage in “naked” short sales by failing to deliver the short-sold bond (delivery failures were quite

common around the time of 2007-09 financial crisis). We relax the no-naked-short-selling condition


                                                             18
(7) later in Section 4.3 when we apply our model to the episode of 2007-09 financial crisis.


3.4.2     Balance sheet cost

Compared with Greenwood and Vayanos (2014), we study the repo market in which dealers provide

repo services qtd (τ ) in (6), in addition to their portfolio choice xt (τ ). What is more, dealers face

an additional balance sheet cost—denoted by Λt —in their portfolio choices in our model. Each

individual dealer takes the marginal cost Λt as given, so the total effect is linear in their own

positions xt (τ ) and qtd (τ ). The balance sheet cost Λt depends on the aggregate holdings only; one

can think of a frictionless inter-dealer market which equalizes these costs across dealers.

   Recall that for each tenor τ , the aggregate bond holdings in the dealer sector is Xt (τ ), and the

aggregate reverse repo Qdt (τ ). What is the balance sheet size for tenor τ ? There are two cases to

consider.

  1. If Xt (τ ) ≥ 0, then the accounting is straightforward. The balance sheet occupied by tenor-τ

        bonds, denoted by Bt (τ ), is simply


                                              Bt (τ ) = Xt (τ ) + Qdt (τ ) .

                       RT
        Denote Qdt ≡    0   Qdt (τ ) dτ . Integrating over τ ∈ [0, T ], we can calculate the balance sheet

        size of the entire dealer sector as

                                                     Z T
                                              Bt ≡         Xt (τ ) dτ + Qdt .                         (9)
                                                      0


        Note, all equilibrium aggregate variables, Xt (τ ), Qdt and Bt , will depend on the aggregate

        bond demand shock βet .

  2. When Xt (τ ) < 0 (i.e., when the dealer is short selling some tenor-τ bonds), then


                                                   Bt (τ ) = Qdt (τ ) .


        To see this, recall that we have ruled out naked short selling in Section (3.4). To sell short

        a bond, the dealer therefore must first borrow the bond via the repo market. The dealer’s


                                                          19
         short sale may be smaller than than his entire reverse repo position; in this case, the dealer’s

         liability side books both the short sale and his tri-party repo market borrowing.18

Combining these two cases, we can write the aggregate size of the dealer’s balance sheet as

                                              Z T
                                       Bt ≡         max (Xt (τ ) , 0) dτ + Qdt .
                                               0

As we will see, the particular supply shock during the COVID-19 crisis implies that Case 1 prevails

in equilibrium.

       We assume that the marginal balance sheet cost Λt ≡ Λ (Bt ) is linear in the balance sheet size

Bt :

                                              Λt = λBt , with λ > 0.

In words, the dealer is bearing a marginal cost from taking on an extra dollar of Treasuries (whether

directly held by the dealer or indirectly by financing hedge funds’ positions) onto the balance sheet,

and this cost is increasing in the aggregate balance sheet size Bt .

       As explained in the introduction, the balance sheet cost captures the Supplementary Leverage

Ratio (SLR) constraint combined with some cost of raising equity (with an upward sloping equity

supply curve, say as in He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013b)).


3.5      Equilibrium

Without loss of generality, we follow Greenwood and Vayanos (2014) by normalizing the aggregate

bond supply for each tenor τ ∈ [0, T ] to be zero. We focus on symmetric equilibrium in which

individual agents (hedge funds and dealers) are employing the same strategy as their own groups,

respectively. In aggregate, for tenor τ , the dealer sector has Xt (τ ) = xt (τ ) amount of direct (cash)

Treasury holdings and provides Qdt (τ ) = qtd (τ ) ≥ 0 amount of reverse repo.

       We define the equilibrium in the standard way:
  18
     As an example, suppose that a dealer engages in q d (τ ) = 3 repo lending, and at the same time holds a short
position x = −1 by having (short) sold in the Treasury market. This implies that the dealer first takes 3 dollars worth
of bonds that he receives through reverse repo; he then passes 2 dollars’ worth of bonds as collateral in the Tri-party
repo market (where the collateral would have rested without being available to anyone else for purchase), and sells the
remaining 1 dollar of bonds to the Treasury market. On the dealer’s balance sheet, the dealer’s obligation to return
the borrowed and short-sold Treasuries to the habitat agents is recorded as a liability of 1 as “Financial instruments
sold but not yet purchased.” Adding the 2 dollars of liability in the form of Tri-party repo, the balance sheet size of
this dealer is 3, which is his total repo position.


                                                           20
Definition 1. Given the demand by habitat agents Ht = −θ (τ ) β̃t in (1), a (symmetric) equilibrium
                                 n                       o                     n                                     o
is a collection of quantities      qth (τ ) , Qht (τ )       by hedge funds,   xt (τ ) , Xt (τ ) , qtd (τ ) , Qdt (τ )    by

dealers, and prices {Pt (τ ) , Λt , Φt (τ )}, so that

    1. Each hedge fund solves the problem in (3);

    2. Each dealer solves the problem in (5);

    3. Allocations are symmetric and consistent: qth (τ ) = Qht (τ ), xt (τ ) = Xt (τ ), and qtd (τ ) =

       Qdt (τ );

    4. Both Treasury and repo markets clear for τ ∈ [0, T ], i.e.,


                                            0 = Ht (τ ) + Qht (τ ) + Xt (τ ) ,                                           (10)

                                            0 = Qht (τ ) − Qdt (τ ) .



Since Qht (τ ) = Qdt (τ ) in equilibrium, we will use Q to denote them whenever without risk of

confusion. Figure 4 illustrates the model setting with X > 0. There is an aggregate bond (risk)

supply S to be borne by habitat agents (via direct holdings X and Q) and dealers (direct holdings

X). But as shown, dealers are serving as the counterparty for repo transactions Q, which occupy

their balance sheet—hence a balance sheet size of B = Q + X. We will come back to Figure 4 in

Section 4.1.5 to offer a full illustration of how this simple fact drives the interesting interactions

between the repo market and Treasury market in our model.



4     Model Solution and Implications

We first consider a special case of our model and illustrate its economic mechanism in detail. We

then show that this case is sufficiently rich to deliver interesting empirical patterns during the

Treasury market breakdown when the pandemic hit the U.S. in mid-March 2020.


4.1    Model Solution and Mechanism

As the main focus our paper is on the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, in this section we consider β > 0

which entails a positive supply shock of Treasuries to be absorbed by dealers and hedge funds.

                                                              21
    As in Greenwood and Vayanos (2014), the demand from habitat agents is price inelastic, and

hence exogenously determined by the aggregate demand shock as Ht (τ ) = −θ (τ ) β̃t < 0 given in

(1). Invoking the market clearing condition (10) we immediately know that in equilibrium


                           Qt (τ ) + Xt (τ ) = θ (τ ) β̃t ≥ 0 for all τ ∈ [0, T ] .                  (11)


This implies that the naked-short-selling constraint (7) never binds in equilibrium. We study the

alternative case in Section (4.3).


4.1.1    Equilibrium balance sheet size and repo wedge

We will show soon in equilibrium that


                                      Xt (τ ) ≥ 0 for all τ ∈ [0, T ] .                              (12)


As explained in Section (3.4.2), under (12) the dealer’s balance sheet size for bond τ is Bt (τ ) =

Qt (τ )+Xt (τ ). This is particularly convenient because then the market clearing 0 = Ht (τ )+Qt (τ )+

Xt (τ ) in (10) implies that the equilibrium balance sheet size is independent of the equilibrium repo

size Qt (τ ):

                                          Bt (τ ) = −Ht (τ ) ≥ 0.

To see this, imagine the hedge fund sector buys one dollar’s worth of bonds from the dealer, but

using leverage through repo. While this reduces the risk the dealer has to bear, it does not relax

the dealer’s balance sheet.
                                                                                        RT
    We now use (1) to calculate the equilibrium aggregate balance sheet (recall Θ =      0   θ (τ ) dτ )

                                              Z T
                                       Bt =         Bt (τ ) dτ = β̃t Θ.                              (13)
                                               0


Equation (11) and Qt (τ ) ≥ 0 imply that the dealer is taking an interior repo position in equilibrium.

Because the dealer’s objective is linear in the repo funding supply Qt (τ ), with a marginal benefit




                                                      22
of ∆t − Λt , in equilibrium it must be that


                                                ∆t = Λt = λBt > 0.


      This result has important implications for our problem. Per unit of Treasury bond, the dealer’s

holding cost is the balance sheet cost Λt while the hedge fund’s holding cost is the repo financing

wedge ∆t . In equilibrium they must be the same.


4.1.2      Optimal risk sharing within the intermediary sector

The same holding cost for both dealers and hedge funds imply that they are facing the same

problem. To see this, because the dealer’s problem is linear in the reverse repo q d , the profit from

repo provision must be zero.19 Plugging in ∆t = Λt one can show that the wealth dynamics of a

dealer and that of a hedge fund are identical.

      In our model, dealers and hedge funds only differ in their risk-bearing capacity ad and ah .

However, the standard asset pricing result implies that, in equilibrium, the optimal risk sharing

has dealers (hedge funds) directly hold

                                                              ρd
                                             Xt (τ ) = −           Ht (τ ) ,                          (14)
                                                           ρd + ρh

and the hedge fund sector to hold (Qht (τ ) = Qt (τ ))

                                                              ρh
                                             Qt (τ ) = −           Ht (τ ) .                          (15)
                                                           ρd + ρh

4.1.3      Euler equation and equilibrium asset pricing

We now study equilibrium bond pricing based on the standard Euler equation. The derivation in

this section is an extension of Greenwood and Vayanos (2014) but with Poisson jumps. What is

more, in our model the equilibrium pricing kernel—which is determined by {Xt {τ } : τ ∈ [0, T ]}—

is endogenous and pinned down by the dealer’s equilibrium holdings (14) under the optimal risk

sharing just shown.

      Recall that the no-naked-short-selling constraint (7) never binds in equilibrium due to (12).

where we have invoked the dealer’s equilibrium holdings xβt (τ ) = Xβt (τ ), which are given by (14).

   Note, one can also write the Euler equation from the entire intermediary sector’s perspective: it

absorbs the whole supply shock −Ht (τ ) but with an effective risk bearing capacity of ρI ≡ ρd + ρh .
                                                                      1−e−κτ
   Now plugging in (17), one can derive A (τ ) =                        κ       and an ordinary differential equation

(ODE) for Cβ (·). Repeating the same exercise for β̃t = 0 (i.e., before the economy is hit by the

demand shock), we obtain another ODE for C0 (·). Appendix A gives the details as well as the

numerical algorithm to solve for {C0 (·) , Cβ (·)}.

   Equation (18) is the standard Euler equation for the representative risk-averse dealer. The

left-hand side gives the bond τ ’s expected effective excess return, net the balance sheet cost. In

equilibrium it equals the risk premium that compensates the dealer for bearing the additional

Brownian interest rate risk σdZt and Poisson demand risk β̃, as shown on the right-hand side of

(18).

   Equation (18) also makes it clear that the entire dealer’s equilibrium portfolio {Xt {τ } : τ ∈ [0, T ]}

pins down the pricing kernel in this model that prices each bond with tenor τ . Similar to Green-

wood and Vayanos (2014), demand shocks affect the dealer’s equilibrium holdings and hence the

pricing kernel. Dealers who absorb an increase in the supply of long-term bonds bear more in-

terest rate risk in their portfolio, and hence in equilibrium require all bonds—both long-term and

short-term—to offer higher expected returns in excess of the short rate.


4.1.4    Shadow price for OIS curves

One of the key empirical objectives in our paper is to track changes in the (in-)convenience yield

of Treasuries during the COVID-19 crisis episode. For this reason, we seek a maturity-matched

benchmark for comparison that isolates the (in-)convenience yield. In our model, we can define as

benchmark a derivative asset with the exact same cash flows as physical Treasury bonds, but free


                                                                25
from balance sheet or inventory concerns and hence free from inconvenience yields. Empirically, we

proxy for the yield of this derivative asset with overnight index swap (OIS) rates. In practice, the

weight imposed by the SLR constraint on interest rate derivative contracts is about two orders of

magnitude smaller than the underlying bonds,20 and dealers can in principle write any derivative

contracts in case there is a demand, free from the physical “inventory” constraints.

One can solve for C0OIS (·) , CβOIS (·) following the same technique as in Section (4.1.3) (for details,

see Appendix A.3).

    The Treasury-OIS spread at τ roughly captures the Treasury’s extra holding cost Λt during

the remaining time-to-maturity τ , discounted by the equilibrium pricing kernel which takes into

account aggregate demand shock. Hence through the lens of our model, Treasury-OIS spreads

observed in the empirical data capture the Treasury (in)convenience yields.


4.1.5    Summary and model mechanism

The following proposition summarizes what we have shown.

Proposition 1. Consider the scenario of a potential supply shock, i.e., β > 0, from the habitat

agents. Recall the habitat agents random demand Ht (τ ) = −θ (τ ) β̃t . The equilibrium is character-
   20
      The Potential Future Exposure of derivative contracts equals the effective notional principal amount, times the
add-on factor. The add-on factor for interest rate derivatives is 0 for bonds with remaining maturity of one-year or
less; 0.5% over 1 to 5 years; and 1.5% over 5 years.

                                 Bt = β̃t Θ, and ∆t = Λt = λBt = λβ̃t Θ;



  2. The holdings of Treasury bonds by hedge funds via repo financing are

                                                            ρh

                                                         ρd + ρh

   Figure 4 illustrates the workings of our model; the mechanism applies to tenor-τ bonds as well

as the entire maturity spectrum. Say a supply shock hits habitat agents (β̃t jumps from 0 to β > 0).

As illustrated by Figure 4, the dealers’ balance sheet B = −H expands due to market clearing.

The greater the (negative) demand shock size β, the larger the dealers’ balance sheet size, and

hence the higher the balance sheet cost Λ (B) = λB. This effect is stronger for a larger balance

sheet cost parameter λ, which presumably reflects the scarcity of intermediary capital (He and

Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013b)) and/or debt overhang (Andersen, Duffie, and Song (2019)).

   Hedge funds step in to absorb the supply shock from habitat agents via collateralized repo

borrowing from dealers. Since reverse repo takes up space on the dealers’ balance sheet, in equilib-

rium the dealers pass the balance sheet cost Λ through to hedge funds via the repo wedge ∆ on a

one-to-one basis, adversely affecting the repo demand Q from the hedge fund sector. In equilibrium

both dealers and hedge funds achieve the optimal risk sharing.

   The dealers’ direct holding X pins down their pricing kernel and hence equilibrium bond prices

via their Euler equation (18). As noted in Figure 4, the balance sheet cost Λ, as the holding cost or

inconvenience yield per unit of Treasury bonds, also enters in the Euler equation (18). In contrast,

the OIS curve, which does not entail the balance sheet cost, is driven by the dealers’ pricing kernel

only.


4.2     Treasury Market Breakdown in the COVIC-19 Crisis in 2020

We show that a simple special case of our model, which features a supply shock to long-term

Treasuries, can explain the market turmoil experienced in March 2020. Consider θ (τ ) = 1{τ >τ̂ }

and β > 0, so that long-term Treasuries are being sold by habitat agents. We then have Θ =
RT
 0   θ (τ ) dτ = T − τ̂ in all the equilibrium objects in Proposition 1. In our illustrative numerical

example, we set τ̂ = 5.


4.2.1    Model implications: Treasury inconvenience yield

Figure 5 Panel A (left) plots the equilibrium yield curves at the normal state β̃ = 0 and the stressed

state β̃ = β > 0. We observe that the yield at the long-end rises when the hedge fund sector and



                                                   28
dealers are absorbing the aggregate supply shock from the habitat agents. As in Greenwood and

Vayanos (2014), the equilibrium yield at the short-end also rises because all Treasury bonds are

priced by the same marginal investors (hedge funds and dealers). Importantly, we observe that the

yield curve steepens in the stressed state, consistent with yield curve movements in March 2020

(see Figure 1).

   To express the new implication of our paper, Figure 5 Panel B (right) plots the equilibrium

repo GCF-Triparty wedge ∆ (left axis) and 10-year Treasury-OIS spread (right axis) in the stress

state β̃ = β, both as a function of the supply shock size β. The equilibrium repo wedge ∆ equals

the balance sheet cost Λt = λΘβ̃t , which is linear in the supply shock size β in the stress state.

This represents the extra holding cost of Treasury bonds on the dealer’s balance sheet (i.e., the

inconvenience yield of Treasuries). This inconvenience yield is state-dependent, and drives about a

5-bps wedge between the instantaneous Treasury yield and risk-free short rate rt in Panel A in the

stress state.

   In Panel B we see that our model generates a positive implied 10-year Treasury-OIS spread,

thanks to the balance sheet cost. The model implied 10-year Treasury-OIS spread is increasing in

the shock size β, just like the repo wedge ∆. These theoretical predictions will be confirmed in the

data, as shown in the next section.


4.2.2   Empirical evidence of Treasury inconvenience yield

Figure 6 plots daily series of the 10-year and 3-month Treasury-OIS spreads (in the left panel)

during the COVID-19 crisis. Consistent with the model prediction (Figure 5 Panel B), the 10-year

Treasury-OIS spread is indeed positive. Moreover, it decreased before 3/9/2020, consistent with

a standard flight-to-safety to long-term Treasuries, but shot up since then amid a selling pressure

by investors who scrambled for cash. On 3/15 right before the Fed announced direct purchases of

Treasuries, the 10-year Treasury-OIS spread jumped up by about 30bps, consistent with an increase

of Λt in our model. In contrast, the 3-month Treasury-OIS spread decreased on 3/15, consistent

with the supply shock being concentrated at the long end. The 10-year Treasury-OIS spread began

to decrease afterwards likely because the Fed’s direct purchases weakened the supply shock.

   The right panel of Figure 6 plots daily series of the GCF-Triparty repo spread during the

COVID-19 crisis. Also consistent with the model prediction (Figure 5 Panel B), the repo spread

COVID-19 crisis. Parameters: r̄ = 0.055, κ = 0.201, ρh = ρd = 1/57, σ = 0.017, ξ0 = 0.1, ξβ = 0.4, λ = 0.01,

is mostly positive. It spiked up as high as 60 basis points during the two-week period from 3/9 to

3/23, driven by the increase of the balance sheet cost Λt associated with the supply shock. Holders

of long-term Treasury securities found it hard to post them as collateral in the repo market to raise

cash.

          Together with the results in Section 2.1, we find that during the COVID-19 crisis, both the

long-term Treasury yield and repo spread increased considerably. Consistent with our model, these

increases are associated with the sale of long-term Treasuries. Primary dealers only take a limited

amount of them, and also provide limited repo funding for levered investors to take them until the

Fed steps in with direct purchases.


4.3              Excess Treasury Demand and 2007–09 Financial Crisis

While our focus in this paper is on the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, we now show that one can also

understand, through the lens of the same model, the movements of yields and yield spreads during

the 2007-09 financial crisis. This serves as a useful additional validation of the model.

          We have so far focused on the case with a supply shock from habitat agents, i.e., β > 0. But in

the 2007-09 financial crisis, the shock was a different one. In the early stages of the financial crisis,

Notes: This figure plots daily series of the 10-year and 3-month Treasury-OIS spreads (left panel) and of the

there was a positive demand shock for Treasuries. To accommodate such a demand shock, the

intermediary sector has to short-sell some bonds to meet that excess demand from habitat agents.

In this section we first introduce costly naked short-selling into our base model, and then apply this

model to understand the empirical patterns in the 2007-09 financial crisis. Since this is an episode

prior to the SLR regulation, the analysis in this section ignores the balance sheet cost (it is trivial

to add back the balance sheet cost).

       As there is no clear term structure pattern in 2007-09 financial crisis, for exposition purposes

we eliminate the tenor-dependence of demand shocks by setting θ (τ ) = 1 in this section; hence

Θ = T . We therefore drop τ whenever appropriate, especially for aggregate quantities and prices.


4.3.1        Excess Treasury Demand and Naked Short-Selling

When Treasury demand surges, β̃t = β < 0 implies that Ht > 0. In this case, the no-naked-short-

selling constraint in (7) must fail, simply because


                                                  Qt + Xt = −Ht < 0.                                                                (21)


       We introduce naked short-selling to accommodate this empirically relevant case. We assume

that naked short-selling is costly, which captures reputation loss or regulatory penalty when the



                                                                31
dealer fails to deliver. We could equivalently introduce a securities lending market in which dealers

engage in a search for Treasury bonds to borrow from some habitat agents, and then sell to other

habitat agents who demand these bonds, as long as these security lending activities entail some

cost (for instance, it is difficult to locate the securities).

       For each tenor τ , denote by ndt (τ ) ≥ 0 the amount of naked short-selling that the dealer is

The dealer is facing the exact same problem as before in (6), except one difference: now he can

short-sell nt (τ ) dollars of bonds to relax his short-selling constraint (23) at a cost of ndt (τ ) Γt .21

short-selling as dealers. More specifically, if the hedge fund short-sells nht (τ ) amount of bonds,

Here, if the hedge fund is holding a short position qth (τ ) < 0, then it earns a short risk-less rate rt

on the sales proceeds.

       Suppose that in equilibrium the hedge fund sector is offering Nth (τ ) amount of naked short-

selling. To close the model, we assume that the naked short-selling cost Γt is increasing in the
  21
    For instance, xt (τ ) = −1.5, qtd (τ ) = 1, and ndt (τ ) = 0.5 imply that the dealer short-sells 1 unit of Treasury via
repo, and short-sells another 0.5 through either naked positions or security lending.




                                                                 32
equilibrium aggregate naked short selling Nt ≡ Nth + Ntd . For simplicity we assume that


                                 Γt ≡ Γ (Nt ) = γNt for some γ > 0.


4.3.2   Equilibrium repo wedge and bond pricing

Naked short-selling allows us to connect its cost Γt to the repo wedge ∆t in equilibrium. Some

positive naked short-selling Nt > 0 must occur in equilibrium given a positive excess Treasury

demand −Ht < 0 (recall Eq. (21)). Then, a strictly positive cost of naked short-selling Γt = λNt > 0

implies that (23) holds with equality, with


                                    Nt = −Qt − Xt = −β̃t > 0.


   In fact, because both hedge funds and dealers are endowed with the same naked-short-selling

constraint, in equilibrium they will absorb the habitat agents’ demand shock in proportion to their

risk-bearing capacity as in Section (4.1.2):

                                                  ρh
                                    Xt = −Ntd =         β̃t < 0
                                                ρh + ρd
                                                   ρd
                                    Qt = −Nth =         β̃t < 0.
                                                ρh + ρd

In this case, in equilibrium both hedge funds and dealers are in a short position, and hence the

equilibrium repo volume is zero (note, in our model repo can only be used to finance long positions).

   However, the shadow price of repo financing is linked to the cost of naked short-selling. To see

this, each dealer in equilibrium is solving the following problem


                                       max             −ndt · Γt + qtd · ∆t ,
                                  qtS ≥0,ndt =Ntd ≥0


with a linear constraint (23). Because dealers are free to obtain one unit of security via repo (and

then sell it short), in equilibrium they will offer an attractive repo wedge to just offset the naked




                                                        33
short-selling cost:22

                                              ∆t = −Γt = −γNt = γT β̃t < 0.                                                            (24)

          The negative repo wedge can be viewed as a natural consequence of a Treasury bond shortage

given a demand shock. In our model, the Triparty repo rate is fixed by the short-term risk-free

rate rt . But dealers are desperate to borrow and short-sell Treasury bonds to satisfy the habitat

agents’ surging demand. Intuitively, dealers are bidding down the GCF repo rate aggressively and

willing to eat the loss of GCF-Triparty repo wedge (∆t ), as long as in equilibrium this loss can be

covered from the saved cost of cutting an extra dollar of naked short-selling (Γt ). This mechanism

is similar to Treasury being “special” in Duffie (1996).

          Given this, one can solve for equilibrium bond pricing as in Section 4.1.5, recognizing that now

the holding cost of an additional Treasury bond is negative with ∆t = γT β̃t < 0—i.e., a convenience

yield.

The model captures a demand shock for Treasury bonds from habitat agents so that β < 0, just like in the
2007–09 financial crisis. Parameters: r̄ = 0.055, κ = 0.201, ρh = ρd = 1/57, σ = 0.017, ξ0 = 0.1, ξβ = 0.4, γ =

     We have assumed away tenor-dependent demand shocks in this section, by setting θ (τ ) = 1 for all τ ∈ [0, T ]. For
general θ (τ ), in equilibrium Nt (τ ) = Ht (τ ) as well as the cost of naked short-selling γNt (τ ) will be τ -dependent.
This would be inconsistent with our General Collateral (GC) repo market setting, in which the repo wedge ∆t is
uniform across all tenor τ . The special repo market studied in Duffie (1996) precisely captures this tenor-τ dependent
demand, and would be an interesting direction for future research.

4.3.3     Treasury convenience yield in 2007–09 financial crisis: Theory and evidence

As before Figure 7 Panel A (left) plots the equilibrium yield curves at the normal state β̃ = 0 and

the stressed state β̃ = β < 0 (demand shock). Overall the yield curve is downward sloping. This is

because the dealers (hedge funds) are in a short position in equilibrium; long-term bonds provide

a hedge benefit for the marginal investor, hence demand a lower premium.

   In contrast to the supply shock we studied in Section 4.2, the demand shock β̃ = β < 0 pushes

down the entire yield curve. Figure 7 Panel B then plots the equilibrium GCF-Triparty repo wedge

∆ (left axis) and 10-year Treasury-OIS spread (right axis) after the demand shock, both as a

function of the shock size β < 0. The equilibrium repo wedge ∆, which is now negative, equals the

naked short-selling cost Γt = λT β̃t < 0. This implies that Treasuries enjoy a convenience yield—a

holding benefit—which is widely documented in the safe asset literature. This explains a negative

implied 10-year Treasury-OIS spread, that is increasing in the shock size β, as plotted in the same

figure.

   Turning to empirical analysis, Figure 8 plots weekly series of the holdings of Treasuries by

foreign investors, Fed, and primary dealers, as well as the repo amounts of primary dealers, from

January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008. The three event dates considered are 7/31/2007 when

Bear Stearns filled for bankruptcy, 9/15/2008 when Lehman Brothers filled for bankruptcy, and

11/25/2008 when the Fed announced the direct purchases of agency MBS. We observe a flight-

to-safety to long-term Treasuries in the 2007–09 crisis, in sharp contrast to their selling pressure

during the COVID-19 crisis (see Figure 3). In particular, the top left panel shows a large increase

in foreign investors’ holdings of long-term Treasuries by about $350bn since July 31, 2007, while

the top right panel shows a decrease in the Fed’s holdings. In stark contrast to March 2020, the Fed

reduced its holdings of Treasuries to help accommodate the safety demand. Primary dealers were

net short in Treasuries, especially coupon Treasuries, and were on the net lending side in the repo

market. That is, they maintained short positions in their market-making portfolios of Treasuries

and often borrowed Treasuries in the repo market. Their net short cash positions and net repo

lending amounts trended lower towards the end of 2008, suggesting an easing of the shortage of

Treasuries.

   The excess demand of Treasuries as evidenced in Figure 8 would imply an effectively positive

shorting cost Γt , which affects the repo spread and Treasury-OIS spread negatively in our model

(as shown in Figure 7 Panel B). The top panel of Figure 9 plots monthly series of the GCF-Triparty

repo spread from January 2007 to December 2008. Indeed, the repo spread is mostly negative, and

reached as low as −80 basis points in December 2007. From the middle panel, the 10-year Treasury-

OIS spread also stays below zero mostly. That is, amid a flight-to-safety to long-term Treasuries

(with decreasing 10-year Treasury yield throughout the period as in the bottom panel), the large

shorting cost pushed the repo spread and Treasury-OIS spread to negative levels, consistent with

our model. Both moved up notably after the Fed’s TSLF program introduced in March 2008,

which likely eased the shortage of Treasuries and decreased the shorting cost Γt . In addition, we

also observe that the 3-month Treasury-OIS spread stays slightly more negative, showing that the

excess demand for T-bills is even stronger.



5     Regression Analysis of Dealer Constraints and Costs

The empirical evidence we have presented so far, in Sections 2.1, 4.2, and 4.3, following an event-

study approach like Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), reveals that (a) the shock to

the demand of long-term Treasuries is negative in the COVID-19 crisis and positive in the 2007-09

financial crisis, (b) dealers incur a balance sheet cost in holding long-term Treasuries and interme-

diating repos in the COVID-19 crisis, and (c) dealers incur a cost in short-selling Treasuries in the

2007–09 crisis. In this section, we conduct formal regression analysis using the full sample from

2006 to 2020 and provide further supporting evidence to our model.


5.1   Dealer Constraints and Costs across Sub-periods

Guided by the model, we first break up the full sample period according to variations of dealers’

balance sheet cost and shorting cost (Λt and Γt in the model, respectively). As shown in Section

4, the former positively affects the repo spread and Treasury-OIS spread, while the latter affects

them negatively when there is excess demand for Treasuries.

    The post-crisis implementation of SLR that drives dealers’ balance sheet cost phased in from

2015 onward (see Section 2.2.2). Hence, we define pre-SLR and post-SLR as before and after

July 2015, respectively, and expect Λt to be effectively positive post-SLR but negligible pre-SLR.23

Moreover, according to the NBER Business Cycle classifications, the Great Recession (GR) ended

in June 2009, so we define pre-GR and post-GR as before and after June 2009, respectively. Given

that primary dealers entered the GR with large net short positions of Treasuries, we expect Γt to be

effectively positive. However, the shorting cost likely decreased significantly in the period of March

2008–June 2009 during which the Fed increased the supply of Treasuries by allowing dealers to

obtain Treasuries against non-Treasury collateral in the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF).

We hence define pre-TSLF and post-TSLF as before and after March 2008, respectively.

        In sum, our sample period consists of four segments roughly together the respective interpreta-

tion of our model: (1) pre-TSLF, when Γt is positive and Λt is zero, (2) post-TSLF and pre-GR,

when Γt is reduced substantially but still positive and Λt is zero, (3) post-GR and pre-SLR when

both Γt and Λt are zero, and (4) post-SLR when Γt is zero and Λt is positive.

Notes: This figure plots the average GCF-triparty repo spread (left panel) and Treasury-OIS spread (right
panel) in percent of four sub-periods. The “Post-TSLF” period is constrained to pre-GR, while the “Post-
GR” period is constrained to pre-SLR, successively. For each average spread, we report the 99% confidence
intervals based on standard errors clustered at calendar quarters.


        The left panel of Figure 10 reports the average GCF-Triparty repo spread over these four sub-

periods. Consistent with our characterizations of these sub-periods based on the costs Γt and Λt ,
  23
    Though not in effect officially until 2018, banks could have had reputation concerns due to the disclosures and
also begin to prepare for the final adoption long before, which would make the SLR exert influence much earlier.

the GCF-triparty repo spread is indeed negative pre-TSLF because of the positive shorting cost,

about −23 bps, which was greatly reduced to only −3 bps with the Fed’s TSLF program that eased

the shortage of Treasuries. The average GCF-triparty repo spread turns positive post-GR, reaching

only about 5 bps before the SLR formally phased in but about 11 bps afterwards when Γt turns

positive. Column (1) of Table 1 reports regressions of the repo spread on the sub-period dummies

to formally test the significance of its change:


             GCF − T ripartyt =α + β1 DP ost-T SLF + β2 DP ost-GR + β3 DP ost-SLR + εt ,          (25)


where the full sample is used (note that the repo spread is monthly from October 2006 to July 2012

and daily from August 1, 2012 to March 31, 2020, as detailed in Appendix B.1). The significant

coefficients match the changes of the GCF-triparty spread across the sub-periods and confirm the

significance of these changes.

   Regarding the balance sheet cost Γt , the effect of the SLR rule is likely to come in over an

extended period of time during which dealers gradually adjust their policies rather than as an

immediate effect, so the post-SLR dummy in column (1) of Table 1 captures its average effect

accordingly. However, the change over an extend period of time may be confounded by other

factors. We explore a variation based on quarter-end shocks to mitigate this concern and further

quantify the potential effect of SLR on repo spread. In particular, foreign bank dealers’ repo

intermediation activities contract at quarter ends when snapshots of their balance sheet are used

to calculate leverage ratio (Duffie (2018)). In consequence, post-SLR when Λt becomes positive,

U.S. dealers receive higher demand for repo intermediation, resulting effectively in a higher λ on

quarter ends than other days within the same quarter. This difference on quarter ends versus other

days should be weak pre-SLR.

   Columns (2) and (3) of Table 1 report regressions of the repo spread on quarter-end dummies

(DQuarterEnd ), for both post-SLR and pre-SLR respectively. We control for quarter fixed effects

so that the coefficient DQuarterEnd captures the difference of the repo spread between the quarter-

end and other days within the same quarter. Indeed, the repo spread is about 23 bps higher on

quarter-ends post-SLR, but negative and insignificant pre-SLR. Column (4) reports regressions on

the interaction term of DQuarterEnd and DP ost-SLR , where the difference in quarter-end effects before

and after the SLR phases in is confirmed to be significant. In addition, the pre-SLR period examined

in column (3) includes the pre-TSLF period when primary dealers hold large short positions of

Treasuries and Γt is positive. In columns (5) and (6), we regress repo spread on quarter end dummies

using the post-TSLF sample. The coefficient on DQuarterEnd is positive but insignificant, likely

reflecting some effects of SLR before 2015. The coefficient on the interaction term of DQuarterEnd

and DP ost-SLR is positive and significant, confirming the difference in quarter-end effects before

and after the SLR phases in.

Treasury-OIS spread over the four sub-periods. Again, consistent with our characterizations of

these sub-periods based on the shorting and balance sheet costs, the average Treasury-OIS spread

Notes: The first column reports regressions of the 10-year Treasury-OIS spread on dummy variables for
sub-periods over the full sample period of October 2006 to March 2020. The next three columns report
regressions of the GCF-Triparty repo spread on the 10-year Treasury-OIS spread for the sample of pre-GR,
of post-GR and pre-SLR, and of post-SLR, respectively. The t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at
calendar quarters are reported in parentheses. The significance levels are represented by *p<0.1, **p<0.05,
***p<0.01.


also turns positive post-GR, reaching about 16 bps before the SLR formally phased in but about

36 bps afterwards. The first column of Table 2 reports a regression similar to (25) of the 10-year

Treasury-OIS spread on dummies for sub-periods. The significant coefficients match the changes

of the Treasury-OIS spread across the sub-periods and confirm the significance of these changes.

   The last three columns of Table 2 report contemporaneous time-series regressions of the repo

spread on the 10-year Treasury–OIS spread for the three sub-periods featuring different combina-

tions of Γt and Λt . As shown in Figure 5 and 7, our model implies a positive relation between

them for the cases of both positive (positive Λt ) and negative supply shocks (positive Γt ). Indeed,

the regression coefficient is positive and significant for both the pre-TSLF and post-SLR periods.

For the sample period after the TSLF program was implemented but before the SLR phased in,

the regression coefficient is insignificant, as both Γt and Λt are negligible and there should be no

detectable association between the repo spread and Treasury-OIS spread.

6    Conclusion

In sharp contrast to most previous crisis episodes, the Treasury market experienced severe stress

and illiquidity in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising concerns that the safe-haven

status of U.S. Treasuries could be eroding. We document that some large owners of Treasuries

substantially reduced their holdings during March 2020 and the intermediary sector struggled to

absorb this demand shock.

    To understand the inelastic response of the intermediary sector, we build a model in which

balance sheet constraints of dealers and demand shocks from habitat agents interact with each

other, affecting the term structure of Treasury yields. A novel element of our model is to introduce

repo financing as an important part of dealers’ intermediation activities, through which levered

investors obtain leverage. Both direct holdings of Treasuries and reverse repo positions of dealers

are subject to a balance sheet constraint related to regulation reforms since the 2007–09 crisis such

as the supplementary leverage ratio. Consistent with model implications, the spread between the

Treasury yield and overnight-index swap rate (OIS) and the spread between dealers’ reverse repo

and repo rates are both highly positive in the COVID-19 crisis, and both greatly negative in the

2007–09 crisis. Over the whole sample of 2006–2020, the Treasury-OIS spread and repo spread

increased after 2015 when the regulatory reforms phased, and their correlation is significantly

positive.

A         Euler Equations for Treasury Pricing

We derive the ODE system for {C0 (·) , Cβ (·)} based on the dealer’s Euler equation first. We then

offer a detailed numerical procedure to solve the ODE system, and then give the results on the

equilibrium OIS curves.

          Taking derivative with respect to τ on both sides of the first equation in (32), and

          plugging in eC0 (τ )−Cβ (τ ) , we get

B     Data and Additional Evidence

    In this appendix, we first provide details of the data and variables used in empirical analysis.

We then present two sets of additional empirical evidence, one highlighting the flight-to-cash nature

of the COVID-19 shock and the other breaking down primary dealers’ repo positions into different

tenor buckets.

B.1    Data

We obtain daily series of constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) yields from the H.15 reports of the

Federal Reserve, which are equal to the coupon rates on par bonds. We obtain daily series of

overnight index swap (OIS) rates from Bloomberg. The OIS is a fully collateralized interest rate

swap contract that exchanges a constant cash flow against a flow of floating payment indexed to

the geometric average of the daily effective federal funds rate. OIS contracts with maturities of up

to one year have only one final payment, while cash payments for those with maturities of over

one year are made quarterly. Hence, OIS rates are effectively zero-coupon yields for maturities of

up to one year and par yields for maturities of over one year, both comparable to the CMT yields.

We then take the difference between the CMT yield and the maturity-matched OIS rate as the

Treasury-OIS spread.

    We use overnight repo rates of Treasury securities of both the tri-party market and the GCF

market. Daily series of GCF repo rates are provided by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corpo-


                                                                   55
ration (DTCC), available starting from 2005, calculated as the average interest rate across repo

transactions weighted by volume within a day.24 The tri-party repo rates are from multiple sources.

First, we obtain daily series of the Tri-party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) computed by the

Federal Reserve Bank of New York, available from August 22, 2014. The TGCR is calculated as

the volume-weighted median of transaction-level tri-party repo data, excluding GCF Repo trans-

actions and transactions to which the Federal Reserve is a counterparty.25 Second, we obtain daily

series of tri-party repo rates from August 1, 2012 to August 21, 2014 calculated by the Bank of

New York Mellon, the largest of the two clearing banks. These repo rates are also calculated as

volume-weighted medians on each business day for new, overnight repo trades with U.S. Treasuries

(excluding Strips) as collateral assets.26 Third, for November 2010–July 2012, we obtain monthly

series of tri-party repo rates using the overnight tri-party repo trades between MMFs and dealers

reported in the N-MFP fillings with the SEC, similar to Hu, Pan, and Wang (2019). Specifically,

we calculate the volume-weighted medians of all overnight tri-party repo trades on the last business

day of each month. Fourth, for October 2006 – April 2010, we use the month-end value-weighted

average overnight repo rates (weighted by notional amounts) constructed in Krishnamurthy, Nagel,

and Orlov (2014) based on quarterly N-CSR, N-CSRS, and N-Q fillings with SEC. MMFs file these

reports at different month-ends throughout each quarter, so monthly series of repo rates can be

calculated.

       The weekly series of primary dealers’ net positions and financing amounts of Treasury securities

are obtained from the FR2004 data collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The data

are reported on a weekly basis, as of the close of business each Wednesday.27 The reported series

are netted and aggregated across all primary dealers, available for four categories, including T-bills,

coupon-bearing nominal securities (coupons), Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), and

Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) that began to be issued in January 2014 and reported from 2015. The
  24
      The series can be downloaded at http://www.dtcc.com/charts/dtcc-gcf-repo-index#download.
  25
      The TGCR is one of the three overnight repo rates provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as
important reference rates to financial markets, together with the Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR) and the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The calculation of BGCR includes all trades used in the calculation
of TGCR plus the GCF Repo transactions. The calculation of SOFR includes all trades used in the calculation
of BGCR plus the bilateral Treasury repo transactions cleared through the Delivery-versus-Payment (DVP) service
offered by the FICC but filtered to remove a portion of transactions considered “specials.” For further details, see
https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-repo-reference-rates-information.

net positions include both spot cash positions and Treasury derivatives like futures (Fleming and

Rosenberg (2007)).

      Regarding financing amounts, the FR2004 data separate repo from other financing activities like

security lending contracts from April 3, 2013, but repo and securities lending contracts are blended

together earlier. Hence, we use the amounts of repo and reverse repo from April 3, 2013 onward,

but total financing amounts of cash in and cash out before, which will be referred to as repo and

reverse repo for convenience. Note that the financing contracts are defined from the perspective

of dealers, so dealers borrow cash through repo and lend cash out through reverse repo. For both

repo and reverse repo, the amounts are available for overnight and term contracts separately. We

mainly focus on the total amount by adding the overnight and term financing amounts together,

but will briefly discuss the breakdown in the next section.

      The daily VIX series are obtained from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). We

obtain daily series of constant-maturity yields of TIPS also from the H.15 reports of the Federal

Reserve. We compute the breakeven inflation rate as the difference between the CMT nominal

yield and TIPS yield of the same maturity, which is a market-based measure of expected inflation.

We also obtain daily series of inflation swap rates from Bloomberg as an alternative measure of

expected inflation. To measure the uncertainty and tail event probability of inflation, we obtain

weekly series of the standard deviation and the probability of a large increase in inflation (of more

than 3%) based on inflation density estimates using 5-year inflation caps and floors.28

      We obtain the amounts of Treasury holdings and issuance from various sources. First, the

monthly series of net issuance amount (gross minus retirement) of Treasury notes and bonds are

obtained from the SIFMA.29 Second, series of net new cash flows into long-term government bond

mutual funds are obtained from the Investment Company Institute (ICI), available at the monthly

frequency through March 2020 and at the weekly frequency afterwards.30 Third, monthly series of

foreign net purchases of U.S. long-term Treasury securities are obtained from the Treasury Inter-

national Capital (TIC) system.31 We group them into four categories: Europe, Asia, Caribbean

(including a lot popular tax haven countries), and Other (including all other countries and inter-

national organizations). The nonmarketable Treasuries are excluded. Fourth, weekly series of the

total face value of U.S. Treasury securities held by the Federal Reserve are provided in their H.4.1

release.32 We group these series into T-bills, nominal coupons, and TIPS.

       We obtain weekly series of total net assets (TNA) of prime, government, and tax-exempt money

market funds from the ICI. We obtain weekly seasonally adjusted series of the commercial and

industrial loans (C&I), cash assets, treasury and agency securities, fed funds sold and cash lent out

through reverse repo,33 and deposits, of all commercial banks, provided in the H.8 release of the

Federal Reserve.34


B.2       Additional Empirical Evidence

We provide two sets of additional empirical evidence. First, Figure B1 presents series of fund

flows of MMFs and banks. The top panels show that there are negative net flows out of prime

MMFs and positive net flows into government MMFs, while the middle panels show that bank

deposits increased significantly, in both the COVID-19 and 2007–09 crises. The bottom panels

show that banks allocate the incoming deposits into cash assets significantly and into long-term

Treasuries and agency securities slightly. All these features are characteristic of flight-to-safety and

flight-to-liquidity.

       Second, Figure B2 provides a breakdown of primary dealers’ repo and reverse repo amounts into

overnight and term contracts. The net reverse repo amounts show that primary dealers conduct

maturity transformation in their Treasury repo intermediation, borrowing overnight and lending

term funds in both the COVID-19 and 2007-09 crises. Yet, the net borrowing amount through

overnight repo is much larger in 2020 than in 2007–09, while the net lending amount through term

reverse repo is similar in these two time periods. That is, primary dealers become more of a net

cash borrower in the repo market post-crisis.
