                                             ABSTRACT

A sketch of the International Monetary Fund’s 70-year history reveals an institution that has reinvented
itself over time along multiple dimensions. This history is primarily consistent with a “demand driven”
theory of institutional change, as the needs of its clients and the type of crisis changed substantially
over time. Some deceptively “new” IMF activities are not entirely new. Before emerging market economies
dominated IMF programs, advanced economies were its earliest (and largest) clients through the 1970s.
While currency problems were the dominant trigger of IMF involvement in the earlier decades, banking
crises and sovereign defaults became they key focus since the 1980s. Around this time, the IMF shifted
from providing relatively brief (and comparatively modest) balance-of-payments support in the era
of fixed exchange rates to coping with more chronic debt sustainability problems that emerged with
force in the developing nations and now migrated to advanced ones. As a consequence, the IMF has
engaged in “serial lending”, with programs often spanning decades. Moreover, the institution faces
a growing risk of lending into insolvency, most widespread among low income countries in chronic
arrears to the official sector, but most evident in the case of Greece since 2010. We conclude that these
practices impair the IMF’s role as an international lender of last resort.

         As recently as 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seemed to be winding down its

business. After the Argentine and Uruguayan crises of 2001-2003, the world had been comparatively

free of financial crises. IMF lending, whether expressed as a share of world GDP or imports, fell to its

lowest levels since the early 1970s, as shown in Figure 1. Dollar amounts declined more markedly than

the number of programs, as lending to the larger emerging markets and middle income countries mostly

came to an end. Low income countries (involving smaller dollar amounts) became increasingly

overrepresented among the remaining programs.


         A view emerged that perhaps an institution whose primary roles were economic surveillance

and crisis management had outlived its usefulness. Possibly, this interpretation of events motivated the

IMF to downsize (Gourinchas and Obstfeld 2012). Treating this temporary calm as the “new normal,”

the IMF shrank the size of its staff, which had expanded considerably in previous decades in response to

a sharp increase in its membership (as reported, for example, in the Economist 2008).


         However, the emergence in 2007-2009 of the deepest and most synchronous financial crisis in

the world’s largest economies since the 1930s put an end to the notion that the IMF was redundant. As

Kindelberger (1978) had wisely observed decades earlier, “Financial crises are a hardy perennial.” By

practically any metric, the post-2008 IMF programs to several European economies are the largest in the

IMF’s 70-year history. As Figure 1 shows, the new programs to the wealthier borrowers brought total

IMF commitments in 2010 (as a share of imports) close to its historical peak in the early 2000s, while as

a share of world GDP, IMF commitments hit an all-time peak.


         The IMF has reinvented itself on several occasions and in different dimensions since its creation

approximately 70 years ago. 1 Under the Bretton Woods system, the IMF oversaw a network of mutually

pegged exchange rates. A key challenge of that system was to get the parity “right.” Otherwise, an

and international reserve losses.

        Because exchange rate misalignments and corresponding balance-of-payments problems were a

frequent and recurrent preoccupation among the IMF membership, the so-called Stand-By

Arrangements of the earlier era involved short-term lending to deal with temporary (illiquidity)

problems. This mandate is laid out in section I (v) of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, which reads:

“To give confidence to members by making the general resources of the Fund temporarily available to

them under adequate safeguards, thus providing them with opportunity to correct maladjustments in

their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international

prosperity.” From this perspective, the IMF was not intended to function as a development agency

engaged in long-term lending (this was a role assigned of the World Bank and various regional

development agencies). Nor was it an institution to lend into situations of sovereign insolvency. Its

intended mandate was to act as the international lender of last resort.



                                                         2
        During the 1950s and 1960s, IMF lending had, indeed, been mostly short-term loans to the

governments of advanced economies in connection with comparatively moderate exchange-rate

adjustments. But the global Bretton Woods system of pegged exchange rates came apart by the early

1970s and some of the world’s major economies adopted floating exchange rates. 2 The role of the IMF

began to evolve. At this time, the membership of the IMF also expanded significantly to include a

growing number of low-income and middle-income countries. Starting in the late 1970s, the IMF

programs increasingly involved lending to countries with a wider range of crises (apart from those

related to foreign exchange), including banking, and sovereign debt crises. IMF lending in these gained

ground with the Latin American crisis of the 1980s and the over-borrowing of many transition

economies (formerly connected to the Soviet Union) in the 1990s. As banking and debt crises tend to be

much more protracted problems compared to the currency crises of the earlier decades, the average

duration of IMF involvements increased markedly. Chronic and recurrent IMF clients multiplied and

program duration has sometimes spanned more than 20 years. 3 Thus, IMF programs came to have less

to do with the original mission of providing temporary liquidity support, and began to resemble long-

term development assistance, especially in some of its poorest member countries.


        Since the short-lived lull in the years leading up 2007, the IMF has (once again) redefined its

role, making extremely large loans (relative to the size of the national economies) to wealthy economies

in Europe, with the largest of these to Greece, where debt sustainability problems have been manifest

for some years now. In some sense, this most recent change brings the IMF full circle, because

advanced economies had been its earliest and largest clients before the emerging markets economies

started to dominate its activity in the 1980s.


        In what follows, we discuss the evolution of the IMF during the past 70 years from several

angles. Our narrative documents the evolving “clientele” for IMF programs and provides a sense of how

activity shifted across different parts of the globe and between advanced and emerging economies. We

  The IMF (2002), Bird et al. (2004), Joyce (2005), and Mody and Saravia (2006), all figure prominently among
the studies that have addressed the causes and consequences behind the protracted duration of Fund programs or
their recurring “serial” nature. Bulow and Rogoff (1990) and (2005) discuss alternative approaches to address the
sustained financing needs of low income countries.
                                                        3
connect some of these shifts to the ascendancy of financial liberalization and the subsequent increase in

cross border finance, as well as global factors such as international interest rates, primary commodity

prices, and global saving patterns. We also consider how the situations to which the IMF responds to

has changed over time, from the early focus on currency problems to the more engulfing challenges

posed by systemic banking and sovereign debt crises, often involving protracted output slumps and

large-scale bailouts of the corporate and banking sectors.


        Our approach concentrates on the fundamental changes in the IMF’s borrowing patterns rather

than delving into concerns about how particular crisis episodes were handled. On the latter, there is a

substantive body of literature which critiques IMF practices. One strand of this literature focuses on the

prominent role of political influence (most notably by the United States) on the design and incidence of

IMF programs. Another body of work takes issue with various aspects of IMF conditionality (including

the role of fiscal austerity). While we refer to relevant works in these areas, we take a different

perspective.


        We focus, in particular, on the IMF’s role in the international financial architecture and the

problems arising from “serial” IMF lending and from lending to countries with excessive debt burdens.

We suggest that the changing nature of lending patterns over time has left the IMF with conflicting

objectives. In dealing with potentially unsustainable debt cases and in moving toward larger and longer

term loan packages, the institution has become more involved in lending into sovereign default (often

chronic). An important unintended consequence of this tilt towards lending into arrears, is that a country

that seeks an IMF loan may be inadvertently signaling to the rest of the world that it is insolvent (and

not just illiquid). Indeed, a recent IMF (2014a, p. 4) report recognized that there is a large “stigma

associated with using Fund resources.” The financial press (e.g. The Economist 2009) has been aware of

this issue for some time.


        The adverse signaling effect has potentially damaging consequences for the IMF’s role as a

lender of last resort in crisis times, notably if solvent countries in need of liquidity refrain from

approaching the IMF altogether. While there are numerous development banks, the IMF is the one


                                                       4
institution that is sometimes described as a central bank for countries or lender of last resort to the world

(for example the essays in Bank of International Settlements: BIS 2014). The Fund could better fulfil its

mandate if it drew a clearer line between members that need financing for temporary balance-of-

payments or liquidity problems, and countries that show a chronic dependence on concessionary

external funds. At the end of the paper, we offer some speculation on the direction and dimension of the

next wave of changes that the IMF may confront.


                                           II. Shifting Clientele


         When viewed by the number of its members, the IMF is a very successful institution. The

initial membership of 28 back in 1945 has increased steadily to 188 in 2015 (Figure 2) with two notable

growth spurts: a jump of 33 countries in the early 1960s, as the former colonies in Africa gained

independence, and a jump of 28 countries in the early 1990s after breakdown of the Soviet Union. 4 New

entrants often asked for IMF assistance shortly after becoming members, which partly explains why the

number and countries with an IMF program has increased so markedly in the early 1960s, as shown in

Figure 3.


        The more intense program activity in the developing world also explains why the IMF came to

be seen as an institution that uses funds from higher-income countries to grant crisis loans to lower-

income countries. Indeed, up until the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, much of the academic and

popular debate of the IMF’s role in coping with crises was relegated to a discussion of episodes in

emerging markets, culminating with Argentina’s spectacular default in December 2001. Largely

forgotten is the fact that in the decades immediately after its creation at the end of World War II, many

IMF programs were providing balance-of-payments support to the comparatively wealthy economies of

Europe. Figure 4 documents the incidence of IMF programs over 1950-2014 in advanced and emerging

market-developing country groups separately, making plain the swings in the pendulum from advanced

II.1    Early Decades: Significant Lending to Advanced Economies


        There were no IMF lending programs in the first seven years after its creation in 1945. Rather,

the Marshall Plan of 1948-1951 accounted for the dominant form of international transfers (via both

loans and grants) to 18 European countries (if the Free Territory of Trieste is counted) along with eight

Asian countries, as well as Israel and a few other countries in the Middle East. While the Marshall plan

is usually discussed in terms of humanitarian aid and reconstruction finance, its loans and grants also

provided much-needed balance of payments support, as the economies in question faced the twin

challenges of having significant needs for imported consumer and industrial goods and limited reserves

of hard currency to make such purchases. This problem was known at the time as the “dollar gap” (for

discussion, see Behrman 2007, especially Chapter 8). Some countries, most notably the United

Kingdom, had also inherited a high level of war-time debt to service. In others, including France,

Germany, Italy and Japan, roaring inflation at the end of the war and the beginning of the peace had

wiped out significant portions of the domestic stock of debt (Reinhart and Sbrancia 2015).



                                                    7
        In 1952, Belgium and Finland were the first countries to use IMF resources. Between 1956 and

1977, the United Kingdom alone had 11 IMF programs. In the early years of the IMF, the classic

lending instrument was a Stand-By Arrangement, in which funds are provided on the condition that the

borrower addresses its underlying imbalances, and were typically granted as one-year programs that in a

few cases were renewed. By 1977, at the outset of the last of the UK programs, the duration of that

Stand-By arrangement was stretched to two years. This trend has persisted. For example, Turkey’s

most recent Stand-by program in 1999 was a three-year arrangement, reflecting a re-interpretation of

what constitutes temporary support (an issue we take up in the next section). 5

        In these early decades of the IMF, France, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United States,

among others, all borrowed from the International Monetary Fund. The fact that Greece did not have an

IMF program during this era largely stems from the fact that the country was in default from 1932

through 1964 and had rather minimal interaction with world capital markets. It was also the case that

Greece was a major recipient of aid, rather than loans, during the encompassing umbrella of the

Marshall Plan.

        The composition of the early developing-country clients of Fund also differed from what was to

emerge in the decades that followed. In the pre-OPEC era (OPEC was founded in 1961), Iran and Syria

had a very brief stint with Fund programs. It has not been repeated since. South Africa was the only

African country in the IMF until the late 1950s, when Ghana and Morocco joined the membership.

However, some of the countries that were to become chronically attached to the IMF (as we discuss in

the next section) — Argentina, El Salvador, Pakistan, the Philippines, among others — had already

made their appearance at the IMF lending window by the late 1950s or early 1960s.



II.2    Emerging Market, Transition Economies and Turmoil


        Many emerging market economies experienced an economic boom in the 1970s. For some of

these countries, the driving force was the sharp rises in oil prices in the mid- and late 1970s (Diaz-

Alejandro 1983, 1984). The surge in oil prices, accompanied by inflation world-wide, lifted commodity

prices in general. A belief that these higher commodity prices would last into the long-term meant that

lending to commodity producers came to be seen as a lucrative activity. A common dynamic of

international finance at this time was the so-called “recycling of the petrodollars,” which refers to the

recurring pattern whereby oil-producing countries deposited their surging dollar-denominated export

revenues in international financial intermediaries that, in turn, aggressively expanded their lending to a

broad range of developing countries.


        The spectacular boom was followed by a protracted bust, as has been a common historical

pattern (Kindelberger 1978; Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Gourinchas and

Obstfeld 2012). The spike in US interest rates in October 1979 abruptly brought the feast-phase of the

cycle to an end. Given that a significant share of the new debts of emerging-market economies were

either short-term or carried a variable interest rate, there was a swift and adverse effect on their national

balance sheets. Furthermore, the sharp appreciation of the US dollar accompanying the Federal

Reserve’s tight monetary policy further undermined the solvency of those nations that had taken on

dollar-denominated debt (whether those debts were public or private). By the early 1980s, commodity

and oil prices plunged, and debt-servicing costs for the developing world skyrocketed. The decade of

the 1980s is often referred to as the “lost decade” for Latin America. While emerging markets in Asia

fared better in terms of growth, inflation, and gains in social indicators, commodity-intensive Africa

fared just as badly in general and in several dimensions worse. For emerging markets as a whole, the

1980s was the most dismal decade since the 1930s.


        The number of IMF lending programs more than doubled from 1976 to 1983. The new wave of

IMF clients was comprised mostly of what were called “less developed countries” or LDCs in the

language of the day. This marked shift in the composition of what kind of countries were borrowing

from the IMF influenced the modalities and scope of the programs. In 1987, the IMF introduced the

Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program, which focused on making low-interest loans

to low-income countries. The debt crisis of the 1980s was eventually addressed after several years. One

main step was the external debt restructurings in 16 countries (mostly in Latin America) under the

Brady Plan of 1989, in which creditors agreed to write down the debts they were owed in exchange for


                                                      9
being issued new debt that was more likely to be repaid. The IMF participated by setting aside some of

its own loans. In addition, high-inflation countries in Latin America and elsewhere undertook

macroeconomic stabilization and anti-inflation programs,


        In the 1990s, the breakdown of the Soviet Union and its satellite community ushered new clients

to the IMF. A rough categorization of the new members would place much of Eastern Europe in the

middle–to-high income category and the former Soviet republics in the lower-income strata. Among this

lower-income group in particular, a number of these countries have become recurring and chronic users

of Fund resources since joining the Fund in the 1991-1993 period. As the next section documents, this

further lengthened the “effective” duration of IMF programs.


II.3    Post-2008: Crisis in the Eurozone


        In the years before the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, many countries in the periphery

Europe, as well as Iceland, the United Kingdom, and the United States experienced a boom in capital

inflows. As in so many pre-crisis booms, borrowing from the rest of the world supported a combination

of larger current account deficits, domestic lending surges, and asset price booms. For example, in 2008,

the current account deficits in Iceland, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland had reached records of 28, 15, 13,

and percent of GDP, respectively. As the global financial crisis severely sapped economic activity and

confidence in sovereign government finances eroded, the access to international capital markets that had

been taken for granted by advanced economies during most of the post-World War II era came to a

sudden stop. Iceland was the first to start an IMF program in 2008, followed by Greece and Ireland in

2010 and Portugal in 2011.


        This episode brought an enormous rise in the sheer volume of lending (in real terms) directed at

the higher-income economies (Figure 5): from 2008 to the present, the IMF has loaned more than $200

billion, of which about two-thirds went to advanced economies like Greece, Iceland, Ireland and

Portugal. This emphasis on lending to advanced countries represented the reemergence of an earlier

pattern. In the 1950s and 1960s, advanced economies accounted for a larger share of total approved

lending than emerging and developing economies. Table 1 shows the largest IMF programs during its

history, as measured by the dollar amounts of the loans approved (in real 2009 dollars) and in relation to
                                                    10
the country’s quota and GDP. The Mexican and Indonesian programs of 1995 and 1997 made headlines

at the time with loans of 6-7 times their quota, but they are dwarfed by the more recent wave of IMF

lending. The sheer scale of IMF lending during the most recent crisis, whether the country is in the

advanced or emerging category (like Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine), is a multiple of what were

considered record-sized programs in the 1990s and early 2000s.

        If one scales IMF lending by the recipient country’s GDP, the median program was less than 2

percent of GDP through the late 1970s (Figure 6)— which is consistent with what might be expected in

connection with temporary balance-of-payments support. For several years during the various debt

crises of the 1980s, the median IMF program reached about 4 percent of GDP and remained in that

range through the worldwide lull in financial crises during 2003-2007. The sheer size of the post-2008

IMF programs has no historical antecedent, as programs accounted for 10-16 percent of GDP of the

recipients. In addition, these post-2008 programs offered the same three-year duration of loans that the

Extended Credit Facility offered to low income countries.

                                          III. Evolving Demands


        As the composition of the IMF’s clientele evolved during the past 70 years since the

institution’s birth, so did common challenges or “types” of crises facing the IMF and its membership.


III.1   From Currency Crises to Banking and Sovereign Debt Crises


        Indeed, currency crises (or realignments) were not uncommon during the Bretton Woods era, as

highlighted by the light bars in Figure 7 plotting the number of currency crises per year over 1950-2014.

The year-by-year count of banking crises is given by the dark bars. As the figure makes plain, while

realignments (often in the form of large devaluations followed by re-pegging) were commonplace,

banking crises during the era of capital controls and tightly regulated financial markets were rare. 6

Owing to a combination of a broader adoption of more flexible exchange rate arrangements and a

decade of prosperity in emerging markets, the incidence of currency crashes diminished through 2012.

  Largely owing to a combination of a broader adoption of more flexible exchange rate arrangements and a decade
of prosperity in emerging markets during 2003-2013 the incidence of currency crashes in recent years diminished
in comparison to the 1950s-1970s (let alone the turbulent 1980s).

                                                      13
As emerging market exchange rate volatility has climbed noticeably (once again) it remains to be seen

whether currency woes resurface.

        Sources: Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and sources cited therein; updates by Reinhart at
        http://www.carmenreinhart.com.



        Most currency realignments are essentially temporary disturbances. Cooper (1971) and Krueger

(1978), for example, reach this conclusion after reviewing large currency devaluation episodes during

1951-1970 (many of which were a part of the conditionality associated with an IMF adjustment

program). Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) compare the effects of currency crises, banking crises, and

“twin” crises involving both in a more up-to-date sample. In all of these studies, currency devaluations

were associated with either a decline in output or a slowdown in growth but the effects were

comparatively small and short-lived. In contrast, it is a well-documented regularity that recessions

associated with systemic banking crises tend to be severe and protracted, as the global experience since

2008 has illustrated anew (for broad coverage of this issue see, Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999;

Dell’Ariccia et al.2008; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Claessens et al. 2009; Reinhart and Reinhart 2010;

Gourinchas and Obstfeld 2012 and Jorda et al. 2012). Cases of sovereign insolvency often involve even

more protracted slumps; indeed, sovereign default spells lasting a decade are not uncommon (Reinhart

                                                      14
and Rogoff 2009; Cruces and Trebesch 2013).

         Taken together, these observations about the relative incidence of currency versus banking

crises and their comparative speeds of recovery has implications for the kind of support that may have

been deemed appropriate by the IMF.


III.2    Growing Duration of IMF Lending Programs


         As shown in Figure 8, during the 1950s and 1960, according to our calculations, the duration of

IMF lending programs oscillated in a one-to-two year range (the Stand-By Arrangements during the

1950s and 1960s were one-year programs—but a succession of one-year programs was possible). By the

end of the 1990s, average duration of an IMF interaction had climbed to three years. The presence of

frequent systemic banking crises as well as the increasing incidence of protracted sovereign defaults

may partially account for a lengthening in the duration of IMF programs in 1980-1990s and for an

increase in their size relative to GDP.

        We also find an increasing number of repeated IMF programs, resulting in “serial lending”.

Table 2 presents the frequency distribution for the share of years that a country had an IMF program

during the time that the country belonged to the IMF. Of the current 188 member countries, more than a

quarter of these (25.5 percent) have had an IMF program 50 percent of the time (or more) that they were

an IMF member; 37 percent of the countries have been on IMF programs 40 percent of the time or

more. Forty-two countries (22 percent) never had a Fund program, with oil-exporting countries and

small states accounting for a significant share of this latter group.

        Table 3 lists countries with the heaviest recurring use of IMF resources, showing both the share

of years with IMF programs (breaking out the data summarized for all member countries in Table 2) and

the longest spell (in years) of consecutive programs. Topping the list, Uganda and Malawi (both

member countries since the mid-1960s) have had consecutive IMF programs for nearly 30 years. The

Joyce (2005) study (see also Figure 8) suggested income levels were an important factor in explaining

the duration of programs. With lower income countries having limited or no access to private capital

markets during long stretches of time, one potential story is that the IMF (along with other sources of

official financing) has emerged as a near-permanent substitute for access to private capital markets for

many low-income countries. It is unlikely, however, that this is the whole story, because the list of

countries with serial IMF programs shown in Table 3 includes a substantial number of middle-income



                                                     16
countries with an incidence of IMF programs during the time that they have been members in excess of

30 percent.

III.3   Chronic Debt Burdens and Lending Into Insolvency

        The heavy use of IMF lending by so many countries is clearly not a result of short-term

currency crises, and the historical incidence of banking crises does not seem sufficient to explain it,

either (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009, Ch. 10). More plausible is that IMF lending programs increasingly

occur in countries facing problems with insolvency of sovereign and sometimes private debt.

        A starting point in examining the nexus between IMF program lending and debt defaults is to

determine the extent of overlap between the two, starting with sovereign defaults and restructurings on

private creditors. 7 These highly visible credit events involve bank loans, bonds, or both. In numerous

episodes, there were also significant defaults on trade credit (see also the analysis by Erce 2013).

However, as we note in Reinhart and Trebesch (2015), a fuller picture of solvency also requires an

assessment of a debtor country’s standing with its official creditors. For example, the most prominent

debt crisis of the last few years, in Greece, now revolves almost entirely around the country’s debts to

official creditors including the IMF. While official creditors are not the main story for most middle-to-

high income countries, they play a dominant role in many low-income countries. It is important,

therefore to also assess to what extent official debt is in default, under restructuring, or in substantial

arrears. This task was recently attempted by Beers and Nadeau (2015), mainly based on World Bank

and Paris Club data on defaults and arrears with official creditors. We use their data to complement our

earlier history of private and sovereign credit events, which allows us to study the overlap between the

augmented (private plus official) defaults and IMF programs on a country-by-country basis.

        The pattern we observe is that the share of IMF programs with countries that are either in

default or in the process of restructuring with private creditors climbs from less than 20 percent of all

programs during 1950-1970s to more than 70 percent in the late 1980s. 8 The first country to have an

IMF program overlap with a default was Argentina in 1958 during the post-Peron budget crisis. The

more famous defaults began in earnest in the summer of 1982, as Mexico defaulted in August of that

year. However, smaller countries like Bolivia and much of Central America and numerous African

Rogoff (2009) and Cruces and Trebesch (2013), both updated in Reinhart and Trebesch (2015), and S&P (2015).
8
  In 1989, the IMF modified its policy of non-toleration of external arrears by creating the “Lending into Arrears
Policy”, which allowed countries under a program to have arrears towards private creditors as long as they show a
“good faith” to negotiate a potential debt restructuring and settle the arrears (see Diaz-Cassou et al. 2008).
                                                        19
countries were already in default as early as 1980. During the 1990s, however, the share of IMF

programs involving private debt default then started to fall. Part of the reason was the Brady plan in the

early 1990s, which diminished the number of debtors in default. Another important step in reducing

debt burdens involved the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative started by the IMF and the

World Bank in 1996, which eventually allowed 39 low-income countries to have existing debts reduced

in exchange for reforms that made paying the remainder of the debt more likely. 9

            Many emerging markets also experienced widespread public and private deleveraging following

the Asian crisis of 1997-1998, which made debt defaults in these countries less likely. Finally, the

increase in IMF program size, coupled with large-scale bailouts by other official lenders (e.g. by the

U.S. Treasury or the Eurozone institutions EFSF and ESM) have made sovereign default less likely, as

private creditor are repaid with new official loans. By 2013, fewer than 10 percent of all IMF lending

programs involved a default by private creditors, as shown in Figure 10.

      creditors and their overlap with IMF programs, with data available since 1980. A country is coded as having
      “significant and persistent arrears” to official creditors if these arrears (including to the IMF and World Bank)
      exceed 1% of GDP for three consecutive years or more, using data on official arrears from the World Bank
      (2015) and Beers and Nadeau (2015). Data on GDP in current US$ is from the IMF WEO database.

         Figure 10 also shows that the private-only measure of default shows just part of the picture and

significantly understates the weak and chronic state of fiscal finances, in particular in low-income

countries (and since 2010 in several European countries). Credit events involving official creditors do

not often make headlines, with the notable exception of Greece in 2015 (even the restructuring of

significant levels of official debt in Ireland, Greece and Portugal in 2013 received little attention).

Despite the limited coverage, arrears on official debts are both large and frequent, as show in Schlegl et

al. (2015). Accordingly, the dotted line in Figure 10 shows that defaults on official debt (defined as

significant and persistent arrears) 10 are a frequent by-product of IMF lending programs until this day.


         More specifically, in the 1990s and 2000s, about 40 percent of all IMF lending programs

involve some sort of default, restructuring or arrears on official debt. This is a remarkable and not

widely known fact, and is surprising given that the Fund’s policies dictate (at least in principle) that the

Fund should not lend in the presence of arrears to official creditors. 11 Under exceptional circumstances

this rule of non-toleration of arrears can be waived, for example when countries are in the process of

negotiating over debt relief with official creditors. However, the data suggests that arrears to official

creditors are the norm rather than the exception in many poor countries borrowing from the IMF.


         The intersection between lending programs and sovereign defaults or arrears provides insight as

to why so many countries have a track record that is filled with year upon year of consecutive IMF

lending programs. Indeed, one of the reasons why some countries have become chronic borrowers from

the IMF is that it is effectively a way of ever-greening their ongoing loans to both private and official

creditors. 12 Another reason is that countries asking for debt relief from the Paris Club or under the HIPC

initiative are often asked to agree to an IMF adjustment program first (Rose 2005 finds that 80% of

Paris Club deals coincide with an IMF program signed in the same year). Yet, we do not suggest that

debt problems are a complete explanation for the serial lending patterns we observe. Stone (2004)

provides compelling evidence for 53 African countries from 1990 to 2000 that shows that the typical

IMF’s loans-for-reform contract lacks credibility, because donor countries intervene to prevent rigorous

enforcement; specifically countries with influential developed-country patrons are subject to less

rigorous enforcement (as measured in terms of shorter program suspensions). Bird et al. (2004), who

focus on IMF lending programs over 1980-1996, find that recidivist borrowers have lower reserve

holdings, larger current account deficits and capital outflows, lower but less volatile terms of trade,

larger debt service and external debt ratios, lower investment rates and per-capita income, and weak

governance. Barro and Lee (2005) conclude that both economic factors and measures of political and

economic connections to the United States and, to a lesser degree, to the major European countries play

significant roles in raising the probability and size of IMF lending. Collectively, these studies suggest

that both economic fundamentals as well as political influence help explain why so many countries are

“addicted to the IMF.”

        Figure 11 plots average public debt/GDP across all countries with an IMF program that year and

reinforces some of the conclusions that emerged from examining the coincidence of programs and

external default. The solid line represents the average across programs in advanced economies. As there

is an approximate 30-year gap in which there were no programs, the solid line only re-appears after

2008. In the 1950s, the average is heavily influenced upward by the United Kingdom, where public debt

remained above 100% of nominal GDP for most of the decade. The recent levels for the advanced

economies, surpass by a considerable margin their earlier history. For the developing countries (HIPC

and middle income), the trend from the 1960s to the 1980s is unmistakably upwards and consistent with

the higher observed incidence of default during that period shown in Figure 10.

III.4   Implications of the Eurozone Crisis


        The Eurozone crisis was the latest demand “shock” for IMF lending. It had a major impact on

the IMF’s loan portfolio (see Figures A.2, A.3) and the IMF’s perception as a lender of last resort

(Moreno 2013, Schadler 2014). Three features of IMF involvement stand out.

        First, the crisis in Europe strengthened the tendency towards bigger programs and towards

lending to countries with very high levels of debt (Figure 11). This increased the risks incurred by the

IMF considerably. Table 1 shows that the recent programs in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal beat records

in terms of size in total amounts (and as % of debtor country GDP). All three countries have a debt/GDP

ratio of above 100%. Moreover, since 2008, several other European countries received major IMF loans,

in particular Iceland, Ukraine, and Hungary. As a result, the IMF loans portfolio became highly

concentrated in Europe, as shown in Figure 12. As of 2013, almost 80% of outstanding IMF loans were

owed by European countries alone. The scale of concentration is unprecedented in the IMF’s history.

                     Ex-post, we know that some of the European IMF programs did not fail, in the sense that the

IMF credits were largely paid back (Iceland, Ireland, and Portugal). In the cases of Greece and Ukraine,

which remain large-scale debtors, the jury is still out. However, it seems obvious that, in terms of its

loans portfolio, the risks incurred by the IMF after 2008 were larger than ever before.


                     A second feature of the European crisis is the damage it did to the IMF’s reputation, in

particular in the case of Greece. Most visibly, the Greek default on IMF loans on June 30, 2015 was a

blow to the IMF’s seniority status (Greece missed a payment of €1.5 bn on June 30, 2015 and another

payment of €456 million on July 13, 2015). Greece was the first advanced economy to ever miss an

IMF payment. In the past 70 years a total of 23 countries ran into protracted arrears with the IMF, but

the large majority of these defaulters were low-income countries or countries suffering from severe war

or natural disasters. Defaulting on the IMF is typically a last recourse. As shown by Schlegl, Trebesch


                                                                 24
and Wright (2015), the Fund is at the top of the “pecking order” of sovereign debt repayments, as debtor

countries usually default on all other external creditors first, prior to missing any payments towards the

IMF. Notably, this was not the case in Greece, which defaulted on the IMF, but continued to repay

private bondholders. At the same time, Greece was by far the largest client of the IMF, accounting for

26.6% of total IMF lending in end-2014.

        Figure 13 illustrates how large a full-fledged default by Greece would have been, and compares

this possibility to the history of IMF arrears. This episode illustrates just how dangerous it is for a lender

of last resort to agree to serial lending to a country with unsustainable debts. Lending into insolvency

(especially in large member countries) endangers the IMF’s most valuable asset: its seniority. This is

especially true because the IMF’s seniority is not written in law, but rather a market convention. If

market participants and debtor governments start questioning the IMF’s seniority status, there is little

the IMF can do to enforce its status.

        More generally, the IMF’s management in the Greek crisis has been widely criticized (see

Subramanian, 2015, and Mody, 2015), and the Fund has publicly acknowledged mistakes (IMF 2013).

In a longer historical perspective, however, this dimension is hardly new, as the institution has come

under repeated fire in its handling of past crises (Latin America 1980s, Asia 1997-1998, Russia 1998,

Argentina 2001, to name a few).
                                                     25
           The third and maybe most problematic legacy of the Eurozone crisis is the so called “systemic

exemption” clause (IMF 2014b), which effectively scrapped the IMF’s long-standing rule that no loans

should be given to countries with unsustainable debts. The policy authorizes the IMF to lend to any

country (even insolvent ones) in case this country poses large risks of systemic financial spillovers. It

was introduced in 2010, when the Greek debt burden was no longer evaluated as “sustainable with high

probability” by Fund staff (a precondition for grating exceptionally large IMF loans). In response, the

IMF altered its lending framework ad hoc, argued that Greece indeed posed severe spillover risks for the

Eurozone and the world economy, and, on the same day, granted the country access to IMF loans worth

€30 billion - more than 3000% of the Greek quota (the largest Fund program ever relative to quota, see

IMF 2013). Despite a recent staff proposal to drop the exemption clause, the rule remains in place until

this day, meaning that IMF lending into insolvency can continue on a large scale, at least as long as IMF

management judges the member country to be of systemic importance. 13 As a result, the IMF may face

larger demands for new loans, including by large emerging markets with heavy debt burdens. Moreover,

credibility problems may increase in cases where private creditors are asked to agree to a debt

restructuring and share part of the burden in future bailout programs. Such developments may contribute

to creditor moral hazard and further undermine the Fund’s role as a lender of last resort.


                                    IV. Demand-Driven or Supply-Driven?


           Discussions of the trends and patterns in IMF program lending often fall into two main

categories, depending on whether they tend to emphasize demand-driven or supply-driven explanations.

In explaining the breadth and timing of the changes in IMF lending documented in this paper, we lean

toward a “borrower demand driven” theory of institutional change at the IMF, in which the Fund has

redefined the issues it seeks to address and the tools it employs based on the evolving needs of its

clientele.


           One important demand factor has been the re-globalization of capital markets in the 1980s,

which was accompanied by large-scale cross-border capital flows, more episodes of “sudden stops”,



13
     For a more detailed discussion see Schadler (2013).
                                                           26
more systemic banking crises and more government bailouts of corporate and financial sectors

(Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999). 14 As a result of these trends, the Fund’s main activity shifted from

mostly trade related problems (then) to mostly capital flow related problems (now). These shifts also

became visible in the IMF’s organizational structure. . In particular, the experience of the Mexican and

East Asian crisis of the 1990s paved the way for the introduction of a new department within the IMF

that focused on the financial sector. Moreover, by the late 1990s, the Financial Sector Assessment

Program (FSAP) had become a central element of IMF “surveillance,” in which it evaluates the

economic risks that countries may face.


         Another demand factor has been the persistent financing need of poor countries without access

to private external capital markets, which in 1987, gave rise to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment

Facility (ESAF) program focused on low-interest loans to low-income countries. As noted, a significant

share of these programs involve countries with chronic arrears to official borrowers and account for

some of the longest (recurring) IMF programs.


         An alternative view would characterize the IMF as being “creditor supply-driven,” taking the

position that key funders (and the United States in particular) have dictated IMF and used it as an

extension of their own treasury ministries. This argument is neither new, nor difficult to understand. As

noted in Appendix I, the United States and the major economies of Western Europe have IMF quotas

that have traditionally granted them considerable power over IMF decisions.


         Indeed, the range of evidence that supports the conclusion that politics plays a role in IMF

lending decisions (usually at the country level) is compelling. We have already alluded to some of these

findings (for example, the Barro and Lee 2005 study). There are other studies. Thacker (1999), for

instance, finds evidence that political factors and voting alignments with the US are significant in

explaining the probability of getting an IMF loan (although his results vary across sample periods).

Stone (2004) discusses the political economy of IMF loans in Asia. Dreher et al. (2009), for instance,



14
  “Re-globalization” refers to the fact that the integration of capital markets was substantial in the heyday of the
gold standard era (Eichengreen 1992; Obstfeld and Taylor 2004; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009) before two World
Wars with the global economic depression of the 1930s in between balkanized global finance.
                                                          27
find systematic evidence that United Nations’ Security Council membership reduces the number of

conditions included in IMF programs. Another recurring critique is whether the use and character of the

conditions that the IMF places on its loans (as well as the rigor with which such conditions are

enforced) is unduly influenced by the objectives of key lenders. Jeffrey Sachs at the time of the Asian

crisis, 1997-1998 was a vocal proponent of this view (Sachs 1998), while Feldstein (1998) is explicit

about this problem in the case of Korea. More systematic evidence comes from Dreher and Jensen

(2007), suggesting that closer US allies face less strict IMF conditions.

          In a related vein, the issue of political control over the IMF has been also been evolving. For

example, China’s current quota is less than one-quarter of that of the United States even though by 2014

its share in world GDP (adjusted for purchasing power differentials, as reported by the IMF’s World

Economic Outlook) reached approximately the same as that of the United States. The China-US split on

this issue is much broader (and much older), as it represents the tension between the advanced and

developing country membership within the IMF (which was expressed as North versus South in an

earlier literature). IMF quotas, with their implications for voting power within the institution and the

quantity of loans that can be received, are reviewed infrequently. There has been proposal on the table

since 2010 for resetting the IMF quotas. The proposal would roughly double the size of the quotas—and

thus double the lending power of the IMF, but it would also diminish the relative power of the United

States and Western Europe. China would become the country with the third-largest quota and voting

power at the IMF, and Brazil, India, and Russia would all be in the ten largest countries by voting

power. 15. However, the change cannot occur without the support of the United States, which has so far

declined to do so.

          In sum, while we would emphasize a “demand driven” interpretation for general or aggregate

trends in IMF lending, our view does not preclude political factors from playing a significant role in the

design or implementation of IMF lending programs for individual countries, as suggested by much of

the evidence.

                                           V. Conflicting Objectives

         During the decades since the IMF was founded (in 1945), a clear disconnect has emerged between the

institution’s original mandate and its modern operations. Indeed, the gap between mandate and operations appears

to have widened over time. The original mandate of the IMF focused on temporary lending when liquidity was

tight and balance of payments support was needed. Despite those intentions, we have documented here a number

of patterns which suggest that an alternative mission has taken root: 1) about one-quarter of the member countries

have been engaged in an IMF program more than half of the years since becoming a member; 2) 66 out of 188

member countries have had consecutive IMF program spells that last somewhere between 10 and 30 years; 3)

since the 1980s, the share of IMF programs involving a sovereign that is in default, restructuring, or arrears has

oscillated between 40 and 70 percent; 4) IMF lending in the post- 2008 period to high-income countries

in Europe has re-enforced the prior ongoing trends toward larger and longer programs that are entangled

with issues of sovereign debt.

         In explaining the reasons behind this change, we lean toward an interpretation in which the

Fund has redefined the issues it seeks to address and the tools it employs based on the evolving

challenges of its members. A more negative interpretation is that the trends documented here are

evidence of mission creep at the IMF, in part in response to increased competition with the World Bank

and other development institutions. Indeed, the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank, led by a

political push from China, is sometimes seen as a threat to the IMF’s relevance. Along another margin,

some studies have suggested that the IMF often competes with private capital markets.

         Our concern is that the IMF’s increasing involvement in chronic debt crises and in development

finance may make it harder to focus on its original mission. While the modern demands on the IMF with

nearly 200 members are more diverse than ever before, the old or original needs as defined in the

Articles of Agreement remain as compelling as ever. It is true that classic balance-of-payments

problems may no longer arise as frequently as they once did, because exchange rates are no longer as

likely to be fixed or predetermined. However, de jure exchange rate arrangements that promise floating

exchange rates are often more flexible on paper than they are in practice; fear of floating has diminished

but not disappeared (Levy-Yeyati and Sturzeneger 2007; Ilzeztki, Reinhart and Rogoff 2016).




                                                         29
        There are further reasons why an international lender of last resort remains indispensable. The

high levels of international reserves that we observe today should not be taken for granted. International

commodity prices can change abruptly and deteriorate over long periods, as do global financial

conditions. Most developing or emerging economies (and not a few advanced ones) have large stocks of

debts in foreign currency. Moreover, a domestic lender of last resort faces limitations in emerging

markets, particularly those that are highly dollarized (Calvo 2006). In the past, the US Federal Reserve

has shown a remarkable willingness to provide dollar liquidity in crisis times, for example when

markets froze in 2009. Yet, the Fed’s role and mandate are first and foremost domestic. Finally, there

are numerous global and regional development agencies, but the world lacks a global central bank.

        The inherent conflict faced by the IMF is between strengthening its role as an international

lender of last resort and the demands of many member countries for serial lending, resulting in repeated

programs and a perpetual state of debt “ever-greening.” A usual concern in this context is that countries

will be tempted to over-borrow, if the terms of repayment are so elastic (both the IMF and the debtors

have incentives for ever-greening their loans). However, the point we would like to emphasize instead

deals with signaling and stigma.

        Many countries appear to welcome (in principle at least) access to liquidity in times of financial

stress. The IMF answer is to offer contingent credit lines, which can supplement the self-insurance of

countries provided by their holdings of international foreign exchange reserves. However, an

international discount window faces many of the same problems of discount window facilities of

domestic central banks. In a domestic setting, banks often shy away from approaching a central bank’s

discount window for fear that temporary illiquidity will be mistaken for insolvency by fellow market

participants (for discussions of this issue, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 2015;

European Central Bank 2015; BIS 2014). As one example, an important object lesson in the Federal

Reserve’s history comes from the crisis of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in

1984. In order to meet the demands created by bank runs, Continental Illinois borrowed heavily from

the discount window in 1984. The association of the discount window with a failing institution set a

precedent of adverse signaling that subsequently led other banks to avoid the discount window, for fear

they may be deemed as similarly troubled institutions. A policy instrument was damaged and lost.

                                                    30
        It seems plausible that countries may worry about stigma in a manner similar to banks.

The fact that so much of IMF lending in recent decades is longer term and connected to long-

run solvency problems may taint all of its lending. The importance of appearances and

signaling, especially how these factors may manifest themselves in times of stress and

confusion, should not be underrated. If an IMF program carries a signal of insolvency and is

categorically associated with other chronic problems, engaging in a program carries a risk of

sending a negative signal about a country’s solvency.

        If removing development finance and insolvent nations from IMF lending programs is not in the

cards, there may at least be merit in more deliberately separating lender of last resort activities from the

remainder of what the Fund does. In recent years, the IMF has shown efforts to move in this direction. It

introduced several new program lines that tilt (albeit broadly) in the direction of behaving like a central

bank discount window—that is, being willing to extend a substantial volume of credit on short notice.

First, the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), which seeks to provide quick loans with limited conditions to

low-income countries facing a balance of payments crisis. Second, the Flexible Credit Line (FCL),

enacted in 2009, which has the specific goal of reducing the risk of stigma. FCL loans are granted for

crisis-prevention and crisis-mitigation in more stable economies, i.e. for countries with very strong

policy frameworks and before the economy is at severe risk. Third, the Precautionary and Liquidity

Line (PLL) is aimed at countries with essentially sound economic fundamentals but with a limited

number of vulnerabilities which disqualifies them from using the Flexible Credit Line.

        At least so far, these discount-window-like programs have not drawn much interest from

potential borrowers. The FCL has only had three applicants (Colombia, Mexico, and Poland), while the

PLL has been arranged in two cases only (in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and

Morocco). Perhaps the limited impact of these programs is due to the fact that issues of stigma remain.

This danger of being unable to perform a lender of last resort function because of straying from its

original mission is most likely the fuel behind the recommendation of Calomiris and Meltzer (1999) that

the IMF act only as lender of last resort and only to countries that meet certain prerequisite standards in

banking.



                                                     31
        In this journal more than a decade ago, Fischer (1999) touched upon many of the central issues

related to the need for an international lender of last resort, particularly in connection with reducing the

intensity of financial crises and limiting contagion. We agree with Fischer that a modest element of

crisis avoidance may be within reach if there is a more effective lender of last resort. Furthermore, we

recognize the IMF’s potential role in mitigating the impact of crises on economic development and on

long term growth (on crisis costs see Cerra and Saxena, 2008, and Reinhart and Reinhart 2010, 2015). 16



                           VI. Concluding Observations: What Lies Ahead?


        In the last few years, while advanced economy borrowing from the IMF has reached historic

highs, emerging markets have mostly abstained from IMF borrowing. This has much to do with the

favorable external environment that emerging markets faced during much of the past decade: US

interest rates were low, declining, and mostly negative after adjusting for inflation; commodity prices

were rising markedly; China’s investment-led record growth rates fueled the appetite for primary

commodity exports; bleak asset returns in advanced economies set off the eternal quest for yields among

global investors, favoring emerging markets as an asset class. Good policies helped, too: unlike in prior

commodity price booms like the 1970s, many developing country governments managed to avoid

heavily pro-cyclical fiscal policies.


        But the era of tranquility for emerging markets appears to have ended (at least temporarily). The

risks are many. During the last few years, firms and banks in emerging market economies have

increasingly succumbed to the temptation of borrowing at low international interest rates at a time

during which their currencies were either stable or appreciating against the dollar. Current account

deficits have reappeared for many of these countries, along with domestic credit booms and currency

overvaluation. Moreover, growth began to slow and the US Federal Reserve announced its plans to

gradually withdraw from its exceptionally accommodative policies of last few years during the spring of


16
  Using a sample spanning 1870-2014, Reinhart and Reinhart (2015) document that crises are typically associated
with lower medium-term growth. Given that the forces for convergence of income across countries are estimated
to be slow, an economy that goes off track at the time of a financial crisis may well experience long-lived
consequences for its relative economic development—consequences that could have been mitigated by an active
and able international lender of last resort.

                                                      32
2013. Since then, a sharply appreciating US dollar coupled with significant domestic currency

depreciations in many emerging markets have increased external debt burdens.


        It is precisely in such an unsettling environment for emerging markets that the IMF may face

another wave of demands on its resources. At such a juncture, it appears particularly important that the

IMF strengthens its international lender of last resort capabilities and works towards reducing the stigma

of IMF lending. The legacy of the recent IMF lending in Europe raises the question of whether the

IMF’s next round of programs will ratchet up to the 10-16 percent of GDP, too. If emerging market

economies and/or advanced economies in crisis situations were to need and request the same program

scale going forward, this would imply more risks for the IMF portfolio, and surely increase the

likelihood that the IMF ends up lending into insolvency. A good starting point to mitigate these risks

would therefore be to strictly apply the debt sustainability criteria that IMF policies prescribe. Serial

lending to low-income countries and countries with severe debt sustainability problems moves the

functioning of the institution quite close to that of development agencies, which is an increasingly

crowded field. In our view, the only way to preserve the unique status and the seniority of the IMF is to

assure that its lending focuses on the task of providing liquidity quickly in response to short-term

financial crises — that is, acting as a lending source of last resort — the central bank to central banks.

Appendix I: IMF structure

        A country that joins the IMF is given a “quota,” which is the amount that must be paid by the

country to the IMF upon joining. The total of all national quota is at present around $330 billion

(although the IMF denominates the total in “Special Drawing Rights” whose value changes with

movements in exchange rates). The main factor determining the quota is the size of a country’s GDP,

but a country’s openness to trade, economic variability and size of international reserves may also play a

role. Up to three-quarters of a nation’s quota can be paid in its own currency, while the rest must be paid

in “hard” currencies that are widely accepted in the global economy like the US dollar, the euro, and the

yen. Quotas determine voting rights within the IMF. Because quotas are linked to GDP, it follows that

during the history of the IMF, the United States and the major economies of western Europe have

largely controlled the decision-making apparatus: for example, the United States has a large enough

share of total votes that it can exercise veto power over any substantial IMF decisions, while the

Managing Director of the IMF has always been a European. What a country can borrow from the IMF is

typically in the range of 200 to 600 percent of its quota, depending on the situation, although as we will

see the recent IMF loans in Europe have greatly exceeded this threshold. For a basic overview of the

quota system, the IMF website offers a useful starting point:

Appendix II: A Note on Official debt

           As noted, the sheer magnitudes of the IMF lending to periphery Europe is on a different scale

from most past metrics in terms of the real dollar amounts, its share of IMF quotas, and its size relative

to the GDP of the borrowers. 17 However, there is another important dimension in which the recent

episode stands out from experience. Other official lending to Greece, Ireland and Portugal from newly-

created post-crisis facilities, predominantly the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism (EFSM);

and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) has also soared. Indeed, Greek, Irish and

Portugese debt is now largely in the hands of official creditors, as carefully documented by Arslanalp

and Tsuda (2014) and shown in Figure 7. This is strikingly at odds with the experience of most middle-

income emerging markets and more similar to the low-income countries that seldom (if ever) had access

to international private capital markets.


           In the modern era, debts to the official sector of those magnitudes have only been associated

with the two World Wars and their immediate aftermath. As documented in Reinhart and Trebesch

(2015), most (if not all) of the WWI official debt of the advanced economies (of comparable

magnitudes) went into default in the summer of 1934 and was never repaid. 18

     Periphery here also includes emerging Europe.

     The notable exception was Finland, which fully repaid its obligations to the United States.

Appendix III Supplementary material on IMF program duration

        We suggest that these differences in the underlying problems faced by IMF membership over

time influenced important features of IMF programs in terms of their duration, recurrence (serial IMF

programs), and their size (relative to both the size of the economy and to their respective IMF quotas).

The selected country profiles presented in Figures A.2 and A.3, complement the evidence discussed in

Section III. As A.2 highlights for the advanced economies, IMF programs prior to the 1980s (on the

whole) were shorter and less recurring (with the exception of the UK) than the programs of more

modern vintage in many emerging and developing economies (Figure A.3). The high incidence of

default/restructuring of external debt that has accompanied many of the emerging market cases across

nearly all regions (for instance, Ghana, Peru, and Vietnam) is, no doubt, connected the different

modalities of the IMF interventions. Some of these programs had their origins in the reversal of

favorable external factors, as real interest rates climbed in the early 1980s, commodity prices crashed

and external financing became difficult, if not impossible, for many sovereigns

Notes: The IMF has an established procedure to react to protracted arrears on its loans. The punishment
measures range from declaring a country ineligible for additional IMF leinding, to a declaration of non-
cooperation (which implies a halt of technical assistant programs, for example), to a suspension of voting rights,
and, most drastically, a procedure to prepare a compulsory withdrawal from the IMF (this has never actually
occurred, countries like Cuba left voluntarily and fully settled their arrears eventually). For details, see - IMF
2012. “Review of the Fund’s Strategy on Overdue Financial Obligations” (link below)
