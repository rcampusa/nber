           The Effect of Family Background on Economic Status:

             A Longitudinal Analysis of Sibling Correlations



                                     ABSTRACT



         Numerous previous studies have used sibling correlations to measure the
importance of family background as a determinant of economic status. These studies.
however, have been biased by several flaws: failure to separate permanent from
transitory status variation (including that from measurement error). failure to account for

life-cycle stage. and overly homogeneous samples. This paper presents a methodology to
address these problems and applies it to longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics. Our main conclusion is that family background appears to exert greater
influence on economic status than has been indicated by earlier research.

          The Effect of Family Background on Economic Status:
             A Longitudinal Analysis of Sibling Correlations

                                      1. Introduction
         The influence of family background on economic status has persistently interested
social scientists and others concerned with social policy. This interest has stemmed largely
from a belief that income inequality attributable to family background violates equal

opportunity norms and warrants government intervention. Michael Harrington s
influential book The Other America, for example, based its call for antipoverty efforts on

just such a premise:
            the real explanation of why the poor are where they are is that they made the
         mistake of being born to the wrong parents, in the wrong section of the country.
         in the wrong industry, or in the wrong racial or ethnic group. Once that mistake
         has been made. they could have been paragons of will and morality, but most of
         them would never even have had a chance to get out of the other America.1

Similar (though less colorful language has appeared in scholarly studies. The foreword to
John Brittain's The Inheritance of Economic Status, for instance, says his findings

"constitute impressive evidence of the effect of family background on a man's chances for
economic success: they imply that inherited advantage, over which the individual has no
control, is important; and they bolster the case for a public policy aimed at redistribution of
income and wealth."2

         One device social scientists have used for measuring the importance of family

background is to estimate sibling correlations in economic status. The idea is that, if
family background matters very much, siblings will show a strong resemblance in
economic status; if it matters hardly at all, they will show little more resemblance than
would randomly selected unrelated individuals. In Section 2 of this paper. we formalize
this idea with a statistical model which also shows that previous sibling-based estimates of

family background's influence on income variables have been biased (probably downward

in most cases) by a series of shortcomings: measurement error, failure to distinguish

permanent and transitory income, failure to adjust for life-cycle stage, and overly

homogeneous samples. We then present a simple methodology for addressing these
problems with longitudinal data and apply it to data from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics. In Section 3, we develop a more sophisticated extension of the methodology

and report the corresponding results. We summarize our findings in Section 4.

                                          2. A Simple Model
           We begin with a simple statistical framework for analyzing sibling correlations.

Let

where         IS some economic status measure in year t for the j
                                                                 .th..            .th
                                                                   sibling in the i family.

       is a vector of explanatory variables chosen to account for life-cycle stage and general

time effects such as price inflation, business-cycle conditions, and cohort effects), and 3 is

the associated vector of regression parameters. The error term e.., which then represents
economic status after abstracting from life-cycle and time factors. is the object of our

analysis.
            We view e.. as the sum of three components:
                     iJt


(2)         e..
             lit   1     iJ         lit


where a. is a permanent component common to the siblings in the th family u. is an
individual-specific permanent component not shared by siblings in the same family, and v

is a transitory component generated by some combination of measurement error and true
transitory- fluctuation in c... With general time effects already accounted for. V..     is
                              lit                                                  lit
assumed to be cross-sectionally independent.3 though it may be serially correlated. The
three error components are to be interpreted so that they are orthogonal by construction.
For example, the permanent component of an individual's status is conceptually
                                                    3


partitioned into the part a. that is perfectly correlated among siblings in the .th
                                                                                i family and
 the part u. that is perfectly uncorrelated.

          We then view c, the stationary population variance of Eijt as the sum of the
variances of its three components:


(3)       o =a2a +2u +.2v
           2



This variance decomposition is reminiscent of the numerous studies in the earnings
function literature, such as Lillard and Willis (1978). which have broken earnings variance

into permanent and transitory components. The present analysis further decomposes the
permanent component into sibling and family components. The population variance in
permanent status then is           +      and the correlation of permanent status among siblings

is


         o =        2,.2    2.
(4)            o•
                    a   au
                     to• +0• ).


         This correlation         tells, in a sense, what proportion of the population variance in
permanent status is attributable to family background. It does so by describing what
proportion of the variance is common to siblings. The particular sense in which
summarizes family background's importance is broad in certain respects and narrow in
others. On one hand, anything shared by siblings — not just parental characteristics, but
also community characteristics such as school quality and status of neighbors — is

included in the measured family background effect. On the other hand, some factors often
thought of as family background factors are left out. For example, those genetic traits not
shared by siblings are excluded. Also excluded are family or community factors that differ
among siblings because the siblings are raised at different times or because the parents
choose to treat the siblings differently.4
                                                4


          Nevertheless, sibling correlations have considerable appeal as omnibus measures

 of the importance of family background, and numerous researchers have used them as
 such. Corcoran. Jencks. and Olneck (1976), for example, estimated brother correlations

 for the natural logarithm of earnings and obtained values of .13, .21, and .22 in three
different data sets. Similar analyses by other researchers usually have produced
correlations in the .1O—.35 range.5

         Previous estimates. however, have been biased by several flaws. First, most
studies have relied on only one observation of annual earnings (or some other status

measure;) per person. As a result, their status measures contain transitory components

(including measurement error) along with the permanent components. Consequently, the
brother correlations in these studies are effectively estimates of

                 /t±
                 a   a   u      V




rather than o. As a comparison of (4 and (5 makes clear, the failure to distinguish

transitory and permanent status tends to obscure the importance of family background in

permanent status. To put it another way. by using only single-year earnings data.
previous studies have tended to underestimate the brother correlation in permanent status
by a factor of

         Second, many previous studies have relied not on representative national

samples, but on remarkably homogeneous samples. For example. Olneck's (1977) study is
based on brothers from Kalamazoo. and Kearl and Pope (1986) use data on Mormon

brothers in 19tFcentury Utah. Studies that draw their samples from such homogeneous
sets of families will tend to produce small estimates of cr2 and therefore will again tend to

underestimate the true for the overall U.S. population.

          Third, most previous studies have not adjusted their status measures for stage of
life-cycle.6 Insofar as the siblings in a sample tend to be closer together in age than are

randomly selected sample members, this failure will tend to overestimate sibling

resemblance in permanent status. Since the age range in most samples has been fairly
narrow, though, this bias probably is minor in most cases. We therefore expect that the
biases toward underestimation typically dominate.

         The remainder of this section outlines a strategy for addressing these estimation
problems with longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics tPSID. We
focus on a sample of "splitoffs" — children in the original 1968 PSID families who have

since become heads of households or spouses of heads) in their own families. This sample.

of course, contains multiple siblings from the same families. The longitudinal nature of our
data on splitoffs' adult status enables us to address the first estimation problem of

separately identifying permanent and transitory variation. The national
representativeness of the PSID alleviates the second problem overly homogeneous

samples). and regression adjustments described below address the third (life-cycle stag&.
         The general procedure is as follows. First we use least squares methods to
estimate equation (1) where        is a vector of age and year variables. We then use the
regression residuals

(7)      e..    v.. —X..
          Ut     ijt       Ut


as consistent estimates of      the variable of interest. Next we apply analysis-of-variance
methods to e.. to estimate the three variance components: .2 2 and
             ljt                                                au          v Finally,
substitution of these estimates into (4), (5), and (6) yields estimates of . -, and ,'i'.
         If our sample contained an equal number of siblings J per family and an equal
number of annual observations T per sibling. if the transitory component         were serially
uncorrelated, and if the PSID were a simple random sample. we could estimate the
variance components with the classical analysis-of-variance formulas:

the basis of observed year-to-year variation in the same individuals status. then identifies
the permanent variance among siblings in the same family on the basis of observed within-
family variation, and finally identifies the permanent variance across families on the basis

of observed between-family variation.
         In fact, however, none of the required conditions for the classical formulas is met.

Our sample contains different numbers of siblings J. per family and different numbers of
observations T.. per person: numerous previous longitudinal studies have found evidence of
serial correlation in the transitory component of earnings: and the PSID is a stratified
multistage survey. We will defer treatment of the latter two problems to the next section,

but we will close this section by illustrating OUr approach with an analysis that does treat

the first problem.
         This analysis focuses on men's annual earnings. The sample contains male
splitoffs from the Survey Research Center component of the PSID7 who were between
                                               7


 the ages of 10 and 17 at the outset of the survey in 1968. Our data consist of annual

earnings observations over the 1975—82 period, and we restrict our sample observations to

positive earnings reported when the men were at least 25 years old. These data were
collected in interviews from 1976 through 1983 and pertain to the preceding calendar

years. Men that were under age 10 in 1968 are excluded from our sample because they
had not reached age 25 by 1983. Men that were over age 17 in 1968 and entered the
PSID because they were still living in their parents' households are excluded to avoid

overrepresenting men that left home at late ages. The resulting sample contains a total of
 18.54 observations on 433 men from 342 families.

          Our first step was to perform ordinary least squares estimation of equation (1)
where the dependent variable        was the natural logarithm of annual nominal earnings
and       was a vector of year and age dummy variables.8 We then subjected the
resulting residuals e.. to an analysis of variance. Our estimators of the variance

          The resulting estimates of the respective variance components are 8-        .119,

correlation in permanent log earnings to be        .342. As expected, the use of longitudinal
data to estimate the brother correlation in permanent status produces an estimate higher

than most in the previous literature. This point is highlighted by substituting all three
estimated variance components into (5) to obtain = .203. This amounts to an estimate
of the brother correlation in a single year's observation of status and indeed does

correspond more closely to the previous estimates that relied on single-year data. The

ratio of to suggests that using only single-year data underestimates the brother
correlation in permanent status by a factor of •59,5•10

                                         3. A More General Model
         The results above are based on a procedure that assumes simple random
sampling and serial noncorrelation of the transitory component "ijt With respect to the
latter assumption, several previous studies — such as Lillard and Willis (1978), MaCurdy
(1982), and Abowd and Card (1986) — have found evidence of substantial serial

correlation in the transitory component of earnings. We therefore modify our model to
allow     to follow the first-order autoregressive process


(11)     v..        pv..ij.t— 1 + z..
          ijt                      lit


where     is serially uncorrelated and                  =   2/( 1— p2). Substituting (11 into (2) and then
subtracting p times the once-lagged version of (2) yields


(12)            —              =   (1—p)a.   + (l—p)u.. +
                           1




If a consistent estimate of p is available, one can apply the same analysis-of-variance
procedures described in Section 2 to              —
                                                              — 1   to obtain estimates of the three variance

components for (12): (1—p)2o2. (1—p)22, and o. It is then straightforward to solve for
the implied values of c. o. and c.

         To follow this procedure, one needs an estimate of p. A simple method is to

regress the difTerenced residuals e.. —e..    on their lagged values e..     —e..     . As
                                   lit            ij,tl                ij,t—1 ij.t—2
shown in Solon (1984), the resulting coefficient estimate r consistently estimates the first-
order autocorrelation of —               — 1'
                                                which is (p- 1)12. Inverting the relationship between r

and p, one can then estimate p with =               1   + 2r.
         The assumption of simple random sampling raises two other issues. First, the

PSID sample actually was generated by a multistage survey design that randomly selected
geographic clusters of households. This departure from simple random sampling causes
bias in the variance component estimators described above, but a simple extension of the
                                                9


 analysis in Section 9.3 of Cochran (1963) shows that, with the large number of clusters in
 the PSID, this bias becomes negligible. As will be discussed later, however, the

 nonindependence of observations in the same cluster is one of several complicating factors

 for the estimation of standard errors. Second, the full PSID sample contains both the
 Survey Research Center SRC sample used in Section 2 and an additional sample of low-
 income families drawn from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO). The SEO
 sample was added in a deliberate effort to oversample the low-income population.

 Excluding SEO families from our analysis in Section 2 resulted in an unnecessarily small
 sample size, and we will include them in this section's analysis. Their inclusion, however.

 raises a new problem. With oversampling of low-income families, the sample distribution
 of economic status becomes systematically different from the population distribution, and

therefore our variance component estimators based on observed sample variances become

inconsistent. To correct this problem. we henceforth apply our estimation procedures to
data weighted by the inverse of the probability of selection into the sample.1' The details
of' the estimation procedures are given in Appendix A.

         We apply t.hese procedures first to men's log annual earnings. The sample
selection criteria are the same as in Section 2 except that we now use both the SRC and

SEQ components of the PSLD. The initial (unweighted) sample size is 3.5 33 annual
observations on 855 individuals from 6.51 families, but the "p-differencing" procedure

eliminates one observation per individual and also eliminates individuals who start with
only one observation. The sample size for the differenced data is 2656 observations on

738 individuals from 583 families. Slightly over half these observations come from the
SRC sample. Of the 738 sample individuals, 448 are "singletons," i.e.. either they have no
brothers or their brothei-s do not meet the sample selection criteria. The other 290 sample

individuals consist of 116 brother pairs, 18 triples, and 1 quadruple.

         The first column of Table I shows the estimation results. The first-order serial

correlation p of the transitory component is estimated at .4 79. a finding similar to those in

into (4) yields an estimated brother correlation in permanent status of = .448. This
estimate, even higher than the one in Section 2, suggests a distinctly larger influence of

family background than implied by most earlier siblings studies. Again, it is interesting to
substitute all three estimated variance components into (5) to estimate the brother
correlation in single-year (rather than permanent) status. The resulting = .248 is fairly
typical of the estimates in previous studies based on single-year data. The ratio
        .554 implies that measuring the brother correlation in single-year status
underestimates the correlation in permanent status by almost half.
          Our estimate of is based on a complex estimation procedure that uses multiple
years of panel data. It is worth asking what we would obtain if, like previous studies, we
actually used only single-year data to estimate a2, the sum a2 + a2, and the ratio
    = a2/tSa2+a2±a21. We have performed such estimation12 for each of the years 1979
through 1982. and the resulting estimates of range from .150 for 1981 to .511 for 1979.
The surprising instability of the estimates across years led us to examine the data more
closely. What we discovered is that the variance component estimators are highly
sensitive to outliers.13 In particular. the estimates are greatly influenced by the log
earnings of the few individuals who earned less than several hundred dollars in a year.14

This problem becomes particularly important when the outliers happen to be singletons. A
brother outlier inflates the estimates of both a2 and a2 + a2 so that the estimate of the
ratio - is not dramatically affected. A singleton outlier, however, inflates only
(singletons provide no information on within-family variation and therefore do not appear

in the estimator for a2 + a2) and hence substantially inflates as well. This suggests the

possible advisability of excluding singletons (as most previous studies have done). With
singletons excluded, our single-year estimates of - do indeed compress to a narrower range
—   from .235 for 1981 to .342 for 1982.'° These estimates tend toward the higher end of
                                               11


 the range from previous studies, but remain well below = .448, our estimated brother
 correlation in permanent status.

          Beyond its magnitude relative to earlier estimates, our estimate of q is difficult to
interpret in practical terms. We therefore present, in the first column of results in Table
II, answers to the question: If an individual's family background component is in some
specified decile of the family background distribution, in what percentile rank of the

permanent log earnings distribution is the individuaFs expected permanent log earnings?
The figures in the table are based on our variance component estimates and the additional

(and questionable'6i assumption that the two permanent components a. and u. are both
normally distributed. The results suggest a startlingly important influence of family
background. For example. an individual whose family background is in the bottom decile

has expected permanent log earnings in only the 12th percentile of the permanent log
earnings distribution.

         Although these findings have substantively important implications, their
reliability depends on the precision of our estimation. The complexity of our estimation
procedure combined with the complexity of the PSID sample design has prevented us from
analytically deriving standard errors for our estimators. A correct analytical solution
would have to take account of the imprecision in our estimation of the original regression

adjustment coefficients 3 and the serial correlation parameter p as well as the imprecision
from the analysis-of-variance procedure itself. It also would have to account for the
apparent nonnormality of cit' the nonindependence of observations from different families

in the same geographic cluster, and the weighting necessitated by the oversampling of the
low-income population.17 To bypass these difficult problems. we instead have used a

nonparametric "balanced half-sample replication" approach to produce standard error
estimates. This approach — described in detail in Kish and Frankel (1970), McCarthy
(1969), and Wolter (1985) — repeatedly applies the entire estimation procedure to a

succession of strategically chosen half-samples. Each estimator's observed variance across
                                              12


the half-sample replications is then used to infer an estimate of the variance of that
estimator as applied to the full sample. Our application of this procedure is described more

fully in Appendix B.
          As shown in Table I, some of the standard error estimates obtained in this

manner turn out to be quite large. Most importantly, the estimated brother correlation in
permanent status () has an estimated standard error of .295. This is much larger than
the standard error estimates reported for 4 in previous studies, even those studies based on
brothers samples no larger than our own. Our large standard errors seem to arise from
two factors. The first is simply that we have tackled a more difficult estimation problem

than that undertaken by earlier studies — we have attempted separate identification of the
permanent and transitory individual-specific components in order to estimate a brother

correlation for unobserved permanent status rather than for observed single-year status.

Given the obvious difficulty of distinguishing a permanent component from a serially
correlated transitory component on the basis of only a few years of panel data, the
imprecision of our estimation should not be surprising. The second factor is the previously
mentioned sensitivity of the estimation to singleton outliers. In an effort to treat this

problem, we have repeated our analysis with singletons excluded. The resulting point
estimates are fairly similar to those in Table I ( .114,         = .198.     =   .248,

.367, 4    .205,   4=   .557). but the estimated standard errors become even larger. The

reason is that the robustness gain from excluding singletons is more than offset by the
efficiency loss from deleting most of the individuals in our sample. To paraphrase
MacDonald and Robinson (1985), the exclusion of singletons throws the sample size out

with the bathwater.
          One important parameter we do estimate with some precision is the ratio vIth,

estimated at .554 with estimated standard error .082. Exact confidence intervals are

precluded by our ignorance of the distribution of 4I, but we can make conservative
statements on the basis of the Chebyshev inequality.18 According to the Chebyshev
                                                13


inequality, no random variable, regardless of its distribution, can deviate from its mean by
more than k standard deviations with a probability greater than 1/k2. Thus, if .082 is a
good estimate of the standard error, then .554       3 (.082) is a conservative .89 confidence
interval around       The upper end of this range, .800, still implies that studies using only

single-year data are biased toward substantial underestimation of the brother correlation
in permanent status. To put it another way. .554 is more than five estimated standard
errors below unity. We expect therefore that a hypothesis that single-year analyses are
only negligibly biased could be rejected at any conventional significance level.
         Thus far we have focused on men's earnings, the variable considered in most

earlier work. We also have applied our estimation procedure to several other variables

related to economic status: log hourly wage. log annual hours of work. log family income,
and log family income, needs for men as well as the same two family income variables for

women. The hourly wage measure is the ratio of annual earnings to annual hours, and
the income'needs ratio is family income divided b a needs standard related to the official
poverty line for the individual's family size. 19 The results, shown in columns 2—7 of

Table I, are qualitatively similar to those for men's earnings. The sibling correlations in

permanent status are generally high compared to those in previous studies; they range
from .276 for women's log family income to .534 for men's log wage. The computing

expense of implementing the balanced half-sample replications prevented us from
estimating standard errors. but our experience with men's earnings suggests that many of
the standard errors are probably quite large.

         Finally, columns 2—7 of Table II repeat the exercise of interpreting the estimated

sibling correlations in terms of percentile ranks. Of course, the results differ across
variables in accordance with the differences in estimated sibling correlations. but in all

cases the estimated influence of family background remains strikingly large.

                                        4. Summary
          Previous studies of sibling correlations in economic status have been biased by

several flaws: failure to separate permanent from transitory status variation (including
that from measurement error), failure to account. for life-cycle stage. and overly

homogeneous samples. We have presented a methodology to address these problems and
have applied it to longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The

resulting point estimates of sibling correlations in permanent status suggest a greater
sibling resemblance than indicated by earlier studies. Unfortunately, standard error
estimates based on balanced half-sample replications reveal that these point estimates are
very imprecise. Nevertheless, the evidence of substantial downward bias in the previous
studies that used single-year data is overwhelming. Our main substantive conclusion.

then, is that family background appears to exert greater influence on economic status than
has been suggested by earlier research.
          The policy implications of this finding are far from obvious. First, whether
income inequality attributable to family background can be affected by policy intervention

depends on just what it is about siblings' shared background that matters. To address this
issue, we are beginning research on the relationship between the PSID splitoffs' status and
a wide variety of characteristics of their parents and the communities in which the splitoffs
grew up. A reliable assessment of which characteristics are important, however, will be
difficult in the face of multicollinearitv among the characteristics, measurement error, and
omitted-variable problems. Second. even if the influential aspects of background can be

identified, whether the resulting income inequality ought to be affected by policy
intervention will depend inevitably on value judgments concerning what an equitable
income distribution is and the extent to which efficiency losses should be suffered to
achieve it.

                                          Appendix B
         To facilitate half-sample replications, the Survey Research Center has

characterized the PSID sample as consisting of two independent "primary selections" from

each of 32 strata. The pair of selections in the kth stratum might be, say, the PSID
samples from the Milwaukee and Minneapolis areas. The coding of these pairs is
described on pages 89—90 and 3 10-11 of Survey Research Center (1985). A half-sample

comprised of only one selection from each of the 32 strata more or less duplicates the

complex survey design of the PSID, but at only about half the size.
         We used the 32x32 Hadamard matrix on page 325 of Wolter (198.5) to select a

set of 32 "balanced" half-samples. For any parameter p, if denotes the estimate from
the full sample and k the estimate from the kth half'-sample, we estimate the variance of
  with


        'N.           32         2
(18)     Var ( =                   /32.
                      k=1
         \Vhy is this a sensible estimator of Var (? Let      denote the estimate of p from

the complement of the kth half-sample. and suppose     =      +         as is exactly true if

 is a linear estimator and is likely to be approximately true otherwise. Then, for any

arbitrary half-sample k,


(19)     E(kP)2 =

                  = E[(k/ik,'J/2]

                  =           2
                                  14
                      E(Pkpk.)

                  =

                  = 2 Var

                  = Var
                                            21

                  = Var (a).                                 -

Thus, for any particular half-sample k, the squared deviation of   from is an
approximately unbiased estimator of Var (2). The point of taking 32 different half-
samples and averaging the squared deviations of the k from is to improve the precision
of the variance estimator. The optimal method of choosing "balanced" half-sample

replications is discussed in detail in McCarthy (1969 and Wolter (1985).

31n response to comments from Angelo Melino and Kevin Murphy, we have checked the
assumption that the contemporaneous sibling correlation in the transitory component          is
zero. Based on the relationship between brothers' earnings changes in 198 1—82, we have
estimated that correlation to be .128. Some rough calculations suggest that, if .128 is the
true sibling correlation in v.., then our subsequent estimation of the brother correlation in
permanent status under the assumption of cross-sectional independence of "ijt is biased
upward, but by only a small magnitude. We also have checked the assumption that         is
homoskedastic with respect to age and business-cycle stage, and have found no clear-cut
evidence to the contrary.
4The parameter o can be affected in complex ways by parents' behavior regarding
investment in their children. For example, if, as Griliches (1979 claims, parents invest
more in their less able children, this compensatory" behavior reduces o2: if, as Becker
and Tomes (1976) claim, parents invest more in their abler children, this "reinforcing"
behavior increases o. These different investment strategies might affect as well, but
the directions of the effects on that variance component are less obvious.


°See Behrman. Taubman. and Wales (1977), Bound. Griliches, and Hall (1986). Brittain
(1977). Corcoran and Jencks (1979). Griliches (1979), Kearl and Pope (1986), and Olneck
(1977). The main outlier is the high correlation (.54 that Behrman, Taubman, and Wales
found for monozygotic twins. It should not be surprising, though, that rnonozygotic twins
show stronger resemblance than do other siblings.

6A related point, with similar implications, is that these studies also have failed to
account for cohort effects.


TAs will be discussed later. the PSID oversampled the low-income population by also
including a sample component drawn from the Survey of Economic Opportunity.


8The dummy variables included one each for ages 26—32 (25 omitted) and one each for
years 1976—82 (197.5 omitted). Accounting for life-cycle stage with individual-invariant
age coefficients assumes that different individuals do not have systematically different
earnings-age profiles. Somewhat surprisingly, the longitudinal analyses of earnings by
MaCurdy (1982) and Abowd and Card (1986) support this assumption. They find that the
serial correlation in change of log earnings is essentially zero at lags longer than two
years, which would not be the case in the presence of substantial individual-specific time
trends. We find similar evidence in our data.
                                             23


9Our estimate of     is larger than most in the existing literature. As noted by
MacDonald and Robinson (1985). most previous studies have depressed their estimates of
   by deleting outliers and all observations for individuals who had zero earnings in any
year in the sample period. Our approach is to include all positive observations and
recognize that our estimate of c' is partly comprised of variance due to measurement
error. Another possible factor behind our large is the young age range in our sample.
Our sample members may display especially volatile earnings because many of them are
not yet settled into their regular career paths. If the PSID continues well into the future.
it would be worthwhile to conduct a later replication of our study once our sample has
matured.

t0Other estimates of the ratio in (6) can be inferred from results of previous longitudinal
analyses of earnings. The results in the first row of Table 1 in Lillard and Willis (1978),
for example, imply i'q .73. These results. however, do not adjust for stage of life-cycle
and are based on a sample restricted to individuals with positive earnings in all years of'
the sample period. The results in the seventh row of Table 1 in MacDonald and Robinson
(1985) imply      = .57. This analysis pertains to hourly wages and adjusts for schooling
as well as life-cycle and year effects, but is otherwise similar to ours in that it does not
exclude outliers or individuals with zero earnings in any year.

1tThis technique has been suggested in related contexts by Hausman and Wise (1981) and
Manski and Lerman (1977).

12The estimation formulas specialize those in Appendix A to the case where T..      1 and
the within-family variance components      and     are not separated.


t3We are not the first to encounter this general problem. Section 8.1 of Huber (1981)
comments on the special sensitivity of estimated second moments to outliers.


'41t was tempting, of course, simply to delete the outliers. An examination of the outlier
cases, however, did not give us any sound basis for concluding that they were any less
valid than other observations.

15As will be discussed later in this section, obtaining appropriate standard error estimates
is a formidable task. We have applied the half-sample replication procedure described
later to the for 1982 and estimated its standard error to be .081.

16The relative preponderance of low outliers indicates that     is distributed
asymmetrically and hence nonnormally. If the nonnormality of 1ijt arises solely from
                                            24


nonnormality of the transitory component         however, Table il's normality assumption
for a and u.. is appropriate.


'7See footnote 16 on the nonnormality issue. These same factors that complicate the
estimation of standard errors also explain why we did not adopt a maximum likelihood
approach for the estimation in this paper.


t8See DeGroot (1975), p. 185.


'9The needs standard is described on pages 115—16 of Survey Research Center (1985).
The usual procedure of adjusting the standard for inflation is unnecessary in our study
because we include-year variables in X.. in equation (1).

19 of Survey Research Center (1979 give a detailed explanation of the construction of the
weight.
