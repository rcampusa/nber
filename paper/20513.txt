                                              ABSTRACT

We report on recent findings of a fruitful research agenda that explores the importance of ethnic-specific
traits in shaping African development. First, using recent surveys from Sub-Saharan African countries,
we document that individuals identify with their ethnic group as often as with the nation pointing to
the salience of ethnicity. Second, we focus on the various historical and contemporary functions of
tribal leaders (chiefs) and illustrate their influence on various aspects of the economy and the polity.
Third, we elaborate on a prominent dimension of ethnicity, that of the degree of complexity of pre-colonial
political organization. Building on insights from the African historiography, we review recent works
showing a strong association between pre-colonial centralization and contemporary comparative development
both across and within countries. We also document that the strong link between pre-colonial political
centralization and regional development -as captured by satellite images of light density at night- is
particularly strong in areas outside the vicinity of the capitals, where due to population mixing and
the salience of national institutions ethnic traits play a lesser role. Overall, our evidence is supportive
to theories and narratives on the presence of a "dual" economic and institutional environment in Africa.

1    Introduction
Over the past years while researching the political origins of contemporary African development,
we were struck by an apparent disconnect between the focus of works in the economics literature
and the narrative permeating the African historiography.
      On the one hand, most studies in economics study the role of country-wide features, such
as the national legal framework and property rights institutions, the degree of political free-
dom and democracy, foreign aid, and ethnic fractionalization. In the same vein, during Africa’s
post-independence era, the international community designed and implemented policies and in-
terventions at the country level. For example, the disbursement of foreign aid to various regimes
has been conditional on reducing graft and boosting bureaucratic eﬃciency. Similarly, the UN
Millennium Development Goals set national-level targets regarding poverty, education and health
whereas international media focus on the role of national leaders and the adequacy or deficiencies
of national policies in shaping African development.
      On the other hand, the African historiography downplays the role both of the colonial
state and the post-independence governments in shaping comparative economic and political
development. In many parts of the continent the central state is weak and incapable of providing
basic functions, such as policing and taxing, while in several countries the national government
exerts limited influence outside the capital. Moreover, even in countries where national structures
are relatively strong, local tribal leaders (chiefs) often act as the intermediaries between the central
administration and the local economy. This strand of literature, hence, stresses the predominant
role of the ethnicity, de-emphasizing nationwide features.
      In his synthesis of works on the political economy of African development, Herbst (2000)
notes that quite often Western policy makers and academics alike when discussing African coun-
tries project their notion of nation-states that is based on strong governments, pervasive national
identification, and well-defined political boundaries. Yet, most African states defy the Weberian
notion of an entity that enjoys a legitimate monopoly of violence providing order, security, and
protection of private contracts. Throughout most of its post-independence history, most African
states have not been able to monopolize violence and uniformly enforce the law. Moreover, na-
tional identity has only recently started to emerge, as most African states are colonial makings
without strong historical antecedents (notable exceptions include Ethiopia and to a certain extent
Botswana).


      Structure - Results Preview This paper presents evidence and reviews studies on the
"dual", national and ethnic, institutional structure of many African states: National institutions,
policies, and bureaucrats on the one hand; and ethnic norms, institutions, and traditional leaders


                                                   1
(chiefs) on the other.1
       We start our analysis (in Section 2) adding empirical content and weaving together two
seemingly unrelated characteristics of the African landscape: the salience of ethnic identity and
the limited state capacity of African governments. In particular, using survey data from 18 − 20
Sub-Saharan African countries on ethnic identification and cross-country proxies of state capacity,
such as legal-court quality and tax capacity, we show that these two features are closely linked.
Motivated by this observation we lay out a framework where ethnic-specific norms, institutions,
and practices, interact with country-wide structures and state capacity in general.
       Specifically, in Section 3 we examine some salient features of ethnic structures, discussing
works in political science, anthropology, and economics on the functions of tribal leaders (chiefs)
and the importance of ethnic norms in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa. We supplement our
discussion with evidence on the contemporary role of chiefs using data from the Afrobarometer
Surveys (2005, 2008). The analysis reveals that tribal leaders play a crucial role in the allocation
of land rights and dispute resolution within communities.
       In Section 4 we turn our attention to a key ethnic trait that has been linked to African
development, the pre-colonial complexity (centralization) of political (and social) organization.
We start our analysis presenting anthropological maps illustrating the variability of political
structures in pre-colonial Africa, ranging from large centralized states, such as the Zulu empire,
to acephalous societies organized at the village level, such as the Nuer. We then discuss the
likely channels linking pre-colonial ethnic political centralization to contemporary development
through case studies.
       In Section 5 we discuss our recent research (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013b)) and
other related works showing with formal econometric techniques and novel georeferenced data
(satellite images of light density at night) the strong association between ethnic-specific pre-
colonial political centralization and contemporary regional development both across and within
countries. In line with narratives on the presence of a "dual" institutional-economic environment,
we show that ethnic institutions are particularly relevant in (mostly rural) areas further from
the capitals. In the latter it is the national institutional structures that influence economic
performance (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014)).
       In the last section we summarize the key lessons and discuss avenues of future research in
management science.

     In this regard our study contributes to recent works in management/marketing/strategy emphasizing the
institutional challenges that firms face in their attempt to function in areas exhibiting diﬀerent and coexisting
institutional frameworks, both in Africa and elsewhere (e.g., Kistruck, Sutter, Robert B. Lount, and Smith (2013),
Mair, Marti, and Ventresca (2012), Webb, Kistruck, Ireland, and David J. Ketchen (2010); Rivera-Santos, Rufín,
and Kolk (2012), Viswanathan, Rosa, and Ruth (2010), Sridharan and Viswanathan (2008)).

2       Ethnic Identification and State Capacity
In this Section we first present evidence on the salience of ethnic identity across 18 − 20 Sub-
Saharan African countries and the limited state capacity of the African states. We then show that
these two features are inter-linked, suggesting that if one is to explain the weak state capacity of
African states it is crucial taking into account ethnic-specific norms.

2.1     Ethnic Identification

        Data For our analysis we exploit data from the 3 and 4 rounds of the Afrobarometer
Surveys (2005, 2008) that cover 18 and 20 Sub-Saharan economies, respectively.2 Both rounds
were conducted in Benin, Botswana, Cape Verde, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe. The 4 round also covers Burkina Faso and Liberia.3 The Afrobarometer team
in each country implements nationally-representative interviews in a random sample of 1 200 or
2 400 individuals of voting age. The surveys record information on respondents’ education, living
conditions, access to public goods like a sewage system and electrification, beliefs (e.g., on the
merits of democracy, corruption perceptions), civic engagement, trust, and ethnic identification.


        Patterns In Figures 1 − 1 we tabulate people’s responses on whether they identify
more with their ethnicity or with their nation; the pie charts present the corresponding per-
centages. The question reads: "Let us suppose that you had to choose between being a [Ghana-
ian/Kenyan/etc.] and being a [respondent’s identity group]. Which of these two groups do you
feel most strongly attached to? " The structure of the question is particularly useful as it directly
compares national to ethnic identity. Figures 1 − 1 illustrate the importance of ethnic identity.
Across a sample of approximately 25 000 individuals in each round, only a third identify solely
with the nation, whereas a large fraction of the population (around 40% in the full sample) iden-
tifies both with their country and their ethnicity. Roughly 15% of the respondents identify either
exclusively or overwhelmingly with their ethnicity.
        Figure 2 reveals that there is considerable variation across countries on ethnic identifi-
cation (for brevity we report statistics only from the 4 round of the Afrobarometer Surveys).
Ethnic identification is the lowest in Tanzania, where chiefship was formally abolished in the
1960 and where nation-building policies were implemented in the 1970 and the 1980. Ethnic
identification is the highest (and national identification the lowest) in Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin,
    2
     Logan (2011) also explores the role of ethnic norms and the influence of ethnic leaders in Africa using data
from the Afrobarometer Surveys.

     In most graphs/figures we exclude Cape Verde since there are no traditional authorities and there were no
questions on the role of ethnicity.

           Figure 2 shows that national and ethnic identification coexist across most (though not all)
countries. This dual-identification appears in line with the dual authority and mixed governance
view of African states, where national and ethnic institutions and policies coexist, sometimes
in harmony and other times in conflict (Herbst (2000), Sklar (1993)). This pattern is also in
accord with Mahmood Mamdani’s (1966) observation that since decolonization, Africans have
been subject to both a modern legal system originating in the colonial state and a customary
one, rooted at the ethnic level and enforced by powerful chiefs. The dual identification of African
citizens may also be related to the "dual"economy paradigm of Arthur W. Lewis (1954), who
argued that underdeveloped countries are characterized by an "advanced" sector -usually associ-
ated with manufacturing and urbanization- and a "backward" sector -typically associated with

                                                                                                             4
communal property rights in agriculture (see also Migdal (1988)).
       As it will become apparent from our discussion and the evidence below, the salience of
ethnic identity reflects the far-reaching role of ethnic structures in shaping the social, economic
and political milieu of African citizens. For example, in several countries customary, rather than
national, law governs land rights with tribal leaders and local chiefs settling disputes and acting
as formal or ad-hoc arbitrators and judges. Moreover, ethnic leaders enjoy significant popular
support, are perceived as being less corrupt than government oﬃcials, and are more trusted than
members of the parliament, national courts, and police oﬃcers.


       Explanations Ethnic identification in Africa is driven by a variety of factors. First,
Sub-Saharan Africa is by far the most ethnically and linguistically diverse region of the world
with African ethnicities characterized by distinct cultural norms and economic traits (Alesina,
Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, and Wacziarg (2003)).4 According to the Alesina et al. (2003)
index, average (median) ethnic fragmentation in Africa is 063 (072), while the average (median)
in Asia is 042 (043), in Europe 027 (022), in South America 049 (057), and in North America
039 (042). Moreover, in Africa an ethnic group is often also a linguistic group, which fosters
interaction within group members and limits communication between groups. Additionally, due
to the low levels of financial development, risk sharing is facilitated within extended families,
clans, and tribal groups.
       Second, ethnic identity is magnified by income diﬀerences between ethnic groups. Robin-
son (2001) stresses the key role of ethnic inequality in creating conflict and spurring ethnic
identification across Africa), while Alesina, Michalopoulos, and Papaioannou (2012) show that
economic diﬀerences across ethnic lines are the highest in Africa compared to Europe, Asia, and
the Americas.5
       Third, national politics have a strong ethnic component, as parties are formed in many
countries across ethnic cleavages (e.g., Franck and Rainer (2012), Eifert, Miguel, and Posner
(2010)). Alesina, Michalopoulos, and Papaioannou (2014) further show that ethnic inequality
goes in tandem with political inequality, while Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013a) show that
ethnic-based discrimination and exclusion from power is also linked to a key historical ethnic trait,
ethnic partitioning.
   4
     A region’s ecology and its state history have been proposed as drivers of ethnic diversity. For example,
Michalopoulos (2012) shows how geographic diversity and proximity to the equator increase ethnic diversity via
the formation of location-specific human capital along heterogeneous land endowments, whereas Ahlerup and Olsson
(2012) show that ethnic diversity is lower in countries with a long history of statehood. Thus, the ecologically
diverse endowments across Africa coupled with its overall limited history of state formation may explain its current
high levels of ethnic diversity.
   5
     Alesina, Michalopoulos, and Papaioannou (2012) estimate that the average (median) ethnic Gini index for
African countries in 2009 is 054 (061), while in Asia the mean (median) is 045 (049), in Europe the mean
(median) is 027 (021), and in America the mean (median) is 037 (040).

       Fourth, in some instances colonization reinforced or even created -rather than attenuated-
ethnic identity, because Europeans collaborated with specific ethnic groups in their indirect rule
policy (Mamdani (1996); see Blouin (2013) for a nice case-study application of the role of Belgian
policies towards the Hutu and the Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi). Fifth, Nunn (2008) shows that
the slave trades -that preceded colonization- had significant long-run negative consequences on
development, mostly by creating animosity among ethnicities and leading to inter-ethnic conflict.
In line with this idea, Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) document a strong negative within-country
association between historical enslavement and proxies of social-civic capital.
       Finally, there are significant diﬀerences in pre-colonial institutional legacies across African
groups which translate into contemporary diﬀerences in regional economic performance both
across and within countries (Gennaioli and Rainer (2007), Michalopoulos and Papaioannou
(2013b)) whereas Michalopoulos, Putterman, and Weil (2014) show that individuals tracing an-
cestry to ethnicities that derived a larger share of subsistence from agriculture in the pre-colonial
times are more educated and prosperous today.


       A Caveat - Group Identity Outside Africa Anecdotal evidence suggests that ethnic
identification is not a feature unique to Africa, with populations in the Caucasus region, even
within some European countries (e.g., Basque country, Scotland, Flanders) harboring strong
local identities. In an attempt to shed some light on whether ethnic (as compared to national)
identification is higher across African countries, as compared to other parts of the world, we
pored through data from the Latinobarometer Surveys, which cover around 20 countries in Latin
America, the Life in Transition Surveys (LiTS) which cover around 35 countries in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, and the Asian Barometer Surveys that cover 11 Asian countries. Unfortunately,
it is only in the context of Africa that respondents are asked to rank their ethnic identity vis-à-vis
their national one. In the other surveys questions on identity are asked separately for the nation
and the group that usually regards religious (rather than ethnic) aﬃliation. For example, in
the Asian Barometer Surveys of 2004 and 2005 there are questions on the salience of national
identity vis-à-vis religious identity. The responses show that for all countries in South East Asia,
national identification is quite strong, with roughly 15% of the respondents ranking their religious
identity as more important than their national one. In Central Asia national identification is
relatively low and religious identity is important for a significant part of the population.6 Due
   6
     Here we report the percentage of respondents in each country that "think themselves as being part of their coun-
try’s people" and the percentage (in parenthesis) of people answering that "religion is more important than national-
ity". South Korea: 95.94% (2.81%), Japan 93.15% (2.67%), Myanmar 99.13% (41.25%), Philippines 99.5% (13.5%),
Thailand 99.5% (9.63%), Indonesia: 93.36% (28.85%), Vietnam 96.25% (not asked), Malaysia 93.34% (14%),
Singapore 80.40% (11.38%), Laos 97.63% (not asked), Brunei 92.57% (17.91%), Afghanistan: 98.38% (58.35%),
Bangladesh: not asked (33.13%), Bhutan: 97.75% (13.36%), India: 99.92 % (9.29%), Kazakhstan 46.99% (6.75%),
Kyrgyzstan 66.88% (20.50%), Maldives 100% (16.20%), Mongolia 94.99% (2.50%), Nepal: 99.13% (20.50%), Pak-

to the non-comparable nature of the datasets between continents we cannot provide meaningful
counterfactuals. Nevertheless, this pattern suggests that in countries in Asia religious identity
may be the relevant cleavage for understanding group identity.

2.2    State Capacity

In recent years works on political economy and comparative development have focused on the role
of state capacity. Building on insights from Tilly (1985) and Migdal (1988), among others (see
Hintze (1970) for an early contribution), Acemoglu (2005) and Besley and Persson (2011) study
the origins and implications of the inability of many governments to enforce contracts, safeguard
private property, and collect taxes.7 Legal and fiscal capacity as well as state fragility are linked
to historical factors related to civil and international conflict. African national governments
have been weakened considerably by long-lasting civil wars and ethnic violence that tend to be
driven by the legacy of Africa’s slave trades and the artificial drawing of national borders during
the "Scramble for Africa" in the late 19th century. The latter led to the partitioning of several
groups into diﬀerent countries and forced heterogeneous populations to share state resources. The
arbitrariness of modern-day African borders has crucially contributed to the weakness of national
governments, fomenting civil conflict, ethnic hatred, and violence (see Asiwaju (1985), Alesina,
Easterly, and Matuszeski (2011), Englebert, Tarango, and Carter (2002), and Michalopoulos and
Papaioannou (2013a)).
       Herbst (2000) argues that due to the challenging geography (deserts and rainforests) and
the limited colonial investments, national governments in Africa find it extremely diﬃcult to
broadcast power beyond the capitals in peripheral regions. According to Mamdani (1996) the
limited penetration of the nation-state is also related to the legacy of Europe’s indirect rule during
the colonial times, under which the colonial power was exerted inland via local chiefs and a very
small number of European administrators (see Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson (2014) for a nice
case study of Sierra Leone). In line with this conjecture, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014)
show that diﬀerences in the quality of national institutions across split-by-the-border ethnic
homelands do not map on average into diﬀerences in economic performance (captured by images
of satellite light density). Nevertheless, focusing on ethnic homelands close to the capital cities
the association between national institutions and development becomes positive and significant.
Moreover, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014) show that law enforcement (for crimes and tax
evasion) and national (as opposed to ethnic) identification decays in areas far from the capital,
istan 96.34% (76.80%), Sri Lanka 95.19% (16.24%), Tajikistan 82.38% (23.50%), Turkmenistan 93.13% (7.38%),
Uzbekistan 59.75% (23.88%).
    7
      See also Aghion, Persson, and Rouzet (2012), and Gennaioli and Voth (2011), among others. In an early
contribution, Johnson, Kaufmann, and Shleifer (1997) stressed the importance of state capacity for the development
path of transition countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in the 1990s.

further illustrating the limited penetration of the state outside the capital centers.
       Figure 3 plots the cross-country average of two (related) measures capturing state fragility
in 2011 across continents, using data from the Center for Systemic Peace (Marshall and Cole
(2011)). The blue bars plot the average of a 0 − 25 composite index (state fragility index )
that captures the eﬀectiveness and legitimacy of the government to provide security and protect
its citizens from internal conflict, the openness and inclusiveness of political institutions, and
the government’s ability in tackling poverty and infant mortality and promoting development
(higher scores indicate more fragile countries). In grey bars we exclude the economic sub-index
(alternative state fragility index ), so as to concentrate on the security and the legitimacy of the
national government. In spite of the recent democratization wave and the decline of conflict,
Africa is still the continent with the highest state fragility. A similar picture emerges when we
look at other proxies of state weakness, such as civil wars, violence against the civilian population,
secessions, etc. (results not shown).
       Figure 3 shows our tabulation of the continental averages of two widely-used proxies of
state-level fiscal capacity. Following the burgeoning literature on state capacity (see Besley and
Persson (2011)), we proxy fiscal capacity using the share of income taxes as a fraction of GDP
(in the 1990) and the share of total taxes as a fraction of GDP (in the 1990); the underlying
idea is that strong states are capable of taxing wealth (mostly via direct taxation) so as to
provide basic public goods, such as security, policing, etc. In contrast, weak states are incapable
of collecting taxes relying heavily on tariﬀs and import duties (as compared to personal income
taxation). Fiscal capacity is considerably lower in Africa (and Asia) as compared to the Europe
and Oceania.8
       Figure 3 illustrates one of the key insights of the recent literature on state capacity; the
complementarity between fiscal capacity (as reflected on the share of income taxes to GDP)
and legal capacity, as reflected in a composite index of government anti-diversion policies that
measures law and order, bureaucratic quality, corruption, risk of expropriation and risk of gov-
ernment repudiation of contracts.9 [African states are abbreviated with large, bold fonts.] With
the exception of Botswana, South Africa, and to a lesser extent Namibia, all African countries
score very low on both fiscal and legal capacity. In absence of an eﬃcient tax collection adminis-
tration, African states depend mainly on tariﬀ revenues and royalties from oil, diamond and gold
mines, and other natural resources (this is also a more general pattern that applies to non-African
countries rich in natural resources). Property rights and legal institutions are similarly weak, as
   8
     The low percentages in the Americas are mostly driven by the Central and Latin American countries.
   9
     The results are similar if we use alternative proxy measures of fiscal capacity (such as total taxes as a share of
GDP) or legal capacity (reflecting, for example, court eﬃciency or the formalism of the legal system). Acemoglu et
al. (2001, 2002) use the ICRG government anti-diversion index to measure the quality of national property rights
institutions.

in many cases the government cannot enforce national legislation, while in other instances the
government itself has expropriated land and confiscated private property.

2.3                                The Salience of Ethnic Identity in Weak States

Figures 4 −  show how legal capacity and the salience of ethnicity are related. The figures plot
an institutional capacity index that reflects government’s anti-diversion policies (in the vertical
axis) against the average value of a self-identification index that ranges from 1 to 5 with lower
values indicating stronger ethnic (as opposed to national) identification and higher values marking
stronger national (as opposed to ethnic) identification, using data from the 3 and the 4
round of the Afrobarometer Surveys, respectively. There is a positive association between the
individuals’ self-identification with the nation and state capacity in safeguarding property rights.

                                                     In Figures 5 −  we examine the association between the percentage of individuals in each
country that identify either solely or mostly with their ethnic group and an index measuring the
formalism and ineﬃciencies of that country’s legal system; the legal formalism index comes from
the World Bank’s Doing Business project. It measures the log number of business days it takes to
collect an unpaid debt contract that equals 200% of per capita GDP via courts (see Djankov, La
Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2003)). There is a significant positive association between
identifying with ethnicity and this proxy of legal capacity.10 While it is hard to pin down the
direction of causality, the pattern suggests that ethnic identification (and reliance on ethnic -
rather than national- characteristics) acts as a substitute for a weakly-institutionalized state.

3        Chiefs
Given the salience of ethnicity and the weak capabilities of many African states shown above, it
is tempting to investigate the common factors that give rise to these phenomena. In this section
we discuss a somewhat neglected aspect of African politics that is related both to the dominant
role of the ethnicity and the limited state capacity, namely the role of traditional leaders (chiefs).
First, using case studies we discuss the key responsibilities that ethnic leaders have in various
parts of Africa. Second, we present evidence from the Afrobarometer Surveys illustrating the
importance of traditional leaders in regulating various aspects of the economy and the polity.

3.1      Case-Study Evidence

The role and functions of traditional leaders are multi-dimensional and quite heterogeneous across
the continent.


         Customary Law and Property Rights First, a plethora of evidence points to the
importance of local ethnic authorities in allocating land rights, mostly in rural communities
that are quite often subject to customary law. This is not surprising since at independence
many countries maintained a "dual" legal system. Under this system, first established by the
colonizers, customary law applied to African aﬀairs and European law applied to the transactions
of the settlers, mostly in the capitals and the main ports (Mamdani (1996)).
         While upon decolonization some countries attempted to integrate the legal systems of
the urban hubs and the countryside, the legal order in many countries explicitly recognized
customary rules. For example, Mamdani (1996) observes that at independence in Senegal "78
oﬃcially recognized customs, chosen from 33 diﬀerent ethnic groups, were applicable in courts."
In Ghana, the 1979 Constitution gave traditional leaders explicit power over land in the north of
the country. Similarly, in South Africa the 1994 Ingonyama Trust Act put one-third of the land
in the province of KwaZulu-Natal under the trusteeship of the Zulu king and subsequently the
1996 Constitution formally recognized chiefs’ role in settling land disputes. Likewise, in Zambia
the 1995 Land Act recognized chiefs’ roles in land administration. Herbst (2000) documents that
14 out of 39 Sub-Saharan countries have passed legislation or constitutional amendments (in the
case of Uganda and Ghana) formally recognizing the role of ethnic institutional structures in
settling property rights disputes and enforcing customary law.11 Baldwin (2014) discusses the
case of Mozambique, where the role of local chiefs (régulos) was oﬃcially recognized in 1994. Even
in countries where the Constitution or national legislation do not oﬃcially accept customary law,
    11
   These countries are: Botswana, Ghana, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,
Swaziland, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.



                                                     11
ethnic leaders have considerable de facto power in allocating land. For example, Herbst (2000)
writes that in "the Democratic Republic of Congo 97% of all land is governed by community
tenure (and) reforms aimed at over-turning local practices have been defeated". Similarly for
Gabon, Herbst (2000) notes that "traditional practices still govern the majority of land."
       In his systematic exploration of property rights institutions and development across the
Ivory Coast-Ghana border, Bubb (2013) documents that while the two countries have quite
distinct formal (de jure) institutions governing land rights (with Ghana, unlike Ivory Coast, ex-
plicitly recognizing customary law), there are no diﬀerences in the actual enforcement of property
rights. Using a regression discontinuity approach that identifies the eﬀect of national institutions
at the border Bubb (2013) shows that households on either side of the border enjoy similar land
rights. These are subject to local customary law (dating to the pre-colonial states of the Ashanti
and the Akan) and the power of local chiefs on either side of the border. According to Ashanti
customary law, for example, land rights are not individualistic but are vested in the commu-
nity with local chiefs acting as the arbitrators and the custodians. (Bubb (2013) reproduces an
Ashanti adage saying that "the farm is my property, the land is the chief’s.") This result is in
line with the evidence of Goldstein and Udry (2008) who show that local chiefs and clans exert
significant de facto power in assigning land in rural Ghana (see also Besley (1995) and Kutsoati
and Morck (2012)).


       Political Power and Ethnic Voting Second, in many countries tribal leaders have con-
siderable political influence on local and national politics (see Posner (2005) for an overview).12
Focusing on Sierra Leone, Acemoglu, Reed, and Robinson (2014) and Acemoglu, Chaves, Osafo-
Kwaako, and Robinson (2014) describe how local chiefs cooperated with the British and sub-
sequently with the national government in a "quid pro quo" regime where traditional leaders
provided votes and support for national policies in exchange for legitimacy, strengthening their
role, and other perks. Casey (2012) documents the strong correlation between ethnic origin and
voting in Sierra Leone. She notes that the Temne-based All Peoples’ Congress party won 36 of
the 39 seats in the Temne dominated Northern provinces, while the Mende-linked parties (the
Sierra Leone Peoples’ Party and the Peoples’ Movement for Democratic Change) won all but
one seats in the Mende-dominated Southern provinces (see also Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel
(2013)).
       Focusing on Zambia, Posner (2005) provides evidence that ethnic identity rather than
political ideology permeates national politics. Baldwin (2013) documents that in Zambia local
chiefs exchange their influence on the local community with the national government during
  12
    Many African national leaders, such as Nelson Mandela, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, and Julius Nyerere come from
families of chiefs and old kings.

parliamentary elections in return for public goods provision. Interestingly, she shows that voters,
acting in a sophisticated way, tend to follow the chiefs, when they perceive them as collaborating
with politicians in getting public funds channelled to their district.
       Turning to Eastern Africa, Long (2012) demonstrates the strong ethnic roots of voting
in Kenya. Conducting a nation-wide household survey close to the 2007 presidential elections
Long finds that Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, received close to 95% percent of the votes of his fellow
Kikuyus, while Raila Odinga, Luo, got almost all (99%) of Luo votes, and Kalonzo Musyoka was

Rainer (2012) show that national leaders have significantly increased primary school attendance
and reduced infant mortality within their ethnic group. Similarly, using sub-national data from
the countries covered in the Afrobarometer Surveys, Baldwin (2014) shows that national leaders
usually cede control to local chiefs from other ethnic groups in an attempt to form political
coalitions.


       Other (Public Goods, Taxation) Third, besides their role in allocating property rights
and influencing local and national politics, ethnic leaders perform a variety of other functions,
such as collecting taxes and providing local public goods. To some extent, this stems from the
colonial legacy of indirect rule, under which local government oﬃcial and ethnic leaders collected
taxes and provided security (Mamdani (1996)). For example, in Sierra Leone local chiefs collect
taxes, fees, and royalties from diamond mines (Glennerster, Miguel, and Rothenberg (2013)).
Similarly, Mamdani (1996) argues that in spite of the land nationalization legislation in 1973 in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, local chiefs still collect levies and usage fees from land. Moreover,
Englebert (2002) shows that in contemporary Uganda, ethnic Buganda chiefs collaborate with
the local government oﬃcials in various administrative duties.

3.2    Evidence from the Afrobarometer Surveys

Data from the 4 round of the Afrobarometer Surveys, which include an array of questions on
the role of traditional leaders/authorities, provide an updated portrait of the role of ethnic leaders
and local institutions across African countries.


       Influence of Ethnic Leaders in Governing the Local Community Figure 6 re-
ports the distribution of respondent’s views on the actual influence of ethnic leaders. The question
  13
    This of course is not to say that ethnicity is the only determinant of voting behavior across African countries.
For example, focusing on Ghana, Long and Hoﬀman (forthcoming) find little evidence of ethnic-based voting,
whereas Casey (2012) shows that information about a candidate’s quality mitigates the role of ethnic aﬃliation on
voting in Sierra Leone.

nity? ". Only a fifth of respondents reply that traditional leaders have absolutely no influence
in local governance. More than half of respondents believe that traditional leaders exert either
a great deal (28%) or a considerable deal (26%) in governing the local community, while the
remaining 25% reply that ethnic leaders play only a small role. As with ethnic identification,
there is variation across countries, with ethnic leaders’ role being the strongest in Malawi and
Zimbabwe and the weakest in Tanzania and Madagascar (Figure 6). Another interesting feature
that emerges from Figure 6, where besides country means we also plot the standard deviations,
is that there is heterogeneity even within countries, suggesting that ethnic-specific features may
be important drivers of traditional leadership’s influence.
           One may wonder whether the significant influence of traditional leaders today masks their
declining importance or their disapproval from the people. Figures 7 − 7 reveal that this is
not the case. First, according to Figure 7 more than 40% of respondents reply that they want
the influence of traditional leaders to increase considerably; and approximately 25% reply that
they want their influence to increase somewhat; whereas only 10% of respondents want the role of
tribal leaders to decrease. Second, even in countries where traditional leaders exert relatively small
influence (as in Madagascar, Senegal, and Tanzania) the majority of individuals reply that they
want their role to increase (Figure 7). Third, an interesting case appears to be Zimbabwe where
the role of tribal leaders is quite strong and at the same time people reply that they want their
role to increase further. Most likely, this pattern reflects the chaotic environment (hyperinflation,
conflict, crime) that followed the confiscation of white-owned farmlands in 2007 − 2009; if this
is indeed the case, it suggests that when national policies fail people tend to fall back on local
ethnic-specific institutional structures.

           Figures 8 − 8 provide some insight on the underlying reasons behind the influence and
popularity of traditional leaders. Figure 8 plots the average (across all respondents) of a cor-
ruption perception index that reflects individuals’ beliefs on the pervasiveness of graft among
various types of oﬃcials. The index ranges from zero to three with higher values indicating that
the majority of members of the parliament, government oﬃcials, elected local assembly members,
and traditional leaders is perceived being corrupt. People perceive traditional leaders as being
significantly less corrupt than government oﬃcials and elected members of the national or the
local assembly. This pattern applies to all countries except Malawi and is especially strong in
Uganda, Mali, and Senegal (results not shown).
           A similar picture emerges when we compare the respondents’ answers to a question cap-
turing the responsiveness to peoples’ needs of government oﬃcials, members of parliament and
traditional leaders. The question reads: "How much of the time do you think the following try
their best to listen to what people like you have to say? " The index ranges again from 0 to 3
with higher values indicating a higher degree of responsiveness. Figure 8 shows that individuals
reply that traditional leaders try much harder to listen to what people say compared to elected
oﬃcials in the national parliament or in local assemblies. Importantly, this pattern applies to
each country separately (results not shown).
           In Figure 8 we examine people’s trust towards tribal leaders and compare it with trust
towards members of the parliament and elected local assembly councilors. The trust index ranges
from 0 to 3 with higher values indicating more trust. The average value for trust towards
traditional leaders is close to 2, while the mean values for the national parliament and the local
assemblies is half a standard deviation lower (17 and 16). Trust towards traditional leaders is

                                          Chiefs’ Responsibilities But what exactly traditional leaders do? Is their power solely
derived from tradition or do they actually perform specific duties? In the case studies reviewed
above we described some of the tasks that traditional authorities undertake. Here we rely on
survey responses to obtain direct evidence on the type of duties performed. In particular, we
examine respondents’ answers on who has primary responsibility for providing basic public goods
and some key government tasks, such as keeping the community clean, managing schools and
health clinics, solving local disputes, allocating land, maintaining law and order, and protecting
rivers and forests.

the central and the local government across eight diﬀerent functions. Traditional leaders are
minimally involved in providing education, as well as health and sanitation, and have rather
limited roles in policing (coined as "law and order" in the surveys), since the latter is the primary
responsibility of the central government.

              Ethnic leaders, however, have considerable power in solving local disputes (Figure 10)
and assigning property-land rights (Figure 10). Thus, in line with the case studies and the
anecdotal evidence presented in the previous section, tribal leaders exert significant influence on
local economic activity, since they are prominent both in allocating land rights within the local
community and providing judicial services. In the terminology of North (1981) it seems that in
Sub-Saharan Africa ethnicity is instrumental in assigning and securing both property rights and
contractual institutions.14

    According to North (1981) "property rights institutions" protect citizens against expropriations from the gov-
ernment or powerful elites (that stem from a "predatory theory of the state"), while "contractual institutions"
provide the legal (contractual and judicial) framework to facilitate economic transactions between individuals.


                                                                                                           17
            Given the primary role that the economics literature places on property rights and legal
institutions (e.g., Acemoglu and Johnson (2005)) we further examined these two key responsi-
bilities of traditional leaders. Figures 11 and 11 report the role of ethnic leaders in settling
local disputes and allocating land rights by country. There is sizable heterogeneity. At the one
extreme, in Malawi, Lesotho, Ghana, and Zimbabwe, the role of tribal leaders is fundamental and
pervasive. This should not come as a surprise as in some of these countries customary courts and
tribal leaders’ role in solving local disputes is explicitly recognized by the state. Local chiefs also
have considerable power in settling disputes and allocating land in Uganda, Mali, and Zambia.
At the other extreme, in Tanzania, Madagascar, Benin and South Africa the role of ethnic leaders
is small (though their popularity and influence is high).

            Summary Using both case-studies and survey-based evidence this section illustrated the
vibrant role of traditional leaders in the governance of local communities across Africa. Chiefs,
however, do not operate in vacuum, but are embedded in ethnic-specific institutional frameworks.
In the next sections we explore the institutional variation across ethnicities and investigate how
these diﬀerent legacies map into comparative economic development within and across African
countries.


4         The Legacy of Pre-colonial Ethnic Institutions
This section sheds light on the importance and persistence of pre-colonial ethnic institutions. We
start (in Section 41) by laying out the literature narrative that weaves political centralization to
economic development and briefly review case studies pointing to the role of pre-colonial ethnic
organization and political institutions. We then (in Section 42) portray political centralization
at the time of European colonization and (in Section 43) trace the role of ethnic institutions

                                                                                              18
both during and after the colonial period. In Section 44 we discuss the channels via which
ethnic-specific political institutions and traditional leaders determine development.

4.1    Political Centralization in the Context of Comparative Development

An influential conjecture in political economy regarding the roots of contemporary diﬀerences in
economic performance holds that political centralization has played a fundamental role through-
out human history. While there is a debate on whether development is mostly an outcome of
geography (Diamond (1997)), culture (Landes (1998)), or institutions (Acemoglu and Robinson
(2012)), most scholars tend to agree that politically centralized societies have been better po-
sitioned to provide a relatively secure environment for growth. Diamond (1997), for example,
describes in detail how societies organized in large chiefdoms or complex states, had developed
bureaucracies providing security, some form of property rights protection, and other basic pub-
lic goods. Large chiefdoms and organized states tended to have centralized conflict resolution
mechanisms with a monopoly in violence oﬀering individuals access to a formal legal framework.
Moreover, politically centralized groups developed tax and redistribution systems whose proceeds
were used to finance wars and provide security (see Tilly (1985)).
       Recently the economics literature has formalized these ideas and quantified the role of
statehood in shaping economic and institutional progress (see Besley and Persson (2011) for a
text-book treatment). Employing cross-country data, Bockstette, Chanda, and Putterman (2002)
and Putterman and Weil (2010) show that contemporary development is positively correlated
with a state antiquity index (constructed by measuring the years since 1 that a region had
some form of statehood). Africa’s contemporary under-development (vis-à-vis Europe, Asia, and
the Americas) has been linked to its relatively low levels of pre-colonial political centralization
(Goody (1971)). In line with this idea available anthropological evidence shows a lower prevalence
of politically centralized societies in Africa compared to Asia and Europe. And clearly Africa
scores the lowest in Bockstette, Chanda, and Putterman (2002) state antiquity index. Herbst
(2000) synthesizes a vast literature in African historiography and political economy stressing that
Africa did not develop many large organized states, mostly because population densities in pre-
industrial African societies were lower compared to Europe.15 Partially as a result of relatively
low pre-industrial population densities, inter-state conflict in Africa was low, compared to that in
Europe or Asia, further impeding the strengthening and creation of empires and kingdoms (see
Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014)).
  15
     Fenske (2013) provides empirical evidence supportive to the "land abundance" view of African political in-
stitutions. Yet Osafo-Kwaako and Robinson (2013) show that the correlation between population density (or
agricultural intensity) and political centralization in Africa is weak, while in Eurasia and the Americas the correla-
tion is strong. Alsan (2014) documents that endemic infectious diseases caused by the tsetse fly have contributed
to the low degree of political centralization and urbanization in Africa.


                                                         19
       The Argument through the Tale of Two Countries The fundamental role of
pre-colonial institutional endowments in shaping post-independence growth trajectories across
African countries may be exemplified by contrasting the success story of Botswana to the disas-
trous case of Sierra Leone.16
       Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2003) and Robinson and Parsons (2006), among others,
attribute part of Botswana’s success in securing property rights and providing a stable environ-
ment for economic activity to the inclusiveness of its pre-colonial institutions stemming from the
strong state of the Tswana. Building on works by Schapera (1967, 1970) they note that Tswana
chiefs were accountable to the local community both via local and inter-clan assemblies (kgotlas).
In kgotlas, key issues were debated, and all adult males could participate and contribute to the
arguments. Moreover, the Tswana king, while very powerful, was subject to checks and balances
by senior chiefs, who in turn cooperated with local administrators and various advisory bodies.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Botswana’s relative post-independence success seems to be partly driven
by the perceived legitimacy of the Botswana Development Party’s government, which was seen as
a continuation of the Tswana rule, based on pre-colonial chiefs, customs, and ethnic institutions
(see also Hjort (2010)).
       Turning now to a disaster case, Chaves and Robinson (2011) and Acemoglu, Chaves, Osafo-
Kwaako, and Robinson (2014) argue that a part of Sierra Leone’s post-independence devastating
performance can be traced to the lack of large and politically complex kingdoms before coloniza-
tion. Their narrative suggests that the absence of a centralized bureaucracy allowed the British
to implement extractive policies using self-appointed paramount chiefs that were not accountable
to the local community. Even after the British left local chiefs remained powerful as they became
the main instrument for patronage politics. Traditional rulers continue to dominate politics in
Sierra Leone by providing votes to the incumbent national party in exchange for safeguarding
their legitimacy and role in local politics.


       Early Case Studies Diﬀerent legacies of pre-colonial political institutions have also been
linked to comparative development within African states. In an important early contribution
Douglas (1962) compares economic performance in the neighboring ethnicities of the Lele and
the Bushong that are separated by the Kasaai River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She
  16
     Sierra Leone and Botswana diﬀer in many dimensions not just in the degree of pre-colonial political central-
ization. For example, the Alesina et al. (2003) index of ethnic fractionalization in Sierra Leone is 082, while for
Botswana it is 041. Yet the ethnic polarization index of Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) (a strong correlate
of conflict) is similar in the two countries (014), whereas the fraction of the population of European descent is
minimal in both countries. The location of these two countries is also diﬀerent. Botswana is a landlocked country
in Southern Africa, while Sierra Leone is on the coast of West Africa. This relative proximity to Europe and the
Americas caused Sierra Leone to suﬀer disproportionately from slave trades (see Nunn and Puga (2012) for the
diﬀerential eﬀect of unfavorable geography in Africa and elsewhere and the role of the slave trades).



                                                        20
argues that the significant diﬀerences in well-being between the two ethnicities are driven by the
diﬀerent economic institutions that govern their exchange, production, and work ethos. Vansina
(1978) also studies production, commerce, and the societal structure of the Kuba (Bushong)
kingdom and compares it to that of nearby groups. He stresses the key role of the king and that
of hereditary chiefs in providing security (via taxing) that sustained trade and commerce. The
diﬀerences in development between the Kuba and neighboring groups seem to originate in the
beginning of the 17 century when the Kuba king Shyaam laid the foundations of a strong state
with several layers of governance by chiefs that were appointed by the king but also elected from
local assemblies. Steadily a tax system and a formal legal institution emerged (see Acemoglu and
Robinson (2012)).

4.2   Political Centralization in Pre-colonial Africa

Accompanying the relatively low degree of political complexity in Africa, there was significant
heterogeneity in the forms of political organization across groups at the time of colonization.




                                    Figure 12 : Pre-colonial
                                  Centralization across Groups

      In an early study of African societies, Fortes and Evans-Pritchard (1940) categorize eth-
nic groups into two broad political systems. "One group consists of those societies which have
centralized authority, administrative machinery, and judicial institutions-in short, a government-
and in which cleavages of wealth, privilege, and status correspond to the distribution of power
and authority. This group comprises the Zulu, the Ngwato, the Bemba, the Banyankole, and the
Kede. The other group consists of those societies which lack centralized authority, administrative
machinery, and judicial institutions-in short which lack government-and in which there are no
sharp divisions of rank, status, or wealth. This group comprises the Logoli, the Tallensi, and the


                                                21
Nuer." On that classification Diamond (1997) adds an intermediate case of groups organized as
chiefdoms or loose alliances where some state features were present.
      George Peter Murdock (1967) assembled a comprehensive dataset on the cultural, political,
and economic features of a large cross-section of ethnic groups around the world. Using a variety
of sources, Murdock (1967) attempted to document the societal features of groups in Africa (and
the New World), prior to contact with Europeans. The fruits of this major eﬀort are recorded
in an Ethnographic Atlas (published in twenty-nine installments in the anthropological journal
Ethnology) reflecting cultural, geographical, and economic characteristics of 1 270 ethnicities.
      Figure 12 maps Murdock’s (1967) "Jurisdictional Hierarchy beyond the Local Community
Level" index across African homelands using the spatial distribution of ethnicities from his earlier
work (Murdock (1959)). This proxy of political centralization describes the number of political
jurisdictions above the local (usually village) level for each group. A zero score indicates stateless
societies “lacking any form of centralized political organization”. A score of 1 indicates small
chiefdoms. A score of 2 designates paramount (large) chiefdoms; and 3 and 4 indicate groups
that were part of large states.
      He classifies as "centralized" the dominant ethnic groups of the major pre-colonial African
states. For example, the Ankale, the Banyoro and the Buganda, which were the central groups
in the kingdoms of Eastern Africa, get a score of 3. The same applies to other ethnicities that
were part of large empires, such as the Zulu and the Swazi in what is today South Africa, the
Yoruba in Nigeria, and the Shongai in Mali. Murdock’s classification seems appropriate for
stateless societies as well. The jurisdictional hierarchy index equals zero or one for the Amba, the
Konkomba, the Tiv, the Dinka, and the Lugbara, in line with case-study evidence that identifies
them as acephalous (fragmented) societies without any degree of political centralization. He
assigns an intermediate level of political centralization (paramount chiefdoms and small states),
to groups like the Ashanti that were part of a loose confederation, as well as the Kuba in Congo,
the Bemba in Zambia, and the Egba in Nigeria that all had some centralized authority.

4.3   Institutional Persistence

But are these deeply rooted ethnic political institutions still relevant? Ethnic institutions have
endured mainly for three reasons. First, in the majority of cases Europeans did not alter pre-
existing local political (and social) structures, as colonization was (with some exceptions) quite
limited both regarding timing and location. European settlements in Africa were confined in the
capitals and power was mostly broadcast by a small number of local administrators. With the
exception of South Africa, when the initial colonial settlements took place in the 18 century,
colonization in the coastal regions of Western Africa started around 1860−1870 and then spread to



                                                 22
Central and Eastern Africa. The drawing of colonial boundaries that partitioned the continent
into spheres of influence, protectorates, and colonies was completed by the turn of the 20
century. The colonial era oﬃcially ended with the wave of African independence in the early
1960s, but the influence of Europeans had already started weakening after the Second World
War.
       Second, as Mamdani (1996) eloquently argues, in several occasions Europeans strengthened
the role of tribal chiefs and kings via their doctrine of indirect rule. While European strategies
towards the local population and the policies of indirect rule diﬀered across (but also within) col-
onizing powers, to some extent colonial administrators relied on local administrators. Examples
include the system of chiefship in Sierra Leone, and the introduction of warrant chiefs in the Igbo
regions in Southern Nigeria, a group lacking political centralization. Both were established by
the British during the colonial era and remain largely in place today. Similarly, Davidson (1992)
and others present case studies where colonizers reinforced ethnic identities by tailoring indirect
rule along ethnic lines.17
       Third, the African governments upon independence found it extremely diﬃcult to eﬀec-
tively govern rural areas beyond the capitals and a handful of large urban centers. This was
due to the limited infrastructure passed on by the European colonizers and the artificial border
design. As a result, Africans, especially those residing in the periphery, continued relying upon
ethnic-specific structures rather than the national government (Englebert (2009)). For example,
Herbst (2000) notes that in Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria and Chad, while the first
post-independence national governments tried to marginalize traditional leaders, the national
authorities soon realized the extraordinary diﬃculties in administering rural areas and formed
alliances with local tribal chiefs.

4.4    Channels

The African historiography has proposed various mechanisms via which ethnic institutional struc-
tures shape contemporary economic activity. First, many argue that in centralized societies
there is a relatively higher degree of accountability of local chiefs, as compared to stateless eth-
nic groups or societies organized in small chiefdoms (Herbst (2000), Boone (2003)). In large
chiefdoms and organized states there were many bureaucratic layers, and as such local leaders
were monitored by superior chiefs and in some cases hereditary monarchs (kings and emperors).
  17
     The most illustrative example comes from the German and mostly Belgian policies in Rwanda and Burundi.
Initially colonizers strengthened the role of Tutsi chiefs, who were ruling the pre-colonial states of Burundi and
Rwanda, by (a) institutionalizing Tutsi supremacy, (b) extending their authority even in areas where Hutu chiefs
were ruling, (c) removing local petty chiefs and extending the power of (approximately 65) paramount chiefs
(Reyntjens (1987)), and (d ) impeding access of most Hutus to the limited public goods (Nkurunziza and Ngaruko
(2008)). Moreover, in 1933 − 1935 the Belgian administrators issued identity cards labelling locals as either Tutsi,
Hutu, Twa or naturalized; this turned out to have disastrous consequences during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.


                                                        23
Moreover, many centralized ethnic groups had local assemblies where key policy issues were de-
liberated. In many instances these structures endured the colonial era and post-independence
nation-building process. For example, Englebert (2002) describes how the old-kingdom of the
(Bu)ganda reemerged after the 1993 Constitutional amendment in Uganda which explicitly recog-
nized traditional authorities. The Buganda kingdom has its own administrative apparatus with
the kabaka (king) as its supreme leader, local chiefs (saza) ruling the eighteen traditional counties
(amasaza), and sub-ordinate chiefs responsible for smaller administrative units. The Buganda
have also their own envoys in countries with large Ganda communities, such as in the United
Kingdom and Sweden. Likewise, Mamdani (1996) discusses the high degree of accountability of
the Zulu king and the superior chiefs at the time of colonization, describing the quite elaborate
checks and balances in the organization of the other Southern African centralized ethnicities,
such as the Swazi and the Tswana.
      Second, in centralized ethnicities there was access to some formal legal resolution mech-
anism and some form of property rights steadily emerged (Herbst (2000)). Schapera (1970)
presents evidence that the Tswana had elaborate legal rules, courts and detailed procedures for
conflict resolution. Importantly, even chiefs were subject to the law. The limited presence of
the British colonizers in Bechuanaland helped the endurance of these courts and the culture of
the rule of law that are present nowadays. Similarly, Hjort (2010) notes that Botswana courts
have ruled for the (minority) Bushmen San people, against the government’s decision to evict
them from their (diamond rich) historical homeland. Baldwin (2013) shows that across Zambian
regions there is a strong positive correlation between political centralization and the power of tra-
ditional leaders in administrating land. In line with this, Fenske (2013) presents cross-sectional
estimates from the Standard Cross Cultural Sample that covers 186 ethnicities around the world
showing that centralized groups are more likely to have a judiciary system, police, as well as a
formal administrative bureaucracy.
      Third, Schapera (1967) and others have argued that centralized societies benefited dispro-
portionately from the presence of the colonizers. For example, in Eastern Africa British authori-
ties collaborated with the king of the Buganda in order to split the kingdom’s land that was under
communal customary law between colonizers and local chiefs (Englebert (2002)). Moreover, in
some cases Europeans settled and invested in the homelands of the more politically advanced
groups magnifying any pre-existing diﬀerences in well-beings across ethnicities (e.g., Huillery
(2009), Huillery (2011), Arbesu (2011), and Jedwab and Moradi (2012)).
      Fourth, tribal societies with strong political institutions have been more successful in ob-
taining concessions both from colonial powers and from national governments after independence.
For example, Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) describe how the Tswana leaders travelled from



                                                 24
Bechuanaland to England and convinced the British government to allow for a greater degree of
autonomy. The success of the Tswana leaders was driven to a great extent by the legitimacy of
their institutional reach.


5     Empirical Evidence
In this Section we report on recent econometric studies that employ regression techniques to
explore the role of pre-colonial ethnic political institutions on comparative development. We
start our analysis by illustrating the cross-country data patterns. We then discuss the empirical
findings of Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013b) linking pre-colonial political centralization
to contemporary development, as captured by satellite images of light density at night across
ethnic homelands.

5.1   Cross-Country Evidence

Gennaioli and Rainer (2007) use Murdock’s jurisdictional hierarchy index to construct cross-
country measures capturing the degree of pre-colonial political centralization. They distinguish
between "fragmented" societies, being either stateless or organized as petty chiefdoms and "cen-
tralized" ones, defined as those organized in paramount chiefdoms or states. Then, they estimate
for each country the percentage of the population that comes from politically centralized groups
(i.e., where the jurisdictional hierarchy index is 2, 3 or 4). Their analysis shows that countries
historically lacking strong pre-colonial political centralization, such as Liberia and Sierra Leone,
have lower immunization rates, lower educational attainment, and higher infant mortality rates
compared to countries historically populated by politically centralized ethnic groups, such as
Lesotho, Swaziland, and Rwanda. Gennaioli and Rainer (2006) further show that countries orig-
inating from ethnic groups with centralized pre-colonial political institutions tend to score higher
in proxies of national institutional quality (such as property rights protection and a composite
rule of law index) as compared to countries that lacked strong states at the time of colonization.
Both results are robust to various country-level controls even when the authors condition on the
log of per capita income during independence (to account for the level of development at the end
of colonization).
      Figures 13 −  illustrate the cross-country association between the average political cen-
tralization before colonization and contemporary economic and institutional development. Using
Murdock’s data on the jurisdictional hierarchy index we construct a population weighted coun-
try index of the complexity of pre-colonial political institutions and then associate this index
with the log of per capita GDP in 2000 (from the Penn World Tables) and a composite index

mann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2005)). Figure 13 reveals a weak positive association between
pre-colonial political centralization and economic development. Alsan (2014) shows that this
correlation is strengthened once one accounts for colonizer and legal origin eﬀects; moreover, she
shows that the positive association between pre-colonial political centralization and log per capita
GDP in 2005 is robust to the inclusion of controls capturing geography and the historical legacy
of slavery. Figure 13 reveals a strong correlation between pre-colonial political centralization
and contemporary institutional quality, as reflected in the control of corruption index, implying
some significant institutional persistence (the results are similar with other proxy measures of
national institutions, such as bureaucratic quality and rule of law).

5.2                                     Ethnic Homeland Analysis

Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013b) examine the role of pre-colonial ethnic-specific political
institutions on economic development exploiting within-country regional variation. They perform
the analysis at the ethnic homeland level, exploiting the fact that there were sizable diﬀerences in
pre-colonial political centralization even within the boundaries of contemporary states. This ap-
proach has some straightforward benefits. First, one may eﬀectively account for colonial features
related to the identity of the colonizer or/and the type of colonization and post-independence
nationwide features, such as macroeconomic (and other) policies, the role of formal institutions,
foreign aid, and other factors. Second, by performing the analysis at the regional level, one
can account for local geographic, ecological, and other traits (related, for example, to natural
resources and early development) and thus isolate the role of ethnic local institutions on devel-
opment. This is non-trivial since there is a fierce debate over whether the strong cross-country
association between institutional and economic development reflects a causal relationship or is
driven by hard-to-quantify geographical features.

         The nature of the study requires detailed data on economic performance at the ethnic
homeland level (e.g., the region where the Maasai traditionally reside in Northern Tanzania and
in Southern Kenya). Yet spatially disaggregated economic indicators are not available for most
African countries. To overcome this issue the authors follow Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil
(2012) and use satellite images on light density at night to proxy economic development at a
fine grid. Using these data they construct average light density per square kilometer averaging
across all pixels falling in each ethnic homeland in each country in 2007 and in 2008. Henderson,
Storeygard, and Weil (2012), as well as previous studies (e.g. Elvidge, Baugh, Kihn, Kroehl,
and Davis (1997); Doll, Muller, and Morley (2006)) and subsequent works (Chen and Nordhaus
(2011), Pinkovskiy (2013), Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014)) show that light density at
night is a strong proxy of economic activity at various levels of aggregation.18
         Figures 14 and 14 portray the distribution of luminosity across African ethnic homelands.
In Figure 14 the luminosity data is aggregated at the country-ethnic homeland level, while in
Figure 14 the continent is divided into pixels of 25  25 decimal degrees (approximately 125
 125) indicating lit and unlit pixels. There is sizable variation in light density across regions
with luminosity being significantly higher in Southern African countries and the coastal areas of
Western Africa as compared to the desert areas in Sahara and the rainforest in Central Africa.

     In the Appendix we present graphical analysis illustrating the strong correlation between luminosity and various
proxies of development across and within African countries.

                               Figure 15: Luminosity Summary Statistics

        On the one hand, the mean (median) luminosity in the homelands of stateless societies
is 0257 (0018) and for petty/small chiefdoms the mean (median) value is 0281 (0015). On
average 10% and 129% of populated pixels falling in the historical homeland of stateless groups
and petty chiefdoms are lit, respectively.
        On the other hand, the average luminosity across groups that pre-colonially formed large
paramount chiefdoms is 0315. While the diﬀerence is small when we compare the median values
large and significant diﬀerences emerge. The median luminosity for paramount chiefdoms is more
than three times larger as compared to stateless ethnicities or groups organized in small chiefdoms,
0039. Moreover, the diﬀerence in the likelihood that a pixel is lit is 69% higher for groups
that are paramount chiefdoms as compared to stateless societies (this diﬀerence is statistically
significant at the 95% level). Average luminosity in the homelands of ethnic groups that were
part of large centralized states before colonization is 105, four times larger than luminosity of
stateless societies or small chiefdoms. On average 302 percent of populated pixels falling in the
homelands of highly centralized groups are lit, three times more than the likelihood that a pixel
is lit for stateless societies. The median value of luminosity in this group of ethnicities is 0082,
four times larger than the respective median for societies solely organized at the local community
level or ethnicities with weak inter-community political ties (petty chiefdoms). Luminosity in the
ethnic homelands of pre-colonial states is significantly higher, even when compared to luminosity

                                                   28
at the homeland of groups organized as paramount chiefdoms. Simple test of means suggest that
these diﬀerences are statistically diﬀerent than zero at the 99% confidence level.


       Baseline Estimates However, both pre-colonial political centralization and luminosity
capture common factors. Therefore, the key question is whether diﬀerences in light density are
related to the degree of pre-colonial political institutions, conditional on population density and
other related factors. Figure 16 summarizes the key findings of Michalopoulos and Papaioannou
(2013b). In all (linear) specifications the dependent variable is an indicator (0−1) that equals one
if a pixel is lit and zero otherwise.19 Since a significant fraction of the continent is unpopulated,
we restrict estimation to populated areas (the results are similar if we include unpopulated pixels).
In all specifications the omitted category is stateless upon colonization societies. So, green bars
plot the likelihood that a pixel falling in the historical homeland of small chiefdoms is lit as
compared to stateless groups. Similarly, light blue and dark blue bars plot the likelihood that a
pixel is lit in large chiefdoms and organized states, respectively.20
       Model 1 reports coeﬃcient estimates on the three types of political organization, simply
conditioning on country fixed eﬀects; this accounts for all time-invariant country-specific factors,
related to the identity of the colonizer, the type of colonization, post-independence national poli-
cies and all other nation-wide factors. Compared to stateless societies, development is higher in
the homelands of societies organized as small chiefdoms; yet the diﬀerence is small, around 35%,
and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Diﬀerences are large when we compare politically
acephalous groups to ethnicities that in the pre-colonial era were parts of paramount chiefdoms
or large kingdoms. The coeﬃcient for the groups of ethnicities that formed large states in the
pre-colonial era implies that the likelihood that a pixel is lit is 13 percentage points higher as
compared to the group of societies that lacked any state features at the time of colonization.
       In models 2 we condition on the log of population density in 2000 (using georeferenced
population estimates from the United Nations Environmental Programme).21 Accounting for
population density is important because research shows that there is a strong interplay between
political centralization and urbanization (Stevenson (1968)).22 While the coeﬃcient for groups
organized as large chiefdoms or states declines, the estimates retain their statistical significance,
implying that contemporary development is significantly higher in the homelands of ethnicities
  19
     Overall the analysis is carried out in a sample of 66 570 pixels.
  20
     Since there are just two ethnic groups where the jurisdictional hierarchy index equals four, these ethnicities
are assigned into the group where the jurisdictional hierarchy index equals 3.
  21
     The UNEP dataset imputes population at the grid level using information on roads, railroads, navigable rivers,
and urban centers.
  22
     It should be stressed, however, that while across the globe there is a strong positive correlation between
historical population densities and political centralization, the correlation in Africa is positive but much weaker
(Osafo-Kwaako and Robinson (2013)).

with strong politically complex institutions at the time of colonization.
         In model 3 we also include in the specification a rich set of conditioning variables to account
for local geographic, ecological, and other characteristics. Specifically, we add indicators capturing
the presence of diamond mines, petroleum fields, and water bodies at the pixel-level. We also
control for the distance from the centroid of each pixel to the sea coast, the capital city, and the
national border; and we also add controls for land suitability for agriculture, elevation, surface
area, and a malaria stability index.23 In model 4 we also condition on the same variables at the
country-ethnic homeland-level. We continue to find that regional development is systematically
linked to pre-colonial ethnic institutions. The estimates show that diﬀerences in luminosity
become economically and statistically significant when one compares paramount large chiefdoms
to either stateless societies or groups organized as petty chiefdoms. Contemporary development
is even higher in regions historically populated by societies that were part of large states at the
time of colonization. The most conservative estimates imply that the likelihood of a lit pixel
is approximately 7 percentage points higher when one moves from the homeland of stateless
ethnicities to regions where highly centralized ethnic groups reside. This eﬀect is far from being
small, as in the sample only 167% of all populated pixel areas are lit.

societies, are lit. In contrast, there is a 28% likelihood of a lit pixel falling in the homeland of
two centralized groups, the (Ba)Ngwato, a traditional Sotho-Tswana tribe and the Ndebele, that
originate from the Zulus. In Nigeria, approximately 20% of all populated pixels falling within the
boundaries of groups that were stateless upon colonization (such as the Tiv) are lit; in contrast,
in the homeland of ethnic groups that were organized as large paramount chiefdoms (such as the
Hausa) the likelihood that a pixel is lit is 39%, while in the homelands of ethnic groups organized
in large kingdoms and states (such as the Ife or the Yoruba) the likelihood is close to 50%.
      Given our discussion of a dual institutional-economic structure in Africa reported in the
previous section, we estimated models focusing on homelands outside the capital cities where
due to population mixing and the strong influence of national institutions (Michalopoulos and
Papaioannou (2014)), ethnic traits should play no role. Figure 17 reports otherwise identical
to Figure 16 estimates but excluding from the estimation pixels close to the capital cities. In
particular we use the 25 percentile of distance to capital (236645 kilometers) as a cutoﬀ to
distinguish between proximate and far from the capital city areas. (The results are similar if we
use the median distance to the capital or we use the 10% percentile). In all models the coeﬃcients
on the binary (dummy) variables identifying large states pre-colonial states, paramount and
even petty chiefdoms are positive and highly significant, implying that regional development is
significantly higher in those homelands as compared to pixels falling in the ancestral homelands
of acephalous societies.
      Most importantly all coeﬃcients are larger than the analogous estimates in the full sample
(see Figure 16). For example in the most restrictive specifications (model 4) the coeﬃcients on
petty and paramount chiefdoms are 00386 and 0068, respectively, while the estimate on large
pre-colonial states is 01, while the corresponding estimates in the full sample are considerably
smaller, 00125, 0052, and 0069. This estimate implies that the likelihood that a pixel is lit is
10% if it falls in the historical homeland of a group that was organized as a state in the pre-
colonial era as compared to groups without any level of political centralization beyond the local
level. This eﬀect is three percentage points larger than the implied impact in the full sample.
Note that the likelihood that a pixel is lit in the sample outside the vicinity of capitals is lower
(136%) implying even larger estimates. In contrast, when we restrict estimation to pixels (or
homelands) close to the capitals there is no systematic link between pre-colonial institutions
and pixel-level development, as reflected in luminosity (results not shown for brevity). This
further demonstrates the dual structure of economic-institutional development in Africa, where
ethnic institutions matter in areas far from the capitals where national institutional features are
immaterial, while ethnic institutions are irrelevant for development in the vicinity of capitals
where national institutions are present.

          Further Evidence and Sensitivity Checks Since pre-colonial political institutions
are not randomly assigned, one cannot claim that the estimates from the empirical analysis are
causal. There are three main issues. First, the degree of political centralization is likely to
capture other features of pre-colonial societies, such as historical urbanization,24 social stratifi-
cation, the type of economic activity, settlement patterns, etc. (see Diamond (1997)). To partly
account for this we regressed luminosity on the jurisdictional hierarchy index and more than
twenty other variables from Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas capturing the type of economic activ-
ity (dependence on agriculture, hunting, fishing, animal husbandry, and milking of domesticated
animals), societal arrangements (polygyny, presence of clans at the village level, slavery), early
development (size and complexity of pre-colonial settlements), and proxies of local institutional
arrangements (an indicator for the presence of inheritance rule for property, elections of the local
headman, class stratification and jurisdictional hierarchy at the village level). In all specifica-
tions the jurisdictional hierarchy beyond the local community level index enters with a positive
and stable coeﬃcient. Moreover, across all permutations the coeﬃcient is significant at standard
confidence levels, suggesting that it is political centralization and statehood rather than some
other observable societal features that influence long-run development.
  24
    Since there are not much data on pre-colonial urbanization in most specifications we control for contemporary
population density. To account for the "bad control" problem of Angrist and Pischke (2008), we also conditioned on
log population density using the first post-independence census, finding similar and if-anything- somewhat stronger
results.



                                                             32
      Second, the estimates may be driven by some unobserved hard-to-account-for factor either
related to local geography or pre-colonial economic development. This is a much harder issue to
address. Yet in an eﬀort to account for it, we estimated empirical specifications associating devel-
opment with pre-colonial ethnic institutions within pairs of adjacent ethnicities with a diﬀerent
degree of political complexity in the same country. For example, in Uganda the Acholi, a group
organized as a small chiefdom at the time of colonization, borders the (Ba)Nyoro, the group that
dominated a strong pre-colonial kingdom in East Africa. In Burkina Faso, the homeland of the
Mossi, the dominant ethnic group of the pre-colonial Mossi empire is adjacent to the homeland
of the Samo, an ethnicity that at the time of colonization lacked any level of political authority
beyond the local community level. We thus compare development across 252 pairs of adjacent
ethnic homelands comprising a centralized and a non-centralized ethnicity. The estimates imply
that on average within contiguous ethnic homelands falling in the same country, the probability
that a pixel is lit is approximately 3% higher in the homeland of ethnic group that was organized
as a large chiefdom or state. Moreover, note that if it was the case that some hard-to-account-for
geographic characteristics were behind the observed association between political centralization
and regional economic performance then one would find the same positive relationship even in
places where pre-colonial ethnic traits are probably irrelevant today. This is likely the case for
regions in the vicinity of the capital due to ethnic mixing and the strong presence of the na-
tional state. Hence, we view the finding that ethnic-specific political centralization does not
correlate with regional development nearby the capital cities as further evidence that pre-colonial
centralization does reflect the influence of ethnic-specific institutional actors.
      Third, Murdock’s data surely contain noise, as for example Murdock assigned each African
region to a single ethnic group, while to some extent at least ethnicities overlap. Moreover,
Murdock’s map is bound to have drawing error on the exact boundaries, which in any case are
just approximations given the limited capacity of pre-colonial African states to broadcast power
(Herbst (2000)). Yet in the presence of classical error-in-variables the estimates in Michalopoulos
and Papaioannou (2013b) will be conservative due to attenuation bias (Wooldridge (2002)). Alsan
(2014) constructs regional proxies of pre-colonial ethnic institutions combining Murdock’s juris-
dictional hierarchy beyond the local community index with Ethnologue’s contemporary maps
on the linguistic composition of African regions. Her painstaking approach yields more accu-
rate measures of ethnic-specific pre-colonial political centralization across administrative units
in Africa. Not only her method lowers noise due to the relocation of ethnic groups, but also
partially accounts for population mixing (that is a key issue in capitals). She shows that there is
a strong positive association between pre-colonial ethnic political centralization and development
(as proxied in log luminosity) at the regional level. Interestingly her estimates on pre-colonial



                                                  33
political centralization are way higher (and more precisely estimated than ours) in line with mea-
surement error interpretation. In line with this, in Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013c) we
show that once one combines Murdock’s data with alternative maps of pre-colonial statehood in
an eﬀort to account for measurement error the magnitude of the estimated coeﬃcients increases.


         Additional Evidence Fenske (2014) presents further evidence supportive of the idea
that deeply-rooted ethnic political centralization contributes to contemporary development. He
first shows that pre-colonial states emerged in areas with heterogenous geography, most likely
because centralized bureaucracies and policing were needed to foster trade (see also Bates (1983)
and Michalopoulos, Naghavi, and Prarolo (2012)). He then shows that the (semi-exogenous) com-
ponent of political centralization that is driven by ecological diversity is also positively correlated
with luminosity at the ethnic homeland level. While ecological diversity and propensity to trade
may exert an independent eﬀect on regional development, this result points out that historical po-
litical institutions exert a significant long-run influence. Most importantly Fenske (2014) reports
quantitatively larger two-stage-least-squares estimates, hinting that the OLS estimates in Figure
15 constitute conservative lower bounds (due to attenuation). Likewise, Alsan (2014) shows that
the component of pre-colonial political centralization that is driven by soil-climate suitability for
the Tse-Tse fly is also a strong correlate of regional development; and while Tse-Tse ecology may
shape development (as captured in log luminosity) through other channels, she shows that this
does not seem to be the case.
         Bandyopadhyay and Green (2012) examine the role of pre-colonial political centralization
on development and public goods provision using detailed survey data from Uganda at the district
(96 observations) and the county level (close to 1 000 observations). They show that literacy,
income and a composite human development index are higher in the homelands of politically
centralized ethnic groups. When the authors account for the fact that the ethnic institutions
may be less relevant for areas far from the center of politically centralized groups, they tend to
find stronger results. Interestingly, Bandyopadhyay and Green (2012) fail to detect a systematic
association between the degree of pre-colonial political centralization and proxies of public goods
provision, this result appears in line with the descriptive patterns from the Afrobarometer surveys
(in Section 2), showing that traditional leaders have rather limited responsibility for local public
goods provision.
         In recent work Depetris-Cheuvin (2014) constructs a state-antiquity/centralization index at
a cell-level (approximately at pixels of 10 − 122 ) and uses georeferenced data on civil conflict
to uncover a negative relationship between long-run exposure to statehood and contemporary
conflict.25 Using data from the Afrobarometer Surveys, he then shows that individuals residing
 25
      Similarly, Wig (2013) shows that politically centralized groups are less likely to engage in civil war when they


                                                          34
in regions with a long state history are more likely to accept the key institutions of the national
state, such as the power of courts, the tax authorities, and the police. Moreover, state history is
positively related to chief’s role in the local communities.
       The link between ethnic-level political centralization and development seems to be also
present outside Africa. Focusing on North America, Dippel (2014) shows a strong positive corre-
lation between the degree of pre-colonial political centralization of indigenous tribes and contem-
porary development across indigenous Native American Reservations. Focusing on Latin America
Chiovelli (2014) documents a positive correlation between pre-colonial institutions and contem-
porary levels of development, as measured by light density at night and population density. His
work also reveals a significantly positive eﬀect of pre-colonial centralization on sub-national colo-
nial institutions, suggesting that the significant reduced-form association between pre-colonial
political centralization and development captures (to some extent) their role in shaping colonial
institutional structures.


6    Conclusion
       Summary This study highlights recent explorations of the political economy of African
development that place an emphasis on ethnic-specific institutional and other traits.
       We start our paper reviewing the latest wave of studies stressing the limited fiscal and legal
capacity of most African countries and the limited role that national governments play in areas
far from the capitals. We then link this body of work to survey evidence showing the salience
of ethnic identification, which is widespread across the continent. These findings suggest that
the focus on nationwide factors as the key driver of economic success has perhaps overlooked a
critical feature of the African landscape, namely the role of ethnicity.
       We then discuss the literature on traditional leaders (chiefs) in Africa. Unlike national
politicians and public administrators, ethnic authorities and traditional leaders enjoy widespread
support among their peers. Chiefs have considerable de jure and de facto authority in many
aspects of local economic, political, and social life, most importantly in handling local disputes
and assigning land property rights.
       Ethnic-specific institutions are not a recent development, in fact they are rooted in the pre-
colonial past of the groups. Using anthropological data on the spatial distribution of ethnicities
and the degree of political centralization at the time of colonization, we show that there is signif-
icant heterogeneity in ethnic-specific historical institutional arrangements. The spectrum ranges
from ethnic groups that were organized eﬀectively as states having a centralized bureaucracy,
layers of administration, and formal legal institutions to acephalous (fragmented) societies that
are excluded from the central government.


                                                 35
practically lacked any form of political integration beyond the village level. Colonization did not
significantly alter ethnic institutions, as it was short-lived and Europeans mostly settled in the
handful of capital cities near the coast and waterways. Moreover, in some instances Europeans
institutionalized the role of local chiefs as a by-product of their indirect rule policy.
      In the final section we review recent empirical works showing that ethnic pre-colonial insti-
tutions correlate significantly with contemporary development across countries. We then discuss
the study of Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013b) and subsequent studies linking pre-colonial
political centralization to ethnic-specific economic development, as reflected in satellite images
of light density at night. The analysis reveals a strong positive association between ethnic insti-
tutions and economic development, even when one accounts for colonial and national features,
geography at a fine level, and numerous other ethnic-specific traits. Since there is no random
assignment of ethnic institutions, this correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Yet the
results provide large-scale formal econometric evidence in support of the African historiography
that emphasizes the importance of ethnic institutions and other historical features in shaping
contemporary economic performance. We also report new results showing that the link between
pre-colonial political centralization and regional development, as reflected in luminosity, is par-
ticularly strong outside the capital cities (where national institutions are relevant, Michalopoulos
and Papaioannou (2014)).


      Future Work We view this study as a stepping stone for further research in documenting
and understanding the "dual" economic-political structure of African societies where ethnic and
national institutions seem to coexist. For example, the Afrobarometer Surveys cover roughly
half of the continent’s countries. However, no surveys were conducted in many war-prone and
politically unstable ones, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan where anecdotal
evidence suggests that (perhaps due to the state collapse) ethnic identity is particularly salient.
Moreover, although a priori there are several possible channels via which pre-colonial political
centralization may be beneficial for development, the available studies are silent as to the relevant
magnitudes. Examining heterogeneity is thus needed, as this can shed light on the mechanisms
at play. Subsequent empirical research should try disentangle the mechanisms at work and enrich
the dimension of cultural identity by investigating how ethnicity, language and religion interact
to form the cultural background of one’s identity.
      Overall, the evidence suggests that future work in economics, organizational and manage-
ment science should move beyond country-level aggregates and focus on the largely neglected role
of ethnicity and the delicate interactions between ethnic features (related to culture, history, and
chiefs’ role) and national characteristics (related to institutions and state capacity). For example,
one could examine whether entrepreneurial propensity, managerial practices and the organiza-

                                                  36
tional structure of African firms diﬀer systematically across ethnic lines. Another fruitful avenue
of research is to examine whether there are systematic diﬀerences in credit constraints and firms’
size across the quite heterogeneous ethnic groups. It is also important to understand how ethnic
norms and the diﬀerent historical legacies aﬀect the organizational structure (e.g., hierarchy, del-
egation, hiring practises) of the emerging African corporation. Finally, more work is needed to
shed light on how corporations and multinationals deal with local ethnic institutions and tribal
leaders and how the "dual" coexisting institutional framework in rural Africa influences foreign
investment. We hope to tackle some of these open issues in subsequent research.

7    Appendix A: Satellite Light Density at Night and Develop-
     ment across and within African Countries
Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil (2012), as well as previous studies (e.g. Elvidge, Baugh, Kihn,
Kroehl, and Davis (1997); Doll, Muller, and Morley (2006)) and subsequent works (Chen and
Nordhaus (2011), Pinkovskiy (2013)) show that light density at night is a good proxy of economic
activity at various levels of aggregation. Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013, 2014) provide
additional evidence illustrating the strong link between luminosity and various proxies of economic
well-being both across and within African countries.
                             Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the strong association between log per capita GDP in 2000
and log light density across African countries. The 2 is 035 and the estimate is more than
6 standard errors larger than zero. Besides economic performance, light density also reflects
urbanization. Appendix Figure 1 shows the relationship between log GDP per capita and log
light density partialling out the eﬀect of log population density in 2000. The relationship between
log light density and log GDP per capita becomes stronger; the regression coeﬃcient increases
from 031 to 047 and the t-stat jumps to 10.

                             Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013b) combine the satellite images on light density at
night with data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Afrobarometer Surveys
to examine in more detail the relationship between luminosity and well-being across African re-
gions. The analysis shows that luminosity correlates strongly with various proxies of development
and public goods provision measures across African regions, towns, and ethnic homelands. Below
we reproduce some graphs showing the significant positive correlation between luminosity and
the DHS composite wealth index for four large African countries, Tanzania, Nigeria, Zimbabwe,
and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Luminosity: The data come from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational
Linescan System that reports images of the earth at night captured from 20 : 00 to 21 : 30
local time. The measure is a six-bit digital number (ranging from 0 to 63) calculated for every
30-second area pixel (approximately 1 square kilometer). The resulting annual composite images
are created by overlaying all images captured during each year, dropping images where lights are
shrouded by cloud cover or overpowered by the aurora or solar glare and removing ephemeral
lights like fires, lightning and other noise. The result is a series of global images of time-stable
night lights.
      State Fragility Index: Composite index of state fragility based on six dimensions, ef-
fectiveness and legitimacy of security, polity, and social-economic. The index is an aggregate
of measures capturing civil conflict, the level of democracy and the inclusiveness of the polit-
ical process, and government’s eﬀectiveness in achieving socioeconomic goals, such as tackling
poverty, improving health, and education.

      Alternative State Fragility Index: Composite index of state fragility based on four
dimensions, eﬀectiveness and legitimacy of security and the polity. The index is an aggregate
of measures capturing civil conflict, the level of democracy and the inclusiveness of the political
process. Source: Marshall and Cole (2011).

mid-1990). Source: Besley and Persson (2009).
      Government Anti-Diversion Policies Index: Index of government’s anti-diversion
policies, measured over the period 1986 − 95. It is an equally-weighted average of these five
categories: i) law and order, ii) bureaucratic quality, iii) corruption, iv) risk of expropriation and
v) government repudiation of contracts (each of these items has higher values for governments
with more eﬀective policies towards supporting production) and ranges from 0 to 1. Source:

      Legal Formalism: Legal system ineﬀectiveness index, based on the log number of calendar
days needed to resolve a payment dispute through national courts (unpaid debt worth 50% of
the GDP per capita). Source: Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007).
      Control for Corruption: The control of corruption index is "capturing perceptions of the
extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of
corruption, as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests." The standardized index


                                                 49
ranges from −25 to +25 with lower values indicating a higher degree of corruption. We use the

      Jurisdictional Hierarchy beyond Local Community: Ordered variable ranging from
0 to 4 indicating the number of jurisdictional levels (political complexity) in each society above the
local level. A 0 indicates stateless societies, 1 and 2 indicate petty and large paramount chiefdoms
(or their equivalent), 3 and 4 indicate large states. Source: Murdock (1967); variable code in the
