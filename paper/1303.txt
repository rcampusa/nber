                          Bequests as a Means of Payment


                                     ABSTRACT



       Although recent research suggests that intergenerational transfers play

an important role in aggregate capital accumulation, our understanding of

bequest motives remains incomplete. We develop a simple model of

"exchange—motivated" bequests, in which a testator influences the decisions of

his beneficiaries by holding wealth in bequeathable forms and by conditioning

the division of bequests on the beneficiaries' actions. The model generates

falsifiable empirical predictions which are inconsistent with other theories of

intergenerational transfers. We present econometric and other evidence which

strongly suggests that bequests are often used as a means of payment for services

rendered by beneficiaries.

       uch   recent research suggests that intergenerational transfers play an

 itrportant role in aggregate capital accun'ulation. Kotlikoff and Surrrers (1981)

estiirate that about four—fifths of U.S. wealth accurrulatiort is due to interge-

nerational transfers.1 Several other studies, including Brittain (1978). Nirer

(1979), and Bernheitr (l98la) have found that the savings behavior of retirees is

inconsistent with strong forrrs of the Life Cycle Hypothesis.2 While interge-

nerational transfers appear to be of central iirportance in
                                                                  understanding pat-
terns of capital accutrulation and fatrilial behavior, relatively little is known

about what rrotivates individuals to leave bequests.

       In this paper we develop a Irodel of "exchange rotivated" bequests, and pre-

sent   sorre preliirinary eirpirical tests of it. The central prexrise underlying our
forirulation is that testators use bequests to influence the behavior of poten-
tial beneficiaries. Such influence tray be overt as when parents threaten to
disinherit triscreant offspring, or irore subtle as when parents      reward   Irre
attentive    children   with fatrily heirloorrs. As we discuss below, tro.1els of

exchange rrotivated bequests have very different irrplications for the effects of

institutions such as Social Security and private pensions on the x'ate of capital

forn'ation, and individual behavior Irore generally, than do alternative irodels.

       In our theoretical forirulation, we envision a testator who derives satis-

faction froir consuxrption, and who is also affected by actions taken
                                                                           individually

by a nun'ber of potential beneficiaries. The testator has no conventional
                                       —2—


bequest irotive, and so, apart fron' strategic considerations, would prefer to

hold his entire wealth in annuities. However, his preferences differ froir those

of his potential beneficiaries (he ray, for exairple. wish to receive additional

attention, or irore generally to alter behavior). By holding wealth in

bequeathable forirs and by conditioning the division of bequests (perhaps through

inforrrl ireans) on actions taken, he can atterrpt to influence his beneficiaries'

decisions. However, he is constrained in this regard by considerations of

credibility; he cannot, for exan'pie, credibly threaten universal disinheritance.

We show that as long as there are at least two credible beneficiaries, it is

possible for the testator to devise a siirple, intuitively appealing bequest

rule which overcoires the problea' of credibility, and allows hut' to appropriate

all surplus generated froir testator—beneuiciary interaction. This surplus pro-

vides the incentive for the testator to hold at least part of his wealth in

bequeathable forirs.

     No single tractable analytic irodel can capture as varied a phenorenon as

intergenerational transfers. We believe, however, that the trodel of exchange

rrotivated bequests presented here is a valuable suppleirent to conventional for—

irulations which rely on ad—hoc bequest irotives or intergenerational altruisir.

In particular, our irodel helps to explain several eirpirical observations which

seerr inconsistent with other forirulations. Furtherirore, it generates falsi—
fiable eirpirical predictions, thereby lending itself to econorretric testinr.

     Since undertaking this project, the authors have frequently been accused of

harboring a perhaps too pessirristic view of huiran nature. It is therefore

iirportant to exrphasize that we intend for the current work to supplerrent, rather
                                       —3—


 than substitute for, current theories of bequests. Surely, not all individuaTs

 behave unipu1atively, nor does hinted self—interest necessarily determine

the disposition of' all bequeathable wealth. However, even the optimist rrust

concede that certain cases sirack of financial motivation. For example, rich,

elderly, childless widows often appear to have unusually attentive relatives.

More coirironly, although n'any families seem to divide the bulk of financial

wealth in accordance with certain principles of fairness, specific possessions

(for instance, heirlooms and other valuables) rray be distributed in part on the

basis of "Irerit." We model, a polar extretre in order to highlight analysis of

the exchange irotive, rather than to suggest the absence of other motivation.

The relative significance of different motives is properly the subject of

exrpirical inquiry (as in sections II and III), rather than casual anecdotes.

     The notion that bequests xray arise as a consequence of exchange between

parents and children has previously received varying arrounts of attention from

Sussmran etal. (19T0), Barro (1971, footnote i4), Ben—Porath (19T8), Adains

(1980), Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), Tomes (1981), and Becker (19Th. 1981).

These studies, however, lack a coirplete model of the exchange process. Where

forn'al rrodels of exchange are developed, it is implicitly assured that unwrit-

ten agreen'ents between family meinbers are perfectly enforceable.   By exp'icitly

n'odelling the strategic choices of parties of such agreeirents, we generite

sharp, empirically testable predictions concerning the circurrstnces under which

these agreeirents are enforceable.

     Aside froir the issue of enforceability, our analysis is perhaps irost closely

related to that of Becker (19Th.. 1981), but in his framework, the parent
(testator) is an altruist, and is prixrarily concerned with alleviating inter—

farrily conflict (see, however. Becker's discussion of "irerit goods"). We rodel

a wore elaborate gawe in which testators act selfishly at tiires, prorroting

conflict airong potential beneficiaries to achieve personally desired goals.

Further, we explicitly link the exchange r'otive to decisions to hold wealth in

bequeathable, as opposed to annuitized forirs.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section I presents our irodel of

exchange trotivated bequests and characterizes its solution.   In section II, we

present econorretric evidence on bequeathable assets and beneficiary behavior

which supports the trodel. Section III discusses the ability of various bequest

theories to account for certain stylized facts. Finally, in section IV we exa—

wine sorre iirplications of our nndel for issues such as the effect of Social

Security, governirerit debt, and private pensions on capital forrration and fan'ily

behavior. Conclusions are also presented.


I. A_Model of Exchange Motivated Beauests

     In this section, we present a riodel in which savings and bequests are

partly deteririned by non—cooperative interaction airong self—interested agents.

For a variety of reasons, testators' preferences tray not coincide with those of

their potential beneficiaries. In such cases, decisions of potential benefi-

ciaries tray be influenced by the hope of financial reward. Exairples abound: An

individual might desire wore attention from his children, object to a relative's

choice of spouse, or want to be cared for by a sibling or grandchild.

 Institutions (such as universities) corrironly treat wealthy patrons particularly
                                         —5—



 well,   perhaps to encourage further support in the forw of gifts and bequests.

      A forrral discussion of strategic issues necessarily requires us to seTect a

 structural xrodel. In particular, we envision a world in which the testator is a

 dotrinant, fully inf'orwed player. By designing the rules governing the division

 of bequests, he influences the behavior of potential beneficiaries, extracting

 the full surplus generated by this exchange. There are, of course, a variety of

 other ways to irodel exchange Irotivated bequests; ours has no particular ariorj

 ciairr to realisir. However, it does have the virtue of siirplicity and trac-

tability, and in addition generates falsiuiable errpirica]. predictions which are

inconsistent with other irodels of intergenerational transfers, which lack the

elewent of exchange. This allows us to test the irodel in sections II and III.

On the whole, the evidence appears to support the hypothesis that bequests are

used extensively to facilitate intrafawily exchange.

     In solving for the equilibria of the galre described in the following sub-

section, we wake extensive use of Selten's (1975) notion of subgare perfect

Nash Equilibriuir. Forirally, an equilibriuir is subgaire perfect if strategies

forir an equilibriuir in every proper subgarre. Intuitively, this refinerrent of

the Nash concept requires agents to act in a narrically consistent fashion

(that is, in their own interests) both on and off the equilibriuxr path. This is

coirironly interpreted as weaning that an agent cannot credibly threaten to take

in certain contingencies actions, which, should those contingencies arise, would

be contrary to his interests. In the case of bequests, testators obviously need

to establish credibility in order to wanipulate potential beneficiaries.

Threats of universal disinheritance are, for exairple, unlikely to be belicved.
                                             —6—




Our task is to show that the testator can (in our wodel) successfully tranipulate
potential beneficiaries even though he is constrained to sake credible threats.



A. The_Model
       Consider a single testator with N potential beneficiaries, indexed n = 1,

...,   N.   This set of beneficiaries is intended to be exhaustive: it includes

all individuals (spouse, children, other relatives) and institutions (charities,

churches, universities) to which the testator could credibly prorrise a substan-

tial fraction of his estate. For any particular individual, the size of this

set is an eirpirical question.

            Tiire proceeds in discrete periods, labelled t =   0.   1. 2, ...   The con-

ditional probability that the testator will die at the end of period t given

that he is alive at the beginning of period t will be denoted w. We assuwe

that the testator's lifetixre is deteririnistically bounded (there exists T such

that T =     i).       Let


                       ti—i

       P(t,t')     =    ii    (i —
                                     it5),
                       5 =t

i.e., the probability that he will survive until t', given that he is alive in

period t. These survival probabilities are assuired to be publicly known.

Although the testator's lifetirre is uncertain, we take potential beneficiaries

to be infinitely lived. Relaxing this does not change any substantive conclu-

 sions.

       Each period, the testator and potential beneficiaries choose to consuire
                                                       —T —




awounts C, and {C tn1' respectively. In addition, potential beneficiaries

choose actions at                            which affect the testator's well—being. For

sinplicity, we assuxre that at is a real nrnrber lying in sou'e interval

0 (          .     We   assuwe that the testator's utility is additively separable in

tirre and discounted at the rate .                In    particular, for every period s and for

all strearrs of future consu.irption and actions, his ex ante utility is given by:


       T
       Z 8       P(s,t) U (c,,, at
      ts


We take U to be increasing and strictly concave in each of its arguL"ents.

Siirilarly, for a potential beneficiary n, utility is given by:5


       Z ts un,t        (C
                             n,t
                                   ,   a
      t=s                              n,t




       is taken to be increasing and concave in                       Since we are prirrarily

interested in cases of strategic conflict between testator and beneficiary, we

assuire that a    is "bad" froir the beneficiary's point of view (that is, U                     is
              n,t

       At tirre t =   0, the testator and potential beneficiaries possess initial
wealth W0 and {Wn}ni respectively. Aside froir interest, there are no

infusions of incoire into the systeir after period                    In each period t, agents

allocate wealth (W, {w}1) between consulrption (ct, {C                               one period
                                                         —8—



annuity contracts (Ar. {At}5j) and riskless bonds, the latter yielding a

return in the following period of r.                     In contrast, for the testator, annuities

yield       > r; however, payirent is conditional upon survival. For the case of

fair annuities, 1 + Pt = (1. + r)/(l —                   iTt).   Since beneficiaries survive with

probability one, their annuities are equivalent to bonds.

     The testator's total wealth evolves according to equation (1).


             =
                 (we,
                        —       — A) (1 + r) + At (1 +                                              (1)



Should he die      at       the end of period t, his total bequest Bt is given by


                                                                                                    (2)
        BtWt_Ct_At
The evolution of a potential beneficiary's wealth will be governed by an

equation sirrilar to (1):


        w        = (w          —   C         + b      i(t)) (1 + r)                                 (3)
        n,t+l           n,t            n,t      n,t

Here, i(t) equals 1 if the testator actually dies in period t, and 0 otherwise;

bn,t is the arrount bequeathed to the nth beneficiary in the event that the

testator dies in period t.

        It is convenient at this point to define, for each n and t. the indirect

utility function Vn,t(W) as the solution to the following progratr:



        wax E n BUn,t(c n,t ,o)


subject to
                                               —9—




      Z   C
              n,t 1(1
                        +   r)T_t


 That is, for each potential beneficiary n, tine period t, and wealth level W,

V(W) indicates the iraxiirus present discounted utility which the potential

beneficiary could obtain if he left the garre (i.e. .        set      =
                                                                          bt   =   0 for each

t), and sirrply perforrred life cycle lraxizrization.

      Strategic considerations enter through decisions affecting the size and

distribution of bequests. In particular, choices within a period take place in

the following sequence. First, the testator deterirines his consurption level,

and divides his reTraining wealth between annuities and bequeathable assets. In

addition, he selects a bequest rule, which specifies criteria for deteririning

the distribution of his bequeathable assets should he die at the end of the

period. Second, potential beneficiaries observe the testator's level of

bequeathable wealth,8 and select current actions and consuirption levels, taking

into account the testator's bequest rule. Nature then deterirines whether or not

the testator survives; in the case of death, the estate is divided according to

the bequest rule.

     Forirally, the bequest rule is a vector of N functions, b (IL. B). which wap

the history of the gaire up until the testator dies (H) and the level of

bequeathable wealth (B) into a bequest for each beneficiary. In period t, the

testator iray    choose      a rule which depends on all behavior that is observable

prior to the soonest possible tin'e of his death (i.e., the end of the j'eriod);

we assuire that the history of beneficiaries' actions is observable, hut that

their current consuTrption cannot be ironitored by testators. We require that the

bequest rule satisfy only one condition for all histories H:
                                       —10—



    E b (H,B)=B                                                                   (6)
   n1

This restriction reflects two considerations. First, for feasibility, the lc'ft

hand side of (6) cannot exceed the right. Second, since potential beneficiaries

ist receive all bequeathable wealth upon the testator's death, (6) specifies

equality. Since we have defined the set of potential beneficiaries to be

exhaustive, this sirrply follows fron' the fact that   the   testator "can't take it

with hiir." We have assuired that it is possible to identify a set of credible

potential beneficiaries —— a testator will prefer to leave his wealth to sore

subset   of these individuals and institutions even if they all ignore his wishes9

(as discussed in the introduction, threats to do otherwise are then sirrply not

credible; the perfectness requireirent is irrposed here). Thus, for exairple.

parents iray not be able to successfully issue unreasonable u'Ltirratur's to their

children, threatening universal disinheritance.

     In the next subsection, we show that if there are at least two credible

beneficiaries (N     2), then the testator can design a sirrple, intuitively

appealing bequest rule which allows hia' to extract the entire surplus associated

with testator—beneficiary interaction, even though he is constrained to bequcath

his entire estate to their. The rule establishes a gaire in which potential hne—

ficiaries coirpete for bequests. Thus, "sibling rivalry" errerges as a con-

sequence of parental self—interest. The potential benefits of such exchiane

induce the testator to hold wealth in bequeathable forirs, even though his cr-

sonal rate of' return falls.

B.   qilibriuirin a Sile Period
      Solving    for the perfect equilibria of the gare described in the preceding

section is a soirewhat intricate task. Significant insight into the nature of

this solution can be garnered by first analyzing a single period irodel.                    This

provides a basis for the recursive solution of the full dynairic rrodel presented

in the next subsection. Specifically, assuIre that there is a single period, at

the end of which the testator dies with certainty. His utility is a function of

consuirption and beneficiaries' actions, U(C, a); each potential beneficiary's

utility depends on his chosen action and bequest received,
                                                                              U (an, b).
Decisions are irade in the following order:                   (1) the testator chooses consuirption

and a bequest rule, (2) beneficiaries choose actions.                    Subsequently to these

decisions the testator dies, and his estate is divided according to the spe-

cified rule.

     We Irotivate the solution to this sirrple gaire as follows. Figure 1

illustrates a particular beneficiary's indifference curves in the
                                                                                     (ar. b)
plane. Secall that he thinks of a as a "bad" ——                    utility   increases to the

northwest. Consider the set:


     S
      n      {(an, bn )   :   Un (a n, b n )   ' Un   (0, 0)}


S consists of all pairs which the beneficiary weakly prefers to !rinin'urr action

(a        0) and no bequest (see figure 2). Since he always has the option to set
a = 0,    and since bequests are constrained to be positive, any equilibriwr must

involve beneficiary n consuming an allocation in S.
Figure 1




           ak
Figure 2
                                               —13—


      Now consider the following artificial problew for the testator:


      wax LJ(c, a)
      C,a,b,


      subject to

               N
      s.t.     E b +C=W
             nl n

             (a , bn ) C S       for each n.
                n            n


The solution to this problew, denoted C*, {a*. b}1, would be appropriate if

testators could choose actions for potential beneficiaries subject to the

constraint that each is still willing to participate. Assure there exists a

bequest rule which, along with a consuirption level 0*, induces (a*, b*}N1 as an

equilibriwr. Since this allocation achieves the optiiruw ignoring incentive

constraints, it trust necessarily be the testator's best choice. The perfect

equilibriuir of this sirrplified gatre would then consist of the testator choosing

C* along with this bequest rule, and the beneficiaries playing Nash strategies

in the subgawe defined by the bequest rule.

     To characterize the perfect equilibria for this gaire, we need only exhibit

a bequest rule satisfying (6) for which {a*, b*}N1 etrerges as an equilibriurr

in the beneficiaries' subgaxre)-° One such rule operates as follows. We will
                  N
refer to {a*, b*}
           n   nn=l as "benchirark" actions and bequests. Denote the set of
beneficiaries who take at least their benchirark actions as K =   {n : an > n
let K denote the coirpleirent of K. If K is non—en'pty, the testator bequeaths

nothing to ireirbers of K. In contrast, treirbers of K receive their benchrrark

bequests, plus equal shares of the benchirark bequests for rrerrbers of K. If K is
empty, then the testator bequeaths the entire estate to sore beneficiary m whose

action is closest to his benchmark level: a*  a C a — a n for all n. Note
                                           m — m  n

that total bequests alwvs equal         —   C,   so feasibility and credibility are

satisfied.

         This rule defines a simultaneous irove subgare where potential beneficiaries

choose actions an. It is easy to verify that there are N + 1 Nash equilibria

for this subgaire; one consists of every beneficiary playing his benchmark level.

In the N remaining equilibria, N — 1 beneficiaries choose their benchmark

levels, while one takes the minimum action. However, for a variety of reasons,

one can safely ignore these less desirable equilibria.11

         To summarize: for the simplified game described at the beginning of this

section, the perfect equilibrium consists of the testator choosing consumption

C* along with the bequest rule described in the preceding paragraph, while

potential beneficiaries play Nash strategies in the subgarre defined by the

bequest rule. All other perfect equilibria will yield the same realizations of

consumption, attention, and bequests along equilibrium' paths. Note that the

testator succeeds in extracting all surplus from his beneficiaries (Un (a, b)

=        (0, a)). The bequest rule exhibited is intuitively appealing: each child
    Un
normally receives a positive bequest, but is disinherited if he fails to meet a

standard of "good" behavior. If all children are "bad" the "best" child

receives the entire estate.

         Note that the ability of the testator to successfully influence benefi-

ciaries depends critically upon the existence of more than one credible benefi-

ciary. A single credible beneficiary cannot be "played off" against another
                                            —15—


 agent. Since he is assured of receiving all bequests, no exchange is

 possible, and the garre unravels.


 C. qilibriur in the Full Model

     We are now prepared to characterize the perfect Nash equilibria of the

 fully dynawic garre described in the preceding subsection. We use recursion to

show that the above results generalize: as long as N ) 2, the equilibriur

realizations of all variables directly relevant to the testator (annuities,

bequeathable wealth, testator's consuxrption, beneficiaries' actions, and poten-

tial bequests) are uniquely deteririned, and coincide with the values which the

testator hirrself would select if he rraxiirized his utility subject to the

constraint that       beneficiaries are willing to participate. Thus, the testator
manages to extract all the surplus associated with testator—beneficiary interac-
tion through       the use of a sequence of simple, intuitively appealing bequest
rules. This surplus induces the testator to hold wealth in bequeathable forms,
even though his personal return falls.
     The solution is determined through backward recursion, beginning with
period T + 1. Each beneficiary n starts this period with some (yet to be
determined)         level, WnT+l Since the testator has previously died with
                  wealth

certainty, no strategic considerations arise. Optimal individual behavior from
period T ÷    1   onwards yields utility VnT+l (WnT+l) as previously defined.
     We generate complete equilibrium      strategies by induction. That is, assume
we have solved all subgames beginning in period t      + 1.   Assume that the
testator's equilibrium utility for all such subgames (that is, for all period
t + 1 wealth levels) can be written as V1 (W÷1, {Wnt+1}nl)12 and that the

        By reproducing (with minor difications) our analysis of the single period

case, it is possible to show that the testator can design a simple bequest rule

depending only on current actions which supports his constrained optimum

(beneficiaries Imast willingly participate) as an equilibrium.                                           Consequently,

during actual play, the testator necessarily selects such a rule. Formally, we

consider the following program.

                                                                   t
                              n=l

     5n,t =         {(ant,    bn,t)          0n,t (ant, bnt ; Wnt) >                      0n,t            o Wnt)}

The solution to this problem offers the testator the maximum utility which he

could obtain if he was unconstrined by incentive problems regarding the choice

of actions in the current period, subject only to a free participation of bene-

ficiaries restriction)-3 we denote this as V (w                                ,   {W              ). Since the free
                                                                       t   t            n,t n=l
participation constraint ordinarily binds at the optimuru,1 we have:

     U         (a         b      ; w         ) = U         (o, 0 ; w    ) =         v         (w         ).              (8)

Thus, the beneficiary's indirect utility in period t is independent of whether

or not the testator has died; only the testator succeeds in extracting positive

surplus from this exchange of bequests for attention. This completes the induc—

tion   step, allowing us to characterize the unique allocation sustaintd by the

perfect   Nash equilibria of this model.


II. Econometric Evidence

       In this section, we provide empirical support for the hypothesis that

bequests are used, in part, as a means of payment for services rendered by bene—

ficiaires.    Specifically, our examination of microeconomic panel data reveals

that contact between parents and children is much higher in families where the

elderly parent has a substantial amount of bequeathable wealth to offer. We show

that this correlation is robust with respect to a variety of specifications and

estimation techniques, which are designed to mie out alternative explanations

based on potentially spurious factors. In addition, we explore some implica-

tions of the particular nodel developed in section I which differentiate it from

closely related alternatives, and use these implications to test the model. The

results are extremely favorable to our formulation of exchange rrotivated

bequests.

       Bequests can serve as a means of payment for services only if the presence

of bequeathable wealth can influence the behavior of potential beneficiaries, and

if testators exercise this influence. We adopt a slight abuse of terninolo,

referring to these two distinct aspects of exchange as the "supply" and "demand"

sides.    Primarily due to the nature of available data, our basic strat.e if to

estimate the effect of bequeathable wealth on the amount of services which bene-

ficiaries provide to testators —— the "supply" side. Although we do not esti-

mate the "demandt' side explicitly, we provide indirect statistical evidence for
                                            —19—


 the   claini   that testators exploit the relationship between services and bequests.

        The econometric investigation detailed below requires rather specific data

 concerning assets and family interactions for a sample of elderly individuals.

 The Longitudinal Retirement History Survey (LRHS), conducted by the Office of

 Research and Statistics of the Social Security
                                                    Administration, collected surpri-
 singly extensive information on these characteristics. Data from the 1969,

 1971, 1973, and 1915 waves of the LRHS were available at the time of this

writing; unfortunately, insufficient data on assets were collected in 1973, so

we were forced to drop this year. Over 11,000 individuals aged 58 to 63 were

included in the first wave. Many of these were lost to attrition, on top of

this, we restricted our sample to married couples who had at least one child, no

children living at home, and for whom sufficient data on non—bequeathable assets

were available.15,16 Our final sample consisted of 1,166 observations, 855 of

which had two or nre living children, and 311 of which had only one living
child.

       Measures of attention were constructed as follows. For each observation,

the LRHS contains information on total number of children (c.), number of

children who visit or telephone their parents weekly (vw.), and number       of
children who visit or telephone their parents
                                                   monthly   (VM))7 Our   I:asure   of
attention per child was Constructed from these variables as follows.


                • VW. +   1,7

       V.
        1




V1 indicates contact per child, normalized so that maximum contact equals unity.

We have adopted the approximation that children who visit weekly give their
                                          —20—


parents four times as imach attention as those who visit monthly. It is

interesting to note in passing that the mean of V. was O.54 in 1969, and rose to

0.63 in 1975 ——   evidently,   the average level of contact is quite high, and rises

with age.

     Other variables were constructed as follows. Bequeathable wealth per child

(b) includes financial wealth (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, bank      accounts,
checking accounts), residential and other property, the face value of life

insurance,'8 privately purchased annuities,19 and debt. Non—bequeathable

annuity wealth per child (a.w) includes Social Security and pension wealth.

These were obtained by converting data on income from those sources to capita-

lized values applying a discount rate of 1.03 and actuarial survival probabili-

ties. Matching administrative records contained data on income earned from 1951

to 1975 in employment covered by Social Security up to the taxable maximum.

This information was extrapolated to yearly earnings using the method described

in Fox (1976). The resulting income stream was then accumulated at a 3% rate of

return to produce a measure of lifetime earnings for both husband and wife.

Other variables used in the following analysis included age of respondent, and

dumn variables indicating whether the respondentts health is better (BH.) or

worse (WH) than that of other members of his cohort, as well as whether the

respondent is retired (RET).

     One practical difficulty with these data is that information on the beha-

vior of potential beneficiaries is limited to children. For any given indivi-

dual, the set of credible beneficiaries may or may not be larger. Since our

theory suggest that successful exchange takes place only when this set contains
                                         —21—


 at least two candidates, we cannot be certain that single child families will

 behave in the manner predicted here. Consequently, we initially restrict atten-

tion to families with two or sore children. Analysis and discussion of behavior

 in single child families is deferred to the end of this section.

        Another general issue which arises with regard to the use of these data

concerns the treatment of separate sample years. Except where noted, results

presented in this paper are based on simple pooling of the samples years —— no

correction is made for potential correlation between distinct observations on

the same household. Such correlation would not, by itself, cause our estimates

to be inconsistent, however, it would imply that standard errors are calculated

incorrectly. In order to determine the probable magnitude of the resulting

error, we reestimated a number of our specifications, employing the appropriate

GLS correction. Although small changes in some point estimates were noted, no

qualitative conclusions were altered. More importantly, estimated standard

errors on critical coefficients (such as b) differed only slightly from those

obtained with simple pooling.

        We begin our analysis by specifying the supply of attention from children

as a function of potential bequest per child:



                                                                             ()

where      and b. are defined above, and where c. is a random error term. Within

the context of our theoretical sodel, one can think of equation (9) as a linear

approximation to the implicit function defined by (8), agreated over benef i—

ciaries.
                                           —22—


     Our first step was to estimate equation (9) using 015.20 Results are pre-

sented as equation 1 in Table 1. While the sign of the coefficient on b. is

consistent with our theory, one cannot reject the hypothesis that bequeathable

wealth holdings have no effect on attention per child.

    There are, however, a variety of reasons for believing that 015 estimates

of this relationship may be inconsistent. One reason follows directly from the

structure     of our model: explicit consideration of the "demand" side suggests
that b will      be determined endogenously. The parent's optimal choice of

b depends in part upon the preferences of his children, and           is an important

component of these preferences. Thus, as long as the parent has more infor-

mation about the preferences of his children than does the econometrician,

   and        will be correlated. The direction of the resulting bias is, however,

ambiguous.

     Correlation between b and          is likely to be present for other reasons as

well. Stepping outside the formal model of the last section, one particularly

plausible story is that some parents get along well with their children, while

others do not.21 Those that do may hold more bequeathable wealth simply because

they like their children, while the children in turn nay be attentive simply

because they like their parents.

        Our   solution to this set of problems is to instrument for b.1 in ejuation
(9), using the parents' lifetime earnings y.. We justify this choice of
instrument as follows. It is clear that lifetime earnings are positively        corre—

lated    with holdings of bequeathable wealth. We trust establish    that, in :tddi—


tion,    this instrument is uncorrelated with ci     For our first   story, y may be
                                           —23—


 correlated with c. if   parents   work harder when young, so that they have more

wealth with which to influence their children when old. For our second story,

this correlation may be non—zero if the elderly parents whose children par-

ticularly like them have been particularly hardworking (or lazy).22 Although one

could, in both cases, plausibly argue that the correlation is non—zero, it is

difficult to believe that it is very large.

     2SLS estimates of equation (9)     are presented in column 2 of   Table 1.

Notice that the coefficient of b is approximately eight times as large as the

corresponding OLS estimate, and that the hypothesis of no effect on attention

can be rejected at extremely high levels of confidence. This regression con-

firms our prediction that, in multiple child families, bequeathable wealth will

be strongly correlated with attention.

     The apparently striking difference between OLS and 2SLS estimates can be

tested formally. A Hausman (1978) test reveals that exogeneity of b. can be

rejected at a high level of confidence. This conclusion is consistent with our

model (in which b and a are simultaneously determined), and constitutes

limited evidence in favor of an operative "demand" side. One should, of course,

bear in mind that this rejection of exogeneity is also consistent with other

alternatives. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the particular alternative

outlined above (correlation between filial and parental altruism) implies that

OLS estimates of the coefficient on b should be biased upwards. In fact, we

observe the opposite.

    While our theoretical nedel offers one explanation for the set of results

described above, the observed correlation between attention and bequeathable
wealth could also be attributed to a number of spurious factors. We now turn to

the task of ruling out these alternative explanations.

     One might object that our basic specification omits a number of important

variables with which both attention and bequeathable wealth are highly corre-

lated. For example, healthy parents may be rmre pleasant to visit (or conver-

sely, less needy of attention), as well as more successful in the marketplace.

Older parents belong to a poorer cohort, and in general require more care.

Retired parents may have a greater desire for contact with children. We correct

for these difficulties by adding a vector of parental characteristics, Z, to

our basic specification:



                          +   + C.                                           (10)
     V. =
            o   +
                    1b.
In particular, Z. includes age, health dummies (BE., WH.), and a retirement

dumn (RET1). Results are presented as equation 3 in Table 1. The inclusion of

these additional variables appears to have very little impact on either the

magnitude or statistical significance of the coefficient on b..

     Another apparently compelling objection is that wealth may al'fect attention

through a variety of spurious channels. For example, parents with higher wealth

may simply pay for travelling expenses, telephone calls,and so forth in order to

have re contact with their children. Wealth effects may also be less direct.

In particular, there is presumably a positive correlation between the incomes of

parents and their children. A wealthy child may be more difficult to influence,

or more desirable to visit. Wealthy children may be more capable of defraying

the costs of travel and telephones, buy may also, on average, live farther from
                                         —25—


their parents. Thus, the direction of the potential bias is not obvious.

     Note, however, that these alternative explanations do not distinguish bet-

ween bequeathable and non—bequeathable (social security and pension annuity)

wealth, as does our theory. A parent's ability to defray the costs of contact

is determined both by his ordinary wealth, and by his claims on annuities.

Similarly, while it is true that the wealth of children is correlated with

parental resources, it is not likely to be highly correlated with the division

of parental resources between bequeathable and non—bequeathable forms. Thus, in

order to determine the magnitude of spurious wealth effects, we add annuity

wealth (awi) to our basic specification:



     V. =    + 51b. + 32aw.   +
                                  Zy +                                        (11)

The effect of holding another dollar of wealth in bequeathable form is then

given by the difference between the coefficients on b and aw.      —    •23

     Estimates of specification (11) are presented as equation   in Table 1.

Note that the coefficient of aw (the spurious wealth effect) is negative and

statistically significant, while the coefficient on b. is positive, and highly

significant. The effect of holding wealth in bequeathable rather than

annuitized form, given by the difference between these coefficients, is esti-

mated to be 6.36, with a standard error of 1.89. Thus, correcting for spurious

wealth effects only strengthens our original conclusion.

    Another possible solution to the problem of spurious wealth effects is to

restrict attention to a subsample for which these effects are likely to be unim—

portant. If the source of contamination concerns ability to pay, then such
                                                  —26—


effects may be minimized by considering a subsample for which financ.al costs of

contact are negligible. Presumably, geographic proximity eliminates much of

these costs. Fortunately, the LRILS             contains    relevant information. In Table 2,

we reestimate equation (11) for two subgroups: parents whose children all live

within the same city or neighborhood, and parents whose children all live within

150 miles. The parameter estimates are quite close to those obtained for the

entire sample. In fact, the effect of bequeathable wealth on attention appears

to be largest for parents living in closest proximity to their children.

     A related objection concerns the inclusion of housing wealth in our

measure of b1. It has been suggested to us that a positive coefficient on

             simply   reflect the fact that children prefer to visit parents who live
b1 may
in nice houses. To accomodate this objection, we reestimated equation (11),

substituting bequeathable non—housing wealth (bnh1) for b. Our results were

as follows:


     V.         .150 +     5.142   bnh. — 1.50        aw.

Despite the fact that most elderly individuals hold a large fraction of their
portfolios in residential housing, these estimates are very close to those pre-

sented in Table 1. On the basis of this evidence, we are inclined to reject

the hypothesis that our            results   are simply an artifact of sote special feature

of housing wealth.

     As a final check on the robustness of our results, we reestimated
                                             —27—


 equation (n) separately for each of our sample years. Estimates based on

 cross section data from 1969, 1971, and 1975 are presented in Table 3. Note

 that the coefficients of interest (those on b. and awi) are extremely stable

 over the sample period.

        So far, our empirical analysis has been solely concerned with establishing

a link between attention and bequeathable wealth, and with ruling out alter-

native explanations based on potentially spurious factors. We now explore some

other implications of the particular xdel developed in section I which dif-

ferentiate it from closely related alternatives, and use these implications to

test the model.

        First,   a number of the variables included in          should   affect the "price"
at   which attention can be purchased, as well as the absolute amount of attention

supplied by children. Consider, for example, the variable WH (worse health).

Although    sick parents may   recieve more attention simply due to filial devotion,

on   a more cynical   view, illness increases the probability of death, thereby

making a potential bequest of fixed magnitude more valuable to the child, To

differentiate between these effects, we reestimated equation (ii), adding

                            and
                                  WH. BH. and AOE.2b The results presented in Table
interactions between b1

  are quite striking. Only three coefficients are statistically significant:

those on aw., WH., and WH .       b..   The coefficient of awi changes very little

from our original estimate. The coefficient of WI-I. is          negative, indicating
that,   aside from exchange motivated concerns, sick parents receive less atten-

tion. In contrast, the coefficient of               •
                                                        b. is large and positive. This

strongly suggests that, for multiple child families, rich parents who are in
                                      —28—


poor health receive much more attention than their indigent counterparts. Once

again, the data suggest significant financial rmtivation.

    A second strong implication of our particular theory is that exchange

motivated holding of bequeathable wealth can influence the behavior of potential

beneficiaries only if there are at least two credible candidates.

Unfortunately, as mentioned above, there is no way to determine the number of

such candidates for any particular respondent in the LRHS. However, logically

speaking, our theory admits the possibility that children are, in some meaning-

ful sense, the only credible beneficiaries for the bulk of a parent's estate.

This hypothesis can be tested empirically by investigating behavior in single

child families, and comparing them to our multiple child results. We must

emphasiie that this hypothesis is not a consequence of our theory; thus, failure

to differentiate between behavior in single and multiple child families would

not recommend rejection of our theory. However, the absence of a positive

correlation between attention and bequeathable wealth in single child familes

would strongly support our theory, as well as the supplemental hypothesis

that parents cannot credibly threaten to disinherit all of their children.

     These considerations motivated us to reestiniate each specification above

using data on single child families. A representative set of results is pre-

sented in Table 5. Note that in equations 1 through 14, the pattern of signs on

the coefficients of b and aw1 is precisely the opposite of that obtained for

multiple child families. In addition, the standard errors of coefficients on

key parameters are relatively small. It is worth noting that the coefficient of

    in these regressions is quite close to the magnitude of the spurious wealth
                                        —29—


effect estimated for Imiltiple child families.25 This is what one would expect,

since b. is no longer "contaminated" by an exchange motivated effect. The only

troubling aspect of these estimates is that there appears to be a statistically

significant difference between the coefficients of b1 and awi. presumably,

aw1 should carry only the spurious wealth effect as well. Strictly speaking,

this is inconsistent with our model. Note finally that in equation 5, worse

health continues to have a negative impact on attention (although the magnitude

is not statistically significant); however, there is no evidence that this can

be compensated for by high bequeathable wealth holdings, as in rrultiple child

families. This evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that exchange

motivated bequests take place only in families with at lest two children; thus,

children are usually the only credible beneficiaries. It is difficult to recon-

cile this conclusion with any known model of bequests other than that presented

in section I.

       One possible alternative explanation of the differing results for single

child famiiles runs as follows. Suppose children are altruists, but they are

primarily concerned with making certain that their parents receive a particular

amount of total care and attention from all children. Then within any sample of

families with the same number of children (such as single child families), there

will be no observed relationship between attention and bequeathable wealth.

However, comparing families with different number of children but the same total

level of bequeathable wealth, one would find a correlation between attention per

child and bequeathable wealth per child ——     children   "shirk" in larger families.

As   long as total wealth is not too highly positively correlated with the number
                                       —30—


of children (which seems plausible), one would observe a positive correlation

between wealth per child and attention per child in the "several children" sub-

sample, but no such correlation anon6 single child famIlies.

      Note that this argument does not entirely succeed in explaining the results

of this section, since it applies equally well to both bequeathable and annuity

wealth. Our case is predicated upon the difference between these coefficients.

Nevertheless, as a further check of robustness, we reestiniated equation (11)

separately for two and three child families. Results are presented in Table 6.

For   both groups, key parameter estimates are very close to those obtained for

the original sample. We must qualify this conclusion only by noting that the

standard error for the coefficient of b in three child families is substan-

tially larger than either that obtained for two child families, or for the

pooled sample. We interpret these results as additional strong support for the

exchange nxtivated bequest hypothesis.

       A further remark on the difference between single and multiple child fami-

lies is in order. Just as it is difficult to see how this difference could be

reconciled with any other known theory of bequests, it is also difficult to see

why any explanation   of our multiple—child results based on potentially ptxrious
factors   would not apply equally well to single child families. Thus, our

results   refute any alternative explanation which fails to account for the
single/multiple child distinction. We believe that this makes the empirical

case for our theory compelling.

       Taken as a whole, the preceding estimates are extremely favorable to our

model. It is therefore important to emphasize that our results were extremely
                                       —31—


 robust, and that these estimates are representative of other regressions which

we ran, but did not include in this paper. Aside from some problems with

selecting a proper subsample (for example, one preliminary sample inadvertently

included observations of which children lived at home, making interpretation of

visits and telephone calls difficult), our procedures produced favorable results

on the first try, and subsequent modifications altered no substantive conclu-

sions. Full disclosure requires that we report three apparent "failures.'t

First, OtIS estimates of all but the simplest specification (equation 1, Table 1)

yielded negative coefficients on b.. This is not surprising in light of our

arguments concerning the endogeneity of b. in fact, we submit that the discre-

pancy between OtIS and 2SLS estimates strengthens the case for an operative

"demand" side. Second, attempts to estimate a fixed effects version of the model

produced nonsensical coefficients with large standard errors. However, since no

sensible instrument is available for fixed effects estimation (there is only one

observation on lifetime earnings for each respondent), we were not troubled by

this finding. Finally, estimates based on an alternative measure of attention

(letters received from children) were much less striking.   Although the pattern

of coefficients was consistent with our theory (the coefficient of b. was

greater than the coefficient for aw for multiple child families, and visa versa

for single child families), alternative hypotheses could not be rejected with

any reasonable level of confidence. Upon reflection we decided that the letters

variable was not a very satisfactory proxy for attention since parents who were

frequently visited persunably received few letters.

    Estimates of    —
                        82 have a very tangible interpretation: since holding an
                                         —32—


                                                                   —        units of
additional dollar of wealth in bequeathable forms elicits              B2

attention, one can infer from these coefficients a "price" of attention. e

undertake the following rough calculations to et some feel for magnitudes.

                                                       —        - 6) imply that
Under the normalization employed, our estimates            B2

increasing bequeathable wealth per child by roughly i6O ODD will raise                 from

0 (no attention) to 1 (maximum attention). If we interpret maximum attention as

52 contacts per child per year (each child visiting or calling once per week is

consistent with V1 =   i),   then holding bequeathable wealth of approximately

$3,000 results in an additional visit per year, on average. The cost of holding

wealth in this form is the incremental return which the parent would have

received had he invested this money in annuities. If. for example, the return

sacrificed is 2 percent, then our estimates imply that an additional visit or

call costs the parent $60 on the margin.26 This figure is, of course, very

imprecise, but not implausible.


III. Other Evidence

     The preceding econometric analysis of the LRHS data favors the view that

exchange plays an important role in bequest behavior. By and large the rcdic—

tions of our model are confirmed. At least some of these predictions are not

implications of alternative models of bequest behavior. Beyond this evidence,

there are a number of other aspects of individual behavior which are more easily

reconciled our model of exchange motivated bequests than with alternative for—

mulat ions.

      There are at least three alternative formulations to the present model of
                                      —33—



bequest behavior which have been widely studied. These are the "accidental

bequests," "bequests for their own sake" and "altruistic bequests" models. The

first, recently urged by Davies (1981), suggests that consumers do not have

bequest motives, and that bequests arise only as a consequence of uncertainty

about the date of death in conjunction with annuity market imperfections. A

second model, used by Blinder (19Th) and many others, assumes that consumers'

lifetime utility depends in part on the size of their bequest. On this view

bequests are a form of terminal consumption. A final possibility is the

"altruistic" view of bequests put forth by Barro (1974) and Becker (1974, 1981).

On this view parents maximize a utility function in which the utility of their

children also enters.

     Each of these formulations is inconsistent with the empirical observation

that consumers are reluctant to participate in annuity type arrangements even on

quite favorable terms. Moreover, the second and third formulations cannot

account for the apparent insignificance of gifts. We first review the available

evidence, then indicate why it contradicts the three standard models of bequest

behavior, and finally describe why such behavior is consistent with our model.

     Privately purchased annuities are a rarity in the American Economy. The

Retirement History Survey revealed that such annuities rarely represented more

than a very small fraction of wealth, and in most cases were not purchased at

all. Of course, this may well be due to the fact that adverse selection compli-

cates the working of this market.27 Perhaps more persuasive evidence comes from

the lack of market response to "reverse annuity mortgages." These instruments

allow individuals to annuitize their home equity. Even where they are offered
                                        314

 on relatively favorable terms, they do not appear to be well received.28    A simi-
 lar conclusion is suggested by the lack of a response to a California state

 program which allowed property owners to defer property taxes until after their

 death, on a subsidized basis.29

     Perhaps the strongest evidence of consumer resistance to annuities comes

 from an examination of the choices made by retirees under the TIAA—CREF program.

This group is mainly comprised of educators who are presumably better informed

than most pension recipients. Retirees are offered several options, including

full annuities and "n year certain" plans.3° A 10
                                                  year certain plan, for
example, guarantees that a retiree and his heirs will receive at least 10
                                                                          years
worth of benefits, even if the retiree dies sooner.3' A 1913 study
                                                                   reported that
over 70 percent of beneficiaries chose plans other than those providing full

annuity protection.   This suggests a desire to make allowances for bequests.

     This evidence suggests that there is no strong latent demand on the
                                                                         part of
aged Americans for annuity protection, and is

"accidental bequestt' model. On this view individuals should purchase annuity

protection even if it is very unfair actuarily, since bequests are not value..1 at

all. In particular, the choice of "years certain't annuity protection directly

contradicts the "accidental bequests" model.

    Less obviously, the reluctance of consumers to t&ke advantage of actuarially

fair or subsidized annuities is inconsistent with the "bequests for their own

sake" and "altruistic" models of bequests. It is well known (see, for example,

Sheshinski and Weiss (1981) or Bernheim (l98lb)) that under such for.xlations,

consumers who have access to actuarially fair annuity markets will
                                                                     perfectly
                                        —35—



insure,   financing consumption entirely out of annuity income. An underan—

nuitized individual will finance consumption partly out of bequeathable wealth,

while an overannujtjzed individual will save some fraction of his annuity

income, thereby building an estate. Thus, if an individual consumes some por-

tion of either the principal or income from his bequeathable wealth, we infer

that he is underannuitized, and should take advantage of actuarially fair oppor-

tunities to purchase annuities.

     There are two reasons to believe that individuals hold bequeathable wealth,

in part to finance their own personal consumption. First, despite the earlier

findings of Brittain (1978) and Mirer (1979), more recent studies by King arid

Dicks—Mireaux (1983), Diamond and Hausman (1983), and Berriheim (l98Ia) suggest

that retirees do dissave from bequeathable wealth. Second, if bequeathable

wealth is held only for the purpose of making intergenerational transfers, then

these transfers would be made as gifts, rather than as bequests at death. Early

transfer confers two advantages: it allows beneficiaries to annuitize the opti—

inal fraction of transferred resources immediately; and it may ease liquidity

constraints encountered by beneficiaries early in the life cycle.32

     To summarize: behavioral evidence suggests that individuals hold

bequeathable wealth in part to finance personal consumption. Under either the

"bequests   for their own sake" or "altruistic" models, this implies that   such

individuals are   underanriuitized, and should take advantage of actuarially fair

opportunities to insure. Yet this prediction is counterfactual.

     The reluctance of very wealthy individuals to convert bequests into intra

vivos gifts poses a further puzzle for these alternative theories. Despite the
                                           —36—



existence   of significant tax advantages to transferring resources during lifeti-

mes, many wealthy individuals who can anticipate leaving large bequests with

virtual certainty, do not make significant intra vivos gifts. This observation

has disturbed some proponents of dynastic altruism, who recognize that an impor-

tant implication of this model is that families will con.jure their affaris to

minimize total tax liability. While some (notably Adams (1978)) have defended

dynastic altruism by arguing that, contrary to Shoup (1966),       Cooper (1979),    and

Menchik (1980), tax minimizing transfers are in fact observed, we find this

claim implausible.33

     The exchange motivated bequest model described in Section I does not share

these counterfactual implications concerning the acceptance of annuities and the

use of gifts. Since parents do not care about their children's consumption

directly, there is no reason to smooth out transfers over states of nature.

Furthermore, by making all intentional transfers at once, the parent attenuates

his ability to influence his children in subsequent periods. Finally, it is

quite likely that it is easier to influence children by promising bequests, as

opposed to gifts. Few families are so mercenary as to countenance explicit quid

o 2. contracts;      thus, the lure of gifts tends to be     more speculative than a
claim on a known estate, and vague promises of contemporaneous rewards are sub-

ject to equivocation by parents who would prefer to retain resources, ex post.

     A common finding in empirical analyses of bequests (Sussman et.al. (1970),

Brittain (1978), Menchik (1980fl1 is that, in most cases, parents give equal

amounts to each of their offspring. In part, this conclusion may arise from

focusing    primarily on cash   rather   than the more difficult to value tangible
                                          —37—



bequests.    The model here nakes no prediction that bequests should be equal

across children, except by coincidence or if beneficiaries are identical. Equal

bequests pose an equal or greater problem for the altruistic model, which issues

the clear prediction that bequests should be used to equate as closely as

possible the utilities of various offspring.35 The implication that, in effect,

parents impose 100 percent tax rates on their children's other income is clearly

counterfactual. The other two models of bequests do not have any clear itnplica-

tions for this issue.

       So far we have been content to infer motives indirectly from behavioral

observations. Studies by Sussrnan et.al.     (1970) and Horioka (1983) offer much
more direct evidence on the nature of bequest motives. Both studies confirm the

significance of exchange motivated bequests.

       Sussman et.al. conducted a painstaking study   of   close to 1,000 estates

selected from Cleveland probate court. They document the use of bequests as a

means of payment by finding a significant effect of intrafamily exchange on

deviations from equal division of bequests. In case after case, "reciprocity

was expressed through the distribution to particular children for services ren-

dered to parents," so that "children who took care of their elders ...       received
the largest share of the parentts property or the only share if the estate was

very   small" (p.   290). Disinheritance was usually a side effect of' rewarding a

specific child for care given in old age (p. 103), although some parents speci-

fically disinherited children who ignored them.

       It is important to emphasize that both testators and beneficiaries clearly

perceived and consciously exploited opportunities for exchange involving
                                       —38—


bequests. Testators frequently left most of their estates to spouses in jart so

that the spouses would "have a legacy to use in bargaining for services from

children and others later on" (p. 290). Likewise, "children feel that they

should maintain intimate contract with a6ed parents in order to provide them

with emotional support and social and recreational opportunities, and that such

contact maintenance is requisite for obtaining a share of the inheritance" (p.

119). When interviewed, children "generally accept the notion that the sibling

who has rendered the greatest amount of service to the aged parent should

receive a major portion of the inheritance" (p. 118), and usually prefer that

bequests be divided according to the principle of reciprocity (p. 1b8).

     Rorioka (1983) reproduces the results of a survey      of attitudes of the
elderly in Japan toward the distribution of the   ir   assets among their children,

35.1 percent of the respondents indicated that they would "give more to the

child or children who did more for me." This, however,       should be thought of   as


a lower bound on the significance of exchange motivated bequests. The tradi-

tional pattern in Japanese families is for the eldest son to move in with and

care for his elderly parents until their deaths, at which time he receives the

entire estate. Thus, the 43.2 percent of respondents who indicated that they

would "give all to the eldest son" may have simply announced their equilibrium

choices, having already received cooperation from that child. It is worth

noting that only 12.1 percent said that they would "divide equally between one's

children," while only 4.3 percent were inclined to 'give to the child who is ill

or physically weak or who has no income—earning power." Thus, neither

utilitarian   nor altruistic motives appear to be particularly prevalent.

IV. Mac roeconomic iplicatio

     In the preceding section, we developed the implications of our mud1 for

several aspects of individual behavior, and contrasted these with predictions

based on alternative xjdels. This section focuses on the macroeconomic implica-

tions of exchange ntivated bequests.

     Our paper provides an example of an environment in which parents and

children are linked by voluntary utility maximizing intergenerational trinsfers,

but for which the "Ricardian equivalence theorem" and related propositions are

nevert1ieless false. The implications of our formulation for issues such as the

effects of Social Security and government indebtedness on capital formation

correspond very closely to the implications of standard life—cycle model.3b To

see this, observe that the bequests made         parents are independent of the eco—

nomic welfare of their children, except to the extent that changes in their eco-

nomic welfare affect their supply curve of attention. Note that the sin of the

effect of an increase in children's economic welfare on bequests (parental

"expenditures"     on attention) will depend on whether the elasticity of dcmtnd for

attention   is   greater or less than unity.

     Several reasons for preferring the current model to the "dynastic a t 'uism"

formulation of Barro were discussed in the preceding sections. We are wuware

of any direct microeconomic evidence favoring the notion of altruistic h1ucts.

Until such evidence is provided, economists should be cautious about jutifying

the analytical use of infinite lived consumers by appealing to dynastic

altruism.

     The ndel developed here suggests a number of potentially important
interactions between demographic and economic phenomena.    By condftioning

bequests on behavior, parents may successfully influence decisions by their

children concerning education, migration, and marriage.    The desire to purchase

services from children, coupled with the need to have at least      two credible
beneficiaries, may also affect fertility. This could, for    example, account for
Park's (1983) observation that Korean households have a    strong   preference for

two male children, and could strengthen theories of the so—called "demoraphic

transition" based on parental desire for care during old age. The model also

suggests that various exogenous demographic trends will have specific economic

effects. Declining population growth means more single child families, and

therefore less incentive to save to purchase attention.     For similar reasons,

rising life expectancies, longer retirement periods, and increasing geographic

mobility may   all   affect the national savings rate. These and related issues are

discussed in Bernheim (l98c).

     The model also suggests that international variations in savings rates may

be related to differences in family structure, as well as to legal institutions

governing the distribution of estates. For example, Horioka's evidence indica-

tes that exchange motivates the division of bequests in many Japanese house-

holds. In addition to the survey of attitudes discussed in section III, he

documents that over 80 percent of elderly Japanese live with their children,

compared to approximately 10 percent for the U.S. This may help to account for

Japan's high rate of saving. In contrast, certain European countries such as

Sweden (see Blornquist (1919)) require testators to divide the bulk of their

estates evenly between their children. This restriction neutralizes the ruecha—
nism outlined in Section I, and removes a strong incentive for accumulating

bequeathable wealth.

     Our analysis also suggests a subtle but possibly important side effect of

the growth of Social Security and the spread of annuitized private pensions.

The model here provides a partial explanation for consumers' reluctance to

purchase annuities at even relatively attractive rates: annuities deny con—

sumers the opportunity to purchase care and attention from their children

(although much of the actual aversion to annuities is undoubtably based on

ignorance and confusion). If Social Security or pensions foist more annuity

protection   on consumers than they wish, a collateral consequence will be that

consumers are able to purchase less attention than they would prefer. A general

decline in attentiveness of children to parents is widely alleged to have taken

place since the introduction of Social Security (see for example Friedman

(1980)). The significance of the effect stressed here is of course difficult to

gauge.37

     This research could usefully be ectended in a number of directions. The

theoretical model could be elaborated to allow more fully for the element of

"caring" which explains why   parents   crave attention from their own   children. It
would also be valuable to explore models in which more elaborate interactions

between children were possible. Empirically, the insights siiested by        this
model could be used to inform econometric analyses of the consumption and port-

folio choices of the aged. In addition, it might be useful to use simulation

techniques to examine the relation between bequests of the type modelled here

and the level or capital formation. It is unlikely that any     of   these extensions

would cast doubt on ir conclusion that the exchange imtive is centr-i.1 to

the economic analysis of bequests.

                                  Footnotes

1. The significance of intergenerational transfers is still the subject of
    much debate. Tobin (1961) and Davies (1981) present simuiLation results
    which indicate that pure Life Cycle motives are sufficient to account for
    the bulk of U.S. capital.

2. Brittain (1978) and Mirer (1979) document continued accumulation of wealth
    after retirement. Shorrocks (1975), King and Dicks—rireaux (1981), and
    Diamond and Hausman (1983) find limited evidence to dispute this claim.
    Bernheini (1984a) confirms this finding, but demonstrates that behavioral
    responses of rates of decumulation to non—discretionary annuities are
    inconsistent with the predictions of simple life cycle models.

3. As long as it is impossible for a potential beneficiary to predecease the
    testator, relaxing this restriction simply involves adjusting the discount
    factors of children to account for survival probabilities after period T.
    Althugh the analysis becomes more complex when it is possible for children
    to die first (we must worry about what happens for all possible patterns of
    deaths), it is possible to show that, even in this case, our basic conclu-
    sions are unchanged.

4. In the case of parents and children, such actions might include attention,
    care, or choice of the "right" spouse. For institutional beneficiaries,
    a t might for example represent naming a building after a potential testa—
    to.

5. Notice that in the current formulation single period utility does not
    depend directly upon whether the testator is alive (the dependence is
    indirect, since we will never observe a > 0 once the testator has
    died). This restriction is convenient, lut inessential.

6. Time separability of utilities simplifies the method of solution. We doubt
    that our basic insights would be changed in a more general model.

7. Allowing exogenous future income for potential beneficiaries would not
    alter the analysis at all. Allowing testators to receive some exogcnous
    income would not affect the qualitative conclusions as long as desired
    wealth held by the testator is always strictly positive.

8. It is in the testators's interest to hold his wealth in easily observed
    forms. This may provide a partial explanation of the notorious reluctance
    of the elderly to sell their houses (although there are certainly other
    factors involved).

9. Limiting the set of potential beneficiaries does involve some notion of
    altruism which extends only to a certain class of individuals or intitu—
    tions. In this very limited sense the bequests considered here are
    altruistic.

10. There may be many bequest rules which sustain {a, b}1 as an equilibrium
    in the appropriate subgame. However, the perfect equilibrium will be uni-
    que in the sense that any such equilibrium must yield C, {a, b}1 on
    the equilibrium path.

11. We suggest two reasons: (i) for all e > 0 if the testator sets benchmark
     levels at a — c rather than a and otherwise employs the same rule, there
     is a unique Nash equilibrium consisting of all agents meeting their bench-
     marks. In other words, the testator can get arbitrarily close to his opti-
     mum without running into the problem of multiplicity, (2) the N undesirable
     equilibria are not trembling hand perfect (see Selten (1975)). Consider
     the potential beneficiary who sets a = 0, while expecting his competitors
     to offer their benchmark levels. He cannot be worse off by playing a =
                                                                         that
     an*. In addition, if he thinks there is any chance, however small,
     another beneficiary will make a mistake ("tremble"), thereby missing his
     benchmark level, a* will in that event yield strictly higher utility than
    a = 0.
12. For t = T we adopt the convention that VT÷l (WT+1, {w T+1n=1 = 0
    since the testator is no longer living.

13. Note that in this problem, we do not allow the testator to choose consump-
     tion levels for the beneficiaries. This is so because we have restricted
     bequest rules to depend on actions only. It might be possible for the
     parent to condition bequests on the beneficiary's consumption as well.
     Although in our model this makes no difference, in another specification it
     may be in parent's interest to do this. It is straightforward to modify
     the model so that such strategies are permissible.

1. Assume it does not bind. Then the testator can successfully deaind more
     attention from each beneficiary without holding more bequeathable wealth.
     This directly increases utility. However, there is also an indirect
     effect. Changing ak will alter the beneficiary's optimal level of Cn t
     thus changing W t+) This has an ambiguous effect on           It seems
     quite unlikely tftat such secondary effects would dominate.

15. Specifically, we include those who began to receive pensions and Social
     Security at some point during the sample.

16. Note that our theory predicts that use of bequests to obtain attention
     should be more effective when there is only one parent. By considering
     couples, we presumably stack the odds against finding evidence of
     exchange.

17. For some years,the survey also asked for the number of children who visit
     or telephone daily; in other years, this was simply incorporated into the
     "at least weekly" category. To be consistent over years, we added daily
     contact to weekly contact in years for which the former was available.

18. It is appropriate to include the face value of life insurance, since
     children wish to be named as beneficiaries. Unfortunately, data on life
     insurance are quite poor; in particular, it is impossible to determine how
     much individuals have borrowed against their policies. Omitting insurance
     from our definition of bequeathable wealth has an insignificant impact on
     the estimates presented in this section.

19. Most privately purchased "annuitiest' fail to match the economic definition,
     since they have bequeathable components.

20. Throughout, we have ignored potential problems arising from truncation of
     our dependent variable. There is little reason to believe that this biases
     our results in any particular direction.

21. Our goal here is only to suggest a significant exchange not ivated element
     in bequest behavior, not to deny that altruistic aspects are also present.

22. The direction of this correlation is not clear. If a parent likes his
     child, he may work harder to provide sore physical goods, or work less to
     spend more time with the child.

23. Equation (11) is equivalent to          =           +         —           +         +        +   where

     e'fects, and 81 —     is the independent effect o? holding wealth in a
                        82
     bequeathable form.

2.&. For the 2SLS regressions, we included interactions between lifetime income
     and WH, BH, and AGES in the instrument list.

25. That is, it equals the coefficient on annuity wealth in the equations pre-
     sented in Table 1.

26. The one year probability of dying is 2.9 percent for 65 year old males and
     1.5 percent for 65 year old females. The 2 percent figure assumes approxi-
     mate fairness of available annuities.

27. Though one would expect the adverse selection to be much more serious in
     the relatively well functioning market for life insurance. Warshawsky
     (1983) presents evidence that loads on annuities are comparable to loads on
     life insurance.

28. For a survey of the evidence on this topic see A Summary of Recent Research
     on Inflation and the Elderly, by Urban Systems Research and Engineering,
     1983.

29. See URSE (1983).

30. Annuity amounts are set so that the plans are, in principle, equivalent on
     an actuarial basis, see TIAA—CREF (1973).

31. In each case, provision is rde for surviving spouses.

32. Note also that the failure of parents to transfer their homes to their
     children is inconsistent with the Kotlikoff—Spivak view that families serve
     to provide private annuity insurance.

33. Adams overstates the burden of the capital gains tax hy neglecting the fact
     that the beneficiary can defer realizing any assets with capital gains, and
     can use a variety of other devices to shelter them. Nor does his analysis
     explain the failure of most families to set up non—reverting trusts which
     allow assets, and in some cases capital income as well to escape tax almost
     entirely. Lastly, Adams' analysis cannot explain why assets without capi-
     tal gains, or even with capital losses, also appear to be transferred as
     gifts only infrequently.

34. Disputed, however, by Tomes (1981).

35. Assuming they enter symmetrically the parent's utility function.

36. Barro (1974, footnote 14) himself notes that the Ricardian equivalence
     theorem would not hold if exchange played a large role in motivating
     bequests.

37. The model also implies that Social Security offsets private savings by less
     than one for one.
