                                           ABSTRACT

Violations of Tinbergen rule and strategic interaction undermine monetary and financial policies
in a New Keynesian model with the Bernanke-Gertler accelerator. Welfare costs of risk shocks
are large because of efficiency losses and income effects of costly monitoring, but they are larger
under a simple Taylor rule (STR) and a Taylor rule augmented with credit spreads (ATR) than
under a dual rules regime (DRR) with a Taylor rule and a financial rule targeting spreads, by 264
and 138 basis points respectively. ATR and STR are tight money-tight credit regimes that
respond too much to inflation and too little to spreads, and yield larger fluctuations in response to
risk shocks. Reaction curves display shifts from strategic substitutes to complements in the choice
of policy-rule elasticities. The Nash equilibrium is also a tight money-tight credit regime, with
lower welfare than Cooperative equilibria and the DRR, but still higher than in the ATR and STR
regimes.

1       Introduction
   A broad consensus formed after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis around the ideas of imple-
menting macroprudential financial regulation and incorporating financial stability considerations
into monetary policy analysis. Putting these ideas into practice has proven difficult, however,
partly because of heated debates surrounding two key questions: First, should financial stability
considerations be added into monetary policy rules or be dealt with using separate financial policy
rules? Second, if separate rules are used, should financial and monetary authorities coordinate
their actions? For instance, Cúrdia and Woodford (2010), Eichengreen, Prasad and Rajan (2011),
and Smets (2014), among others, have argued that central banks should react to financial stability
conditions (i.e. lean against the wind), even if there is a separate financial authority. In contrast,
Svensson (2014, 2015) and Yellen (2014) favor having a different authority addressing financial
imbalances, while keeping the central bank focused on price stability.1

    This paper provides quantitative answers to the above questions using a New Keynesian model
with the Bernanke-Gertler financial accelerator. The model features two inefficiencies that justify
the use of monetary and financial policies. Monetary policy addresses the inefficiencies due to
staggered pricing by monopolistic input producers. Financial policy addresses the inefficiencies
due to costly state verification of entrepreneurs’ returns by financial intermediaries.

    The effectiveness of alternative policy regimes is assessed in terms of their implications for so-
cial welfare, macroeconomic fluctuations, policy targets, and the elasticities of policy rules. Mon-
etary policy is modeled as either a simple Taylor rule (STR) governing the nominal interest rate, or
an augmented Taylor rule (ATR) targeting both inflation and credit spreads. To study the relevance
of Tinbergen rule, we compare the effectiveness of the STR and ATR v. a dual rules regime (DRR)
with a Taylor rule and a separate financial policy rule. The latter targets the external finance pre-
mium using as policy instrument a subsidy on lenders that incentivizes lending when credit spreads
rise. To make these regimes comparable, we implement each with welfare-maximizing values of
the corresponding policy rule elasticities, defined as those that minimize welfare costs of risk
shocks. Welfare costs are measured as compensating lifetime-utility-equivalent consumption vari-
ations relative to a deterministic steady state with zero inflation, zero external financial premium,
and a subsidy neutralizing the distortion of monopolistic competition.

    To examine the importance of strategic interaction, we construct reaction curves in a strategy
space defined over the elasticities of the Taylor and financial policy rules. We construct grids of
these elasticities and compute the value of the elasticity that maximizes the payoff of the monetary
(financial) authority for each value of the financial (monetary) rule elasticity. The payoff functions
are in the class of quadratic loss functions widely used in monetary policy studies, defined in terms
of the sum of variances of the instrument and target of each authority (as in Taylor and Williams,
2010; Williams, 2010). We then compute Nash and Cooperative equilibria for one-shot games
between the two policy authorities, and contrast their implications for welfare and for policy rule
    1
    Other authors, such as De Paoli and Paustian (2017) or Angelini, Neri and Panetta (2014), study cooperation
between monetary and financial authorities, financial policy goals, and optimal policy arrangements.

elasticities.2 Since the case in which a planner sets the elasticities of both rules to maximize wel-
fare (i.e. the DRR with welfare-maximizing elasticities) is equivalent to the outcome of a game in
which both authorities share welfare as a common payoff, we label this the “Best Policy” scenario.

    The analysis is conducted using the risk-shocks framework proposed by Christiano, Motto and
Rostagno (2014), because risk shocks make financial policy more relevant by strengthening the
Bernanke-Gertler accelerator.3 Risk shocks affect the standard deviation of the entrepreneurs’ re-
turns on investment projects, which in turn affects the entrepreneurs’ probability of default altering
the supply of credit and investment. As banks cut lending, capital expenditures fall causing a de-
cline in the price of capital and in net worth, which triggers the financial accelerator. Since the
agency costs in the credit market result from a real rigidity, namely costly state verification, risk
shocks are akin to financial shocks that create inefficient fluctuations in credit spreads. Christiano
et al. argue that these shocks can explain about 60% of U.S. GDP fluctuations.

    We study monetary and financial policies in terms of rules, rather than optimal Ramsey poli-
cies, because of the widespread use of the Taylor rule for evaluating monetary policy in DSGE
models, and because Ramsey optimal financial policies often require global, non-linear solution
methods and have been solved mainly in parsimonius models (see Bianchi and Mendoza, 2018).
For monetary policy, it is well-known that the Taylor rule can be the Ramsey optimal policy when
the policymakers’ payoffs are quadratic functions of target variables (or linear in their variances),
but it has also been established that in most widely-used DSGE models the Taylor rule is not the
Ramsey optimal policy under commitment.4 Still, policymakers act optimally in our setup, in the
sense that they set the elasticities of their rules so as to maximize explicit payoff functions.

    In the model we propose, Tinbergen rule applies because two instruments are needed to tackle
two inefficiencies (sticky prices and costly state verification). Hence, the question is not whether
Tinbergen rule is valid in the model, but whether it is quantitatively relevant. In particular, whether
there are important differences in policy rule elasticities, welfare, and the macro effects of risk
shocks across the STR, ATR, and DRR regimes. Similarly, the result that incentives for strategic
interaction are present in the model is straightforward, so the contribution of the paper focuses
on whether strategic interaction is quantitatively significant for the effectiveness of financial and
monetary policies. Incentives for strategic interaction exist because the target variable of each au-
   2
      This methodology is analogous to the one used by Mendoza and Tesar (2005) to study international tax competi-
tion, and is also related to Dixit and Lambertini (2003)’s analysis of monetary-fiscal interactions.
    3
      We show in Section 4 that our results still hold if we add TFP, government expenditure, and input-price markup
shocks. With only TFP or government expenditure shocks, financial policy is less relevant because of the standard
result that in New Keynesian models solved with local methods the amplification produced by the Bernanke-Gertler
accelerator is small (see Appendix B.6). Financial policy is relevant with markup shocks only because they move
inflation and output in opposite directions, and hence financial policy complements monetary policy by reducing the
output loss of lowering inflation.

      Woodford (2010) reviews optimal monetary policy in New Keynesian models, including the conditions under
which monetary policy rules match Ramsey optimal policies. Bodenstein, Guerrieri and LaBriola (2014) analyze
strategic interaction in monetary policy between countries and in monetary v. financial policy in a Ramsey setup.

thority is influenced by the instruments of both authorities. Inflation is partly determined by the
effect of financial policy on investment and hence aggregate demand, and the credit spread is partly
determined by the effect of the nominal interest rate on the lenders’ participation constraint.

    The risk of costly strategic interaction between financial and monetary authorities is relevant
under various institutional arrangements that exist today. This is clearly the case in countries
where the two policies are set by separate authorities, or where financial policy is only partially the
purview of the central bank. But strategic interaction can still be an issue even in countries like the
United Kingdom, where the two policies are within the domain of the central bank but designed
by separate committees.

    The quantitative analysis yields four key results:

    (1) Welfare costs of risk shocks are large. Welfare in the three policy regimes is 3.9 to 6.5%
lower than in the deterministic stationary state, compared with typical measures of the cost of
U.S. business cycles of around 1/10 of a percent or of the cost of U.S. tax distortions of around
2%. This is the result of income effects and efficiency losses due to changes in the long-run av-
erages of the external finance premium and the resources allocated to monitoring costs, which in
turn result from the effects of risk shocks and costly monitoring on the stochastic stationary state.

    (2) Violating Tinbergen rule is very costly. Welfare is 264 and 138 basis points lower under
STR and ATR, respectively, than under DRR, and macro fluctuations in response to risk shocks
are markedly smoother with DRR. Hence, while “leaning against the wind” of financial conditions
is welfare-improving relative to not responding to financial conditions at all, the DRR regime is
significantly better. Moreover, the STR regime yields a higher inflation elasticity than the ATR
and DRR regimes, and by construction it does not respond to spreads. The ATR has a marginally
higher inflation response but again a much weaker response to spreads than the DRR. Hence, ATR
and STR are “tight money-tight credit” regimes: the interest rate responds too much to inflation
and not enough to adverse credit conditions. The STR and ATR violate Tinbergen rule, requiring
two instruments for two targets. One instrument cannot do as well at tackling the two sources of
inefficient fluctuations as the DRR does using two separate instruments. The DRR regime weak-
ens significantly the adverse long-run effects of risk shocks on the external finance premium and
monitoring costs, and provides an insurance-like mechanism against risk shocks for consumption.

    (3) Reaction curves of monetary and financial authorities shift from strategic substitutes to
complements in the choice of policy rule elasticities. For the monetary authority, the best elasticity
response for the Taylor rule is a strategic substitute of the elasticity of the financial rule if the latter
is sufficiently high but a strategic complement otherwise (i.e. the monetary authority’s reaction




                                                     4
function shifts from downward to upward sloping if the financial rule elasticity is high enough).5
The reaction function of the financial authority is convex, with the elasticity of the financial rule
changing from strategic complement to substitute as the elasticity of the monetary rule increases.

    (4) Strategic interaction is quantitatively significant. The Nash equilibrium yields a welfare
loss of about 30 basis points relative to the Best Policy scenario or cooperative equilibria with ei-
ther equal welfare weights or weights “optimized” to yield the smallest welfare cost. These cooper-
ative equilibria yield welfare outcomes that are very similar to the Best Policy. The Nash outcome
yields again a tight money-tight credit regime relative to the Best Policy case. A Stackelberg game
with the financial authority as leader yields a similar outcome as the Nash equilibrium, but if the
monetary authority leads the Stackelberg game yields an even tighter money regime with a larger
welfare cost. In addition, the Nash equilibrium dominates the STR and ATR regimes by large mar-
gins, with welfare outcomes that are 234 and 108 basis points higher than each of these regimes,
respectively. Hence, even a regime in which separate authorities engage in non-cooperative Nash
competition is better than regimes with just a monetary rule (either STR or ATR).

    The gains from coordination arise because, around the Nash equilibrium, the reaction func-
tion of the monetary authority is almost at the point where the Taylor rule elasticity switches from
strategic substitute to complement of the financial rule elasticity, while the financial authority’s
best response is nearly independent of the elasticity choice of the monetary authority (albeit at a
higher level than under cooperation). This indicates that there are large adverse spillovers of finan-
cial subsidy changes on the volatility of inflation and/or interest rates through the model’s general
equilibrium dynamics. A small change in the financial rule elasticity around the Nash equilibrium
increases the volatility of inflation and the nominal interest rate sufficiently to justify an increase
in the elasticity of the monetary rule as the best response. Cooperation tackles these adverse
spillovers by correcting the tight money-tight credit nature of the Nash policy rules, which implies
lowering (increasing) the inflation (spread) elasticity relative to the Nash equilibrium. Without
coordination, this is not sustainable because both authorities have incentives to deviate, since the
cooperative equilibrium is not a point in either authority’s reaction function. At the symmetric co-
operative equilibrium, the financial authority acting unilaterally would aim to reduce its elasticity
sharply, and the monetary authority would increase its Taylor rule elasticity sharply.

    Our findings on Tinbergen rule are consistent with results from studies comparing standard with
augmented monetary policy rules by Angeloni and Faia (2013), Angelini et al. (2014), Kannan,
Rabanal and Alasdair (2012) and Quint and Rabanal (2014). Angeloni and Faia study a model with
bank runs and nominal rigidities driven by TFP shocks, quantifying the implications of monetary
and bank capital rules with given coefficients. They find that responding to financial conditions
always dominates in terms of welfare and output variability. Moreover, monetary rules with more
aggressive inflation responses are better, in line with our tight money result. Angelini et al. also
find that a monetary rule that responds to the loan-output ratio yields lower output variability than a
standard monetary policy rule, but did not examine welfare implications. Kannan et al. examine a
   5
    In our setup, lowering the elasticity of the financial rule when the elasticity of the Taylor rule rises means tight-
ening financial policy when monetary policy tightens. Thus, the policy rule elasticities are strategic complements
(substitutes) when reaction functions are downward (upward) sloping.

model with housing assuming that the credit spread is given by an exogenous function, increasing
in the borrowers’ leverage and in a financial policy instrument. In line with our findings, they find
that (using a variance loss function) ATR dominates STR, and a regime with separate monetary and
financial rules is best. Our work differs in that we examine risk shocks, derive the credit spread for
an optimal contract with financial policy, and study strategic interaction. Quint and Rabanal study
a two-country (core v. periphery) model with risk shocks in housing, and find that an ATR yields
higher welfare if it responds to nominal credit growth but not if it responds to the credit-GDP ratio.
Welfare assessments are complex, however, because the model separates savers and borrowers, and
financial policy can be costly for the latter. The augmented monetary rule can improve welfare in
the periphery because it can reduce macro volatility in that region.

    Our work is also related to Aoki, Benigno and Kiyotaki (2015), who analyze the quantitative
interaction between monetary and financial policy in a small open economy subject to world inter-
est rate shocks with financial frictions à la Gertler-Karadi-Kiyotaki. They compare welfare effects
for a small set of elasticity pairs of the Taylor rule and a tax on bank external debt for different
variances of interest-rate shocks and with fixed v. flexible prices. They do not study strategic in-
teraction or Tinbergen rule, but their findings are in line with ours in that they find that welfare
displays significant interaction effects as the two elasticities change, which are consistent with our
finding of shifts between strategic complements and substitutes in reaction functions: For suffi-
ciently high variance of interest-rate shocks, welfare is monotonically decreasing (increasing) as
the Taylor-rule elasticity rises for a lower (higher) elasticity of the financial rule.

    Finally, this paper is also related to the quantitative literature using DSGE models with financial
frictions to compare cooperative and noncooperative outcomes by Angelini et al. (2014), Boden-
stein et al. (2014), De Paoli and Paustian (2017) and Van der Ghote (2016). Our work differs in
that we consider the role of risk shocks, construct reaction curves to analyze strategic behavior
finding the changing incentives to adjust policy rule elasticities as strategic substitutes v. strate-
gic complements, and find nontrivial gains from policy coordination. De Paoli and Paustian find
that the gains from policy coordination are non-negligible in games without commitment and for
mark-up shocks, while for shocks to net worth or productivity the gains are negligible. Bodenstein
et al. solve for Nash equilibria with commitment using only TFP shocks and payoff functions with
a varying degree of bias in favor of inflation (for the central bank) and the credit spread (for the fi-
nancial authority), and find that gains from cooperation can be significant. Angelini et al. find that
the benefits of introducing financial policy, in the form of a time-varying capital requirement, are
substantial when financial shocks are the driver of business cycle, but policy coordination results in
small differences in output, inflation, and credit. Van der Ghote proposes a continuous time-model
with TFP shocks and an occasionally-binding leverage constraint but without capital accumulation.
He studies welfare-based payoff functions allowing financial policy to produce long-run efficiency
gains but using a tax to neutralize those resulting from price stability, and finds a modest gain from
coordinating policies of 0.21%.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 provides
a diagrammatic analysis of the effects of risk shocks and the interaction of financial and monetary
policies. Section 4 describes the calibration of the model and discusses the quantitative findings.
Section 5 presents conclusions.

2       Model Structure
   The model is based on the one proposed by Christiano et al. (2014) to introduce risk shocks into
the New Keynesian model with the Bernanke-Gertler financial accelerator developed by Bernanke,
Gertler and Gilchrist (1999), CMR and BGG, respectively hereafter. The model includes six types
of agents: a final-goods producer, a set of producers of inputs, a physical capital producer, a finan-
cial intermediary, entrepreneurs, and households. The model features Calvo staggered price-setting
by non-competitive input producers and costly state verification in financial intermediation. Since
our analysis focuses on stabilization policies, we introduce adjustments that neutralize the effects
of these frictions on the deterministic steady state. In particular, we postulate Taylor and financial
rules that yield zero inflation and zero external finance premium at steady state, respectively, and
introduce a time-invariant subsidy on input producers that removes the steady-state effect of mo-
nopolistic competition.6 Because asset markets are incomplete, however, alternative policy regimes
yield stochastic steady states that differ from the deterministic steady state due to differences in
long-run averages of monitoring costs and the external finance premium (as shown in Section 3).
Since several features of the model are similar to those in BGG and CMR, the presentation is kept
short. Full details are provided in Sections A.1-A.9 of the Appendix.

entrepreneurs rent out capital to input producers at a real rental rate zt+1 and sell the capital stock
that remains after production to a capital producer. The return gained by an individual entrepreneur
is affected by an idiosyncratic shock ωe,t+1 . Hence, an entrepreneur’s real return at time t + 1 is

ωe,t+1 rt+1 ke,t , where rt+1 is the aggregate real rate of return per unit of capital, given by
                                          k       zt+1 + (1 − δ)qt+1
                                         rt+1 ≡                      ,                                      (2.3)
                                                          qt
where δ is the rate of capital depreciation.

    The random variable ωe,t+1 is i.i.d. across time and entrepreneurs, with E(ωe,t+1 ) = 1, SD(ωe,t+1 )
= σω,t+1 , and a continuous and once-differentiable c.d.f., F (ωe,t+1 ), over a non-negative support.
Following CMR, the stochastic process of ωe,t+1 features risk shocks, which are represented by the
time-varying standard deviation σω,t+1 , with a long-run average σ̄ω . An increase in σω,t+1 implies
that F (ωe,t+1 ) widens.

    Entrepreneurs participate in the labor market by offering one unit of labor each period at the
real wage rate wte .7 Also, entrepreneurs have finite life horizons, with each entrepreneur facing
a probability of exit given by 1 − γ. This assumption prevents entrepreneurs from accumulating
enough wealth to be fully self-financed. Aggregate net worth in period t is thus given by
                                                nt = γvt + wte .                                            (2.4)
where vt is the aggregate equity from capital holdings of entrepreneurs who survive at date t,
which is defined in the next subsection. Entrepreneurs who exit at t transfer their wages to new
entrepreneurs entering the economy and consume part of their equity, such that cet = (1 − γ)%vt for
% ∈ [0, 1], and the remainder of their equity, At = (1 − γ) (1 − %) vt , is transferred to households.

2.3    The lender and the financial contract
   The financial intermediary takes deposits from households at the riskless rate Rt . Deposits are
used to fund risky loans to entrepreneurs. These loans are made before the entrepreneurs’ returns
are realized and these returns can only be verified at a cost.8 The optimal loan contract is modeled
following Bernanke and Gertler (1989), adding a financial subsidy on the lender’s participation
constraint as the instrument of financial policy.

    At time t, when the financial contract is signed, the idiosyncratic shock ωe,t+1 is unknown to
both the entrepreneur and the lender. At t + 1, if ωe,t+1 is higher than a threshold value ω̄e,t+1 ,
                                                    L
the entrepreneur repays her debt plus interest, re,t+1  be,t , where rtL is the gross real interest rate on
loans. If ωe,t+1 is lower than ω̄e,t+1 , the entrepreneur declares bankruptcy and gets nothing, while
   7
    As noted by BGG, this is necessary so that entrepreneurs have some net worth to begin operations.
   8
    For convenience, we express the returns of entrepreneurs and the lender in real terms, but we emphasize in the
lender’s participation constraint that the relevant opportunity cost of funds is the nominal interest rate Rt .

                                                        8
the lender audits the entrepreneur, pays the monitoring cost, and keeps any income generated by
the entrepreneur’s investment. The monitoring cost is a proportion µ ∈ [0, 1] of the entrepreneur’s
                       k
returns, i.e. µωe,t+1 rt+1 qt ke,t . The threshold value ω̄e,t+1 satisfies:
                                                     k              L
                                            ω̄e,t+1 rt+1 qt ke,t = re,t+1 be,t .                                      (2.5)
    The optimal contract sets an amount of capital expenditures and a threshold ω̄e,t+1 such that
the expected return of entrepreneurs is maximized subject to the lender’s participation constraint
                               k
holding for each value that rt+1    can take.9 The type sub-index can be dropped without loss of
generality to characterize the optimal contract. The expected return of entrepreneurs is:
                                                         k

                                     Et [1 − Γ(ω̄t+1 )] rt+1 qt kt ,                         (2.6)
                  R∞              R ω̄
where Γ(ω̄) = ω̄ ω̄ f (ω)dω + 0 ωf (ω)dω.10 The participation constraints of the lender satisfy
                                   k
this condition for each value of rt+1  :
                                                                       k

                  Rt
where rt =           is the ex-post real interest rate, which reflects the fact that the debt contracts
                1+πt+1
                                                    R ω̄
are denominated in nominal terms, µG(ω̄) = µ 0 ωf (ω)dω represents the expected monitoring
costs per unit of aggregate capital returns, and τf,t is a subsidy (a tax if negative) that the financial
authority provides to the financial intermediary on its net loan revenues, with the associated cost
financed with a lump-sum tax on households. The left-hand-side of equation (2.7) is the after-
subsidy lender’s income from lending to entrepreneurs, both those who default and those who
repay, net of monitoring costs, and the right-hand-side is the cost of funding all the loans.

    The optimal financial contract consists of the pair (qk, ω̄) that maximizes (2.6) subject to the
set of constraints (2.7). The first-order conditions of this problem are provided in Appendix A.3.
Since the subsidy is non-state-contingent, the results in BGG apply directly by simply considering
the after-subsidy interest rate determining funding costs Rt /(1 + τf,t ). Thus, the equilibrium in the
credit market can be summarized by the following external finance premium (efp) condition:
                                           k 
                                            r          s (xt )
                                       Et t+1 =                .                                  (2.8)
                                              rt      1 + τf,t
              k
The ratio Et rt+1  /rt is the efp or credit spread, xt ≡ qt kt /nt is aggregate leverage, and s(·) is a
function such that s(·) ≥ 1 and ∂s(·)/∂xt > 0 for nt < qt kt .

    The above expression reflects the equilibrium requirement that, for entrepreneurs that need ex-
ternal financing, the return to capital must equal the marginal external financing cost. efp depends
positively on the leverage ratio, because higher leverage reflects higher reliance on debt to finance
capital expenditures. The financial subsidy is akin to a subsidy on monitoring costs that lowers efp
   9
      The contract has an equivalent representation in terms of a loan amount and an interest rate. The loan size follows
from the fact that net worth is pre-determined when the contract is entered and qt ke,t = be,t + ne,t , and the interest
rate is given by condition (2.5).
   10
      For a given rk , notice that if ω ≥ ω̄ the returns of the entrepreneur are given by ωrk qk−rL b. RUsing equation (2.5),
                                                                                                         ∞
we can rewrite the last expression as (ω − ω̄) rk qk. Taking expectations with respect to ω yields ω̄ (ω − ω̄) rk qkdω,
which after some algebraic manipulations leads to (2.6).

                                                             9
for a given value of s(·). Risk shocks increase efp, because an increase in σω implies more risk, in
the sense of a higher probability of a low ω for entrepreneurs. This increases the interest rate that
financial intermediaries charge for loans, and thus s(·) rises.

    The credit spread is both the engine of the Bernanke-Gertler financial accelerator and an ef-
ficiency wedge in the allocation of capital. If entrepreneurs’ average net worth falls and is suf-
ficiently low relative to their assets to generate a positive credit spread, they are more likely to
default, which leads the financial intermediary to cut lending, which in turn reduces capital expen-
ditures and increases rk . This causes a decline in the price of capital, which reduces net worth
further and triggers the accelerator mechanism. Risk shocks operate through the same mechanism,
because an increase in σω,t also makes it more likely that entrepreneurs default, everything else the
same. Conversely, the financial subsidy aims to offset the higher spreads and adverse amplification
effects that would otherwise result from shocks that increase s(·). The inefficiency follows from
the lender’s participation constraint (2.7), because moral hazard induces lenders to offer too little
credit in order to avoid large monitoring costs. Hence, credit and capital are smaller than in the
efficient allocation (i.e. one with no information asymmetries, or µ = 0, and no credit spread).

    The inefficiently low credit and capital allocation justifies the policy intervention with the fi-
nancial subsidy. In principle, if the financial regulator had complete information and could impose
state-contingent subsidies, the subsidy could be managed optimally to fluctuate over time and
across states of nature to remove the credit spread and the inefficiency completely. This is not pos-
sible, however, because credit contracts are signed at date t with the value of the subsidy known,
but before the realizations of aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks for t + 1 are known.

    The optimal credit contract implies that the aggregate capital gains of entrepreneurs (i.e. the
entrepreneurs’ equity for the beginning of the next period) can be written as:
                                                                        rt−1 bt−1

2.4    Capital Producer
  The capital producer operates in a perfectly competitive market. At the end of t−1, entrepreneurs
buy from it the capital to be used in period t, i.e. kt−1 . Once intermediate goods are sold and
capital services paid, entrepreneurs sell back to the capital producer the remaining capital, net of
depreciation. The capital
                          producer then builds new capital, kt , by adding investment, it , net of
                        it
adjustment costs, Φ it−1 , to the existing capital, (1 − δ) kt−1 . The capital producer’s problem is:

                                                                 it
                          kt = (1 − δ) kt−1 + 1 − Φ                         it , for all t.
                                                                it−1

    Since households own the firm that produces capital, its profits are discounted at the rate
β t−T λλTt
         for t ≥ T , where λt is the Lagrange multiplier of the household’s budget constraint.
We use the formulation of investment adjustment costs from Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans
(2005), according to which old andnew investment goods are combined to produce new capital
                                 it
units, with a quadratic form Φ it−1  = (η/2) [it /it−1 − 1]2 .

2.5      Final Goods Producer
  Final goods, yt , are used for consumption and investment, and produced in a competitive market
by a representative producer who combines a continuum of inputs indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], via the

j at date t, and θ is the elasticity of substitution among intermediate goods. Profit maximization

     Pj,t dj        , where Pj,t denotes the price of the intermediate good produced by firm j.

2.6      Intermediate Goods Producers
     Input producers engage in monopolistic competition and produce differentiated goods using
labor `j,t and capital kj,t−1 to produce good j at date t. Total labor input in each firm combines
household labor, `hj,t , and entrepreneurial labor, `ej,t ≡ 1, with a Cobb-Douglas function `j,t =
       Ω e 1−Ω
 `hj,t    `j,t   . Each input is also produced with a Cobb-Douglas technology yj,t = `1−α     α
                                                                                         j,t kj,t−1 .


    Input producers set prices according to Calvo (1983)’s staggered pricing mechanism. At ev-
ery date t, each producer gets to adjust its price optimally with a constant probability 1 − ϑ, and
with probability ϑ it can only adjust its price following a passive indexation rule Pj,T = ιt,T Pj,t ,
where t < T is the period of last re-optimization and ιt,T is a price-indexing rule, defined as
ιt,T = (1 + πT −1 )ϑp (1 + π)1−ϑp ιt,T −1 for T > t and ιt,t = 1. The coefficient ϑp ∈ [0, 1] mea-
sures the degree of past-inflation indexation of intermediate goods prices and π is the inflation rate
at the deterministic steady state. In order to remove the distortion of monopolistic competition on
this steady state, we assume that the government provides a time-invariant subsidy τp so that aggre-
gate output in the deterministic steady state reaches the same level as in the flexible-price economy.

            ?
     Let Pj,t denote the nominal price optimally chosen ar time t and yj,t,T denote the demand for
good j in period T ≥ t for a firm that last re-optimized its price in period t. Producer j selects

household’s stochastic discount factors), taking as given the demand curve for its product:

where mct is the marginal cost of production corresponding to the derivative of the cost function
with respect to yj,t (see Appendix A.6 for details). To support the flexible price production levels
at the deterministic steady state, the subsidy must be equal to the inverse of the price markup,
so 1 − τp = (θ − 1) /θ < 1. Sticky prices still create a distortion that affects macroeconomic
fluctuations in the form of price dispersion. Following Yun (1996), we show in Appendix A.6, that
aggregate production can be expressed as:

2.7     Policy rules
  In the STR regime, there is no financial policy rule and the monetary policy rule sets the nominal
interest rate following this simple Taylor rule:
                                                    a
                                              1 + πt π
                                 Rt = R ×                , aπ > 0,                             (2.13)
                                               1+π

where aπ is the elasticity of Rt with respect to inflation deviations from target, R is the steady-state
gross nominal interest rate, and π is the central bank’s inflation target.11 In the ATR regime, the
Taylor rule is augmented with the deviation of efp from its target:
                                     a         k        !−ǎrr
                               1 + πt π Et rt+1        /rt
                 Rt = R ×                                         , ǎrr > 0, aπ ≥ 0,             (2.14)
                               1+π                rk /r

where rk /r is the target value of the credit spread at steady state, which is set to rk /r = 1 so
as to remove the steady-state effect of efp. The elasticity with respect to the credit spread enters
with a negative sign because increases in the credit spread cause a decline in investment and hence
aggregate demand, to which the monetary authority responds by lowering Rt .

   In the DRR regime, monetary policy follows the same Taylor rule as in the STR regime, but in
addition the financial authority follows this rule to set the financial subsidy:
                                                           k        !arr
                                                       Et rt+1   /rt
                            1 + τf,t = (1 + τf ) ×                        ,             (2.15)
                                                            rk /r

τf is the value of the financial subsidy that ensures that rk = r in the deterministic steady-state.
Notice that τf is present even in the STR and ATR regimes that do not have a financial policy rule
for targeting efp, so that all policy regimes yield the same steady-state capital-output ratio.

    We do not include the output gap for simplicity and because quantitatively this model yields higher welfare if the
Taylor rule does not respond to the output gap than if it does (see Subsection 4.4.2 for details).

2.8    Resource and government budget constraints
  The government’s budget constraint is:
                               Z 1
                Υt = g + τp st     yj,t dj + τf,t [Γ(ω̄t ) − µG(ω̄t )] rtk qt−1 kt−1 .                (2.16)
                                      0
    Government expenditures, g, are kept constant. The government runs a balanced budget, so
that the sum of government expenditures, plus subsidies to monopolist producers, plus financial
subsidies is paid for by levying lump-sum taxes in the amount Υt on households.

    Combining the resource flow conditions of the various agents in the model (budget constraints,
net worth, equity of entrepreneurs, firm dividends, etc.) together with the above government budget
constraint yields the following aggregate resource constraint:
                             yt = ct + it + cet + g + µG(ω̄e,t )rtk qt−1 kt−1 .                       (2.17)
    Total production is allocated to consumption, investment, government expenditures, and moni-
toring costs. At equilibrium, all markets must clear, and the intertemporal sequences of prices and
allocations must satisfy the optimality conditions of each set of agents.

2.9    Social welfare
   In order to compare welfare across equilibria with different policy rules, we use standard com-
pensating lifetime consumption variations that make agents indifferent between the levels of ex-
pected lifetime utility attainable under a given policy regime and a reference level, as proposed by
Lucas (1987). We use the deterministic stationary equilibrium as the reference level, because it is
constructed with the adjustments mentioned earlier that neutralize long-run effects of price stick-
iness, the external finance premium, and monopolistic competition. If welfare is lower under the
stochastic version of the model with any of the three policy regimes, our welfare measures show
the welfare cost of that particular regime with its particular policy rule elasticities.

    The welfare measures are constructed as follows: Define W (aπ , arr ; %) as the unconditional
expected lifetime utility attained for a given parameterization defined in the vector % and a pair of
policy rule elasticities aπ and arr , (or ǎrr for the ATR):
                           (∞                                                                        )
                             X
                                 β t U ct (aπ , arr ; %) , `ht (aπ , arr ; %) , Ct−1 (aπ , arr ; %) ,
                                                                                                   
      W (aπ , arr ; %) ≡ E                                                                             (2.18)
                              t=0

                       `ht
where ct (aπ , arr ; %), (aπ , arr ; %), and Ct−1 (aπ , arr ; %) are equilibrium allocations of individual
consumption, labor supply, and aggregate       consumption for specific parameter values and policy
rule elasticities, and U ct , `ht , Ct−1 is the period utility function used in equation (2.1). Since we
are assuming a representative agent, Ct−1 (.) = ct−1 (.).

    Define next Wd , cd = Cd , and `hd as the welfare and allocations at the deterministic steady state,
so that:                                      n
                                                            υ         o1−σ

                         U cd , `d , Cd           d                d
                 Wd ≡                      =                                       ,

    The welfare effect of a particular pair of policy elasticities is then defined as the percent change
in consumption, ce, relative to the reference consumption levels (i.e. those in the deterministic
steady state), such that the following condition holds:
                                                                               
                                             U (1 − ce) cd , `hd , (1 − ce) Cd
                          W (aπ , arr ; %) =                                     .
                                                          1−β
With CRRA utility, we can solve for ce as:
                                                                                   
                                                           [W (aπ , arr ; %) − Wd ]
                       ce (aπ , arr ; %) = 1 − exp (1 − β)                            .                        (2.19)
                                                                 υ(1 − σ)

Thus, ce > 0 (ce < 0) is a welfare cost (gain) relative to the deterministic steady state. Since
ce (aπ , arr ; %) is always measured relative to the same deterministic steady state, the welfare cost
or gain of changing from a policy regime with elasticities (axπ , axrr ) to one with elasticities (ayπ , ayrr )
is given by the difference between ce (axπ , axrr ; %) and ce (ayπ , ayrr ; %).


3        Risk Shocks & Policy Responses: Diagrammatic Analysis
   This Section provides a diagrammatic analysis of the effects of risk shocks and of how financial
and monetary policy responses alter those effects. The aim is to show how each policy instrument
affects its goal, which is behind the validity of Tinbergen rule, and to illustrate the spillovers from
monetary (financial) policy into the credit spread (inflation), which drive the incentives for strate-
gic interaction.

    The three panels of Figure 1 show plots with the equilibrium of the markets for credit (ex-
ternal financing), capital goods and final goods. These charts are only a one-period snapshot of
the full model’s equilibrium.12 The equilibrium of the market for external financing is determined
where the demand for capital by entrepreneurs (which is also the demand for credit) intersects the
supply of funds. The demand for capital follows from condition (2.3), taking into account that
the rental rate of capital at equilibrium matches the decreasing marginal product of capital. The
                            s(x)
supply of credit, labeled 1+τ  f
                                 , follows from the equilibrium condition (2.8) which determines the
efp. Equilibrium in this market determines k and rk . Notice that rk ≥ r, otherwise the financial
intermediary would not participate in the contract.

    In the capital goods market, the supply schedule, labeled k s , is given by the standard Tobin’s
Q investment optimality condition. This schedule is upward sloping because of the investment
adjustment costs. The demand is given again by the marginal product of capital that pins down
the gross real returns of capital goods. Equilibrium in this market determines the relative price of
capital goods, q, and the optimal investment amount k.

    12
    Note that the model does not yield closed-form solutions for the functions plotted and includes dynamic, stochastic
general equilibrium effects absent from these plots.




                                                         14
    In the final goods market, aggregate supply is given by the standard Phillips curve, labeled P C,
which is upward sloping due to nominal rigidities. Aggregate demand, labeled y d , is given by the
resource constraint, and it is downward sloping because of standard assumptions regarding income
and substitution effects so that consumption declines with the interest rate, and because investment
also falls as the interest rate rises. For ease of exposition, we abstract from monitoring costs in this
graphic analysis, which reduces the resource constraint to yt = ct + cet + it + gt . We briefly explain
later in this Section how monitoring costs affect the trade-off between financial and price stability.

    Panel (a) of Figure 1 shows the effects of an increase in σω . For simplicity, we assume that
the economy starts at its steady state equilibrium (denoted by asterisks). The risk shock increases
the entrepreneurs’ probability of default, which shifts the supply of external financing to the left.
The vertical intercept is unchanged, because the nominal interest rate is set by the central bank and
we are abstracting in these plots from changes in expected inflation for t + 1, and the horizontal
segment shrinks, because the risk shock reduces the maximum level of capital covered by internal
financing. The shift in the supply of loans reduces capital purchases and increases efp to k1 < k ∗
and r1k > r∗ respectively. Investment falls along with the demand for capital goods, which reduces
the relative price of capital (q1 < 1) as well as the net worth of entrepreneurs (not shown in the
plots). The latter feeds into the Bernanke-Gertler accelerator and creates a wedge between the
returns of capital and deposits, so after the shock efp is positive (i.e. rk > r), which lowers output
and inflation to π1 < π ∗ and y1 < y ∗ , respectively.

    Panel (b) shows the effects of a financial policy response to the risk shock, by increasing τf .
This increases the expected return on loans, which helps counter the drop in the supply of exter-
nal financing. Notice that again the vertical intercept of the supply of loans does not change, and
now the horizontal segment extends. The extent to which the supply of loans recovers depends on
the parameters of the financial policy rule, and on general equilibrium feedback effects not cap-
tured in the plots, including those that depend on the parameters of the monetary policy rule. In
the scenario as plotted, the financial policy is effective but falls short of returning the economy to
the initial equilibrium. Hence, financial policy yields the equilibrium identified with “f” subscripts.

    Panel (c) shows the effects of a monetary policy response to the risk shock, by cutting R. Since
we are abstracting from changes in expected inflation, this lowers the real interest rate r, which
shifts the entire supply of funds curve down and to the right, because it lowers the intermediaries’
cost of raising deposits. The price and quantity effects on the three markets are qualitatively similar
to those obtained with the financial policy, but monetary policy exerts a stronger effect on aggre-
gate demand, because in addition to the effect on credit markets, it also affects saving-spending
decisions of households via the standard effects present in New Keynesian DSGE models. Hence,
the transmission channel of monetary policy is likely to be stronger.

    As drawn in Panel (c), the cut in R helps increase capital purchases and reduce efp towards their
initial values, but at the cost of pushing inflation above its initial level (πR > π ∗ ). Moreover, if we
add monitoring costs to aggregate demand, the trade-off between lower efp and higher π worsens,
because aggregate demand rises more as monitoring costs increase with the risk shock (as more
entrepreneurs default and the intermediary spends resources to audit them). Hence, this example
suggests that the interest-rate path needed to achieve financial stability may be very different than

the path needed to achieve price stability. In turn, this argument is indicative of the relevance of
Tinbergen rule: Dual policy rules, one aimed at the financing premium and one aimed at inflation,
are more likely to succeed because they adjust two instruments to target two variables.

     The need for two instruments to target π and efp can be illustrated as a feature of the full
DSGE model by noting that condition (2.8) implies that, if the central bank is expected to target
inflation successfully using rule (2.13), then in the neighborhood of the stochastic steady state
rt = R/(1 + π). Hence, monetary policy cannot be used to target the credit spread, because once it
is targeting inflation, the spread still fluctuates as implied by condition (2.8), with rt approximately
constant at the value implied by inflation targeting. Then, the financial subsidy is needed in order
to target the spread with an instrument independent of the monetary policy instrument. Notice that
under flexible prices (the scenario represented by the P C f lex curve in Figure 1), the monetary and
financial instruments could be used indistinctly, because the inefficiencies due to nominal rigidi-
ties vanish. Tinbergen rule is irrelevant because inflation becomes an irrelevant target. In this case,
there are two possible instruments to target one variable, the credit spread.

    Using separate policy rules raises the potential for strategic interaction. As Panels (b) and
(c) show, inflation and output are affected by τf,t , while efp, credit and leverage are affected by
Rt . Hence, if the payoff functions of the two authorities differ, strategic interaction would yield
inferior outcomes when they act unilaterally than when they coordinate their actions. Moreover,
Panels (b) and (c) suggest that the relative size of the policy rule elasticities matters for whether
each authority sees the elasticity of its own rule as an strategic substitute or complement of the
other authority’s elasticity. For example, if arr is high enough, the monetary authority may find
optimal to increase aπ when the financial authority increases arr , so as to tighten monetary policy
more to keep π from rising when the financial authority is increasing τf by more. In this case, the
curves in Panel (b) would shift out significantly more, and hence the central bank may find optimal
to adjust its elasticity so that the curves in Panel (c) shift out less. Conversely, if arr is low enough,
the central bank may prefer to lower the elasticity of the monetary rule. The quantitative analysis
of the next Section yields results in line with these arguments.


4     Quantitative Analysis
4.1    Calibration & Deterministic Steady State
  In the remainder of the paper we conduct a quantitative analysis to study the model’s implications
for the relevance of Tinbergen rule and strategic interaction in the management of monetary and
financial policies. The model is calibrated to a quarterly frequency, with most parameters taken
from CMR and BGG. Table 1 lists the values of the model’s parameters in the Baseline calibration.
As explained earlier, we set inflation in the deterministic steady state to zero (π = 0) in order
to remove the steady-state effects of price stickiness. We also set υ, the parameter governing the
disutility of labor, such that the household’s steady-state labor allocation is 1/3rd (i.e. `h = 1/3),
and set the habit persistence parameter to h = 0.85 as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2008).

    The values of the discount factor, the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the capital share in
the intermediate sector, the elasticity of demand for intermediate goods, the depreciation rate, the
investment adjustment costs, the government expenditures-GDP ratio, the price indexing weight,
and the degree of price stickiness are taken from CMR. They set some of these parameters by cali-

    The financial sector parameters are taken mostly from BGG. Accordingly, the transfers from
failed entrepreneurs to households are set to a very small value (1 − % = 0.01%), so that the
entrepreneurs’ consumption process, which is quite volatile, does not affect aggregate consump-
tion significantly. We take from BGG their calibrated values for the survival rate of entrepreneurs
(γ = 0.98), the monitoring cost coefficient (µ = 0.118), the unconditional standard deviation
of the entrepreneurs idiosyncratic shocks (σ̄ω = 0.27), and the fraction of households’ labor on
production (Ω = 0.98).13 BGG obtained these calibrated parameters so that the deterministic
steady state of their model matches an entrepreneurial labor income share of 0.01, a default rate
of entrepreneurs of 3% per year, a capital-net worth ratio of 2, and a 2% long-run external finance
premium, which are figures based on historical U.S. averages. Here, we take the financial sector
parameters they obtained as given, and solve for the value of the steady-state financial subsidy τf
that reduces the steady state efp to zero. This yields τf = 0.96%.14

    The entrepreneurs’ idiosyncratic productivity shocks, ωt , follow an i.i.d. log-normal process
with an unconditional expectation of 1 and a time-varying standard deviation characterized by the
following AR(1) process:

                          log(σω,t ) = (1 − ρσω ) log(σ̄ω ) + ρσω log(σω,t−1 ) + σ t                           (4.1)

where σω,t is the standard deviation of ωt , and σ is the standard deviation of the innovations to the
risk shock process. We set ρσω = 0.97 and σ = 0.1 using the estimates from CMR, including in
σ both surprise and anticipated components.

    The key ratios of the model’s deterministic steady state under the Baseline calibration are listed
in Table 2, together with the ratios for two alternative cases: the BGG model and a variant of the
model without financial frictions. The Baseline case differs from BGG in that it includes the fi-
nancial subsidy that removes the external finance premium at steady state, and it differs from the
case without financial frictions in that it still uses up resources in monitoring costs. In the Baseline
case, monitoring costs amount to µG(ω̄)rk, where ω̄ is the threshold value of ω below which an
entrepreneur defaults with zero efp (i.e. rk = r) and k is the associated steady-state capital stock.
All three scenarios include the subsidy to intermediate producers and assume zero inflation to neu-
tralize the steady-state effects of monopolistic competition and nominal rigidities, respectively.

    In the BGG case, the steady state is affected by both the distortionary effects of the external
finance premium and by the resources spent in monitoring costs. Because efp > 0, the investment
rate and the capital-output ratio are lower than in the other two scenarios which have zero efp. For
the same reason, the steady-state investment rates and capital-output ratios are the same without
  13
      σ̄ω = 0.27 is close to the value of 0.2713 estimated by Lambertini, Nuguer and Uysal (2017) and the 0.26 estimate
used by CMR. Lambertini et al. (2017) estimated a model with nominal and real rigidities, a housing sector with risk
shocks, mortgages, and endogenous default using quarterly U.S. data.
   14
      This approach implies that with efp = 0 our model yields higher steady-state values for the default rate of en-
trepreneurs and the capital-net worth ratio than in BGG. As shown in Appendix B.3 however, our results on Tinbergen
rule and strategic interaction for the three policy rules we examined do not vary much if we set τf = 0, so that the
steady state of the model matches the same data targets as the BGG calibration.

             Note: The model without financial frictions corresponds to the case in which µ = 0. The
             efficient output, ynf , is the one attained without financial frictions, which is also the one
             attainable in a standard Neoclassical model (since it is a steady state with zero inflation
             and with a subsidy removing the distortion of monopolistic competition on production).


financial frictions and in the Baseline case, and in both scenarios steady-state output equals its
efficient level. In contrast, in the BGG setup the capital-output ratio is about 150 percentage points
lower and output is nearly 10% lower.

    Removing the external finance premium using τf removes the investment inefficiency in the
Baseline case, but c/y is lower than in either BGG or without financial frictions. BGG has a higher
c/y because, although resources are going into paying monitoring costs, the positive efp reduces
the investment rate below that in the Baseline case. Without financial frictions, c/y is higher than in
the Baseline because now the investment rate and the output level are the same but in the Baseline
some resources are used up to pay monitoring costs. These differences are worth noting because, as
we show later, in the stochastic stationary state, alternative policy regimes yield different long-run
averages for efp and monitoring costs which have important welfare implications. Qualitatively,
these stochastic steady states are more similar to the deterministic BGG case than to the Baseline
case, because they feature both monitoring costs and efficiency losses due to positive efp.

    We solved the model using a second-order perturbation method, as proposed by Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2004). This improves the accuracy of the welfare calculations critical for our anayl-
sis. To avoid explosive sample paths when computing expected lifetime utility, we simulated the
second-order solutions using the pruning method developed by Andreasen, Fernández-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2017). The model is solved using Dynare, version 4.

4.2    Tinbergen rule
   To evaluate the relevance of Tinbergen rule, we compare the DRR, STR and ATR regimes in
terms of social welfare for a set of policy rule elasticities, the elasticities that yield the lowest wel-
fare cost (denoted “optimized elasticities”), and the macroeconomic dynamics in response to risk
shocks.

Note: ce is the welfare cost for each elasticity pair, computed as averages over the ergodic distribution of the welfare
measure defined in eq. (2.19). The optimized elasticities that minimize ce are marked with asterisks.


    Figure 2 shows surface plots of welfare costs for a set of elasticity pairs under the ATR (labeled
“1 instrument” in the left plot) and the DRR (labeled “2 instruments” in the right plot). The results
for the STR regime are also included. They correspond to the cases with ǎrr = 0 in the ATR
case or arr = 0 in the DRR case. These are identical because in these cases ATR and DRR are
equivalent STR regimes at the given aπ (recall that ATR and DRR have the same constant τf ).

     These surface plots show two key results. First, welfare costs are large in all regimes and elas-
ticity pairs considered, with ce ranging from about 6 to 17%. This is due to long-run effects of
changes in efp and monitoring costs, as we explain in more detail below. Second, the curvature
of the surface plots is indicative of the relevance of Tinbergen rule and strategic interaction. In
particular, for low aπ , welfare costs in the ATR show a marked U shape as ǎrr varies, whereas in
the DRR regime they first fall sharply as arr rises from 0 but then change only slightly. Welfare
costs are slightly higher with the DRR than with the ATR for arr and ǎrr near 0 for all values of
aπ , but lower if those efp elasticities are sufficiently high. Moreover, for arr ≥ 1.2, welfare costs
for aπ = 1 are nearly unchanged as arr rises in the DRR, whereas under the ATR they are sharply
increasing in ǎrr when aπ is low but moderately decreasing in ǎrr when aπ is high. These differ-
ences in the curvature of the two surface plots indicate that Tinbergen rule is relevant because they
show that the DRR can avoid sharply increasing welfare costs as arr rises for a given aπ , which is
possible because it has separate instruments to tackle price and financial stability. The curvature is
also indicative of large policy spillovers, providing incentives for strategic interaction.

    Figure 3 illustrates further the differences in welfare costs across policy regimes by showing
how ce varies as each elasticity changes, keeping the other fixed at its optimized value. The plot on
the left is for aπ and the one on the right is for ǎrr and arr . The dashed-red curves are for the ATR
and the solid-blue curves are for the DRR, and in the left plot the dotted-black line is for the STR.
In each curve, asterisks identify the optimized elasticities. The left plot shows that, for all values
of aπ , ce is uniformly lower under the DRR than under the ATR, and much lower than under the
STR. The right plot shows that for spread elasticities below 0.5 ce does not differ much between

the DRR and ATR, but for higher spread elasticities ce is much lower under the DRR. Welfare
costs under the ATR rise much faster with the spread elasticity, producing a markedly U-shaped
curve, while under the DRR welfare costs are nearly unchanged as the spread elasticity rises. This
is again evidence of Tinbergen rule relevance: arr in the DRR can rise with much less adverse
welfare consequences than ǎrr in the ATR because DRR targets efp with its own instrument with-
out affecting the instrument of monetary policy. Notice also that in all curves there is an internal
solution for the optimized elasticities and those solutions differ markedly. These findings show
that the different policy regimes have sharply different implications for the inefficiencies due to
the financial accelerator and the nominal rigidities, and hence yield sharply different equilibrium
allocations and welfare, and cause non-trivial interaction between monetary and financial policies.

Note: “Optimized Elasticities” are the elasticities from the sets used in constructing Figure 2 that produce the lowest
welfare cost under each policy regime. ce v. DRR is the difference in ce under the ATR or STR relative to the DRR
in basis points. “Full ce” is the welfare measure defined in equation (2.19) which is decomposed into an effect due to
changes in long-run averages (“Mean eff. Total”) and an effect due to fluctuations (“SD eff.”). Mean eff. Total is com-
                                                                                    
puted as in equation (2.19) but replacing W (aπ , arr ; %) with U E[c], E[`h ], E[C] /(1 − β), where E[c], E[`h ], E[C]
are long-run averages of the model solved under each policy regime. “Mean eff. Net” removes the long-run average of
monitoring costs from the Mean eff. calculation, by treating monitoring costs as private consumption in the resource
constraint.

    Table 3 shows the quantitative relevance of Tinbergen rule by comparing the DRR, ATR, and
STR, each operating with its optimized elasticities. The Table lists the optimized elasticities, the
difference in ce in the ATR and STR relative to the DRR, and a decomposition of ce in terms of
Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) components. We denote the DRR as the “Best Policy” scenario
because it yields the best welfare outcome of the three regimes, and also because it matches the
outcome of a cooperative game in which social welfare is the common payoff of the two policy
authorities. In the welfare effect decompositions, the Total Mean Effect is computed using equa-
tion (2.19) but replacing the value of welfare under a given regime with the welfare value of a
hypothetical stationary state in which equilibrium allocations are constant at the average values of
the same regime’s stochastic stationary state. The SD effect is just ce minus the Mean effect. We
also show the Mean effect net of monitoring costs, which is calculated by treating the long-run
mean of monitoring costs as private consumption in the resource constraint. The aim is to illustrate
the relevance of long-run changes in resources used up in costly monitoring for the welfare costs.

     The optimized elasticities in the DRR are aπ = 1.27 and arr = 2.43 v. aπ = 1.27 and
ǎrr = 0.36 in the ATR. The inflation elasticities are similar (with the one in the ATR marginally
higher), and both are about 50 basis points smaller than the inflation elasticity of the STR regime.
The efp elasticities, however, differ markedly. The one under DRR is much higher than in the other
regimes, 2.43 in the DRR v. 0.36 in the ATR and 0 in the STR. The STR and ATR regimes are tight
money-tight credit regimes because financial policy does not respond enough to worsening spreads
and monetary policy responds too much to higher inflation, albeit by a negligible amount in the
ATR case. In line with Tinbergen rule, policy responds less to worsening financial conditions un-
der the ATR because it cannot respond with an instrument independent from the monetary policy
instrument. Moreover, the only instrument it can respond with, the interest rate, is the one with the
stronger transmission mechanism, because as we explained earlier, it has first-order effects on the
inefficiencies caused by both Calvo pricing and the financial accelerator.

    The violations of Tinbergen rule entail large welfare costs: ce in the ATR and STR is 138 and
264 basis points larger than in the DRR, respectively, and 126 basis points lower in the ATR than
in the STR. Hence, allowing the Taylor rule to respond to the credit spread is better than not but
using separate financial and monetary rules is significantly better.

    The welfare costs of the three regimes with optimized elasticities are large relative to other
standard measures. The STR regime yields a cost of 6.5% v. 5.2 and 3.9% under the ATR and
DRR, respectively. These are all much larger than typical estimates of the welfare cost of busi-
ness cycles of about 0.1% (see Lucas, 1987), and larger even than estimates of the welfare costs
of distortionary taxation in the 1 − 3% range. In order to understand the factors behind this re-
sult, we conducted a series of counterfactual experiments isolating the welfare implications of key
model parameters (monitoring costs coefficient, habit persistence, price stickiness, properties of
risk shocks, labor elasticity, etc.) and we found that by far changing the coefficient of monitoring
costs contributes the most to the large welfare costs, followed by habit persistence.15

  15
    Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2005) also found that increasing habit persistence increases welfare costs. Appendix
B.5 provides a detailed analysis of the role of the model’s key parameters in determining welfare costs.



                                                       23
    Table 3 provides two sets of results to illustrate this point. First, the decomposition of ce into
Mean and SD effects shows that the Mean effects are the main source of the large welfare costs.
These in turn are due to differences in the long-run averages of consumption and leisure across
policy regimes, of which further analysis showed consumption differences are more important.
The SD effects isolate the contribution of business cycle variability per-se, and the results are in
line with typical measures of the welfare cost of business cycles. Second, the Table shows that net
mean effects are markedly smaller than total mean effects (by 124, 90, and 67 basis points in the
DRR, ATR, and STR respectively). This is because although the deterministic steady-state effects
of nominal rigidities, monopolistic competition, and efp have been neutralized, each regime yields
different results for the long-run averages of efp and resources assigned to monitoring costs in the
corresponding stochastic steady state, and also because in the DRR the average financial subsidy
changes as the average efp changes. It is important to note, however, that these changes are long-
run implications of the business cycle volatility induced by risk shocks: The means of monitoring
costs and efp are higher in the stochastic than in the deterministic steady states because of the dy-
namic equilibrium effects of risk shocks under incomplete markets, which differ markedly across
regimes.16 We document these differences and their effects on the welfare calculations by studying
differences in long-run moments and impulse response functions for risk shocks under each regime.

    Table 4 shows the moments of the model’s key variables in the stochastic steady state of each
regime with optimized elasticities, and their corresponding deterministic steady state values. The
Table shows means, standard deviations relative to the standard deviation of output, and corre-
lations with output. A comparison of model averages v. the deterministic steady state provides
further evidence of the role that changes in efp and monitoring costs play in explaining the large
welfare costs of risk shocks. In the deterministic steady state, efp = 0 and monitoring costs are
about 1.1% of output. In contrast, the long-run averages of monitoring costs rise to 1.6, 1.7, and
2% of output in the DRR, ATR, and STR, respectively, and the long-run averages of efp rise to
0.18, 0.65, and 0.99% in each regime, respectively. The resulting effects on average household
leisure are small, but the changes in average consumption, investment, and capital are large. Rela-
tive to their deterministic steady-state values, mean consumption falls −1, −2.6 and −3.2% in the
DRR, ATR, and STR, respectively. The changes in average consumption are the main determinant
of the large welfare costs, and they are due to both the increases in monitoring costs and the effi-
ciency losses caused by the increases in efp. Investment in the DRR (ATR and STR) falls by −1.7
(−5.6 and −7.5)% relative to the deterministic steady state, while capital falls by −1.6 (−5.1 and
−6.7)%.

    The DRR is significantly inferior to the deterministic steady state in terms of welfare, but also
much better than the ATR and STR regimes, and this is the case because the increases in monitor-
ing costs and efp, and their associated declines in consumption, investment and capital are smaller.
In turn, these differences are due to the ability of the DRR to respond to the movements in efp by
adjusting the financial subsidy. The subsidy rises from 0.96% in the deterministic steady state to
1.07% in the average of the stochastic steady state of the DRR.This higher subsidy results in higher
lump-sum taxes in the DRR, but welfare is higher because the higher lump-sum taxes are not dis-
  16
     The welfare calculations based on pruned (stable) time-series simulations of the model’s second-order dynamics
are critical for these results.

tortionary and help offset the higher efficiency losses under the ATR and SDR. These movements
also allow the DRR to sustain more credit than in the ATR and STR regimes. Credit in the DRR is
5.5% lower than in the deterministic steady state, but this is a smaller decline than 10.7 and 13.1%
in the ATR and STR, respectively.

    The DRR’s ability to respond to financial headwinds with τf,t also reduces business cycle vari-
ability. The relative standard deviations of consumption, investment, and the capital stock are 0.9,
3.8, and 1.7 in the DRR, while in both the ATR and STR these are about 1.1, 4.9, and 2.1. The
correlations of investment and the capital stock with output are also significantly smaller, at 0.1
and 0.55 in the DRR v. 0.52 (0.57) and 0.78 (0.82) in the ATR (STR).

    Next we compare the responses of macro variables to risk shocks in the three optimized policy
regimes. Figure 4 shows impulse response functions for a one-standard-deviation shock to σ at
t = 0 (equivalent to a 10-percent increase in σω,t ), plotted as percent deviations from long-run
averages under each regime. The continuous-blue curves are for the DRR, the dashed-red curves
are for the ATR, and the dotted-black curves are for the STR. The responses of all variables are
qualitatively similar across the three regimes but significantly smoother under the DRR, with the
exception of the consumption response, which differs both quantitatively and qualitatively in the
DRR. In all three regimes, the risk shock increases the probability of default on impact, and thus
increases efp, and as the risk shock fades monotonically the rise in efp also reverses monotonically.
The efp rises to about 0.6% on impact under the STR and the ATR, while in the DRR it only rises
to 0.13%, illustrating again the ability of the DRR to respond to risk shocks with the financial
subsidy, and the relevance of Tinbergen rule: Separate financial and monetary rules are much more
effective at stabilizing prices and the spreads than the ATR and STR regimes. Inflation rises on
impact in all three regimes, because although aggregate demand excluding monitoring costs falls,
total demand inclusive of monitoring costs rises and exerts upward pressure on prices.

    The higher π and efp trigger different policy responses determined by the rules of each regime.
Inflation rises significantly more in the ATR regime than in the other two, yet the impact increases
in R are similar. The STR and the ATR yield nearly the same initial interest rate, because the
former has a higher aπ but experiences a smaller rise in π. The interest rate rises more in these
regimes than in the DRR, reflecting their tight money-tight credit nature. Under the STR, the infla-
tion elasticity is higher than in the DRR, and hence with a similar impact increase in π it yields a
higher R. Under the ATR, the inflation elasticity is similar than in the DRR but the impact increase
in π is larger, and even tough the increase in the efp contributes to lower R, the spread elasticity is
not big enough to prevent the interest rate from rising more than with the DRR.

    In the DRR, the financial subsidy displays the same monotonic mean reversion as efp in about
30 quarters. Interestingly, the nearly identical efp responses under the STR and the ATR indicates
that, although the interest rate responds to the credit spread in the latter but not in the former, the
resulting equilibrium credit spreads do not differ much. This is again showing the relevance of
Tinbergen rule: the ATR does a poor job at altering efp because it does not use a separate instru-
ment. In contrast, the financial subsidy results in significantly lower spreads with the DRR.

    In all three regimes, higher spreads, combined with the investment adjustment costs, produce a
gradual but large decline in investment. This in turn produces gradual declines in the capital stock,
aggregate demand, and inflation. The fluctuations of these variables, along with those of the efp
and the short-term interest rate, are significantly smoother under the DRR than under the other two
regimes, and those under the ATR are in turn smaller than with the STR. This is due to the higher
spreads under the ATR and STR, both of which lack a separate instrument to respond to the effect
of risk shocks on credit spreads. Note that interest rates between the 4th and 20th quarter are in
fact higher under the DRR, but since this regime has the financial subsidy as a separate instrument,
it yields lower spreads and can thus smooth investment and aggregate demand more effectively,
again indicating the relevance of Tinbergen rule.

    Consumption is smoother and displays very different dynamics under the DRR than in the other
regimes. It falls slightly on impact and then continues to decline slowly down to a through of about
−0.2% below its long-run average by the 40th quarter. In contrast, in the other regimes consump-
tion rises to a peak about 0.4% above their long-run averages by the 8th quarter, and then falls
sharply and steadily for 26 quarters down to a through about 0.65 below their long run averages.
These different consumption dynamics are due to the increase in lump-sum taxes needed to pay
for the financial subsidy that smooths the effects of the risk shock on spreads and investment. As
we show below, this subsidy reduces the size of the declines in the income households obtain via
dividends and transfers from entrepreneurs, partially offsetting the higher lump-sum taxes. After

the 20th quarter, consumption becomes higher in the DRR than in the other regimes, as the finan-
cial subsidy and lump-sum taxes fall. In the long-run, consumption reaches a level slightly higher
in the DRR than in the two regimes, as shown in Table 4.

    The different consumption dynamics of the DRR reflect differences in the evolution of dis-
posable income and its components. Figure 5 shows the contributions of these components to the
consumption impulse response functions. The plots show the contributions of labor income, wt `t ,
net resources from deposits, rt−1 bt−1 − bt , transfers from entrepreneurs, At , dividends, divt , and
lump-sum taxes, Υt . On impact, divt falls more under the ATR than in the other regimes but yet
consumption is actually higher in this regime. This happens largely because faced with reduced
dividend income, households reduce deposits sharply (i.e. rt−1 bt−1 − bt rises). After the impact
effect, the components of income display a similar evolution under the ATR and STR regime.

    The key finding from Figure 5 is that it shows how the DRR smooths disposable income, and
hence yields a consumption path with higher welfare than the other regimes. By producing smaller
hikes in efp that yield smaller efficiency losses and smaller increases in monitoring costs, the DRR
provides implicit insurance for disposable income against risk shocks that is more effective than
under the other regimes. The components of income fluctuate less on impact, and their changes
are spread more evenly over the first 10 quarters. Moreover, while lump-sum taxes reduce dis-
posable income much more than under the ATR and STR, since they are needed to pay the high
financial subsidy of the early periods, the smaller associated efficiency losses and monitoring costs
produce a much smaller fall in dividends under the DRR than in the other two regimes. In fact, on
impact the combined loss of disposable income due to dividends and taxes is much smaller than


                                                              28
under the ATR and STR. This implies also that resources drawn from deposits need to increase
less on impact and are more evenly allocated intertemporally. This is also possible because of the
temporarily higher interest rates from the 4th to the 20th quarter under the DRR. Since inflation
rates are not that different from those under the ATR, real interest rates are higher in the DRR,
generating higher returns on deposits and incentives to reallocate them intertemporally.

    These results show that, even though the direct effect of the financial policy instrument is on
the lender’s participation constraint, it has nontrivial effects on the demand and supply sides of the
economy and on the dynamics of disposable income. In computing the optimized elasticities of
the DRR, the financial authority trades off the effects of τf,t as it tilts the consumption profile over
time, reducing consumption initially but increasing it steadily in future periods. The last plot of
Figure 4 shows that period utility has a similar response on impact in all three regimes, then from
the 2nd to the 20th period it is lower with the DRR, but after that it is higher under the DRR and
converges to a higher long-run average (see Table 4).

    In summary, the results reported in this Section show that the implications of violating Tin-
bergen rule in the design of monetary and financial policies are quantitatively large. A regime
with dual rules for monetary and financial policies yields higher welfare, smaller efficiency losses,
and smoother fluctuations in response to risk shocks than regimes in which the monetary policy
rule is augmented with the credit spread or follows an STR. The results also show, however, that
spillovers from changes in the policy instrument of one authority to the target variable of the other
are large, raising the potential for strategic interaction. The DRR sidesteps this issue, because it is
equivalent to a regime in which the two authorities choose policy rule elasticities so as to maximize
welfare as a common payoff. In the next Section we relax this assumption and quantify the effects
of strategic interaction.

4.3    Strategic Interaction
   This Section analyzes the effects of strategic interaction. The payoff functions of are denoted
by Lm for m ∈ {CB, F }, where CB is the central bank and F is the financial authority. The
payoff functions are in the class of quadratic loss functions, and in particular they are defined by
the sum of the variances of
                           each authority’s
                                            instrument and target: LCB = − [Var (πt ) + Var (Rt )]
                      k
and LF = − Var rt /rt + Var (τf,t ) , where Var (xt ) is the unconditional variance of xt in the
stochastic steady state. We also compare results vis-à-vis a case in which both authorities share
a common payoff function given by the household’s expected lifetime utility function (i.e. social
welfare): Lm = W (aπ , arr ; %) for m ∈ {CB, F }. Sharing a common payoff precludes strategic
interaction, but we use this scenario to provide intuition about some of the results.

     The above payoff functions are in line with those used by Williams (2010) and Angelini et al.
(2014), which include the variability of instruments and targets. This class of payoff functions are
viewed as capturing different sources of economic distortions. Using a second-order approxima-
tion to the utility function in a New Keynesian model, Woodford (2003) shows that the inflation
term accounts for the inefficient fluctuations caused by price dispersion under sticky prices. Wood-
ford also shows that an output-gap term appears in the loss function, but quantitatively its weight
is fairly small. Cúrdia and Woodford (2010) and De Paoli and Paustian (2017) show that financial

                                                  29
frictions generate extra terms that reflect resource misallocation caused by suboptimal credit sup-
ply.17 In addition, large changes in asset prices can induce financial instability, which in turn has
welfare costs and favors reducing the volatility of policy instruments (see Rudebusch, 2006).18

    Following the above arguments, we included Var (πt ) in LCB to be consistent with the view
that the monetary authority sees higher inflation variability as painful,
                                                                          as part of an inflation tar-
geting strategy. For the financial authority, including Var rtk /rt in LF is consistent with the aim
to use financial policy to counter financial instability (e.g. IMF, 2013; Galati and Moessner, 2013)
and with the literature on quantitative financial policy analysis using DSGE models. In this liter-
ature, financial policy generally targets the credit-output ratio, credit growth, or the volatility of
credit spreads (see Angelini et al., 2014; Bodenstein et al., 2014; De Paoli and Paustian, 2017).
As we showed earlier, in our model targeting efp is desirable because of its effects on monitoring
costs and efficiency losses. Moreover, as noted later in this Section, targeting credit is equivalent
to targeting efp up to a first-order approximation.

    To conduct the quantitative analysis of strategic interaction, we construct reaction functions
that return the payoff-maximizing choice of one authority’s rule elasticity for a given value of the
other authority’ elasticity.19 Denote the reaction function of the monetary authority a∗π (arr ) and
that ofthe financial authority a∗rr (a π1), both  defined over discrete grids of values of elasticities

                                                       rr with M and N elements, respectively. Hence,
the strategy space is defined by the M × N pairs of rule elasticities. Also, denote as %(arr , aπ ) the
equilibrium allocations and prices for a given set of parameter values (e.g. the baseline calibration)
and a particular pair of elasticities (arr , aπ ). The reaction functions are defined as follows:

       arr (aπ ) =  (aπ , arr ) : arr = arg max E {LF } , s.t. %(aπ , arr ) and aπ = aπ                          .

In these definitions, the authorities maximize the unconditional expectation of their payoff, which
corresponds to its mean in the stochastic steady state.

      De Paoli and Paustian (2017) show that the credit spread appears in a linear-quadratic approximation of the utility
function in a model with credit constraints, and hence represents a source of welfare costs. Cúrdia and Woodford
(2010) show that allocation inefficiencies coming from financial frictions can be represented by either changes in
credit spreads or in aggregate credit.
   18
      Rudebusch (2006) argues that policymakers are keen to reduce the volatility of their instruments for two reasons.
First, uncertainty, which leads authorities to act with caution acknowledging their partial understanding of the sources
of shocks and/or the structure of the economy. Second, small changes in instruments are useful as a lever to manage
agents’ expectations, so that forward-looking agents can read those small changes as news about future policy.

      We assume commitment to the log-linear policy rules and abstract from studying strategic interaction under dis-
cretion (see also De Paoli and Paustian, 2017; Bodenstein et al., 2014).

where EN [LCB ] and EN [LF ] are the payoffs of the central bank and the financial authority in the
Nash equilibrium. There can be more than one cooperative equilibrium depending on the value
of ϕ (i.e. the set of cooperative equilibria corresponds to the core of the contract curve of the two
authorities). For simplicity, we study the symmetric cooperative equilibrium (ϕ = 1/2) and one
with the value of ϕ such that the cooperative equilibrium yields the highest social welfare, denoted
ϕ∗ . We also compute Stackelberg equilibrium solutions with either the monetary or the financial
authority as leaders. When the monetary (financial) authority is the leader, we compute the value
of aπ (arr ) that maximizes LCB (LF ) along the financial (monetary) authority’s reaction function.

    Figure 6 shows four surface plots of different payoff functions for the elasticities in the strategy
space. Plot (a) shows social welfare in terms of welfare costs relative to the deterministic steady
state, (b) shows LCB , (c) shows LF , and (d) shows the symmetric cooperative payoff. The blue star
in plot (a) identifies the elasticity pair that maximizes welfare, and the blue stars in plots (b)-(d)
identify the location of that same elasticity pair in LCB , LF , and the symmetric cooperative payoff.
The black asterisks identify the elasticity pairs that maximize each payoff function (for (b) and
(c) these are the bliss points that maximize each authority’s payoff unconditionally). All of these
payoffs are single peaked, and more importantly, the bliss points of the monetary and financial
authorities differ from each other and also differ from the welfare-maximizing and cooperative
outcomes. These differences reflect the conflict of objectives of the two authorities and their in-
centives for acting strategically.

    By construction, the pair of elasticities that maximizes welfare in plot (a) matches the “Best
Policy” scenario under the DRR (i.e. the optimized elasticity pair). As noted earlier, the elasticities
in the Best Policy case are (a?π , a?rr ) = (1.27, 2.43). It is straightforward to see that this Best Policy
outcome is also the cooperative equilibrium of a game in which both authorities share welfare as a
common payoff, for any value of ϕ.

    Figure 7 displays the reaction functions of the central bank (red-dashed curve) and the finan-
cial authority (blue-solid curve) and the equilibria of the various games: Cooperative with ϕ = 0.5
(blue rhombus), Nash (pink dot), and Stackelberg with CB (F) as leader (green and transparent
squares, respectively). The plots also identify the locations of each authority’s bliss point (black
asterisks) and of the Best Policy elasticity pair (blue star).

Note: The blue stars in each figure show the point that maximizes welfare in Plot (a). The black asterisks show the
maximum point for each of the corresponding plots.


    The two reaction curves are convex and change slope, reflecting the incentives for strategic in-
teraction. In the financial authority’s reaction curve, for aπ < 1.5, a∗rr (aπ ) falls slightly as aπ rises,
while the opposite happens for aπ ≥ 1.5. Hence, the financial authority shifts from treating the
elasticities as strategic complements to treating them as strategic substitutes.20 The monetary au-
thority’s reaction curve has analogous features but with stronger curvature. For arr ≥ 1.7, a∗π (arr )
rises as arr rises, so the elasticities are seen as strategic substitutes, but for most values in the in-
terval arr < 1.77, a∗π (arr ) falls as arr rises, so the elasticities are treated as strategic complements.21

    The above features of the reaction curves can be rationalized with the diagrammatic analysis
of Section 3. The relative magnitude of the shifts in credit, investment, and aggregate demand
induced by one policy v. another depend on the relative values of the elasticities. For instance, the
shift from strategic complements to strategic substitutes in the monetary authority’s reaction curve
  20
      The change would be from substitutes to complements considering only the slope of the reaction curve, but recall
that lower arr means that the financial subsidy increases by less as efp rises, and thus lowering arr when aπ rises
means tightening financial policy when monetary policy tightens. Hence, in terms of strategic interaction, the two
policies are strategic complements (substitutes) if arr falls (rises) when aπ rises, or if aπ falls (rises) when arr rises.
   21
      For arr very close to 0, a∗π (arr ) is negligibly upward slopping but this can be due to numerical approximation.

occurs because, at low arr , τf does not rise as needed to prop up aggregate demand in response to
a risk shock, thus making it optimal for the central bank to lower aπ as arr rises. For arr ≥ 1.7, the
situation reverses. Now the monetary authority finds that the financial subsidy props up demand
too much and thus aims to increase aπ as arr rises. A similar argument explains the shift from
strategic complements to substitutes in the financial authority’s reaction curve.

    Qualitatively, the relative location of the equilibria in Figure 7 is consistent with standard re-
sults when coordination failure is present: The cooperative outcome is in between the two bliss
points (connected by a contract curve not shown in the Figure), and the Nash equilibrium dif-
fers sharply from the cooperative equilibrium. Interestingly, the Stackelberg equilibrium when the
financial authority leads is very close to the Nash outcome, and not too different from the Stackel-
berg equilibrium with the monetary authority as leader.

    Table 5 compares the Nash and cooperative equilibria against the Best Policy DRR. Nash has
a higher aπ than the two cooperative equilibria and the DRR outcome (2.12 v. 1.41, 1.33 and 1.27,
respectively). Nash also has a lower arr than in the cooperative and DRR equilibria (1.69 v. 2.67,
2.1 and 2.43, respectively). Hence, relative to the those equilibria, the Nash equilibrium is a tight
money-tight credit regime. Comparing cooperative equilibria v. the DRR, the former are still tight-
money regimes, but the symmetric cooperative equilibrium is a loose-credit regime (the financial
subsidy rises too much when the spread is above target). The welfare-maximizing cooperative
equilibrium, however, is a tight money-tight credit regime compared with the DRR.

    In terms of welfare, Nash is a “third-best” outcome, in the sense that it is inferior to both the
Best Policy regime and the cooperative outcomes. The gains from policy coordination are sizable:
Relative to the DRR, the Nash equilibrium implies a welfare loss of 30 basis points in the ce wel-
fare measure. In contrast, the cooperative equilibrium with ϕ∗ = 0.23 implies a loss of only 1 basis


                                                              33
point. Hence, the cost of coordination failure is roughly 29 basis points (or 26 if we compare v. the
symmetric cooperative equilibrium). It is worth noting that the welfare-maximizing cooperative
outcome weighs the financial authority more (77 instead of 50%) as the planner compensates for
the large cost of risk shocks due to efficiency losses and monitoring costs as efp rises.

     A comparison of Tables 3 and 5 adds to the previous result noting that ATR dominates STR
but both are inferior to DRR by showing that the Nash and Cooperative equilibria also dominate
the ATR and STR regimes. Hence, strategic interaction of the monetary and financial authorities is
preferable to a STR regime and to a regime in which the Taylor rule is augmented with a response
to financial conditions. In other words, designing a regime of monetary and financial policies that
complies with Tinbergen rule is relatively more important than dealing with strategic interaction.

Note: ce corresponds to the consumption equivalent welfare measure defined in equation (2.19).

    In Appendix B.1, we study reaction curves for cases in which either welfare or the sum of LCB
and LF are used as a common payoff. In both cases, the financial authority displays the same shift
from strategic complements to substitutes in policy elasticities, albeit with more curvature than in
Figure 7. The monetary authority’s reaction curve is always downward sloping when welfare is the
common payoff, so it always treats the elasticities as strategic complements. Interestingly, when
the sum of LCB and LF is the common payoff, the monetary authority’s reaction curve shifts from
strategic substitutes to complements as arr increases, with an inflection point near arr = 0.25.
Regardless of the shape of the common payoff, the Cooperative, Nash, and Stackelberg equilibria
coincide, because there is no coordination failure. What changes, however, is that when social
welfare is the payoff, the cooperative and noncooperative equilibria also match the DRR Best
Policy outcome, which is not the case in general for other common payoff functions.

4.4    Extensions & robustness
   We examine below the robustness of our findings to changes in key features of the model, and the
implications of important extensions, such as adding the output gap to monetary rules, introducing
shocks to government expenditures, TFP and price markups, and modifying the targets of the
financial policy rule. Overall, the qualitative features of our main findings continue to hold, with
the exception that with only TFP or government expenditure shocks financial policy has negligible
effects. Full details are provided in Sections B.1-B.8 of the Appendix.


                                                       34
4.4.1   Price stickiness & financial sector parameters
    Appendix B.3 reports the results for four parameterizations: (a) “stickier” prices (ϑ = 0.85
v. 0.74 in the baseline), so that firms reset prices every two years on average rather than once a
year, (b) larger monitoring costs (µ = 0.30 v. 0.12 in the baseline), which increases monitoring
costs to nearly a third of the entrepreneurs’ gross returns, (c) riskier entrepreneurs (σ̄ω = 0.40
v. 0.27 in the baseline), which nearly doubles the average variability of the entrepreneurs’ profits,
and (d) zero steady-state financial subsidy (τf = 0 v. 0.96% in the baseline), which allows costly
state verification to distort the deterministic stationary equilibrium and makes the financial rule
more likely to fluctuate between subsidies and taxes. For each scenario, we re-compute the op-
timized rule elasticities that minimize welfare costs under the STR, ATR, and DRR regimes, and
solve for the cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria.

    Tinbergen rule is quantitatively relevant in all four cases. The DRR delivers welfare gains of
roughly 1% and 2% relative to ATR and STR, respectively. Strategic interaction delivers results
that echo the baseline findings, with some variations worth noting. For instance, as in the baseline,
the monetary reaction function shifts from strategic complements to substitutes in the choice of
aπ as arr changes when σ̄ω = 0.40 and τf = 0, while it displays only strategic complementarity
when ϑ = 0.85 and µ = 0.30. In contrast, the financial reaction curves always display a shift from
strategic complements to substitutes as in the baseline. In all cases, the Nash equilibrium yields a
tight-money, tight-credit regime with respect to the best-policy and cooperative outcomes. In turn,
the latter is a tight-money regime with respect to the best policy regime when ϑ = 0.85, σ̄ω = 0.40,
and τf = 0, but it is a loose-money regime when µ = 0.30. The credit policy of the cooperative
equilibrium does not display a clear pattern with respect to the best policy case. It is a tight-credit
regime when τf = 0, slightly tighter when ϑ = 0.85, and looser when µ = 0.30 and σ̄ω = 0.40.

    In case (a), with a higher degree of price stickiness, the central bank responds more aggres-
sively, particularly when the financial authority is relatively passive (i.e. for low arr ). As docu-
mented in Appendix B.3, the best response of the monetary rule elasticity features larger comple-
mentarities with the financial rule elasticity, so that monetary authority finds optimal to increase
aπ more aggressively than in the baseline as arr decreases, and more so when arr is low.

     In cases (b) and (c), stronger financial frictions increase the variability of efp and π, which
implies that the policy rules of all three regimes have to respond to larger deviations from their
targets. If the variance of efp increases more than that of π, we should expect a more aggressive
reaction by the financial authority, reflected in an upward shift of its reaction function relative to
the baseline (i.e. a shift towards easier credit policy). In contrast, if the variance of π rises more
than that of efp, we should observe a rightward shift in the monetary reaction function relative to
the baseline (i.e. a shift towards tighter monetary policy). In Appendix B.3, we show that when
µ = 0.30, efp becomes much more volatile than π, and thus we find a shift towards easier credit
policy by the financial authority in comparison to the baseline, while monetary policy increases
its strategic complementarity with financial policy. As a result, the policy regime is loose-money,




                                                  35
loose-credit v. the baseline. In the case with σ̄ω = 0.40, the variances of efp and π increase in a
similar manner, and so we find just a slight shift towards a regime of tighter-money, tighter-credit
with respect to the baseline, with only moderate shifts in the reaction curves.

     In case (d) (i.e. removing the steady-state financial subsidy), Nash yields a slightly tighter fi-
nancial policy rule (lower arr ) and a much tighter monetary policy rule (higher aπ ) than in the
baseline Nash case and in the cooperative and best-policy equilibria with τf = 0. The curvature of
the reaction curves is similar to that in the baseline, but the monetary (financial) authority’s reac-
tion curve shifts rightward (downward). Hence, the policy spillovers reflected in the curvature of
reaction curves are similar with and without the steady-state financial subsidy, but the optimal elas-
ticity of one authority’s rule changes when the other authority’s elasticity is set to its lowest level.22

    The monetary authority sets aπ higher when arr = 0 in the case with τf = 0 than in the baseline,
because with both arr = 0 and τf = 0 there is no financial policy. Since in the neighborhood
of arr = 0 the two policy rule elasticities are strategic complements, when financial policy is
removed the central bank cannot benefit from the effect of the financial policy response to risk
shocks on inflation, and thus it chooses a higher Taylor rule elasticity. The financial reaction curve
shifts because of an analogous effect. The financial authority sets arr lower (i.e. tightens financial
policy) when aπ is close to 1 in the case with τf = 0 than in the baseline, because when aπ → 1
the monetary policy reacts passively to inflation deviations. Since in the neighborhood of aπ → 1
the two elasticities are strategic complements, when the monetary policy becomes less responsive
to inflation, the financial authority cannot benefit from the effect of the monetary policy response
to risk shocks on efp, and thus it responds more aggressively by choosing a lower arr .

4.4.2    Monetary rules responding to output gap
   Appendix B.4 documents results showing that, using monetary rules that include the output gap
with an elasticity ay , setting ay = 0 always yields the lowest welfare costs. Hence, our quantitative
findings on Tinbergen rule are identical to those obtained with the baseline model. This finding
holds for two specifications of output: one consistent with the resource constraint (2.17), so that
output equals aggregate demand plus monitoring costs (yt = ct + cet + it + g + µG(ω̄t )rtk qt−1 kt−1 ),
and one that matches the definition of output in the national accounts, so that output equals aggre-
gate demand only (ỹt = yt − µG(ω̄t )rtk qt−1 kt−1 ). To find the optimized elasticities, we perform a
two-dimensional search over aπ and ay for the STR regime, and three-dimensional searches over
aπ , ǎrr , and ay for the ATR regime and over aπ , arr , and ay for the DRR regime.

    The result that welfare costs are minimized with ay = 0 in the STR regime may seem puzzling,
because one may think that by responding to the output gap the central bank could address some
of the real effects caused by efp fluctuations. This is akin to replacing the spreads in the ATR
regime with the output gap. The question is then whether augmenting the STR rule with the output
gap could do as well as the ATR rule. In the model we proposed, the answer is no, since setting
ay = 0 yields the smallest welfare cost in the STR regime. This result echoes Schmitt-Grohé and
  22
     Setting τf = 0 also reduces the long-run investment- and capital-output ratios because of the efficiency losses due
to costly monitoring, as we explained earlier (see Table 2), but with the local solution method these effects do not alter
significantly the cylical tradeoffs that determine the curvature of reaction curves.


                                                           36
Uribe (2007), who find that interest-rate rules with ay > 0 can lead to large welfare losses, because
inflation volatility tends to increase with ay > 0 and this makes the inefficiencies due to price
dispersion larger. The answer would be different if the central bank does not focus on welfare but
instead minimizes a loss function that includes the variance of the output gap. In this case, the
central bank may find optimal to set ay > 0, even if social welfare is lower. See Appendix B.4 for
an analysis of the effects of varying ay on output variability.

4.4.3   Determinants of welfare costs
  The results of robustness experiments showing how changes in parameters values affect the wel-
fare analysis are detailed in Appendix B.5. We vary the habit parameter h in the interval [0, 0.95],
the monitoring costs parameter µ in the interval [0, 0.50], and the Calvo pricing parameter ϑ in the
interval [0, 0.90]. These changes are introduced one at a time, keeping the rest of the parameters at
their baseline calibration values.

    The total welfare cost of risk shocks, ce, is always large and varies non-linearly in all these
experiments, with regions in which it is nearly invariant to parameter variations and regions in
which it rises sharply. ce rises sharply as µ starts to rise from zero, reaching roughly 4%, 5%, and
6% when µ = 0.05 in the DRR, ATR, and STR regimes respectively. As µ rises above 0.05, ce
increases at a much slower pace and eventually becomes slightly decreasing in µ. The opposite is
observed for h and ϑ. The value of ce is nearly unchanged as these parameters rise from zero, until
eventually ce becomes a very steep function of both. For ϑ, there is an intermediate region in which
ce is slightly negatively-sloped, but as ϑ rises above 0.8 the value of ce increases rapidly with ϑ.
The highest costs are roughly 5%, 7% and 8% when ϑ is about 0.9 in the DRR, ATR, and STR
regimes respectively. For h, ce becomes a steep, increasing function of h for h > 0.7, with vertical
asymptotes as h approaches 1. For h = 0.9 (higher than the 0.85 baseline value), the costs reach
about 5%, 7.5%, and 10% in the DRR, ATR, and STR regimes respectively. This high sensitivity
of welfare costs to high degrees of habit formation is in line with Campbell (1999), who argues
that consumers with strong habits can be viewed as less able to make short-term adjustments in
consumption to adjust to shocks, which implies that fluctuations are costlier.

   DRR always dominates ATR and STR, and this is because it yields consumption processes
with higher averages and lower variances. For instance, in the baseline case, mean consumption
under DRR is 1.5% and 2.2% higher than under ATR and STR, respectively. In turn, the standard
deviation of consumption under ATR (STR) is 2.5 (3.1) times higher than under DRR.

    Appendix B.5 also provides a detailed analysis showing that, in line with the baseline results,
the large welfare costs of risk shocks in all the experiments are due to changes in the long-run
averages of consumption and lifetime utility relative to the deterministic steady state. In turn, costly
state verficiation, via its effect on mean efp and resources used up in monitoring costs account for
a large fraction of welfare costs. The contribution of cyclical volatility is small and comparable to
the negligible costs of business cycles found by Lucas (1987). Across all three policy regimes and
all parameter variations considered, the overall welfare cost of risk shocks ranges between 1.54%
and 7.95%, and the mean effect accounts for at least 90% of these costs. The cost of business cycles
ranges between 0.01% and 0.68%.

                                                  37
4.4.4   Introducing additional shocks
    We study next the implications of adding shocks to government expenditures, TFP, and price
markups (see Appendix B.6 for details). First we study replacing risk shocks with one of the other
shocks one at a time. In sharp contrast with the baseline results, using the ATR is suboptimal for
all of these alternative shocks (i.e. the welfare costs are minimized when ǎrr = 0). In the model, if
business cycles are driven by fiscal, TFP, or markup shocks, the central bank does best by setting
the interest rate focusing only on inflation targeting, ignoring efp. Hence, for these alternative
shocks STR and ATR are equivalent, so we refer to them jointly as the STR/ATR regime.

     For the DRR regime, we find again that for government expenditure and TFP shocks there is
no role for financial policy in the model, since the optimized elasticity is arr = 0. Hence, for these
shocks DRR is also equivalent to the STR. A Taylor rule with an inflation elasticity of about 2.3
(2) for government expenditure (TFP) shocks yields the best welfare outcome. For markup shocks,
however, the optimized arr is positive, and hence the DRR regime differs from the STR/ATR
regime. In the STR/ATR regime, the optimized elasticity of the Taylor rule is aπ = 2.1 (and
ǎrr = 0), while in the DRR regime the optimized elasticities of the separate rules are aπ = 2.2 and
arr = 2.4. Thus, monetary policy is about as tight in the STR/ATR as in the DRR regime, but fi-
nancial policy is much tighter. Tinbergen rule is again quantitatively relevant: welfare is 1% higher
under DRR than under STR/ATR (i.e. welfare costs of markup shocks are roughly 1% smaller).

     The irrelevance of financial policy with either TFP or government expenditure shocks follows
from differences in the way the shocks interact with the financial accelerator. Risk shocks have
first-order effects on efp, and the resulting changes in the variability and long-run average of efp
have strong effects on allocations, prices and welfare via the financial accelerator. Hence, it is
natural that financial policy is relevant with risk shocks. For the other shocks, however, we need
to examine further how they interact with the financial sector in order to understand why financial
policy is relevant with markup shocks but not with TFP and government expenditure shocks.

     One reason for financial policy to be weaker with the alternative shocks is methodological: Per-
turbation methods used to solve New Keynesian models do not capture fully the non-linear effects
of the financial accelerator. The external finance premium is a convex function of net worth, and
to the extent that shocks cause large changes in net worth the local methods underestimate efp and
its real effects. This is less of a problem for risk shocks because they have first-order effects on efp.

    There are also features of the model’s financial transmission mechanism that weaken the in-
teraction of the financial accelerator with TFP and government expenditure shocks but not with
markup shocks. Appendix B.6 provides impulse response functions for positive shocks to gov-
ernment expenditures and markups and a negative TFP shock. The results explain why financial
transmission is weak for shocks to government expenditures and TFP. These shocks result in higher
inflation and declines in consumption, investment and the price of capital.23 The shock to govern-
  23
      Shocks to government expenditures have opposing effects on inflation. On the one hand, higher government
expenditures increase aggregate demand and hence push for higher inflation. On the other hand, since agents in the
model are Ricardian, government expenditures crowd out private expenditures, weakening aggregate demand. Inflation
still rises with government expenditures, but by less than a one-to-one effect.


                                                       38
ment expenditures has a positive effect on output, while the other two have a negative effect. But
for financial transmission the key difference across these shocks is in the response of input pro-
ducers and their effect on credit spreads. With shocks to government expenditures or TFP, input
producers increase demand for labor and capital, as they aim to meet the excess demand in the final
good market. As a result, the rental rate of capital increases, which increases capital returns and the
entrepreneurs’ net worth, counteracting the downward pressure on these variables that the fall in
the price of capital exerted, and thus weakening the financial accelerator. efp rises around 2 basis
points after the shock to government spending and 5 basis point after the shock to TFP (8 and 20
basis points in annual terms, respectively), while investment falls 0.5% and 0.8% in each case.24
In contrast, an increase in markups strengthens the monopolistic distortions affecting the inputs
market, causing input producers to reduce their factor demands, so that wages and the rental rate
of capital fall. The latter intensifies the fall in entrepreneurs’ net worth, strengthening the financial
accelerator. In this case, efp rises 10 basis points (40 in annual terms) under the STR/ATR policy,
and investment and output fall 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively.

    In the setup with markup shocks, when financial policy is active under the DRR, the initial rise
in efp moderates to just 2 basis points (8 in annual terms), and investment and output fall only 0.9%
and 0.3%. There is a short-term cost in consumption, however, due to the increase in lump-sum
taxes to pay for the financial subsidy (see Section 4.2). Still, in the long-run consumption attains
a higher mean under DRR than under the STR/ATR (about 2.2% higher) and welfare costs are
100 basis points lower. Examining strategic interaction, we found again that reaction curves are
nonlinear and that the Nash equilibrium yields a tight-money, tight-credit regime, with a welfare
cost 1.23 percentage points higher than with the Best Policy (DRR) outcome.

    We consider next a scenario in which all four shocks enter the model. We calibrate the shocks
following Christiano et al. (2014).25 Our main results continue to hold. Tinbergen rule is again
quantitatively relevant: Welfare in the STR regime is 254 basis points lower than in the DRR
regime. In addition, the gains derived from coordinating financial and monetary policies are of the
same order of magnitude as in the baseline case with only risk shocks. Welfare is 37 basis points
higher under DRR than under Nash. The rationale behind these results is Christiano et al. (2014)’s
finding that risk shocks are the most important source of output fluctuations. Therefore, adding
other shocks to the model does not alter our findings much. See Appendix B.7 for further details.

    Table 6 compares optimized elasticities and welfare costs for DRR, ATR, and STR with the
four shocks, and the outcome of Nash and Cooperative equilibria against the DRR regime. The
Table shows that Nash and STR are tight-money regimes in comparison to the DRR regime. In
turn, ATR is a loose-money rule in comparison to the DRR regime, while the welfare-maximizing
cooperative equilibrium has a similar inflation elasticity than the DRR regime. In turn, all of
the regimes, with the exception of the symmetric cooperative equilibria, are tight-credit rules in
comparison to the DRR regime.
  24
      These numbers are consistent with results showing that the financial accelerator accounts for a small share of
business cycles in standard BGG models with shocks to TFP or government expenditures.
   25
      They included a larger set of shocks than these four, but these four contribute about 80% of the variance of output
in their model.

Note: “Optimized Elasticities” are those from the sets used in constructing Figure 2 that produce the lowest welfare
cost under each regime. ce v. DRR is the difference in ce under ATR or STR relative to DRR in basis points. “Full ce”
is the welfare cost defined in equation (2.19). Full ce is decomposed into an effect due to changes in long-run averages
(“Mean eff. Total”) and an effect due to fluctuations (“SD eff.”). Mean eff. Total is computed as in equation (2.19) but
                                                      
replacing W (aπ , arr ; %) with U E[c], E[`h ], E[C] /(1 − β), where E[c], E[`h ], E[C] are long-run averages under
each policy regime. “Mean eff. Net” removes the long-run average of monitoring costs from the Mean eff. calculation,
by treating monitoring costs as private consumption in the resource constraint.


4.4.5     Alternative financial policy rules
   Two financial policy rules targeting variables other than spreads are equivalent, up to a first-order
approximation, to the baseline rule. One rule targets leverage and the variability of entrepreneurs’
profits, the other targets the ratio of debt to net worth and again the dispersion of profits. These
rules yield the same impulse response functions as the baseline (see Appendix B.8 for details).

    Using the optimality conditions of intermediaries, we can prove that the baseline financial rule
in eq. (2.15) is equivalent, up to a first-order approximation, to a rule that sets the financial subsidy
to respond to deviations of leverage and the standard-deviation of entrepreneurs’ profits from their
steady-state levels, with elasticities set to particular values. The alternative financial rule is:
                                                        x ax  σ aσ
                                                           t       ω,t
                              1 + τf,t = (1 + τf ) ×                      ,                          (4.2)
                                                          x       σ̄ω
where ax , aσ > 0 are the elasticities with respect to leverage and the variability of profits. Intu-
itively, an increase in leverage or in the dispersion of profits raises the probability of default of
entrepreneurs, and thus efp, and hence a rule that reacts to these variables is akin to one that targets
efp. First-order equivalence is obtained by setting ab = χx arr /(1 + arr ) and aσ = χσ arr /(1 + arr ),
where χx , χσ > 0 are reduced-form coefficients that depend on the model’s parameters. 26

  26
     A first-order approximation to the first-order conditions of the optimal financial contract yields: efp   c + τ̂f,t =
                                                                                                                  t
χx x̂t +χσ σ̂ω,t . Combining this result with the first-order approximation of the baseline financial rule (τ̂f,t = arr efp
                                                                                                                        c ),
                                                                                                                           t
we obtain efp
            c = (χx x̂t + χσ σ̂ω,t )/(1 + arr ). From here, it is straightforward to see that an alternative financial rule
               t
that reacts to xt and σω,t , of the form τ̂f,t = ax x̂t + aσ σ̂ω,t , can be constructed to be equivalent to the baseline
financial rule. Making the two rules equivalent requires χx − ax = χx /(1 + arr ) and χσ − aσ = χσ /(1 + arr ).

                                                            40
     For the second rule, the balance sheet of entrepreneurs implies that there is a close relationship
between an entrepreneur’s debt, its leverage, and its net worth, since xe,t ≡ qt ke,t /ne,t = 1 +
be,t /ne,t (see Section 2.2). Hence, a financial rule that reacts to efp is also equivalent, up to a
first-order approximation, to a rule setting the financial subsidy to respond to changes in aggregate
private debt, aggregate net worth, and the dispersion of entrepreneurs’ profits:
                                                           a       a
                                                      bt /nt b σω,t σ
                             1 + τf,t = (1 + τf ) ×                       ,                        (4.3)
                                                       b/n        σ̄ω
where ab > 0 is the elasticity of with respect to bt /nt . This rule is equivalent (up to a first-order
approximation) to the baseline rule if we set ab = χb υb arr /(1 + arr ) where υb ≡ (x − 1)/x.27


5        Conclusions
    This paper undertakes a quantitative study of coordination failure in the implementation of
monetary and financial policies using a New Keynesian model with the Bernanke-Gertler financial
accelerator and risk shocks. Price stickiness and costly monitoring of borrowers cause risk shocks
to produce inefficient economic fluctuations and long-run efficiency losses. Monetary and financial
policies face two forms of coordination failure when used to tackle these distortions. First, viola-
tions of Tinbergen rule, because a regime in which monetary policy alone tackles both distortions
is inferior to one in which separate monetary and financial policy rules targets them separately.
Second, strategic interaction between monetary and financial authorities, because the equilibrium
determination of each authority’s target depends on the instruments controlled by both authorities,
and these spillovers incentivize strategic behavior.

    The quantitative analysis yields four key results: 1) Welfare costs of risk shocks are large, rang-
ing from 3.8 to 6.5% across the various policy regimes examined, because risk shocks increase the
long-run average of the external finance premium causing large efficiency losses in investment and
payments for monitoring costs. 2) The costs of violating Tinbergen rule are large. The standard
Taylor rule (STR) and an ATR regime in which the Taylor rule is augmented to target credit spreads
produce lower welfare and larger fluctuations in response to risk shocks than a dual-rules-regime
(DRR). In the DRR, monetary policy follows a Taylor rule setting the nominal interest rate to tar-
get inflation and a financial policy rule sets a subsidy on financial intermediation to target spreads.
Moreover, STR and ATR yield tight money-tight credit regimes in which the interest rate rises
too much when inflation rises and does not fall enough when spreads widens. 3) Reaction curves
for the optimal choice of policy rule elasticities of the monetary and financial authorities are con-
vex, switching from strategic complements to substitutes in the adjustment of those elasticities.
4) Standard quadratic payoff functions yield a Nash equilibrium significantly inferior to coopera-
tive equilibria and to a welfare-maximizing DRR regime, and both the Nash and the cooperative
equilibria are also tight money-tight credit regimes. Still, even the Nash equilibrium dominates the
STR and ATR regimes.

    27
     A linear approximation to the aggregate balance sheet of entrepreneurs yields x̂t = υx (b̂t − η̂t ). Hence, a financial
rule that responds to bt , nt , and σω,t , so that τ̂f,t = ab (b̂t − n̂t ) + aσ σ̂ω,t is equivalent to the linearized baseline rule
if we set ab = χx υx arr /(1 + arr ) and aσ = χσ arr /(1 + arr ).

                                                               41
     Our findings are robust to important parameter variations, including the degree of price stick-
iness, the severity of financial frictions, and the persistence of habits. The results are also robust
to modifications adding the output gap to monetary rules, introducing shocks to TFP, govenrment
expenditures and price markups, and modifying the financial policy rule to target leverage or the
debt-net worth ratio and the variability of entrepreneurs’ profits instead of spreads. Financial policy
is relevant only if risk shocks and/or markup shocks are present, otherwise if there are only shocks
to government expenditures or TFP the financial accelerator is too weak and a policy regime with
a standard Taylor rule dominates.

    This analysis raises two important issues for further research. First, for tractability, we used
perturbation methods to quantify the amplification effects of risk shocks in the Bernanke-Gertler
financial accelerator. As Mendoza (2016) explained, these methods underestimate the magnitude
of the financial amplification and hence of the distortions that the financial subsidy should address.
Second, our analysis included only the costly monitoring features of financial intermediation em-
bodied in the Bernanke-Gertler setup. This setup abstracts from other important features of actual
financial systems, such as securitization, systemic risk, and balance sheet leveraging, and abstracts
also from informational frictions other that costly state verification.
