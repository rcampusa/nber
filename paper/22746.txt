                                           ABSTRACT

Previous randomized studies have shown that addressing children’s current learning gaps, rather
than following an over-ambitious uniform curriculum, can lead to significant learning gains. In this
study, we evaluate a series of efforts to scale up the NGO Pratham’s approach to teaching children
according to their actual learning level, in four Indian States. While this approach was previously
shown to be extremely effective when implemented with community volunteers outside of school,
the objective of these new scale-up evaluations was to develop a model that could be implemented
within the government school system. In the first two instances (Bihar and Uttarakhand), the
methodology was not adopted by government schoolteachers, despite well-received training
sessions and Pratham support. Motivated by the quantitative and qualitative analysis of these early
attempts, we adapted the approach and designed large-scale experiments in the states of Haryana
and Uttar Pradesh to test two new scale-up models. In Haryana, teachers received support from
government resource persons trained by Pratham, and implemented the approach during a
dedicated hour. In Uttar Pradesh, Pratham volunteers implemented high-intensity, short-burst
“learning camps” for 40 days, in school and during school hours, with additional 10-day summer
camps. Both models proved effective, with gains in language of 0.15 standard deviation in
Haryana, and 0.70 standard deviations in Uttar Pradesh, on all students enrolled in these schools at
baseline. These two models provide blueprints that can be replicated inside other government
systems.

1 Introduction
   Despite rapid gains in s c h o o l enrollment over the past several decades, learning levels are

stagnating in many developing countries. In India, for example, the 2005 ASER survey found that

39 percent of fifth graders could not read at a second-grade level (ASER Centre, 2005). Repeated

surveys have found that Indian students perform significantly below grade-level standards in both

math and reading, with essentially no improvements in any Indian states over the past several years

(ASER Centre, 2014). Other large surveys in Pakistan, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana have

found similar levels of children performing significantly below competency standards for core subjects,

demonstrating the pervasiveness of this issue among developing countries (Andrabi et al., 2007; Uwezo,

2014; NEA, 2008).

   These persistently low levels of achievement are not due to a lack of available solutions. In

particular, a number of experimental studies have shown that simple changes in pedagogy can lead

to significant improvements in learning levels. Interventions which focus on targeting teaching to

the current learning levels of students, such as remedial education (Banerjee et al. 2007), computer

assisted learning (Banerjee et al., 2007) and tracking (Duflo et al., 2011) have systematically

found large effects on learning levels. However, while governments occasionally experiment with

these interventions (IGC, 2014), most previous evaluation efforts have focused largely on

interventions led by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which rely on NGO staff or

volunteers for teaching with new methods. There has been less experimentation on how to induce

similar pedagogical changes among existing government schoolteachers. This is a critical gap,

since reforming the government school systems would allow these practices to reach a much

larger number of children and more effectively utilize the time they already spend in school.

   This paper reports on our iterative efforts to design, experiment, re-design, and experiment

again until two successful, replicable models were developed to scale up such a pedagogical
approach within a government school system in India. Over the last fifteen years, Pratham, one of

India’s largest NGOs, has been developing instructional models that can improve children’s

learning at scale in a cost effective and simple way. In Pratham’s approach, instructors teach basic

language and mathematics according to the level of the children, rather than a prescribed age-grade

syllabus. Children are organized into groups by ability levels and are taught using level-appropriate

teaching, learning activities, and materials. Learning goals are simple and clear, and ongoing

measurement is used to assess progress. A previous study (Banerjee et al., 2010) showed that, when

implemented with carefully monitored but lightly trained community volunteers in the state of

Uttar Pradesh, the program (which focused on reading) significantly improved the reading ability

of children who attended the program.

   To test whether Pratham’s model could be adapted and scaled within the government system,

we implemented several different experiments in the states of Bihar, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and

Uttar Pradesh between 2008 and 2014. In the first experiment, the “summer camp” (implemented in

Bihar during the summer of 2008), government teachers, oriented by Pratham and assisted by

village volunteers, were recruited to provide remedial education during summer vacation. These

summer camps increased test scores by 0.07-0.09 standard deviations, compared to the control

group, suggesting that teachers are capable of effectively teaching remedial skills to children.

   Then, in two parallel experiments conducted in Bihar and Uttarakhand between 2008-2010,

three arms were compared: (1) Some schools received learning materials without any additional

support; (2) Teachers were trained to teach with the Pratham method during the school year, and

received the appropriate materials; (3) Materials were provided, and both teachers and volunteers

were trained (although volunteers had somewhat different roles in each state: In Bihar, they

worked outside of schools, following the original Pratham model; whereas, in Uttarakhand, they

were placed inside schools). Villages or schools were randomly selected to receive one of the three
models (or to be a control group), and data was collected at baseline and after two years. These

experiments confirmed that an exact replication of the original Pratham volunteer model (which

was implemented in Bihar) was effective in this different context, but also found that all the other

scale-up models failed. This failure was due to several reasons: providing only materials was

insufficient; trained teachers did not adopt the methodology and instead used the textbooks

prescribed for the relevant grades, and when volunteers were placed inside schools, they were used

by teachers as assistants to implement traditional methods.

       Motivated by these results, process data from the research studies, considerable field

experience, and qualitative interviews, Pratham developed two approaches to mainstream the

program within government schools, which addressed the main gaps of the previous attempts: (1)

The first, meant to be implemented in an environment with good teaching resources, relied on

teachers to implement the program; however, it also made sure that teachers had a dedicated time

in the day devoted to the program, and were supported from within the government hierarchy; (2)

The second, meant to be implemented in very poor teaching environments, relied on Pratham staff,

replicating the “camp” approach within the government schools.

       The first of these two models was implemented by the state government in Haryana during

2012-2013. In this model, a cadre of government officials at the cluster level were first trained by

Pratham with each cluster level official being responsible for providing academic support to 12-15

schools. Next, cluster officials conducted about 15 days of “practice” where they themselves taught

daily in schools, based on the teaching-by-level approach that they had been trained in. Once the

“practice” period was over, cluster officials rained teachers, with Pratham staff assisting as needed.

Appropriate teaching materials developed by Pratham were used in the schools, and the program

was implemented during a dedicated hour each day. In Haryana, the focus of the learning

improvement effort was on reading; math was not covered. In addition, schools were supervised
and monitored by the cluster officials.

       The second model was evaluated in Uttar Pradesh during 2013-2014. Here Pratham staff and

village volunteers ran “learning camps” (periodic bursts of intensive activity, forty days in total) in

schools. These took place during the school day and in school premises, and were supplemented

with a 10-day intensive burst of “summer camps”.

   In Haryana, the school-year intervention, which was led by government teachers and supported

by government supervisors, increased reading scores by 0.15 standard deviations (as mentioned

earlier, the program focused only on reading). In Uttar Pradesh, where the methodology was taught

by Pratham volunteers during school time, test scores increased by a staggering 0.61-0.70 standard

deviations (from a much lower base than Haryana) in both math and language.

   Guided by process monitoring data generated by the study, our interpretation of the results is

that success of the program relies on systematic implementation of the two key

ingredients of Pratham’s methodology: ( 1 ) grouping of children by initial learning level, and

(2) focusing on skills appropriate to that level (which was very basic in several of the groups). In

Pratham programs that are run out of school and by Pratham volunteers or employees (such as the

original study, or the the program tested in Bihar), these components are systematically implemented

properly and the program improved test scores.

   However, mainstreaming these fundamental changes in pedagogy into the regular school

curriculum is difficult without careful top-down support and monitoring. In teacher-led programs that

ran during the school year in Bihar and Uttarakhand, classrooms were never re-organized around

initial learning levels. By contrast, the teacher-led program in Haryana, which was implemented

in a dedicated time slot, and included supervision by government monitors, led to successful

reorganization of classrooms and therefore higher reading scores. In Uttarakhand, even volunteers

were not able to implement the grouping methodology since they were used by teachers as
assistants to carry out their regular activities. By contrast, in Uttar Pradesh, during the “camp” days

in Uttar Pradesh schools, Pratham volunteers were allowed to reorganize and regroup children for a

few hours during the school day to implement the teaching-by-level methodology, leading to the

largest impacts. In both Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the on-site monitoring and ongoing support

that teachers and instructors received as the intervention progressed were likely a strong factor of

success.


2 Programs and Experimental Design
   The results presented in this paper come from multiple randomized evaluations in which a core

pedagogical approach was implemented at different points in time, with differences in delivery

method (government school teachers, or Pratham staff or volunteers), duration (intensive camp

mode, or daily instruction over the course of the school year), and location (in school or in the

communities).

   In this section, we first introduce the common elements of the Pratham programs before

discussing how the specific context and implementation differed in each location.


2.1 Common Elements
2.1.1 Context

   In government primary schools, the curriculum consists of a prescribed syllabus for each grade,

with automatic promotion through grade 8. Thus, children falling behind the expected levels

according to the syllabus in early grades continue to progress through the system unchecked

without ever being forced, or given the opportunity, to learn basic skills. Teachers also have strong

incentives to target their instruction to the highest-performing students in their classes. As a result,

by grade 5, 39% of children are unable to read at a grade 2 level, a number that has not improved

since 2005 (ASER Centre, 2005; ASER Centre, 2014).4
2.1.2   Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) pedagogy

   The core element of all Pratham’s Programs discussed here is the pedagogy: it is called

Combined Activities for Maximized Learning (CAMaL), but is also referred to as “Teaching at the

Right Level” (TaRL). We call it TaRL below. This pedagogy has evolved over the years from

Pratham’s own intensive experience, internal assessments, as well as external randomized

evaluations, including Banerjee et al. (2010) and Banerjee et al. (2007).

   Although this strategy can be used for all students, the approach has been designed primarily

for those who have reached grades 3 to 5 but are well behind their expected level of achievement,

according to the “grade-appropriate” curriculum used in government schools. Its approach focuses

on building basic reading and arithmetic skills. Students are grouped by their actual (rather than

expected) learning level, and frequently tested. The method also utilizes interactive and attractive

materials that have been designed by Pratham and are constantly updated.

   Although a great deal of experimentation and effort have gone into its development, the actual

instructional methodology is simple to use. Instructors who use the pedagogy are often given only

a week of training, with practice sessions built in. During the intervention, there is typically on-site

mentoring and ongoing monitoring as well as periodic reviews, discussions, sharing of experiences

and refresher training as needed.

   Although the TaRL pedagogy has evolved over the last decade, since 2007 it has been rolled

out across India primarily as part of Pratham’s flagship Read India program. The majority of the

locations covered by Read India have been rural schools and communities. In almost all cases,

Pratham has directly trained all instructors, whether the instructors were Pratham team members,

or community-based volunteers. For training of government teachers, usually Pratham worked with

a team of master trainers from the government side. The Read India program intends to be a

complement to, and not a substitute for, the typical activities taking place in government schools.
   Pratham’s early pilot of Read India took place in 2005-2006 in Uttar Pradesh. Pratham staff

mobilized youth volunteers from the village communities where Read India classes were to be

held, and then trained and monitored the volunteers during the intervention period. Classes were

held after school hours during the 2005-2006 school year. The program was evaluated by randomly

assigning 85 villages to a control group, and 65 villages to a Read India intervention group, and

two other village mobilization groups that did not involve the program. The evaluation showed

significant improvements in reading skills among children in Read India villages, compared to all

the other groups (Banerjee et al., 2010).

   The instrumental variables estimates of treatment on the treated also demonstrated large gains

for children actually attending the classes, suggesting that the TaRL pedagogy, run by village

volunteers, could deliver learning content effectively. However, the “take-up” of the program in

the village was low, limiting the impact on the average child: only 17% of students with the lowest

learning levels participated in classes. Effectively working within the government education

system would make it possible to reach a much larger number of students who are already in

school.

2.1.3 Evaluations

   The programs evaluated in this paper were all implemented in northern states of India, in which

Hindi is the primary written and spoken language. In each of the examples discussed in this paper,

the program was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. Within the randomization design,

the interventions were compared to a control group. In some cases, the pedagogy was implemented

in different forms within the same context and time, and the different implementation strategies

were compared and evaluated within the same study design.

   The main outcome measures are children’s performance on the ASER language and math tests.

The ASER reading test measures child’s reading ability in terms of the following classifications:
beginner (cannot recognize letters), letter recognition, word recognition, paragraph reading (grade

1 level text), and story (grade 2 level text). The ASER Math test measures child’s math level in

terms of the following classifications: beginner (cannot identify single-digit numbers), one-digit

number recognition, two-digit number recognition, subtraction, and division. In each of these

assessments, children are marked at the highest level that they can comfortably attain. These tests

have been extensively piloted by Pratham as well as researchers at the ASER Centre and the Abdul

Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).


 2.2   Bihar and Uttarakhand: Summer Camps, Materials, Teacher training,
       and Volunteers
Based on the Uttar Pradesh evaluation (Banerjee et al., 2010) and other implementation
experiences, Pratham’s Read India program evolved to include schoolteachers as well as
volunteers. By 2008, a number of state governments had begun collaborating with Pratham in
running learning improvement interventions in schools. The evaluation in Bihar and Uttarakhand
was undertaken to evaluate the new model involving schoolteachers. The program and
accompanying evaluations were the result of a partnership involving Pratham, the respective
state governments, and J-PAL. The evaluations took place simultaneously in Bihar and Uttarakhand
over the two school years of 2008-09 and 2009-10.

2.2.1 Context

For these first set of interventions, Bihar and Uttarakhand were chosen due to their contrasting

characteristics with regard to initial learning levels, socio-political contexts and administrative

capabilities. Uttarakhand is slightly more developed. In 2008, Uttarakhand had a lower out-of-

school population, higher private school enrollment, and slightly better state-wide test scores than

Bihar (ASER Centre, 2009; ASER Centre, 2014). According to the 2008 ASER survey, 5.7 percent

of children in the 6-14 age group were out of school in Bihar in 2008, compared with 1.2 percent in

Uttarakhand, and only 51 percent of Bihar’s children in grade 2 could read at word recognition
level, compared with 62 percent in Uttarakhand (ASER Centre, 2009). Within each state, we

selected geographic areas that were broadly typical for each state in terms of socio-economic

conditions and education levels, but that were also feasible for large-scale survey work. In Bihar,

this led to the selection of blocks in West Champaran, a poor district on the border of Nepal, while

in Uttarakhand, blocks in the lowland districts of Dehradun and Haridwar were selected..

2.2.2 Programs

   The program was implemented in four different forms in direct coordination with schools in the

treatment villages. In Summer Camps (run only in Bihar during June 2008), the first intervention

intended to provide remedial instruction to academically weak children in grades 3-5 during a one-

month summer camp, which was conducted in school buildings by government school teachers. In

reality, however, children in grades 1-5 were reached by the camp, and therefore we use this

sample in our analysis. Pratham provided materials and orientation for government school teachers,

and also trained volunteers who supported teachers in the classroom. The government school

teachers were paid extra by the government for their service over the summer period.

   The other three interventions were conducted during the school year. The first model

(implemented only in Bihar) involved the distribution of Pratham materials with no additional

training or support (refereed to hereafter as the Materials (or M) treatment). The second variant of

the intervention included materials, as well as training of teachers in Pratham methodology and

monitoring by Pratham staff (referred to as the Teachers and materials (TM) treatment). The

third and most intensive intervention included Materials, training, and volunteer support

(TMV) treatment. In addition to the materials and training components of the other interventions,

in the TMV treatment villages, volunteers were recruited to provide additional support, especially

in working with children who needed the most help with basic reading and arithmetic. Following

local discussions with government education staff, there were distinct approaches to the use of the
volunteers: in Bihar, volunteers worked outside school hours in the community, though they

sometimes used school premises. School teachers were also consulted on which children should be

sent to the volunteers for extra support. This was thus the closest replication of the standard

Pratham Model that had been previously evaluated in Uttar Pradesh (Banerjee et al., 2010). In

Uttarakhand, volunteers supported teachers in their work within the school day, and did not work

outside of school. Teachers were not only trained on how to improve basic reading and arithmetic,

but were also trained in using the TaRL methodology for basic skills.

2.2.3 Evaluation Design

   In the Bihar sample, schools in about 120 villages were randomly assigned to receive summer

camps, while 40 served as a control group and were not offered a summer camp. The effectiveness

of summer camps was evaluated based on the comparison of these two groups. Subsequently, those

that received summer camps were randomly assigned to receive one of the three remaining

interventions: M, TM, or TMV with about 40 villages in each group. The control group from the

summer period remained the control group during the school-year evaluation. In Uttarakhand, none

of the villages received summer camps, and they were randomly assigned to the control group, TM

or TMV, with about 40 villages in each group. In both states, the control groups received all

normal government support activities, but no additional support from Pratham during the project

period.

   To identify the sample, a census of households was conducted in each village in the study, and

households with children aged 5 to 14 were randomly selected from this list to be tested and

surveyed. Overall approximately 5,200 households with 12,300 children were included in Bihar

(about 33 households per village) and 4,050 households with 8,900 children in Uttarakhand (about

35 households per village). Households and children were surveyed and tested prior to the

initiation of any intervention activity and at the end of each of the two school years. In Bihar, a
sample of children from villages participating in the summer camp (and controls) were surveyed

immediately after the camp.

   In addition to the ASER tests described above, children were also administered written Hindi

and math tests. These tests, each taking 20-25 minutes to administer, tested higher-level

competencies than the standard ASER tests. In Hindi, separate tests were used for children in

grades 1-2 and 3-5.

   All government schools in the study were also surveyed. These surveys consisted of interviews

of headmasters, teachers, and observations of school conditions. School surveys were designed to

be implemented at baseline, and during the first and second school-year endlines. In both school

years, enumerators undertook unannounced visits to all schools to observe school conditions and

track program implementation. These surveys involved collecting data on school attendance, self-

reported material usage by teachers, interviews with children, teachers and volunteers, and

observations of Hindi and math classes.

   For the baseline, an international survey company was selected for the survey work. Their

performance was substantially below expectations. In Bihar, the survey was judged to be of just

adequate quality to use the data, but baseline test scores were missing or had to be dropped for a

significant number of children. For all subsequent surveys, the study switched to a local survey

company, based in Patna, Bihar, with satisfactory results. In Uttarakhand, the survey team was

worse, and evidence of forgery of data by surveyors was discovered. The initial baseline had to be

discarded, and subsequent surveys were self-managed. In order to get baseline information before

the intervention started, a shorter baseline survey was undertaken that only involved the ASER test

of children.

   Research staff observed overall implementation and training of teachers, and held regular

discussions with Pratham field workers to obtain information on discussions with state and
district governments, and form a qualitative impression of progress. This was complemented by

additional qualitative work, including an “institutional review” undertaken by the Centre for Policy

Research, New Delhi, to inform our understanding of the workings of Pratham and the nature of

interactions with state teaching services (see Kapur and Icaza, 2010). A second qualitative analysis

was undertaken by research staff involving semi-structured interviews with teachers, focus groups

of teachers in resource centers, and focus groups of mothers in a small sample of schools and

villages in both Bihar and Uttarakhand (Sharma and Deshpande, 2010).


2.3 Haryana: Teacher Training with Supervisory Support and Dedicated
    School Hour
   As shown in the results below, of the various interventions tested in 2008-2010 in Bihar and

Uttarakhand, those involving schools during their regular functioning did not lead to significant

score gains, while those relying on a dedicated cadre during a dedicated period (i.e. volunteers

outside of schools and government school teachers during summer camps) were effective. Pratham

continued to explore models to integrate their pedagogy into the formal educational system, while

confronting the inertia of traditional teaching practices. In the continuing evolution of the Read

India model, Pratham’s next step was to enable a cadre of government officials who could train,

mentor, monitor and provide on-site support to teachers as they used the TaRL model in their

schools, and more effort was devoted to signal that the program was not optional, but an integral

part of the school routine, slotted in a specific time-period. In the 2012-13 school year, Read

India’s TaRL model was tested in schools in the state of Haryana.

2.3.1 Context

   Haryana ranks third highest among Indian states in per capita income (Reserve Bank of India,

2011). Similarly, at the time of our study’s baseline, student learning levels were higher than the

national average: 52% of students in grades 1 to 8 in Haryana could read a grade 2 level text while
the corresponding number was 38 percent for India as a whole, placing Haryana, again, third

among Indian states (ASER Centre, 2011a).

   Two districts in Haryana were chosen for the evaluation: Mahendragarh and Kurukshetra.

Lying at opposite ends of the state, these districts were selected by the state government, Pratham,

and the researchers because of their different economic profiles. While learning of primary

schoolchildren in each district are similar to the statewide average (ASER Centre, 2011b),

Kurukshetra is more economically developed than Mahendragarh. For example, 96% of

households in Kurukshetra are electrified, compared with 80% in Mahendragarh (Census of India,

2011).

2.3.2 Program

   There were several new features to the Read India model that were implemented as part of the

Haryana evaluation. First, all efforts were made to emphasize that the program was fully supported

and implemented by the Government of Haryana, rather than an external entity. To make this

evident, one important innovation was the creation of a system of academic leaders within the

government that could guide and supervise teachers as they implemented the Pratham

methodology. In the state of Haryana, the existing school monitoring system included field-level

supervisors and monitors, known as Associate Block Resource Coordinators (ABRCs). Although

the administration had provided general guidelines on the roles and responsibilities of the ABRCs,

the government typically did not provide specific training on how to operationalize these

responsibilities in schools. ABRCs had also been used generally as “couriers” collecting

information regarding various programs in the schools and delivering letters. Overall, the emphasis

with respect to program/project management had been restricted to ad-hoc data collection on

physical inputs, with no attention paid to educational outcomes or impact. As part of the

interventions, Pratham gave ABRCs four days of training and field practice. ABRCs were then
placed in groups of three in actual schools for a period of 15-20 days to “test” the Pratham

methodology of grouping by level and of providing level-appropriate instruction. Once the

“practice” period was over, ABRCs in turn trained the teachers that were in their jurisdiction.

Pratham staff assisted and supported the ABRCs in this process.

   The second important feature is that the program was implemented during a dedicated hour

during the school day. Beginning in the 2011-12 school year, the Government of Haryana

mandated that all schools add an extra hour of instruction to the school day. Within TaRL schools,

the extra hour was to be used for class reorganization and teaching remedial Hindi classes using the

Pratham curriculum. This was done merging and re-organizing across grades 3, 4, and 5. In the

control schools, the school day was just longer and the extra time was used to conduct classes

using their standard pedagogy. Reserving the same specific hour for restructuring the classroom

across all schools simultaneously sent a signal that the intervention was government-mandated,

broke the status quo inertia of routinely following the curriculum, made it easier to observe

compliance, and made it practically easier for teachers to teach at the child’s level.

   At the start of the intervention, which coincided with the beginning of the school year, the

government schoolteachers, guided by ABRCs, administered a brief oral assessment of each

student’s reading ability in Hindi. This assessment was used to group children by level for the

“special period” during the school day. During the extra hour, in TaRL schools, all children in

grades 3-5 were reassigned to ability-based groups and physically moved from their grade-based

classrooms to classrooms based on levels as determined by the baseline assessment. Once classes

were restructured into these level-based groups, teachers were allocated to the groups for

instruction. Classroom reorganization of this type had been part of the teacher training in Bihar and

Uttarakhand, but it received more emphasis in the Haryana training. Also, in Haryana, teachers

were trained to re-organize classrooms across grades (teach by level, not by age), while in Bihar
and Uttarakhand the class groups were to be done within each class.

2.3.3      Evaluation Design

   Four blocks, two in each of the districts, were randomly selected as the intervention sites.

Across these four blocks, a total of 400 schools were randomly drawn from a list of all 467

government schools located in the four blocks.

   The study of the TaRL model was conducted alongside an evaluation of another government

program: Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), which involved training government

teachers to regularly assess and provide highly detailed feedback on student performance across

both curricular and extracurricular activities. The 400 schools were assigned in equal proportions

to either a control group, TaRL only, CCE only, and TaRL combined with CCE. We find no

detectable effect of the CCE program, as reported in Berry, et. al. (2014). In the analysis that

follows, we include (but do not report) dummies for assignment to the CCE program.

   Baseline testing took place in the 2011-12 school year, before implementation of the programs,

and endline testing took place at the end of the 2012-13 school year, following implementation

in schools assigned to the treatment groups. Local staff hired and trained by J-PAL South Asia

administered and scored all tests.

   In primary schools, our sample consisted of students who were in grades 1-4 at baseline (and

would therefore be in grades 2-5 during the intervention). Tests were administered to a maximum

of 10 randomly selected students in each grade in each school (which had on average 17 students

per grade) at both baseline and endline, yielding a sample of 12,576 students. For all students in the

sample, we collected basic demographic data – including gender, caste, religion, age, and parents’

occupations – as well as records of recent school attendance from school registers in each round of

testing.

   Primary school students in grade 3 or higher at either round of testing were also administered
written Hindi and math assessments. The written tests, developed for the evaluations in Bihar and

Uttarakhand, tested students on competencies which they should be able to demonstrate by the end

of grade 4. The written Hindi and math tests were each scored on a scale from 1 to 12.5 at both

baseline and endline.

   In addition to student testing, data on school composition, as well as teaching and evaluation

practices were collected through surveys of school headmasters conducted simultaneously with

student testing at both baseline and endline. The endline headmaster survey also included modules

on program implementation, knowledge of how to implement the Pratham pedagogy, and

involvement of ABRCs.

   Finally, we incorporated an extensive program of process monitoring into our study design.

This consisted of close monitoring of all training sites where teachers were taught the TaRL

methodology and surprise visits to each of the 400 evaluation schools by trained J-PAL monitors

between August 2012 and March 2013. During school visits, monitors administered an extensive

questionnaire that included modules on program implementation, the availability of learning

inputs such as textbooks and uniforms, monitoring by ABRCs, and other topics. Monitors also

observed a randomly selected teacher within each school for thirty minutes to collect data on

teaching and evaluation practices in the classroom.


2.4 Uttar Pradesh: In-School Learning Camps
2.4.1 Context

   Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India, with a population of 199.8 million as of the

2011 census (Census of India, 2011b). Learning levels are particularly low in the state: as of 2011,

only 48 percent of children in grades 3-5 could read grade-1 level text, the second-lowest

percentage of all Indian states (ASER Centre, 2011a). The interventions in Uttar Pradesh took

place in the districts of Sitapur and Unnao, both in rural areas in the center of the state. These
districts were chosen because they are large enough to support survey activity and Pratham

volunteer mobilization, but they did not have any previous Pratham activity. Learning levels in

Unnao are near the statewide average, while they are slightly lower in Sitapur (ASER Centre,

2011b, 2012).

2.4.2 Programs

   Given the level of learning in Uttar Pradesh, the weakness of the educational bureaucracy in the

state, and the high level of absenteeism in school, Pratham’s assessment was that there was not

enough capacity in Uttar Pradesh to take over the TaRL program following the Haryana model.

Therefore, they designed a version of the program that was implemented by volunteers, but could

take place within schools, allowing it to reach the largest possible number of children. Guided by

the experience in Uttarakhand, the key was, once again, to create a clearly delineated space and

time for the program and to also avoid seeing the volunteers simply being absorbed by the

schoolteachers. To create this space, the program was conducted in the form of “Learning Camps”

– intensive bursts of teaching-learning activity using the Pratham methodology. During the camps,

all children were grouped according to their existing level of learning achievement, and the

activities and material were designed to move children to the next level on the ASER test. The

camps were led by Pratham volunteers, who all but took over the school during that short period.

Pratham staff also regularly monitored the camps in each school and assisted the volunteers in

administering the camps.

2.4.3 Evaluation Design

   Sample schools in four blocks of Sitapur and Unnao were selected and randomly divided into

either a 10-day camp treatment, a 20-day camp treatment, a treatment group that received only

Pratham learning materials, or a control group, with approximately 120 schools in each group. In

the 10-day camp treatment group, schools received four 10-day rounds of camp, whereas for the
20-day camp treatment group, schools received two 20-day rounds. In both groups, a 10-day

booster camp was held during summer vacations. Permission was obtained from the Uttar Pradesh

school administration to implement these camps within school premises during school hours. On

"camp" days, children from grades 3-5 were grouped according their ability level and taught Hindi

and math for about 1.5 hours each by Pratham team members and assisted by trained village

volunteers. The volunteers were closely supervised by Pratham staff. In the materials-only

intervention (M), schools were provided with Pratham learning materials to be used by the teachers

and distributed to the students. No other form of academic support was provided by volunteers or

Pratham staff.

   The tests were administered to all students enrolled in grades 3-5. In addition to the child

assessments, a headmaster survey was conducted during baseline as well as endline. The

headmaster survey included questions on their perceptions regarding student’s learning outcomes,

attitude towards low performing students and activities carried out in schools to help low

performers. As with the other evaluations, a systematic process monitoring survey was set-up to

collect data on attendance, evidence of learning by "grouping," activities during "camp" sessions,

teaching practices of volunteers, involvement of school teachers, and the school teachers’

perceptions of "camp" activities.


3 Results
3.1 Descriptive Statistics

   In each location, the analysis sample consists of the group of children targeted by the

program. Because the programs targeted slightly different groups of children, the samples differ

across locations. The Bihar summer camps and Bihar and Uttarakhad school year program

included teachers and children from grades 1-5 We use the sample of children who were between

the grades 1 and 5 in both years of the programs. The Haryana and Uttar Pradesh interventions
targeted children in grades 3-5 in school.

   Table 2 displays basic summary statistics of key baseline variables across treatment and control

groups in the four intervention areas. There are few differences across the intervention areas in

terms of age, grade, and test scores. Average Hindi test scores range from about 1.1 in the Bihar

sample (just above the letter level), to 1.6 in Haryana (between the letter and word levels). Math

test scores average below 1 (one-digit number recognition) in all four areas.

   Table 2 also evaluates the balance of these baseline variables across treatment and control

groups. The Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh samples show no significant differences

across these variables (at the 10% level). On the other hand, in the Bihar sample, for 3 out of 6

variables, the F-test rejects equivalence across treatment and control groups at the 5% level.

   Appendix Table 1 displays attrition patterns across treatment and control groups in program

locations. Attrition ranged from about 2.1 percent in Uttar Pradesh, to as high as 20 percent for the M

and TM intervention groups in Bihar. As shown in the last row of each panel, attrition is not

significantly related to treatment group assignment in any location.



3. 2 Empirical Specifications

   Our results are based on the following specification:

   yist = α + Tsβ + δyist0 + Xisθ + εist      (1)

where yist represents the normalized test score for student i in village/school s at endline t

(normalized by subtracting the endline mean in the control group, and dividing by the standard

deviation), Ts is a vector of dummy variables indicating inclusion of the village/school in each

treatment group, yist0 represents the student’s normalized baseline test score, and Xis is a vector of

student- and school-level characteristics common to all datasets, including gender, age, and grade.

Standard errors are clustered at the level of randomization (village for Bihar and Uttarakhand, school
campus for Haryana, and school for Uttar Pradesh). We run Equation (1) separately for each state,

and separately for the Bihar summer camp and school year interventions.

   The Bihar and Uttarakhand samples also include children who did not take the baseline test but

were added based on the household surveys at midline or endline. We include dummy variables to

indicate missing values for their baseline test scores.


3.3 Main Results
   Table 3 displays the main results of each experiment on language and math scores. As shown in

Panel A, the Bihar summer camp intervention resulted in an increase in language scores of 0.09

standard deviations (significant at the 5 percent level), and an increase in math scores of 0.07

standard deviations (significant at the 10 percent level). We note that these results are observed

even though exposure to the summer camps was limited: only about 23 percent of children in

treatment villages attended the camps.

   Panel B displays the impacts of the three Bihar school-year interventions. Among the three

treatment groups, only the combined TMV intervention resulted in a statistically significant

increase in test scores, with a 0.13 standard deviation increase in language and a 0.11 standard

deviation increase in math. The M and TM interventions did not have statistically significant

impacts on either math or language. Since the M and TM interventions seem to have had no effect,

the difference in the TMV intervention is likely due to the volunteers only, working outside of

school. These results therefore replicate the findings of the original Uttar Pradesh study detailed in

Banerjee et al. (2010), which, as discussed above, also found that an intervention using volunteers

to teach camps outside of schools led to significant gains in reading skills.

   Panel C displays the results for the two Uttarakhand treatments. Neither the TM nor the TMV

interventions resulted in statistically significant increases in language or math scores

   As shown in Panel D, the Haryana TaRL intervention resulted in a 0.15-standard deviation
increase in language test scores (significant at the 1 percent level). The program did not focus on

mathematics at all, and correspondingly we find that it had no significant impact on math test

scores.

   Finally, Panel E of Table 3 displays the impacts of the interventions in Uttar Pradesh. The 10-

day camp intervention increased both language and math test scores by 0.7 standard deviations,

while the 20-day camp intervention increased language and math test scores by 0.6 standard

deviations. These results are all significant at the 1 percent level. The M intervention also had a

small, but significant, impact on math scores, with an increase of 0.04 standard deviations

(significant at the 5 percent level).


3.4 Heterogeneity by Pretest Score
   To examine whether the interventions were most effective for the highest- or lowest-

performing children at baseline, we disaggregate impacts by baseline ASER level. Table 4 displays

treatment effects (in levels moved) for each baseline level in language and in math. For language,

the four classification levels are Beginner (child cannot recognize letters), Letter (child recognizes

letters), Word or Paragraph (child recognizes words or can read a paragraph with grade 1 level

text), or Story (child can read a story with grade 2 level text). Across the interventions with

statistically significant impacts on aggregate language scores—Bihar Summer camp, Bihar TMV,

Haryana TaRL, and Uttar Pradesh 10-day and 20-day learning camps—there are no consistent

patterns of monotonically increasing or decreasing impacts by baseline language level. Instead, the

largest impacts occurred for children at the letter level at baseline, while those who could not

recognize letters (beginner level) typically experience the second largest impact.

   For math, the baseline levels are: Beginner (cannot identify single-digit numbers), Single or

Double Digit Number (one-digit and two-digit number recognition), Subtraction, and Division.

Again, among the treatment groups that show statistically significant impacts on aggregate math
scores, there are no patterns of monotonically increasing or decreasing effects across baseline math

levels. For Bihar TMV, effects are largest among those scoring lowest at baseline, while the Uttar

Pradesh interventions show the largest impacts among those who could recognize numbers at

baseline.


3.5 Process Data
   To shed light on the intensity of implementation of each program, we turn to process data

collected by enumerators. Process data were collected for the school year interventions in all four

project sites. In Bihar and Uttarakhand, each school was visited once during the year, while in

Haryana and Uttar Pradesh each school was visited at least twice. Enumerators collected

information on teacher and student attendance, and observed classroom teaching. In Bihar and

Uttarakhand, enumerators observed 4th grade Hindi and math classes, spending about 2 hours on

classroom observations during each visit. In Haryana, enumerators observed a randomly-selected

class for 30 minutes. In Uttar Pradesh, enumerators would spend an entire day in schools during

"camp" days to allow them to observe both language and math classes.

   We focus our analysis on teacher attendance and classroom observations among the

interventions with schoolteachers in Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Haryana. (Monitoring data from the

Uttar Pradesh intervention are still being processed.) The monitoring surveys in each state

contained different questions about classroom practices; however, here we compare similar sets of

questions across locations.

   We first examine the extent to which teachers had been trained in the Pratham methodology.

Table 5 displays the percentage of teachers trained across locations and treatment groups. In Bihar,

67% of the teachers in the TM and TMV groups had been trained, while only 1-4% were trained in

the control and M groups. In Uttarakhand, however, teacher attendance in training was much

lower: only 28% of teachers in the TM group, and 45% of teachers in the TMV group received
training, compared with 15% in the control group. Compliance with training was the highest in

Haryana, where 96% of teachers in the treatment group, and virtually no teachers in the control

group attended training.

   We next turn to classroom observations. In each state, enumerators observed whether Pratham

materials were being used during the observed classes. Table 5 also displays the percentage of

observed classrooms which were seen using Pratham materials. In both Bihar and Haryana

treatment groups, a substantial number of teachers used Pratham materials. In Bihar, use was

highest in the TM and TMV treatments, where 56-64% of teachers were using the materials. In

Haryana, teachers used Pratham materials in 74% of the classes reserved for TaRL, and in virtually

none of the classes in either the control group or in treatment classes outside of the TaRL time.

Rates of usage were much lower among Uttarakhand treatment groups: Only 25.7% and 33.8% of

classrooms used Pratham materials in the TM and TMV groups, respectively.

   Finally, we examine the arrangement of students in each school. As described above, the

Pratham methodology calls for grouping of students by learning levels, rather than by grade in

school. Table 5 further displays the observed classroom arrangements in the three states. Here the

differences between Bihar/Uttarakhand and Haryana are the starkest: in very few cases (10 percent

or less) were students grouped by learning levels in Bihar and Uttarakhand, even in the TM and

TMV treatments. In Haryana on the other hand, over 90% of schools were grouped by learning

levels during the time reserved for TaRL. At other times in TaRL schools, and in the control group,

virtually no students were grouped by learning level.

   In sum, we observe substantial numbers of trained teachers in Bihar and Haryana, and

substantial use of Pratham materials in both these states. In Uttarakhand, however, the number of

trained teachers and the percentage of classrooms using Pratham materials were much lower. By

contrast, the classroom arrangement was substantially different in Haryana compared with Bihar
and Uttarakhand: students were much more likely to be grouped by levels. In the following section

we utilize these results in providing an overall interpretation of the findings across project

locations.


4 Discussion
   There results confirm that the core Pratham pedagogy, when implemented, has significant

impact on learning outcomes: this was found in Uttar Pradesh (Banerjee et al., 2010), Bihar,

Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh again. This method can be effectively implemented by village-level

volunteers without formal teacher training, and by existing government teachers, after they have

received a relatively short training on how to do this. The key challenge to mainstreaming the

program in government schools was the tendency to revert back to the traditional curriculum and

school organization, which occurred in some locations when the program was implemented in

schools and during the normal school year.

   In the original implementation in Bihar and Uttarakhand, classrooms were typically not re-

organized by level of learning at any point during the class, and no specific time was assigned to

the activities. Cluster Resource Centre Coordinators (CRCCs, the equivalent of ABRCs in

Haryana) were part of the training, but not given special functions. Qualitative evidence suggests

CRCCs were often preoccupied with activities other than ensuring effective teaching, let alone

organizational arrangements in treatment schools (Sharma and Deshpande, 2010).

   The Haryana program addressed the core problems identified in the Bihar and Uttarakhand

implementation. The TaRL treatment took place during the regular school year, with a dedicated

hour specified in the school schedule to implement the program. Additionally, during the training

of ABRCs, the importance of sorting children by their actual learning levels was explicitly

emphasized. This was backed by a concerted effort by Pratham and research staff to give the

ABRCs specific functions in implementation. Pratham’s staff ensured ABRCs did 15-20 days of
practice classes before teachers were trained, with the program designed to be led by ABRCs. In

addition, research staff helped set up a monitoring system and taught the ABRCs how to monitor

teaching activities, with the intention of monthly visits to ensure schools were implementing the

TaRL treatment. The process monitoring data suggest that this was quite effective. The frequency

of ABRC visits to schools varied from month to month, but at the final process monitoring visit to

each school, 80% of schools reported a visit from an ABRC in the previous 30 days. Of those who

reported a visit, 77% said that the ABRC spent over an hour in the school, and 93% said that the

ABRCs observed a class in progress in at least one visit.

   Evidence for the different level of implementation in Haryana compared with Bihar and

Uttarakhand is reflected in the grouping of students in classes, as shown in the previous section.

Students in Haryana were much more likely to be grouped by learning level. This was not because

of lack of awareness or lack of use of the materials. As shown above, teacher training was largely

successful in both Bihar and Uttarakhand, and substantial use of Pratham materials was observed.

The only substantive difference observed with the Haryana case was the successful organization

into learning groups during the dedicated hour, for which the additional effort on training and

monitoring of ABRCs, as well as the clear demarcation of a specific time, appear to be key.

   In parallel, Pratham has developed a model to work with volunteers in school, and with all the

children. The Uttarakhand TMV program failed for very much the same reason as the TM

program: Pratham volunteers were absorbed as general-purpose teacher assistants and were not

given any space to conduct the TaRL activities, e.g. grouping children by level and focusing on

their current achievement. However, in the original implementation in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh

(2005-6), or in Bihar, few children were reached because they had to be coaxed in coming after

school.

    In Uttar Pradesh (2013-4), volunteers worked in school, with all children, but during a
dedicated time period (40 days). During that time, the schools were essentially taken over by the

volunteers. Pratham volunteers and staff led the implementation, with very little involvement of

government school teachers. Process monitoring results from Uttar Pradesh indicate that around

60% of school teachers never got involved in the camps even though they happened in school

during school hours. Even among the teachers who did get involved, their involvement was

restricted to taking student attendance and maintaining discipline. From our conversations with

teachers, it seemed that while they found the method effective and materials interesting, they did

not think that adopting them was a part of their "core" responsibility.

   It is quite remarkable that 40 days of active teaching lead to such large learning gains: The

Uttar Pradesh gains (0.7 standard deviation in both language and math) are enormous, and far and

away the largest of all the interventions we tested. Figures 1 and 2 summarize visually the results

in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The treatment effect is so large that by endline, treated children

entirely catch up with the Haryana control children, and almost reach the level of the treated

children in Haryana (in Uttar Pradesh, 48% of the treated children can read at the grade 2 level at

endline; in Haryana, 47.5% of the control children can, and 53% of the treatment children), despite

a huge gap (20 percentage point difference) at the baseline. This reflects in part the abysmal

performance of the school system in Uttar Pradesh, where very little is happening in control group

schools: the number of students who cannot recognize any letter between baseline and endline in

the control group fell from 34% to 24% in Uttar Pradesh, while it fell from 27% to 8% in Haryana.

The number of students who can read at grade 2 level increased from 14% to 24% in Uttar

Pradesh, compared with 34% to 47% in Haryana. But the fact that the children actually reach the

Haryana level in Uttar Pradesh also demonstrates the relative ease with which apparently daunting

learning gaps can be closed. Given the relatively low cost of working with volunteers, it means that

this model is as “legitimate” a scale-up model as the one that involves teachers. Since teachers are
happy to let volunteers work (but hard to convince to change their practices), volunteers seem to be

doing a remarkable job, and recruiting volunteers is not difficult, working with volunteers, which

appears to be extremely effective at least in environment with low starting level of learning, may

be more sustainable.




5 Conclusion
      Learning levels have been “low and stuck” in India for at least a decade, despite large gains in
 enrollment, improvement in school facilities, and massive exit to private schools. The experiments
 reported here show that this appears to be largely a self-inflicted problem: in 50 days of focused
 teaching by lightly trained volunteers, students can catch up from close to the lowest achievement
 levels in India to the level of learning of the third highest achieving state in the country (Haryana).
 The core pedagogical principle would seem to be basic common sense: group children by level of
 achievement, and target activities to the level they are at.
      And yet, the core difficulty that these evaluations have outlined is the resistance of both
 parents and the school bureaucracy to implement this approach. When the program is implemented
 outside of school, take up is low, and the resulting impacts, while high per child treated, is not as
 high as it could be on average. When the program is implemented in school, either by school
 teachers or by volunteer, it tends to be swallowed in business as usual: the clearest symptom being
 that classrooms are not re-organized by learning level.
      In this paper, we present two models that were evolved over several years, and successfully
 take on this implementation challenge: In Haryana, teachers lead the effort, supported from within
 the hierarchy, and with specific instructions to implement the activities and re-organize the
 classroom for one hour per day. In Uttar Pradesh, Pratham volunteers, supported by the Pratham
 hierarchy, lead the activities during specific periods which are entirely devoted to this program. As
 both these models led to significant learning gains, Pratham is now actively promoting these two
 blueprints, both of which can now be considered for scale-up in other states.
