                                Introducti on



      Understanding the behavior of real interest rates is a central

issue in monetary/macro economics.1 In previous research on this topic,

several approaches have been used to measure real interest rates. In one

approach, real interest rates have been calculated by subtracting survey

data on inflation expectations, such as the Livingston data, from

nominal interest rates.2 The problem with survey—based measures of real

Interest rates is that they are only as good as the survey measure of

inflation expectations and there may be little incentive for the survey

respondents to answer accurately. An even more telling criticism of

survey—based measures, often Ignored In the literature, is that the

behavior of market expectations is driven by economic agents at the

margin who are eliminating unexploited profit opportunities. Market

expectations are unlikely, therefore, to be well measured by the average

expectations of survey respondents.3

      Because of doubts about survey—based measures of real interest

rates, other researchers have used the assumption of rational expecta-

tions and ex—post real interest rate data calculated with aggregate




      Here, the term "real Interest rate" refers to the ax—ante real
      interest rate, that Is the expected real return an a bond. When
      referring to the actual realized real return on a bond, the term
      "ex—post real interest rate" will be used,
  2
      For example, see Gibson (1972), Cargill (1976), Lahiri (1976),
      Carlson (1977), Levi and Makin (1979), Tanzi (1980) and Wilcox
      (1983).

price level data to make inferences about real interest rate behavior.4

There are several difficulties with this approach as well. First is the

need for the rational expectations assumption. Although rational expec-

tations Is a maintained hypothesis in much current research in monetary

economics, there are questions about Its validity particularly when

there is a shift from one policy regime to another. An additional

problem with this approach is that unanticipated inflation appears as a

component of the error term in the statistical analysis. As a result,

statistical tests may have low power. Another consequence of the

presence of unanticipated inflation in the error term is              that the

variability of real interest rates cannot be examined directly.

       Because of the difficulties with the analysis of ex—post real

interest rates derived with aggregate price level data, recent research

has begun to use futures market data to examine real interest rate

behavior.6 Futures market data can be used to directly construct own—

commodity real interest rates ——       i.e.,   the ex—ante real return on a bond

in terms of specific commodities —— and then the own—commodity real

rates can be used to make Inferences about the real interest rate for

the aggregate economy. This approach avoids the use of the rational

expectations assumption and eliminates unanticipated inflation from the

error term, while allowing the researcher to directly examine the

variability of real Interest rates.

       Despite the advantages of futures market data for examining real

 interest rates, it does suffer from one major potential disadvantage.

Own—commodity real rates constructed using futures market data contain

not only information about the real interest rate for the aggregate

economy, but also information about ax—ante relative price movements If

the ax—ante relative price movements (which can be thought of as noise)

are greater in magnitude than movements in the aggregate real interest

rate (the signal), then the noise to signal ratio in own—commodity real

rates will be high. Own—commodity real rates constructed using futures

market data might thus contain little information about the aggregate

real interest rate, which is of primary concern to economists.

     This paper examines whether futures market data can be used to

understand the behavior of real interest rates1 The conclusion is      a


negative ones Futures market data do not appear to be particularly

informative about real Interest rates.7 In coming to this conclusion,

the paper examines the data In several ways. First, the ex—ante relative

price movement embedded in the own—commodity real rates (the noise) is

calculated to be on th. order of over one hundred times more variable

than the aggregate real interest rate (the signal). Own—commodity real

rates are thus unlikely to contain much information about the aggregate

real interest rate. Second, several widely accepted facts about the

behavior of aggregate real interest rates in the 1980s are not at all



    More precisely stated, the conclusion is that own—commodity real
    rates constructed with futures market data for specific commodities
    cannot be used to understand the behavior of aggregate real interest
    rates. However, reliable data from a futures contract for an ag-
    gregate price level index, such as the CPI, would get around the
    problems described in this paper. There is currently a CPI futures
    contract which is traded on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange,
    but data from this contract cannot be used to understand the recent
    behavior of real interest rates. The CPI futures contract has not
    been very successful and so has very low trading volume. The thin-
    ness of the market thus makes the data suspect. In addition, the
    contract has only been traded since June of 1985, so that no data is
    available to examine the behavior of real interest rates around the
    critical date of October 1979,
                                       4



evident in the own—commodity real rate data. Thus, analysis of own—

commodity real rates provides a misleading impression of aggregate real

rate movements for a period which displays the most striking movements

of real interest rates in the postwar period. Finally, an econometric

analysis of own—commodity real rate behavior fails to find evidence of a

shift in the behavior of real interest rates when the monetary policy

regime changes in October 1979, a finding that ii at odds with previous

strong findings in the literature.

     Th. overall strategy of the paper has been to beat the data with a

rubber hose ——   i.e.,   to look at the own—commodity real rate data in as

many ways as possible. All the evidence consistently casts doubt on the

usefulness of futures market data for understanding real interest rate

behavior. Not only does this cast serious doubt about some of the

results in previous research such as Cornell and French (1986) and

Hamilton (1986) that make use of futures market data to draw inferences

about real interest rates, but it also indicates that future research on

real interest rates must turn to a different line of attack.

                     A Comparison of Methodologies




     The own—commodity real rate for a particular commodity equals the

ex—ante return on a one—period bond in terms of that specific commodity.

With the existence of a futures market, an Investor can lock in this cx—

ante real return at time t by selling the commodity J at a price of

use the proceeds to purchase a one—period bond with a rominal return

(interest rate) of i, and then transform the proceeds received at time
t+1 back into the commodity at the futures price set at time t, F. The

own—commodity real rate for commodity .j          is   thus defined as,8

                            t
                                —   ln(F/S)
                                       t t


where,

                rr • the own—commodity real rate at time t
                       for commodity i,

                                    the ex—ante rate of change of
                 ln(F/S)
                       commodity j ——         i.e.,   the logarithmic basis1

                F * the         futures price at time t for delivery of

                       commodity i at time t+1,9

                      • th. spot price at time t for commodity i.



An attractive feature of the own—commodity real rate rr defined above

is that it     is directly observable at time t and does not require any

assumption about expectations formation, such as rational expectations,

In order to be measured. This enables the researcher to examine a more

complete specification of the stochastic process of the own—commodity

real rate which involves how the variability of real rates evolves over

time.




     Note that all returns, inflation, and interest rates in this paper
     are continuously compounded, so that no second—order terms are
     needed in equation (1).

     Strictly speaking, F in equation (1) should be the price of a
     forward contract rather than a futures contract. As Black (1976) has
     pointed out, futures contracts are priced differently from forward
     contracts. However, this difference should be minor relative to
     movements of real interest rates. To the extent that prices of
     forward contracts and futures contracts differ, this is just one
     more reason why futures market data may not provide reliable infor-
     mation about the behavior of real interest rates.

      To see how own—commodity real rates                are linked   to the real interact

rate, we can note, as    in Cornell and French (1986), that if futures
markets existed for all commodities in the commodity bundle of the

aggregate price index, then the riskless real interest rate for the

aggregate economy, rr, can be written as a weighted average of all the

own—commodity real rates.

                     • the expenditure weight for commodity j ——                  i.e.,
                          the   relative     expenditure on commodity j in the

                                                                          n

From (1) and (2), we can immediately see that the own—commodity real

rate for commodity j is equal to the aggregate real interest rate plus

the ex—ante relative price movement for commodity i; i.e,




(3)
                 rr rrt - Cln(F/S) -E   ln(F/S)]
                                    Jal
                     • rr —         j




where,
                     a    the ex—ante relative price movement for
                          commodity .1 at time t.
                                           7


We can thus think of each own—commodity real rate as a measure          of the

aggregate real interest rate which Is subject to a measurement error of

      the ex—ante relative price movement.

       it is important to point out that there is a possibility that an

own—commodity real rate may contain no information about the real inter-

est rate. Suppose that a commodity is storable at zero cost and there

are no restrictions on selling this commodity short in the spot market.

Then this commodity will be subject to a cash-and—carry arbitrage condi-

tion in which the percentage difference between the forward rate and the

spot rate must equal the nominal interest rate. In this case, the own—

commodity real rate will necessarily be constant and equal to zero. For

commodities that are likely to be subject to cash—and-carry, own—

commodity real rates should not be very helpful for learning about the

behavior of real interest rates.

       The real interest rite usually studied in the literature is the ex—

ante real return on a nominally rickless bond, which Is defined as,



                       *           S
(4)               rrt 1 —


where,
                  rr the expected real return at time t of a one—

                           period bond maturing at time t+1,
                   I
                           the   expected rate of change (at time t) in the

                            aggregate price level from time t to t+l.



Note that this real interest rate is not riskiess in real terms because

there is uncertainty about the inflation rate. It will thus differ from

the rickless real interest rate, rrt, by a risk premium. If this risk
                                                B


premium is small relative to the movements in real interact rates as

teems     likely, then it is reasonable to assume that rrt •              rr',   and to

simplify the discussion, we will treat them as identical below.

        The real interest rate in (4)           is not observable because ir         is
unobservable, but, as discussed in tllshkin (1981a), we can examine the

ex—post real rate which is defined as,



(5)                eprr •    i     —




where,

                   eprrt •   the       realized real return on the one—period

                             bond held from time t to t+1,

                      •   the change in the aggre9ate price level from

                             time t to t+l.



The ex—post real rate can be written In terms of the real Interest rate

as,




(6)
                   eprr      i —           —
                                                    — i,)   rr   —




where,
                             —          • the   forecast error of inflation.



The equation above thus tells us that the ax—post real rate is Just

equal to the real interest rate plus an error term which is the forecast

error of inflation.

        Two disadvantages of using ax—post real Interest rate data to

examine the behavior of real interest rates are readily understandable
                                    9


from the equation above. The presence of the t   forecast   error of infla-

tion term in ax—post real rates means that the researcher cannot

directly examine how the variability of the real interest rate changes

over time. Specifically, without knowledge about the variability of

inflation forecast errors, information about the variability of the real

Interest rate cannot be directly extracted from Information about the

variability of the ax—post real interest rate. The second disadvantage

stems from the fact noted In Mishkin (1981a) that the presence of the

inflation forecast error term implies that statistical tests using cx—

post real rates will have low statistical power. Equation     (3)   and our

discussion of own—commodity real rates Indicates, however, that they are

also subject to a similar disadvantage. Specifically, for both ax—post

real rates and own—commodity real rates there is a signal to noise

problem. For own—commodity real rates, the noise is the ax—ante relative

price movement, •,     while   for ex—post real rates, the noise is the

inflation forecast error,      If the ex—ante relative price movements,

     are far greater in magnitude than movements in the real interest

rate, then examining own—commodity real rates is unlikely to help us

understand the behavior of real Interest rates. Furthermore, if the

variance of    greatly exceeds the variance of      then we are likely to

obtain better information about the behavior of real interest rates from

using ax—post real rate data than from own—commodity real rate data

constructed using futures market data.

     Now that we understand the issues relating to the advantages and

disadvantages of using futures market data, we can go on to examine what

the data on own—commodity actually looks like.

                                    III.
             An Examination of the Own—Commodity Real Rate Data




    Th. futures market data were obtained from the Center for the Study

of Futures Markets, Columbia Business School. The empirical analysis

requires a choice of non—financial commodities with equal spacing be-

tween contracts that also were traded for a substantial period both

before and after October 1979. Precious metals are not included in the

study because they are most likely to be subject to cash—and—carry

arbitrage which implies that they will contain little information about

real interest rates1 These criterion lead to the selection of five

commoditiesi live cattle (id *2), live hogs (id *4), soybeans (Id * 17),

frozen orange juice (Id * 12), and lumber (Id * 27). The sample period

for cattle, hogs and soybeans extends from January or February, 1967

until January or February 1986. Because earlier data was not available,

the sample period for orange juice extends from January 1968 until

January 1986, while that for lumber Is from January 1971 until January

1986,

        These commodities have contracts maturing every two months, so that

the observation interval and holding period for the own—commodity real

rates is two months long. In calculating the logarithmic basis (i.e.,

the ex—ante rate of change in the commodity price), it is important to

make sure that the future and spot prices pertain to the exact same

commodity. Thus the futures price for the maturing contract is used as

the spot price for the commodity. For example, the logarithmic basis for

cattle (at an annual percentage rate) In February, 1967 is calculated ae

600 times the log of the April futures price at the closing on January

 31, 1967 minus the log of the February futures price at the closing on
                                      11



January 31,       1967. The nominal interest rate is computed as a con-

tinuously compounded percentage rate at an annual rate from beginning of

month prices of U.S. Treasury bills with two months to maturity (ob-

tained from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University

of Chicago). For the February, 1967 own—commodity real rate, the nominal

interest rate is 600 times the log of 100 minus the two—month bill price

at the closing on January 31, 1967.

      Figures     1   to S plot the own—commodity real rates for th. five

commodities. The most prominent feature of the own—commodity real rates

is their tremendous variability.10 The own—commodity rates often are

outside the range       50% (annual rate) and the standard deviations for

the five commodities aret

As a     comparison,    Figure 6 contains the ex—post real rate calculated

using aggregate price level data (the CPI)      as    well as a measure of the
•x—ante aggregat. real rate calculated using the procedure found in

      Because the high variability of own commodity real rates is so
      striking,   I did check outliers in the data for accuracy by comparing
      the Center for Futures Markets data with published quotes in the
      Wall Street Journal. In no case did I find a discrepancy between the
      two data sources. Furthermore, although at first glance it might
      appear as though the tremendous variability of an own—commodity real
      rate implies an unexploited profit opportunity, closer inspection of
      the market suggests that this is unlikely. For example, Bruce Hamil-
      ton has pointed out to me that the variability of the own—commodity
      real rate for hogs (which is the highest of the five commodities) is
      exactly what might be expected because hogs must be slaughtered at a
      specific point in their lives in order to get a good price for their
      meat.

Huizinga and Mlshkln     (1986) with ilmilar data.11 Not only Ii the

variability of the ax—ante aggregat. real rate orders of magnitude

smaller than those of the own—commodity rates, but this is also the case

for the ex—post aggregate real ratci the standard deviation of the ix—

ante aggregate real rate is        2.67., while it Is 3.27. for the ax—past

aggregate real rate.

       As discussed in the methodology section, the ex—post aggregate real

interest rate differs from the ex—ante aggregate real interest rate by

the forecast error of inflation. On the other hand, the own—commodity

real rate differs from the ex—ante aggregate real rate by the amount of

the ex—ante relative price movements for the specific commodity. Thus

which method gives more accurate inference about the behavior of real

interest rates depends on whether the noise represented by the ex—ante

relative price movements Is greater than the noise attributable to the

forecast error of Inflation. Th. standard deviations of the own—

commodity real rates and the ax—post aggregate real rate does provide us

with information about the relative size of the noises. The upper bound

on the standard deviations of the forecast error of inflation equals the




       The ex—ante real rate measure is a fitted value from ax—post real
       rate regressions using the same breakpoints as Huizinga and Mishkin
       (1986) with the two—month Treasury bill rate, two lags of the infla-
       tion rate and one lag of a supply shock variable as explanatory
       variables. The observation interval and holding period is two months
       long and the sources of the data are the same as in Huizinga and
       Mishkin (1986).
  12
       This result follows from the fact that under rational expectations
       the forecast error of inflation is uricarrelated with the ex—ante
       aggregate real interest rate so that the variance of the ax—post
       real rate equals the variance of the ex—ante real rate plus the
       variance of the forecast error of inflation, Therefore, the maximum
       possible standard deviation of the forecast error of inflation
       occurs when the standard deviation of the ax—ante aggregate real
       rate is zero and it Is equal to the standard deviation of the ax—
       post real interest rate.

All of these standard deviation an, many times greater than th. upper

bound for the standard deviation of the forecast error of inflation of

rates is many times greater than the noise in the ex—post aggregate real

rate. Indeed, on average, the variation in the ex—ante relative price

movements seems to be on the order of at least 100 times greater than

the variation in the forecast errors of inflation. Therefore, futures

market data ii unlikely to provide as reliable information about the

behavior of the ex—ante aggregate real Interest    rat. a.   ex—post ag-

gregate real interest rate data does.

      Since the upper bound for the standard deviation of the ex—ante

aggregate real rate equals the standard deviation of the ex—post ag-

gregate real interest rate,14 3.2X, the calculations above can be inter-

preted in a slightly different way. Ex—ante relative price movements

(the noise) are on the order of over 100 times more variable than the

aggregate real interest rate (the signal). Since the signal to noise

ratio is apparently less than 1%, own—commodity real rates constructed

with futures market data are unlikely to be useful in examining the

behavior of aggregate real interest rates,

      Another way of examining th. value of own—commodity real rate data

is to see whether this data confirms two widely accepted facts about the

behavior of aggregate real interest rates since October 1979. The first

fact is that aggregate real interest rose after October 1979 to levels

well above those in the mid to late 1970s. We see evidence of this in

Figure 6 where the measure of the ex—ante aggregate real rate averaged

—0.87. from the beginning of 1975 until October 1979, while after October

1979 it averaged 4.5X. The conclusion that ex—ante aggregate real inter-

est rates rose sharply after October 1979 is also supported by other

methods for measuring the ex—ante aggregate real interest rate, such as

those using survey measures of expected inflation. The second fact is

the increase in variability of ex—ante aggregate real rates after Oc—


 14
      As we have seen in footnote 12, the the variance of the ex—ante real
      rate equals the variance of the ex—post real rate minus the variance
      of the forecast error of inflation. The upper bound on the variance
      of the ex—ante real rate is then reached when the variance of the
      forecast error of inflation is assumed to be zero; i.e., when the
      upper bound equals the variance of the ex—post real rate.

tobur 1979i From th. beginning of 1975 to October 1979, the standard

deviation of the ex—ante real rate measure In Figure 6 is .8%, and after

October 1979 it Ii 2.2%. These two facts about the behavior of ex—ante

real Interest rates seem to be accepted by almost all economists,15 and

yet they are not at all evident in the own—commodity real rate data.

      In Figures 1 to 5, we see that, rather than rising after October

1979, there was some tendency for the own—commodity real rates to fall,

with three of the own—commodity real rates (hogs, soybeans and lumber)

falling into the negative range on average. Th. average values of the

own—commodity real rates for the five commodities in the 197! to October

Furthermore, the variability of the own—commodity real rates fall after

October 1979 rather than rise, as can be seen below.

      To my knowledge, there has not been any serious disagreement with
      them.

      The finding here is however consistent with the evidence in Parks
      (1978) who suggests that there is a positive correlation between the
      level of inflation and relative price variability. Since the infla-
      tion level fell after October 1979, relative price variability would
      be expected to fall and this would be reflected in lower standard
      deviations of own—commodity real rates.

Since the behavior of the own—commodity real rates before and after

October 1979 seems to be at odds with what most analysis suggests oc-

curred for ex—ante aggregat. real rates, we have further evidence that

using futures markets to examine real interest rate behavior may not be

particularly illuminating.




                                   Iv.
       An Econometric Analysis of Own—Commodity Real Rate Behavior




      One of the most striking economic phenomena in recent years is a

major shift in the stochastic process of real Interest rates in October

1979 which resulted in their sharp rise in the 19801 to levels unprece-

dented in the postwar period. Huizinga and Mlshkln (198à) document a

highly, statistically significant shift in the stochastic process in

October 1979,' but they cannot examine all the features of the stochas-

tic process because their use of ex—post real rate data does not allow

them to examine the variability of ex—ante real rates. Own—commodity




 17
      Additional evidence in Clarida and Friedman (1984) and Roley (1986)
      is consistent with the Huizinga—Mishkin findlngsi these papers
      document a shift in the stochastic process of nominal interest rates
      when the monetary regime changes in October 1979.

real rate data does have the advantage that it allows direct statistical

tests on the variability of own—commodity real rates. Thus, even though

our results so far on the value of own—commodity real rate data for

examining aggregate real interest rates are negative, we should see If

econometric techniques that take advantage of the special features of
own—commodity real rate data provide useful results.

      Here the behavior of own commodity real rates are examined with a

variant of the Huizinga—Mishkin methodology which is expanded to allow

for direct tests on the variability of own—commodity real rates. A

linear stochastic process of the own commodity real rate ii      described

by,

where,
                       a vector of variables whose values are known

                       at time t,

                u •    an error term which by construction is

                       defined to be orthogonal to X.



A key feature of the own—commodity real rate is that it is observable

and does not involve an additional       c   error term representing the

forecast error of inflation, as is the case for ex—post aggregate real

rate data.

      The absence of the c error term allows the researcher to examine a

more general specification of the stochastic process in which the

variance of u changes over time. One convenient characterization of the
                                         18



time—series process describing the variance of u is                  with   the

Autoregressive Conditional Hateroscedasticity (ARCH) model outlined by

Engi. (1982), where

where,

                   N — number of observations.




      Tests for a shift in th.     stochastic process of the own—commodity
real rites at October 1979 involve a likelihood ratio test not only for

a change in the —parametari from befor, and ifter October 1979 (as In

Huizinga—Mishkin (1986)), but also for a chang. in the a—parameters

which describe the ARCH process. The tests for a shift in the stochastic

process thus examine not only whether the relationship of own—commodity

real rates to past economic variables changes, but also whether the

      these   regularity   conditions are imposed when maximizing the
      likelihood function.

underlying variability of own—commodity real rates changes. A second

test for the most likely date of the shift in the stochastic process of

real rates involves a procedure outlined by Quandt (19Z8,1960), in which

the most likely date of the shift in the m and p parameters is estimated

by finding the breakpoint that produces the highest value of the

likelihood function. For each breakpoint, the following Quandt statistic

is calculatedi



                 — 2
(10)                   Cln(L) —   ln(Lb))


where,

                 ln(L) • the maximized log—likelihood for the ARCH
                            model assuming no breakpoint,

                 ln(Lb) •   the maximized log—likelihood for the ARCH
                            model assuming that particular breakpoint.



The most likely date of the break then occurs when the Quandt statistic

reaches its highest value.

       The first step in the empirical analysis is specifying the stochas-

tic process of the own—commodity real rates specifically, the choice of

the X—variables and the order of the ARCH process. One desirable feature

of the ARCH model is that consistent estimates of the p—coefficients can

be obtained from a least squares regression under the assumption that

• 0 for all i. After using least squares to specify the X—variables,

then the order of the ARCH process can be chosen using Lagrange—

Multiplier tests described in Engle (1982)          in which the squared

residuals from the least squares regression are regressed on past lags

of the squared residuals,
                                          20


       Least squares estimates of the stochastic processes of the own—

commodity real rate revealed that a first—order autoregressive model

with seasonal dummies adequately fit the data for both the pre and post—

October 1979 sample periods.19 The correlogram of the residuals mdi-

cated that the null hypothesis that the residuals are white noise could

riot be rejected, and in addition other economic variables such as the

supply shock variable used In Huizinga and Mlshkin (1986) were not found

to have statistically significant additional explanatory power. These

findings are consistent with those of Litterman and Weiss's (1985) study

of real interest rates who also found that other economic variables and

additional lags of real interest rates did not have significant addi-

tional explanatory power over a first—order autoregressive model.

       The Lagrange—Multiplier (LM) tests for the order of the ARCH

process could not reject the hypothesis of no conditional heteroscedas—

ticity (i.e.,         • 0   for I   1) in the case of hogs, orange juice, and

lumber in both the pre and post—October 1979 sample periods. However,

the LM tests did reveal significant conditional heteroscedasticity in

the pre—October 1979 sample period for soybeans at lag 1 and for cattle
                     20
at lags 2 and 5.

       Maximum likelihood estimates of the own—commodity real rate models


 19
      It should be noted that the additive seasonal model with seasonal
      dummies outperforms the Box—Jenkins (1970) multiplIcative model.
      When seasonal autoregressive parameters were included with the
      seasonal dummies, the seasonal dummies remained statistically sig-
      niicant, while the seasonal autoregressive parameters were not
      significant.
 20
      I also conducted Lagrange—Multiplier tests to see whether there was
      any conditional heteroscedasticity related to seasonality as repre-
      sented by seasonal dummies. Only in the case of soybeans did I find
      any evidence of seasonal conditional heteroscedasticity. However,
      allowing for seasonal conditional heterosedasticity in tests or
      shifts in the stochastic process of the own—commodity soybean rate
      led to similar conclusions to those found in the text.

using the specifications suggested by the results above can be found in

Tables 1 and 2.21 For both the pry—October 1979 sample periods, the

models show statistically significant serial correlation In the own—

commodity real rates, with the coefficient of the lagged own—rats as

high as   .90. Furthermore, except in the case of lumber, the coefficient
of the lagged own—rate does not appear to change appreciably from pre—

October 1979 to post October 1979. As expected from the Lagrange—

Multiplier tests, the variance of the error term in the models          for


cattle and soybeans displays statistically significant autoregressive

coefficients for the pre—October 1979 period, but these coefficients

decline appreciably in the post—October 1979 period.

       Table 3 examines whether there was a major shift in the own—

commodity real rate processes after the change in the monetary policy

regime in October 1979. Because the linkage between monetary regime

shifts and changes in the seasonality of commodities is not a major

concern of monetary economics, Table 3 focuses only on likelihood ratio

test for shifts in the non—seasonal parameters of the own—commodity real

rate stochastic processes ——   i.e.,   the constant, the lagged own rate and

the u—parameters. (The results for tests of shifts in both the seasonal

dummies and the non—seasonal parameters can be found in Appendix I.) The

likelihood ratio tests in column 1 indicate that there is a statisti-

cally significant shift in the real rate process in October 1979 only

for soybeans and orange juice; there is no such shift for cattle, hogs

or lumber.     In order to see whether shifts in the own—rate processes in

October 1979 are unusual, we need to examine whether similar shifts




  21
       Note that equation (7) and (B) are estimated jointly in the maximum
       likelihood estimation here so that the reported standard errors do
       allow for conditional heteroscedasticity.

ratio tests for shifts in the middle of the pre—October 1979 and the

middle of the post—October 1979 sample periods are found in the second

and third rows of Table 3. Although, there are no significant shifts in

the own—rate processes in the post—October 1979 sample period, there is

strong evidence of instability in the real rate process for orange juice

in the pre—October 1979 period. The evidence in Table 3 is thus much

less clear—cut on the linkage between the monetary regime shift in

October 1979 and shifts In the stochastic process of own—commodity real

rates than ii the Hulzinga—Plishkin (1986) evidence using aggregate price

level data.

      The evidence on dating the breakpoint in Table 4 also does not

provide clear—cut support for the proposition that own—commodity real

rates are linked to the monetary regime shift In October 1979. The rows

of the table show for each commodity the value of the Quandt statistic

at different breakpoints surrounding the October 1979 date.22 (Recall

that the most likely breakpoint occurs when the Quandt statistic reaches

a peak.) Not only is October 1979 not chosen as the most likely date for

the breakpoint for any of the commodities, but the dating of the most

likely breakpoint (marked by the box around the highest Quandt statis-

tic) differs substantially from one commodity to the other.

      The results with own—commodity real rate data thus do not reveal

the shift in the stochastic process of real interest rates which has

been documented elsewhere. This failure of own—commodity real rate data

to reveal this shift in the real rate process indicates that any advan—

                                    Conclusions


     Rarely in monetary/macro economics does empirical work pay suffi-

cient attention to the quality of the data it is analyzing. This paper

is an attempt to be an exception since it asks whether a particular data

set is appropriate for answering an important set of questions. The

analysis here explores several pieces of evidence which provide informa-

tion on the usefulness of own—commodity real rates constructed from

futures market data for understanding the behavior of real interest

rates. The evidence can be summarized as          followsi
           1. The noise in own—commodity real rates (the cx—

                 ante relative price movements) is so large rela-

                 tive to the signal (the aggregate real interest

                 rate) that own—commodity real rates are unlikely

                 to contain much information about aggregate real

                 interest rates.




            23
                  Even though individual own—commodity real rates do not help us
                  understand the behavior of real interest rates, it is possible that
                  combining the information from the own—commodity real rates will
                  prove more successful. However, as can be seen from the evidence in
                  Appendix II, an optimal weighted average of the own—commodity real
                  rates also provides little information about the behavior of real
                  interest rates.

    2. Data on awn—commodity real rates is not consis-

         tent with several widely     accepted   facts about the

         behavior of aggregate real interest rates, in-

         dicating   that    own—commodity real rates can

         provide misleading information about aggregate

         real interest rates.

    3.    Econometric analysis of own—commodity real rate

         behavior fails to find a shift in the stochastic

         process which has been documented for aggregate

         real interest rates. The failure of own—commodity

         real rate data to reveal a shift in the real rate

         process indicates that any advantages of own—

         commodity real rate data for econometric analysis

         is overcome by the disadvantages stemming from

         the fact that the noise in the data is orders of

         magnitude larger than the signal.


     Th. evidence in this paper thus casts serious doubt about some

conclusions in recent papers that make use of futures market data to

provide information about real interest rate behavior. Hamilton

(19S6) finds that during the contraction phas, of the Great Depres-

sion the futures market in several commodities did not reveal ex-

pected price deflation ——   in   other words, the own—commodity real rate

was not unusually high. He thus concludes that aggregate real      inter-

est rates were not high in the early years of the Depression and were

therefore not a major transmission mechanism of contractionary

monetary policy. The evidence in this paper suggests that this con-

clusion is unwarranted because own—commodity real rates do not reveal
                                        25


 much information about aggregate real Interest rates.24

            Cornell and French (1996) study the response of own—commodity

 real       rates to   money supply announcements and conclude that six— and

 twelve—month aggregate real interest rates are positively correlated

 with unexpected components of money supply announcements. The key

 assumption in their analysis is that ex—ante relative price movements

 for the commodities they study are independent of the money supply

 announcement figure. Cornell and French provide no evidence that this

 key aisumption is true. While nothing in this paper rules out their

 assumption the evidence here does suggest that less than IX          of the
 variation in the own—commodity real rate data reflects aggregate real

 interest rates movements, while over 99V. Is due to ex-ante relative

 price movements. Hence, their results probably reflect Information

 about ex—ante relative price movements rather than about aaqreqate

 real interest rates as they assume. This should make us very cautious

     about   their findings.25
             This   paper would have a happier endina if it concluded that

     futures market data is useful for understandinc real interest rate

     behavior. Instead, it indicates that a promisino research line ex-

     ploiting futures market data for analysing real interest rates is not

     so   promising. In order to learn more about real interest rates. we


24
      It should be pointed out that much of Hamiltons discussion of the
      8reat Depression period doei not depend on this conclusion and so
      the      criticism here does not invalidate the basic points of
      Hamilton's     very interesting paper.

      Cornell and French (1986) find only weak evidence that the response
25
      of real rate interest rates to money supply announcements shifts in
      October 1979. This finding is consistent with the inability of the
      econometric analysis of this paper to reveal a clear cut shift in
      the stochastic processes of own-commodity real rates in October
      1979. As argued here. both of these findings may be a reflection of
      the problems with the own—commodity real rate data.

        Provide Information About the Behavior of Real Interest Rates?




        Nelson's (1972) discussion of jointly optimal linear composite

predictions provides a methodology for examining this issue. Follow-

ing Nelson, an optimal linear forecast of the aggregate real interest

rate using a own—commodity real rates can be obtained from the fol-

lowing regression equation

(Note that th. constant term is Included if the own—commodity real

rates are not unbiased predictors of the aggregate real interest

rate. as is likely to be th. case here.) Because the aggregate real

interest rate is unobservable, this equation cannot be estimated to

yield     the optimal weights, r3, However, the ex—post real interest

rate. .prrti is observable1 and by equation (6)                        we   know that it

equals the aggregate real interest rate minus the forecast error of

Inflation,    rrt —   c.   Using the rational expectations assumption that

the forecast error of Inflation, t,                  is   uncorrelated with     any infor-
mation at time t (which Includes rr), the optimal weiohts r                        can be

estimated with ordinary least squares from                    the   regression equation,

 Fitted values from this regression equation can thin be used as

 estimates of an optimal weighted average of the     own—commodity        real

 rates for the January 1971 to January 1986 sample period1 Estimation

 of an ARCH model for the weighted average data thin proceed as In the

 text and can be tested for shifts in non—seasonal parameters as            in

 Table 3. The results for whither there is a      shift   In the   real   rite

 evidence using the weighted average data is no more successful in

 finding a linkaqe between the own—commodity real rate behavior and

 the monetary regime shift in October 1979 than ire the individual

 commodity data.26 Thus, the answer to the question asked in this

 appendix is not An optimal weighted average of own—commodity real

 rates does not appear to provide substantial information about the

 behavior of real interest rates.

     Likelihood ratio tests for shifts in the non—seasonal parameters of
     the ARCH model in the ore—October 1979 period and the post—October
     1979 period also did not provide evidence that the parameters shift.
