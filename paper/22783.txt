Technological progress builds upon itself, with the expansion of invention in one domain
propelling future work in linked fields. Our analysis uses 1.8 million U.S. patents and their
citation properties to map the innovation network and its strength. Past innovation network
structures are calculated using citation patterns across technology classes during 1975-1994. The
interaction of this pre-existing network structure with patent growth in upstream technology
fields has strong predictive power on future innovation after 1995. This pattern is consistent with
the idea that when there is more past upstream innovation for a particular technology class to
build on, then that technology class innovates more.

      Technological and scienti…c progress propels economic growth and long-term well-being.
Prominent theories depict this process as a cumulative one in which new innovations build on
past achievements, using Newton’s descriptive phrase of “standing on the shoulders of giants”
(e.g., refs 1 and 2). Several studies provide evidence supporting this view, and more generally,
knowledge development is embedded in a landscape of individual scientists, research institutes,
private sector actors, and government agencies that shape the fundamental rate and direction
of new discoveries.1 Despite this burgeoning literature, our understanding of how progress in
one technological area is linked to prior advances in upstream technological …elds is limited.
Open but important questions include the long-term stability of how knowledge is shared across
technological …elds, the pace and timing of knowledge transfer, and how closely connected up-
stream …elds need to be to have material impact on a focal technology. This paper provides
some quantitative evidence on these and related questions.
      We show that a stable innovation network acts as a conduit of this cumulative process of
technological and scienti…c progress. We analyze 1.8 million U.S. patents and their citation
properties to map the innovation network and its strength. Past innovation network structures
are calculated using citation patterns across technology classes during 1975–1994. The interac-
tion of this pre-existing network structure with patent growth in “ upstream” technology …elds
has strong predictive power on future “downstream”innovation after 1995. Remarkably, 55% of
the aggregate variation in patenting levels across technologies for 1995–2004 can be explained
by variation in upstream patenting; this explanatory power is 14% when using panel variation
within each …eld (R-squared value from regressions tabulated below). Detailed sectors which
have seen more rapid patenting growth in their upstream technology …elds in the last ten years
are much more likely to patent today.
      This pattern is consistent with the idea that when there is more past innovation for a par-
ticular technology class to build on, then that technology class innovates more. As an example
using patent subcategories de…ned below, “Chemicals: Coating” and “Nuclear & X-rays” dis-
play similar patenting rates in 1975–1984. Before 1995, citation patterns indicate that “Nuclear
& X-rays” drew about 25% of its upstream innovation inputs from “Electrical Measuring &
Testing”, while “Chemicals: Coating” had a similar dependence on “Chemicals: Misc.”. The
former upstream …eld grew substantially less during 1985–1994 than the latter in terms of new
patenting. In the ten year period after 1995, “Chemicals: Coating”exhibits double the growth of
“Nuclear & X-rays”. The network heterogeneity further indicates that knowledge development

is neither global, in the sense that …elds collectively share an aggregate pool of knowledge, nor
local, in the sense that each …eld builds only upon itself.
     It is useful to motivate our approach with the standard endogenous growth and technological
progress models in economics, which posit a production function of new ideas of the form

                                                 N (t) = f (N (t) ; R (t)) ;

where N (t) is the stock of ideas,               N (t) is the ‡ow of new ideas produced, and R (t) is the
resources that are utilized to produce these new ideas (e.g., scientists). Though some studies
estimate the impact of the stock of ideas, N (t), on the ‡ow of new ideas (e.g., whether there
are increasing returns or “…shing out”externalities), most of the literature takes the input into
the production function of new ideas in every …eld to be either their own idea stock or some
aggregate stock of knowledge spanning across all …elds. We take a step towards opening this
black box and measuring the heterogeneous dependence of new idea creation on the existing
stock of ideas through studying innovation networks.
     We suppose that new innovations in technology j 2 f1; 2; :::; Jg depend on past innovations
in all other …elds through an innovation network. Suppressing the resource variable R(t) for
simplicity and assuming a linear form, we can write

                                            NJ   1   (t) =   MJ   J   NJ    1   (t) ;

where      NJ   1   (t) and NJ   1   (t) are, respectively, the J     1 vector of innovation rates and the stock
of knowledge in the J technology classes at time t, and MJ                   J   is a J   J matrix representing the
innovation network— how much one class builds on the knowledge stocks of other classes. Given
the scalar      and our focus on relative growth for technologies, we can normalize the row sums of
MJ    J   to one. The case in which new innovations depend symmetrically upon an economy-wide
technology stock is represented by all entries in MJ                  J   being equal to 1=J; the case in which
…elds only build upon their own knowledge stock is given by the identity matrix.
     We analyze utility patents granted between 1975–2009 by the United States Patent and
Trademark O¢ ce (USPTO). Each patent record provides information about the invention (e.g.,
technology classi…cations, citations of patents on which the current invention builds) and the
inventors submitting the application. We analyze 1.8 million patents applied for in 1975–2004
with at least one inventor living in a U.S. metropolitan area. The 2004 end date allows for a
…ve-year window for patent reviews. In our data, 98% of patent reviews are completed within
this window.

                                                             2
       Figure 1 describes the 1975–1984 innovation network in matrix form.2 The year restriction
refers to the dates of cited patents, and forward citing patents are required to be within ten
years of the cited patent. The ten-year window for forward citations keeps a consistent number
of observations per di¤usion age. USPTO technologies are often grouped into a three-level
hierarchy: 6 categories, 36 subcategories, and 484 classes. This matrix lists subcategories and
their parent categories; our empirical analysis considers subcategory- and class-level variation.
       Each row provides the composition of citations made by the citing technology …eld, summing
to 100% across the row. Own-citations (citations that …elds make to themselves) account for
a majority of citations, and for visual purposes are given a dark shading in Figure 1. In our
empirical work, we face a dilemma: a complete growth accounting includes how cumulative tech-
nological progress in one …eld a¤ects the …eld’s own future development. In fact, own-technology
spillovers are usually the most important channel of cumulative knowledge development and also
connect to the concept of absorptive capacity, where research in one’s own …eld prepares one to
absorb external knowledge from other …elds (e.g., refs 18 and 19). However, it is very di¢ cult to
convincingly establish the importance of the innovation network when looking within individual
…elds, as technological progress for a …eld over time can be endogenously related to its past and
future progress, as well as outside factors, and also display serial correlation for other reasons
(e.g., rising government funding levels, dynamic industry conditions). A contribution of our
network-based analysis that uses upstream technology progress outside of an individual …eld, as
moderated by a pre-existing network structure, to predict future innovation is to demonstrate
the importance of this knowledge development process in an empirical setting that minimizes
these di¢ cult identi…cation challenges.
       We thus present our …ndings below in two ways. One route is to consider the external
network only, which excludes own-citations and within-…eld spillovers to better isolate network
properties. We write our upcoming equations for this case. To a¤ord the complete growth
perspective, we also report results for the complete network that includes own-…eld spillovers.
Formally, an entry in matrix MJ          J   from a citing technology j (row) to a cited technology j 0
(column) is
                                                  Citationsj!j 0
                                         mj!j 0 = X              :
                                                    Citationsj!k
                                                    k6=j

In this representation, the notation j ! j 0 designates a patent citation from technology j to

    Hall et al. (14) further describe the patent data. Studies of cross-sector spillovers date to at least Scherer
(15) and Verspagen (16). Schnitzer and Watzinger (17) provide a recent example.

j 0 , which in turn means knowledge ‡owing from technology j 0 to j. For the complete network
calculation, the denominator summation includes k = j.
   Figure 1 highlights the heterogeneity in technology ‡ows. The block diagonals indicate that
subcategories within each parent category tend to be inter-related, but these ‡ows vary sub-
stantially in strength and show important asymmetries. For example, patents in “Computers:
Peripherals”tend to pull more from “Computers: Communications”than the reverse, as “Com-
puters: Communications”builds more on electrical and electronic subcategories. There are also
prominent examples of connections across technology categories, such as the link between “Or-
ganic Compounds” and “Drugs.” Figure 2 depicts this information in a network format, which
groups in two-dimensional space the stronger relationships in nearer proximity.
   The innovation network is quite stable. Calculating MJ               J   for the ten-year periods of 1975–
1984, 1985–1994, and 1995–2004, the correlations and rank correlations of cell values over ten-
year horizons are both above 0.9; across a 20-year horizon, both are above 0.8. Appendix Figures
1–3 show comparable network structures when using more-stringent thresholds for including
network edges/connections, when examining raw citations without the normalization such that
every technology’s outbound citations are equally weighted, and when using longer data horizons.
Appendix Figures 4–6 show three frequently calculated diagnostics for network nodes: in-degree
importance, closeness, and betweenness. A common theme, which is also evident in Figure 2,
is that many high-pro…le technology areas (e.g., Drugs) are at the periphery of the innovation
network. Technologies like “Electrical Devices” and “Materials Processing/Handling” occupy
more-central positions.
   We take advantage of the considerable heterogeneity in the speed at which knowledge di¤uses—
how many years after invention patents in technology j 0 typically receive citations from tech-
nology j. We construct our innovation network matrix to model separately each year of the
di¤usion process:
                                                          Citationsj!j 0 ;a
                                    CiteFlowj!j 0 ;a =                      ;
                                                            Patentsj 0
where CiteFlow quanti…es the rate at which patents in technology j cite patents in j 0 (Patentsj 0 )
for each of the …rst ten years after the latter’s invention.3 This augmented structure extends
the simple theoretical model described with the M matrix to allow for more complex knowledge
   3
     Time lags consistently broaden the downstream technology impact. One year after invention, 81% of down-
stream citations are from the same category (62% are from the same patent class, 10% are from another patent
class within the same subcategory, and 9% from another subcategory within the same category). After ten years,
75% of citations occur within the same patent category (respectively, 51%, 12%, 12%).

di¤usion processes that depend upon invention age.4
  To predict forward patents, we combine the pre-existing network with technology develop-
ment that occurs within a ten-year window before the focal year t. De…ne P^j;t to be the expected
patenting in technology j for a year t after 1994. Our estimate of P^j;t combines patents made in
the prior ten years with an added di¤usion lag of a = [1; 10] years,

                                             XX
                                              10
                                   P^j;t =              CiteFlowj!k;a Pk;t a ;
                                             k6=j a=1


where Pk;t   a   is the patenting in technology k at a di¤usion lag a from the year t: As an example,
for a patent from technology j 0 applied for in 1990, we model its impact for technology j in 1997
by looking at the average impact that occurred with a seven-year di¤usion lag during the pre-
period. The double summation in the calculation of P^j;t repeats this process for each potential
upstream technology class and di¤usion lag. In addition to the network being estimated from
pre-period interactions, our calculation requires that upstream patents pre-date downstream
predictions by at least one year (i.e., a           1). For the complete network calculation, the …rst
summation term again includes k = j:
   The …rst row of Panel A in Figure 3 reports the strong levels relationship between the
predicted values (P^j;t ) and actual values (Pj;t ) using subcategory variation in a log format. This
estimate includes 360 observations through the analysis of 36 subcategories in each year during
1995–2004; each subcategory is weighted by its initial level of patenting. A 10% increase in
expected patenting is associated with an 8% increase in actual patenting when considering the
external network. We report standard errors that are robust against serial correlation within
a subcategory. This speci…cation explains about 55% of the aggregate variation in 1995–2004
patenting levels. The empirical strength of the complete network estimation is even stronger,
with a 10% increase in expected patenting associated with a 9% increase in actual patenting.
    While powerful, there are several potential concerns with the simple approach. First, persis-
tence in the relative sizes of technological …elds may lead to overstatements of network impor-
tance. Likewise, aggregate ‡uctuations in the annual patenting rates of all …elds could result in
over-emphasis on the importance of upstream …elds. To address, we consider a panel regression
   4
     While Figures 1 and 2 are normalized to sum to 100% for a citing technology using the network matrix
M , we leave this measure relative to baseline patenting to allow direct use with the forward patenting rates by
technology. Patents di¤er substantially in the number of citations that they make, and we weight citations such
that each citing patent receives the same importance. Our results are robust to di¤erent approaches for dealing
with patents that make no citations and instances where patents list multiple technologies.

that includes …eld and time controls,

                                    ln(Pj;t ) =     ln(P^j;t ) +     j   +   t   + "j;t ;

where Pj;t and P^j;t are actual and expected patent rates for technology j in year t ("j;t is an
error term). The estimation includes …xed e¤ects for subcategories ( j ) that remove their long-
term sizes; likewise, …xed e¤ects for years ( t ) remove aggregate changes in USPTO grant rates
common to all technologies, so that the identi…cation of the                                 parameter comes only from
variations within …elds. Intuitively,             captures whether the actual patenting in technology j
is abnormally high relative to its long-term rate when it is predicted to be so based upon past
upstream innovation rates. A            estimate of one would indicate a one-to-one relationship between
predicted and actual patenting after conditioning on these controls.
       We estimate in the second row of Panel A a statistically signi…cant and economically sub-
stantial value of : 0:85 (standard error = 0:17). Though less than one, the estimated coe¢ cient
shows a very strong relationship between predicted and actual patenting. Appendix Figure 7
provides visual representations of these subcategory-level estimations. This …gure shows that
our results are not driven by outliers or weighting strategy.5
       Panel B of Figure 3 shows very similar patterns when using variation among more-detailed
patent classes. We consider in this estimation 353 patent classes that maintain at least …ve
patents per annum. The levels variation is very similar to that found using subcategories in
Panel A. The panel estimates are smaller, suggesting a 3%-4% increase in patenting for every
10% increase in expected patenting, but remain quite important economically and statistically.
Appendix Figures 8-9 provide visual representations of these class-level estimations.
       Panel C of Figure 3 shows a second approach to quantifying the innovation network strength.
We regress cumulative actual patenting during 1995–2004 for each class on its expected value
based upon the innovation network and a control for historical patenting levels,

                              ln(Pj95   04
                                             )=   ln(P^j95   04
                                                                  ) + ln(Pj85        94
                                                                                          ) + "j :

This approach allows greater variation in how the lag structure of the innovation network im-
pacts current technological change; we now estimate a 10% increase in upstream innovation
corresponds to a 3.5% increase in forward patenting. Appendix Figure 10 provides a visual
depiction.
   5
     For the panel estimations, we plot in these appendix …gures the residualized values of actual patenting against
predicted patenting. Residualized values are calculated as the unexplained portions of a regression of ln(Pj;t ) on
the …xed e¤ects j and t (similar process for predicted patenting series). Conveniently, the slope of the trend
line in this …gure is equal to .

    This cumulative approach is a good platform for robustness checks and extensions. Our …rst
check is to compare our expected patenting growth due to upstream stimulus with a parallel met-
ric developed using downstream stimulus. Our account emphasizes the upstream contributions
‡owing through the innovation network, but it is natural to worry whether our estimates are
instead picking up broad local shocks in technology or a demand-side pull. As the innovation net-
work is asymmetric, we can test this directly, and we con…rm in Figure 3 that the upstream ‡ows
are playing the central role. Appendix Table 1 documents many additional robustness checks:
controlling for parent technology trends, adjusting sample weights, using growth formulations,
considering second-generation di¤usion,6 and so on. The results are robust to dropping any sin-
gle subcategory, although they depend upon at least some computer and communication …elds
being retained. We also …nd these results when using the International Patent Classi…cation
system.
    Finally, when introducing the MJ         J   matrix, we noted two polar cases common to the liter-
ature: all entries being equal to 1=J (…elds building upon a common knowledge stock) or the
identity matrix (…elds building only on own knowledge). The bottom of Figure 3 and Appendix
Table 2 quantify that the truth lies in between— technologies building upon a few key classes
that provide them innovation stimulants. We …nd a robust connection of innovation to the
ten most important upstream patent classes, which diminishes afterwards. This relationship
is also shown using the subcategory-category structure, although this approach is cruder given
the knowledge ‡ows across technology boundaries.7 This network heterogeneity indicates that
knowledge development is neither global, in the sense that …elds collectively share an aggregate
pool of knowledge, nor local, in the sense that each …eld builds only upon itself.
    To conclude, our research …nds upstream technological developments play an important and
measurable role in the future pace and direction of patenting. A better accounting for the inno-
vation network and its asymmetric ‡ows will help us model the cumulative process of scienti…c
discovery in a sharper manner. A better understanding of these features can be an aid to policy
makers. For example, the …nding that upstream research is highly salient for growth implies
that if R&D slackens in one period the e¤ects will be felt years later. This paper has approached
   6
     While some network analyses consider high-order relationships (e.g., Leontief inverse in production theory),
…rst-order relationships are su¢ cient when directly observing intermediating outcomes. As an example, consider
       0                                                  0                                                  0
j ! j ! k, with technology k being upstream from j . As we directly model patenting in technology j to
downstream outcomes in j, we have already included any potential upstream stimulus from k. Appendix Table
1 shows similar results using second-order di¤usion when excluding the …rst-order relationship.
   7
     The top 20 upstream classes account for 80% of citations and are distinct from subcategories. Among the top
ten, 27% of citations come from the same subcategory, and another 27% come from other subcategories within
the same category. Among the next ten, these …gures are 16% and 30%, respectively.

these issues in a setting that considers all patents and inventions, the development of which
might be thought of as normal or regular science and innovation. An interesting path for future
research is to consider whether large leaps behave in a similar format to that depicted here. We
also believe this can be pushed to consider regional and …rm-level variation, which can further
help us understand the causal impact of patenting on economic and business outcomes.

Figure 1: Citation matrix 1975-1984. Each row describes the field composition of citations made by the technology subcategory
indicated on the left hand side. Entries across cited technology fields for each citing technology subcategory sum to 100%. The
diagonals—citations of one’s own field, the majority of citations—are excluded from the calculation but given dark shading for
reference. Appendix Figure 1 shows the 1975-2004 network and additional sub-periods.

color are pulled from the same category of
the USPTO system. The width of connecting
lines indicates the strength of technological
flows, with arrows being used in cases of
strong asymmetry. Connections must
account for at least 0.5% of out-bound

Figure 3: (A) reports regressions of actual patenting during 1995-2004 on predicted patenting calculated using the 1975-1994 innovation
network and the growth in upstream technology subcategories predating the focal year. “Field and time controls” analysis reports a panel
data analysis where we first remove averages from each subcategory and each year from actual and predicted values. In External Network
Only analyses, we consider predicted patenting due to upstream patenting outside of the focal patent subcategory. (B) repeats this analysis
for detailed patent classes maintaining over five patents per annum. (C) reports regressions using the patent class sample where we calculate
cumulative actual and predictive patenting during 1995-2004 for a patent class. After reporting baseline effects in the cumulative format, we
contrast the focal upstream effect with a reverse downstream effect. We next disaggregate the stimulus to demonstrate localized spillovers.

Appendix Figure 4: Innovation network 1975-1984, in-degree importance. The in-degree of a node in
the innovation network is the weighted share of patents in other subcategories that are citing patents
in the focal node. (The out-degree of a node is not defined in our primary case given the outbound
citation normalization for each technology.) Nodes are colored by their importance using the scale at

Appendix Figure 5: Innovation network 1975-1984, closeness. The closeness of a node is the average
shortest-path distance between that node and all the other nodes in the network. Specifically,
Closenessn = [1/(g-1)] Σm path(n,m), where g is the number of nodes in the network and m is any node
other than n. A lower closeness score indicates a more important node in the sense of being closer on
average to the rest of the nodes in the network. Nodes are colored by their importance using the scale
at the bottom. (A) uses a 0.5% cut-off for edge inclusion. The closeness scores in the innovation
network range from 1.06 (Misc-Chemical and Misc-Other) to 1.75 (Organic Compounds). (B) uses a
1.0% cut-off for edge inclusion. (C) uses a 2.0% cut-off for edge inclusion. (D) shows a network without
normalization such that every technology’s outbound citations are equally weighted.

Appendix Figure 6: Innovation network 1975-1984, betweenness. Betweenness measures how often
a node links two other nodes. Identifying the shortest paths between every pair of nodes in the graph,
the betweenness score of a given node n is the number of those shortest paths that include n (not
including paths where n is one of the endpoints). If there are multiple different shortest paths between
two nodes, the contribution to the betweenness score of a node on any of the paths is inversely
proportional to the number of paths. Nodes are colored by their importance using the scale at the
bottom. (A) uses a 0.5% cut-off for edge inclusion. The betweenness scores in the innovation network
range from 0.21 (Information Storage) to 38.23 (Misc-Chemical). (B) uses a 1.0% cut-off for edge
inclusion. (C) uses a 2.0% cut-off for edge inclusion. (D) shows a network without normalization such
that every technology’s outbound citations are equally weighted.

Appendix Figure 7: Network strength at subcategory level. (A)
shows actual patenting during 1995-2004 against predicted
patenting calculated using the 1975-1994 innovation network and
the growth in upstream technology subcategories predating the
focal year. Observations represent a subcategory-year pair, color-
coded by parent technological category, and the 45-degree line is
shown for reference. (B) shows a panel data analysis where we
first remove averages from each subcategory and each year from
actual and predicted values and plot the residuals. The color
scheme is the same as (A). (C) shows a version of (B) that weights
observations by their initial size in terms of patenting during
1985-1994. Bubble size indicates weight. This is equivalent to the
panel regression findings reported in the text. Reported trend
lines are calculated with standard errors clustered by subcategory.

repeats Appendix Figure 7 at the patent class level for patent
classes maintaining over five patents per annum during 1975-
2004.

Appendix Figure 10: Network strength in cumulative format. (A)
shows the panel result in a format where we calculated
cumulative actual and predictive patenting during 1995-2004 for
a patent class. Figure presents residual values from regressions
that control for initial patenting levels by classes during 1985-
1994. (B) shows a version where residuals are prepared after also
including subcategory fixed effects in the regressions, effectively
isolating class-level variation within each subcategory. (C) restricts
panel (A) to patent classes that have 50+ patents granted per year
during 1975-2004.

Notes: Table quantifies the relationship between log patenting 1995-2004 by patent class and the stimulus provided by the innovation network. Estimations control for log
initial patenting in the patent class during 1985-1994. Estimations report robust standard errors and weight classes by the patent count in the class during 1985-1994. Column
headers report specification variants. In Column 5, second-generation stimulus is estimated through a second application of the core innovation network matrix to the predicted
patenting. In Column 6, second-generation stimulus is estimated through direct measure of a second-generation citation matrix restricted to ten years.

Notes: See Appendix Table 1. In Columns 2 and 5, we separate the upstream stimulus provided by the ten most-important upstream classes, the next ten
upstream classes, and those beyond. These upstream classes are defined by citation shares made by the focal class during the pre-1995 period. In two cases,
the patent class cites fewer than ten upstream categories and is excluded. Columns 3 and 6 alternatively rely on the USPTO classification system of
subcategories and categories, which is naturally cruder since it is less-tailored to an individual technology's citation patterns. The disaggregated results do
not add up to the total network effect due to the log transformations.
