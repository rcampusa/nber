Inertia, Market Power, and Adverse Selection in Health Insurance: Evidence from the ACA
Exchanges

                                         ABSTRACT

We study how inertia interacts with market power and adverse selection in managed competition
health insurance markets. We use consumer-level data to estimate a model of the California ACA
exchange, in which four firms dominate the market and risk adjustment is in place to manage
selection. We estimate high inertia costs, equal to 44% of average premiums. Although
eliminating inertia exacerbates adverse selection, it significantly reduces market power such that
average premiums decrease 13.2% and annual per-capita welfare increases $902. These effects
are substantially smaller in settings without market power and/or risk adjustment. Moreover,
converting the ACA's premium-linked subsidies to vouchers mitigates the impact of inertia by
reducing market power, whereas reducing high consumer churn in the ACA exchanges increases
the impact of inertia by enhancing market power. The impact of inertia is not sensitive to
provider network generosity, despite greater consumer attachment to plans with more
differentiated provider networks.

     Managed competition is increasingly common in U.S. health insurance markets, such as the
Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs for seniors and the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
individual health insurance exchanges (HIXs) (Einav and Levin, 2015).1 Insurance markets with
managed competition aim to leverage the advantages of competition among private firms by promot-
ing consumer choice while limiting firm incentives to engage in risk selection and offer substandard
benefit packages (Enthoven, 1993). Common elements include consumer choice among qualify-
ing plans, regulations that set baseline benefits, and policies that promote competition and limit
incentives for risk selection. The efficient functioning of these markets is important not only for
consumer welfare, but also for the prudent allocation of significant government expenditures. Suc-
cessful implementation depends on the interaction of three critical and interconnected factors: the
incentive and ability of consumers to choose high-value options, the participation and competition
of firms, and policies in place to manage adverse selection.
     We explore the interaction of these three factors in the ACA exchanges. Choice and information
frictions can undermine the market forces underlying managed competition's presumed advantages
by eroding insurers' incentives to issue high-value options. We examine this issue by focusing on
the role of inertia, the persistence of health plan choices over time despite changes in premiums and
health plan offerings. Inertia could reduce consumer welfare by inducing consumers to remain in
suboptimal plans and by reducing insurers' incentives to lower premiums.2 However, inertia may
also mitigate the effects of adverse selection (Handel, 2013). The balance of these forces depends
on the extent of competition (Polyakova, 2016) and on policies in place to manage risk selection,
such as risk adjustment (Geruso et al., 2019; Mahoney and Weyl, 2017).
     We analyze the premium, enrollment, and welfare impacts of inertia in the ACA setting. The
ACA's architects designed the exchanges with the intent to encourage frictionless consumer choice
and robust insurer competition.3 We provide new evidence on the presence and magnitude of choice
   1
      Although managed competition is relatively new in the U.S., health insurance systems in the Netherlands, Germany,
and Switzerland have relied on managed competition for decades.
    2
      Researchers have documented the presence and magnitude of inertia in the employer group setting (Handel, 2013),
in the Medicare Part D market (Ericson, 2014; Fleitas, 2017; Ho et al., 2017; Polyakova, 2016), in Medicare Advantage
(Miller, 2019), and in the ACA exchanges (Drake et al., 2021). These papers, and our own, lie at the intersection of
broader literatures on choice frictions as a source of welfare loss and market power in health insurance (Abaluck and
Adams, 2018; Abaluck and Gruber, 2011, 2016; Aizawa and Kim, 2018; Cebul et al., 2011; Bhargava et al., 2017;
Ketcham et al., 2015; Kling et al., 2012), and on the effects of inertia on competition in markets other than health
insurance (Dube et al., 2009; Farrell and Klemperer, 2007; Hortacsu et al., 2017; Luco, 2019).
    3
      To facilitate choice, they standardized key plan features, allowed consumers to shop and enroll online, and provided
access to choice assistance from professional navigators. To encourage firm participation and limit adverse selection,
ACA policies introduced risk corridors, reinsurance, and risk adjustment, and mandated and subsidized insurance
purchase. In practice, several of these design elements have disappeared or been eroded in the seven years since the
exchanges opened.

frictions in this environment, and on how important features of the ACA exchange mediate their
effects on social welfare. In doing so, we contribute to a burgeoning literature on the early successes
and failures of the new insurance marketplaces established by the ACA (Abraham et al., 2017; Sen
and DeLeire, 2018; Diamond et al., 2021; Drake, 2019; Panhans, 2019; Polsky et al., 2016; Tebaldi,
2020), as well as the broader empirical literature on managed competition markets such as Medicare
Part D (Decarolis et al., 2020), Medicare Advantage (Curto et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2019), and the
pre-ACA Massachusetts exchange (Ericson and Starc, 2015, 2016; Geruso et al., 2019; Hackmann
et al., 2015; Shepard, 2016).
     To study the impact of inertia in the ACA exchanges, we estimate a model of consumer plan
choice and insurer pricing. Our model endogenizes consumer choices, premiums, plan risk, and
claims. The model explicitly allows for both moral hazard and adverse selection and incorporates
key ACA policies such as risk adjustment and premium subsidies. Our approach is similar to those
in Starc (2014) and Tebaldi (2020) and builds directly on the model in Saltzman (2021).
     We estimate our model using consumer-level administrative data from the ACA exchange in
California. Our data contain nearly ten million consumer plan choices across a variety of local
insurance market settings between 2014 and 2018, the first five years of the exchange. The Cali-
fornia ACA exchange is an important market for understanding the individual exchanges because
it accounts for 13% of nationwide enrollment (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020). It is also a use-
ful market for exploring inertia because plan financial characteristics are standardized, limiting the
number of plan attributes consumers need to compare. Descriptive evidence suggests inertia is high.
Nearly 80% of renewing enrollees remained in the same plan, 91% chose a plan in the same metal
tier, and 87% stayed with the same insurer. New enrollees paid lower premiums than renewing
enrollees and firms with higher market shares raised premiums more in the subsequent year.
     To quantify the equilibrium effects of inertia, we estimate a structural model of the California
ACA exchange. We address potential endogeneity of plan premiums by exploiting variation created
by exogenous ACA regulations, including the phase-in of the individual mandate penalty and the
time-varying kinks in the ACA penalty and subsidy formulas. We identify inertia by leveraging two
key features of the ACA setting captured by our data: (1) every consumer in our model makes at
least one "active" decision, either when the exchanges opened in 2014 or in a subsequent year; and
(2) some consumers make additional active decisions if their previous plans cease being offered.
     We use our estimated model to simulate the impact of inertia under observed and alternative
market conduct and policy scenarios. We make three primary contributions to the literature: (1)
we estimate the magnitude of inertia and how its elimination would impact equilibrium premiums,
plan choices, and welfare in the observed ACA setting; (2) we document how and why the impact


                                                  3
of eliminating inertia would change if firm market power and/or the risk adjustment policy in place
to manage adverse selection were to be removed; and (3) we provide insight into how three policy-
driven features of managed competition in insurance markets, including the design of premium
subsidies, consumer churn between markets, and provider network generosity, interact with inertia.
    We find that inertia, measured as the annual cost of switching to a new plan, is $2,324 for the
average consumer or approximately 44% of the average premium. Higher-income consumers and
adults over age 55 have switching costs of about $3,700, whereas young adults between ages 18
and 34 have switching costs of about $1,500. We also find lower inertia in Asian and Hispanic
households and higher inertia in non-Hispanic White households. While these estimated switching
costs are quite large, they are consistent with previous estimates in the literature (Drake et al., 2021;
Handel, 2013; Polyakova, 2016).
    Next, we use the estimated model to simulate the impact of inertia under alternative scenarios.
The switching frictions underlying inertia may include time costs of comparing complex features of
alternative plans and hassle costs associated with completing paperwork and changing providers.
We simulate setting switching costs to zero4 and find average premiums would decrease by 13.2%.
Annual per-capita social welfare would increase by $902 and annual total social welfare would
increase by $2.13 billion. Our baseline welfare analysis follows the literature in assuming that
revealed preference can be used to calculate consumer surplus, and that inertia impacts choices
but not welfare. When inertia is eliminated, some consumers choose less generous coverage (2%)
and others forgo insurance entirely (3%); substantial errors in consumers' valuation of insurance
(Abaluck et al., 2021) would amplify the welfare losses due to drops in enrollment. Our qualitative
conclusions are largely robust to whether inertia is considered a choice error or a true welfare-
relevant switching cost: the welfare effect of eliminating inertia remains positive provided no more
than 80% of inertia represents a true switching cost.
    The impact of inertia is substantially smaller when firm market power and/or risk adjustment
are removed. If firms price at average cost, eliminating inertia would result in only 0.9% lower
average premiums and a $547 increase in annual per-capita social welfare. This result demon-
strates how firms exploit inertia as a source of market power, as previously explored by Ho et al.
(2017) and Polyakova (2016).5 Without risk adjustment in place to mitigate the effects of selection,
eliminating inertia would result in 10.9% lower average premiums and a $658 increase in annual
    4
      In reality, there is likely no single intervention that would eliminate inertia, but several policies may reduce it,
including alerts regarding product characteristics, information provision, and modified defaults. See, e.g., Domurat
et al. (2021) and Kling et al. (2012).
    5
      Our model does not incorporate dynamic firm pricing in response to consumer inertia (Dube et al., 2009; Ericson,
2014; Fleitas, 2017; Miller, 2019). We consider this an important area for future work on the ACA setting.



                                                            4
per-capita social welfare. The premium decrease is smaller than in the ACA setting because re-
moving risk adjustment leads to premium dispersion (i.e., less generous plans become cheaper and
more generous plans become more expensive) and significant shifts in enrollment from more gen-
erous plans to less generous plans. Eliminating inertia without risk adjustment in place therefore
results in smaller incremental premium decreases and enrollment shifts. In the absence of both
market power and risk adjustment, eliminating inertia would decrease average premiums by 2.9%
and increase annual per-capita social welfare by only $250. These results complement prior work
on the interactions between risk adjustment and market power (Mahoney and Weyl, 2017).
    Our simulation results also demonstrate how three policy-driven features of the ACA environ-
ment interact with inertia. First, the ACA exchanges feature premium subsidies that are linked to
premiums. Price-linked subsidies reduce price competition (Einav et al., 2019; Jaffe and Shep-
ard, 2020; Polyakova, 2016; Tebaldi, 2020) and hence exacerbate market power from inertia. We
simulate the effect of inertia under a voucher or fixed government subsidy and find a significantly
smaller impact than under price-linked subsidies. Eliminating inertia with fixed subsidies results
in a 8.9% decrease in average premiums and a $532 increase in annual per-capita social welfare.
Another prominent feature of the ACA setting that interacts with inertia is consumer churn into and
out of the market (Diamond et al., 2021). In our data, 26% of enrollees exit the ACA marketplace
each year due to exogenous reasons such as receiving an offer for employer-sponsored insurance
or becoming eligible for Medicaid. In contrast to price-linked subsidies, high churn mitigates the
effect of inertia on firms' market power. We simulate the elimination of inertia without churn in
the market and find a larger impact than with churn. Average premiums would decrease by 16.8%
and annual per-capita social welfare would increase by $966. Finally, we study whether the impact
of inertia is sensitive to provider network generosity. We quantify the impacts of network breadth
and network inclusivity (Graves et al., 2020), the degree to which the providers in a plan's network
are shared with other plans in the market, on inertial behavior. This analysis complements prior
work that studies the mechanisms underlying inertia in insurance and other settings (Abaluck and
Adams, 2018; Brot-Goldberg et al., 2021; Drake et al., 2021; Heiss et al., 2016; Hortacsu et al.,
2017; Luco, 2019). We find network inclusivity slightly reduces inertia, suggesting that provider
preference may keep consumers in their plans. However, eliminating only the part of inertia not
driven by network inclusivity yields similar estimates as in our main results.
    Taken together, our results present new evidence on how inertia, competition, and adverse se-
lection interact in an important health insurance marketplace. Policies targeting inertia, such as
signup simplification and plan standardization, may be most effective in markets such as the ACA
exchanges where firms have market power and adverse selection is managed with measures such


                                                 5
as risk adjustment. Our paper also clarifies how subsidy design, consumer churn, and provider
network regulation may mediate the effects of inertia. Switching to a fixed subsidy design would
mitigate the effects of inertia because it would reduce firm market power. Conversely, policies
mitigating consumer churn such as expanding subsidy eligibility to those with access to employer-
sponsored insurance or implementing the ACA's Basic Health Program (BHP) could exacerbate the
effects of inertia by enhancing firm market power over inertial enrollees. Lastly, our results suggest
that regulations regarding provider network breadth would not substantially change the impact of
inertia.
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the data and provides descriptive evi-
dence of inertia. Section 2 presents our empirical demand model and estimates. Section 3 simulates
the impact of inertia in the ACA exchanges on premiums, enrollment, claims, and welfare. Section 4
concludes.


1        Data and Setting
A central component of the ACA was the establishment in 2014 of state-based and federally-
facilitated exchanges for non-group health insurance, in which eligible consumers choose among
qualified health plans and purchase plans with federal subsidies. In this paper, we analyze en-
rollment data and insurer rate filings from the California ACA exchange from 2014-2018.6 The
enrollment data contain plan choices for each enrollee-year, as well as enrollee demographic char-
acteristics such as age, geographic location, and income. The insurer rate filings contain plan-year-
market-level information on administrative costs, enrollee claims, risk adjustment transfers, and
reinsurance. The following two subsections provide more detail on each dataset and descriptive
evidence of inertia.


1.1        Premiums and Enrollment
We analyze consumer-level enrollment data from the California ACA exchange for the 2014 through
2018 plan years. Table 1 summarizes enrollee choices and characteristics. Any citizen or legal
resident can enroll in an ACA exchange plan. However, in practice, the rules governing the avail-
ability of subsidies imply that the exchanges primarily serve individuals without access to afford-
able employer- or government-sponsored insurance. We refer to these individuals as "exchange-
eligible." These eligibility rules were put into place to limit the cost of the ACA and avoid crowd-out
    6
        We rely on the same data as in Saltzman (2021).


                                                          6
of other sources of insurance coverage, including employer- or government-sponsored insurance.
A significant consequence of these restrictions is high consumer churn, which we investigate be-
low. The ACA contained a provision for states to establish a Basic Health Program that would
reduce churn between Medicaid and the ACA exchanges, but only New York and Minnesota have
implemented a BHP program as of 2021.7
    Appendix A details how we construct the exchange-eligible population. Briefly, we begin with
the set of consumers who ever enrolled in a California ACA plan. For years when the consumer
is not enrolled in an ACA plan, we impute whether the consumer was exchange-eligible, given
their age, gender, race, income, and household size. This imputation exercise draws on a prediction
model trained on observed coverage status transitions (i.e., ACA exchange insurance, employer-
sponsored insurance, government-sponsored insurance, and no insurance) in individual-level panel
data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2019).
    Approximately two-thirds of eligible consumers chose an exchange plan in our sample. Enroll-
ment increased steadily from 62% to 70% of eligible consumers between 2014 and 2018. The ACA
mandates that most consumers purchase coverage or pay a penalty; exceptions are made for people
with valid reasons, such as having income below the threshold for filing taxes or lacking access to
a plan that costs less than 8% of household income. In 2014, the penalty was $95 or 1% of income,
whichever was larger. The penalty increased each year until 2016, when it was $695 or 2.5% of
income, whichever was larger. In 2019, the penalty was set to zero following passage of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
    Approximately 52% of enrollees were female, 39% were non-Hispanic white, and 50% were
over age 45. Exchange enrollees tended to have relatively low incomes: half of enrollees in our
sample had incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and 90% had incomes below
400% of the FPL. Nearly 90% of enrollees received premium subsidies.8 As we discuss in more
detail in the next section, premium subsidies are linked to premiums in the silver tier and shield
consumers from premium volatility.
   7
      The BHP program covers consumers with incomes between the 138% of FPL Medicaid threshold to 200% of FPL
in a Medicaid-type plan with lower premiums and cost sharing than an ACA exchange plan. The program reduces churn
for people with income close to the 138% of FPL Medicaid threshold because transitions between Medicaid and the
BHP are relatively seamless. Although churn may increase for consumers with income around 200% of FPL, income
fluctuations are generally more prevalent in lower-income populations.
    8
      Premium subsidies are available to citizens and legal residents with income between 100% and 400% of FPL who
do not qualify for Medicaid and do not have an affordable offer of insurance from their employer. Most California
consumers who have income under 138% of FPL qualify for Medicaid. An employer-sponsored insurance plan was
considered affordable in 2014 if the employee's contribution to the plan was below 9.5% of household income.

    Like many U.S. health insurance markets, the ACA exchanges are concentrated (Dafny, 2015).
In our sample, four large insurers--Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Health Net, and
Kaiser--covered 89% of exchange enrollees. Those insurers had dominant positions throughout
our sample, with one exception: Anthem's market share declined sharply after it exited all but 3
of the 19 California markets in 2018. The collective market share of the 9 small regional insurers
increased from 5% in 2014 to 16% in 2018.9
    Exchange plans are grouped into four "metal" tiers with differing levels of actuarial value (AV):
bronze (60% AV), silver (70% AV), gold (80% AV), and platinum (90% AV). The plan AV defines
the percentage of total covered costs for which a plan pays. For example, enrollees in a plan with
70% actuarial value are responsible for 30% of the costs of all covered benefits they incur, on
average. Over 60% of enrollees chose a silver plan because access to cost sharing reductions (CSRs)
that reduce copays, coinsurance, and deductibles requires enrollment in a silver plan. CSRs increase
the silver plan AV from 70% to 73%, 87%, or 94%, depending on the consumer's income. CSRs are
not available to households with income exceeding 250% of FPL. Roughly two-thirds of consumers
in our data can access CSRs. In many states, insurers have flexibility in how they design plans' cost-
sharing features to achieve a given AV. However, the California exchange has standardized all plans
in the same metal tier to have identical cost sharing.10 In addition to the "metal" plans, catastrophic
plans with much higher deductibles are available to individuals under age 30, but represented only
1% of enrollment share in our sample. California exchange consumers had an average of 27 plans
offered by 4.75 insurers to choose from, though there was considerable heterogeneity in choice set
sizes. Los Angeles County residents could choose from as many as 45 plans offered by 7 insurers,
whereas residents in rural areas of Northern California could choose from as few as 5 plans offered
by a single insurer.
    Figure 1 summarizes annual enrollment transitions across metal tiers and insurers. Two im-
portant features of the California exchange in 2014-2018 stand out. First, consumer churn was
substantial. Approximately 35% of enrollees in year t were not enrolled in year t + 1. Transitions
out of enrollment could be due to "Ineligibility" (approximately 26% of enrollees lost exchange eli-
gibility due to exogenous factors, such as a change in labor market status or Medicaid eligibility), or
to "Uninsurance" (approximately 9% of enrollees remained eligible, but dropped coverage for other
reasons). This phenomenon was relatively stable across metal tiers and insurers, though consumers
were most likely to drop coverage if they were previously enrolled in a bronze plan. Second, plan

switching was relatively rare despite highly volatile premiums during our study timeframe. Among
consumers that renewed coverage in our sample, approximately 79% chose last year's plan, 91%
chose a plan from the same metal tier as last year's plan, and 87% chose a plan from the same in-
surer as last year's plan. Switching from Anthem to Blue Shield was slightly more common because
Anthem exited most California markets in 2018 and many previous Anthem enrollees subsequently
opted into Blue Shield. This high degree of inertia may reflect the role of defaults. At the end of
each plan year, current enrollees are sent a renewal notice. Those who do not actively change plans
are automatically enrolled into their current plans for the next plan year. In sum, the low levels of
switching between plans suggest that inertia was high, but high consumer churn into and out of the
market may have muted some of the effects of inertia.
    Table 2 summarizes average premium spending by year and enrollment status. The average
household paid a subsidized monthly premium of $136, which is approximately 31% of the aver-
age unsubsidized premium of $434. Households who switched plans paid $134 on average and
consumers choosing a plan for the first time paid $130 on average. Although this descriptive evi-
dence does not adjust for differences in the premiums available to incumbent enrollees and to new
enrollees and switchers, it suggests consumers may benefit from annually reviewing their plan op-
tions. Another notable feature of the data is that unsubsidized premiums increased sharply in 2018,
largely as a result of the Trump Administration's decision to halt government funding of CSRs. Be-
cause insurers were still legally required to provide CSRs even after direct government funding was
eliminated, they covered expenses through higher premiums. Many states (including California)
responded by promoting the "silver loading" strategy, which encouraged insurers to only increase
silver plan premiums to cover the cost of having to fund CSRs. Because premium subsidies are
linked to silver plan premiums (see discussion of equation (2) below), consumers received larger
premium subsidies under this strategy and paradoxically paid lower subsidized premiums in 2018.
    Firms may exploit consumer inertia by more aggressively increasing premiums on plans with
greater market share. To understand whether firms engage in this behavior, Table 3 presents the
results of descriptive regressions of yearly (percentage) premium changes (t to t + 1) on lagged
(year t) market share, controlling for plan generosity using the plan's actuarial value, the plan's risk
score, an HMO dummy, and firm and market fixed effects. The first column indicates that a 10
percentage point increase in lagged plan market share is associated with an additional 1 percent-
age point increase in the year-to-year premium growth rate. This association could be driven by
different cost trends among plans with greater enrollment, or by different cost trends in relatively
concentrated markets. The third column sheds light on these potential mechanisms by including
firm and market fixed effects, and indicates a strikingly similar pattern: a 10 percentage point in-

Figure reports enrollee transitions between plan years by metal tier (top panel) and insurer (bottom panel). Each bar
shows the share of enrollees with the insurance status in year t, indicated on the categorical horizontal axis, who
transition to the indicated insurance status in year t + 1. In addition to choosing an exchange plan, consumers can be
either uninsured, but eligible for the exchange, or ineligible for the exchange. For the sake of brevity, we combine
bronze and catastrophic enrollment and label it "bronze"; this has little material impact, as only 1% of sample
enrollees chose catastrophic plans.

crease in lagged plan market share is associated with an additional 1.3 percentage point increase in
the year-to-year premium growth rate. This is consistent with inertia being a significant source of
firm market power.

1.2      Claims and Risk Adjustment
We also use insurer rate filings from California's Department of Managed Care to obtain financial
information on medical claims, reinsurance11 , and risk adjustment (Department of Managed Health
Care, 2016). For each of these financial variables, we observe the average (or per-member per-
month) amount and total amount for each plan sold in each year and market. The rate filing data
are used for estimating plan risk and claims.
    Under the ACA, risk adjustment redistributes money from firms drawing below-average risk
customers to firms drawing above-average consumers. Transfers between firms must sum to zero,
which differs from Medicare Advantage (MA) where risk adjustment payments to MA plans are tied
to Traditional Medicare and are usually positive. The objectives of risk adjustment are to prevent
unraveling of generous options and to disincentivize firms from attempting to select the lowest-risk
consumers (known as "cherry-picking") as a means of reducing costs. All metal plans in the state's
individual market, including off-exchange plans, are in the same risk adjustment pool. Catastrophic
plans are risk-adjusted separately. Figure 2 summarizes risk adjustment transfers in our sample by
metal tier. The most generous tier of platinum plans received substantial risk adjustment transfers
whereas the least generous tier of bronze plans paid risk adjustment transfers. This is consistent
with more generous plans in the ACA exchanges being adversely selected.


2        Model and Estimation
We construct a two-stage model where insurers first set premiums and households then select plans.
Our model closely follows the one in Saltzman (2021). We present and estimate our model starting
with household plan selection.


2.1      Demand
In our demand model, households select the plan maximizing their (indirect) utility

     Reinsurance was in effect for 2014-2016 and helped insurers cover consumers with the highest utilization. The
nationwide budget was $10 billion in 2014, $6 billion in 2015, and $4 billion in 2016.

Notes: Figure shows the per-member per-month risk adjustment transfer for plans in each metal tier. A positive
transfer indicates that a plan received a transfer because its enrollees had above-average risk, whereas a negative
transfer indicates a plan paid a transfer because its enrollees had below-average risk.

Premium subsidies decrease the premium pijt (pt ) paid by the household and CSRs increase the
plan AV in equation (1). Define Ui0t = ip it + i0t as the utility of the outside option (i.e., forgoing
insurance), where it is the household's penalty for not having insurance.

2.1.1   Premium Subsidies and Regulation

The household premium including subsidies
                                    is                               
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                  pijt (pt ) = max it pjmt - max{it pbmt - it , 0}, 0                              (2)
                                                                     
                                        full    premium subsidy
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                           premium
                                                                     

where pjmt is the plan base premium, pbmt is the benchmark plan base premium, and it is the income
contribution limit. The unsubsidized premium equals the product of the plan base premium and
the household-specific rating factor it . The rating factor characterizes the limited ways in which
insurers' premiums can vary with household characteristics. ACA premiums can only vary by age,
tobacco usage, and geography. The ratio of premiums for a 64-year-old vs. a 21-year-old cannot be
greater than 3-to-1. California is one of several states that prohibits tobacco rating. The California
exchange is divided into 19 rating areas within which premiums cannot vary, conditional on age.
    The ACA's premium subsidy is designed to limit the household's outlay for the benchmark plan
to a certain percentage of its income. It is computed as the difference between the benchmark plan
premium (it pbmt ) and the income-based contribution limit it . The benchmark plan is the plan
with the second-lowest premium in the household's choice set and can vary between households
because of partial firm entry and heterogeneous pricing across state rating areas. The income-based
contribution limit was 2% of income for consumers with income of 100% of the federal poverty level
(FPL) and 9.5% of income for consumers with income of 400% of FPL in 2014 (these percentages
change slightly each year). For example, a single consumer earning 100% of FPL ($11,670 in
2014) would have a contribution limit of $233 per year or $19 per month; the consumer's monthly
premium subsidy would be $181 if the full benchmark plan premium were $200. This $181 subsidy
could be used for any metal plan (catastrophic plans do not qualify for subsidies). If some bronze
plans have a full premium below $181, the subsidy would be reduced to ensure the household's
premium is nonnegative. Many consumers may therefore have access to "free" plans, a fact which


                                                  15
we exploit to identify the premium parameter ip as discussed in the next subsection.

2.1.2   Demand Estimation and Identification

To estimate the demand parameters, we assume the error term d   ijt has the generalized extreme value
distribution such that equation (1) defines a nested logit choice model at the consumer level. We
create two nests, including one with all available exchange plans and a second with the outside
option. Following Train (2009), the household choice probabilities are then:
                                                                                   -1
                                             eVijt (pt )/       j   eVijt (pt )/
                           qijt (pt ;  ) =                                     
                                                                                                   (3)
                                                  1+        j   eVijt (pt )/

where Vijt (pt )  ip pijt (pt ) + ij y
                                       yij (t-1) + xij  x + wit  w + j . The vector of utility weights
is  = (ip , ij  y
                  ,  x ,  w ) and  is the nesting parameter. As discussed in Section 2.2 below, we
estimate the model using a two-step feasible generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator.
    Subsidized premiums vary at the household, market, and insurer level. A natural concern is
that premiums are endogenous and correlated with unobserved plan quality, which might reflect
customer service or provider networks. We include insurer-market fixed effects to control for time-
invariant plan quality. Conditional on those fixed effects, there are multiple additional sources of
plausibly exogenous variation for identification of the premium parameter ip . First, the phasing
in of the mandate penalty between 2014 and 2016 and elimination of the penalty in 2019 creates
exogenous variation in premiums relative to the outside option. Second, nonlinearities in equa-
tion (2) create exogenous premium variation between plans within a given household's choice set.
For example, some bronze plans are available free to some households because the subsidy exceeds
the full premium due to exogenous household characteristics; the set of free plans varies across
household characteristics, market, and time.
    Another identification challenge we face is that persistence in plan choices may reflect persistent
unobserved preference heterogeneity, rather than inertia. We identify the inertia parameter ij    y
                                                                                                     by
leveraging two key features of our empirical setting. First, because we observe the first year of
exchange's enrollment, every consumer in our data made at least one active choice upon entry, either
in 2014 or in a subsequent year when the consumer first became eligible for exchange coverage.
This allows us to compare, for example, 2015 enrollment decisions for consumers enrolled in a
Health Net silver plan in 2014 with those of consumers ineligible for the exchange in 2014. The
differential market shares of the Health Net silver plan in 2015 across these two groups provides
evidence regarding the existence and extent of inertia. Although newly-eligible enrollees in 2015


                                                   16
may have different preferences than 2014 enrollees, we can leverage this type of identification across
multiple years and across enrollees initially enrolled in many different plan types. Second, some
consumers made additional active decisions if their previous plans were no longer offered or if they
were prohibited from purchasing their previous plans (e.g., young adults cannot buy a catastrophic
plan upon turning 30). The most prominent example of this phenomenon occurred when Anthem
exited most markets in 2018. Intuitively, we can compare the 2018 plan choices of 2017 Anthem
enrollees, in markets where Anthem remained vs. those where Anthem exited.

2.1.3    Demand Results

We estimate the utility weights in equation (1) using a 5% sample of the data.12 Table 4 summa-
rizes the out-of-sample fit of our model, for four different specifications. Specification 1 is the most
parsimonious and models choices as a function of all plan and enrollee characteristics, including
insurer fixed effects. Specification 2 adds interactions between premium and household charac-
teristics (i.e., allowing low-income families to be more price-sensitive) and between lagged plan
choice and both plan and household characteristics (i.e., allowing inertia to be higher among older
consumers, or among Blue Shield enrollees). Specification 3 controls for insurer-market fixed ef-
fects. Specifications (1)-(3) are estimated on the pooled 5% sample; specification 4 estimates the
model separately for 4 age-income combinations.13 For each specification, we compare the model
predictions to the observed data in a hold-out sample not used in estimation. Specification 2 results
in a better out-of-sample fit than specification 1, particularly for matching the share of enrollment
by metal tier. Including insurer-market fixed effects (specification 3) does not yield any appreciable
gains in fit. Specification 4 matches enrollment by metal tier slightly better than specification 2, but
performs worse in matching plan switching rates and adds considerable computational complex-
ity for our subsequent analyses. We consider specification 2 to be our most preferred and use this
specification for all subsequent analyses in this paper. Detailed parameter estimates are available
in Appendix Table A1.
     The first four columns of Table 5 display price elasticities of demand by household character-
istics. We show both own-premium elasticities and elasticities of exchange coverage overall. The
sensitivity of a subsidized consumer's demand to a premium change is
  12
     We also estimated the model on larger samples and obtained nearly identical estimates. We encountered significant
computational challenges using samples larger than 5% of the data. Therefore, we perform the estimation with a 5%
sample.
  13
     These combinations are (1) below age 45 and income below 200% of FPL; (2) below age 45 and income above
200% of FPL; (3) above age 45 and income below 200% of FPL; and (4) above age 45 and income above 200% of FPL.

separately for 4 age-income bins (age above and below 45, income above and below 200% of FPL). The second panel
reports average annual enrollment, market shares by metal level and insurer, and the percentage of renewing
consumers who switched plans.

Intuitively, a small premium increase for a non-benchmark plan leads to consumers paying more
for only that plan. However, a small premium increase for the benchmark plan increases the con-
sumer's subsidy. This implies that the consumer's contribution to the benchmark plan is unchanged.
However, because of the larger subsidy, the consumer would then pay less for all non-benchmark
plans.
    Our elasticity estimates are similar to previous estimates (Domurat, 2018; Drake, 2019; Saltz-
man, 2019; Tebaldi, 2020). Consumers with lower incomes and younger consumers are more price-
elastic.
    The last column of Table 5 presents the annual switching costs implied by our parameter es-
timates. On average, consumers were willing to pay $2,324 more in annual premiums to remain
in their previous plan, rather than switching to another plan with identical characteristics. Higher-
income consumers and adults over age 55 had switching costs of about $3,700, whereas young
adults (ages 18-34) had switching costs of about $1,500. We also find that consumers were more
attached to some plans than others, though these differences were not as stark. For example, "the
Blues"--Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California--were associated with larger switching
costs.
    Our estimates of inertia are large relative to annual premiums--$2,324 is 44% of the average
enrollee's $5,307 in annual premium expenditures. Handel (2013) estimates a switching cost of
$2,032 per enrollee-year for employer-sponsored health insurance coverage and Polyakova (2016)
estimates switching costs of $400-$600 per enrollee-year for Medicare Part D, which covers only
prescription drugs.

       The formula assumes that the subsidy does not exceed the full, unsubsidized premium.

2.2    Supply
In the first stage where firms set premiums, we account for the complex regulatory and subsidy
structure in the ACA exchanges. Firms set the base premium pjmt for each plan j that they sell to
maximize expected profit
           f t (pt ) = Rf t (pt ) - Cf t (pt ) + RAf t (pt ) + RIf t (pt ) - Vf t (pt ) - F Cf t .     (5)

Expected profit includes total premium revenue Rf t (pt ), total claims Cf t (pt ), risk adjustment re-
ceived RAf t (pt ), reinsurance received RIf t (pt ), variable administrative costs Vf t (pt ) such as com-
missions, and the fixed cost F Cf t of participating in the marketplace.
    Our model endogenizes risk adjustment transfers. Using our notation, we can write the average
plan risk adjustment formula used in the ACA exchanges (as specified in Pope et al. (2014)'s first
appendix) as
                             rjmt (pt ) mM,lJmt qlmt (p)         hj mM,lJmt qlmt (p)
           rajmt (pt ) =                                      -                                p
                               mM,lJmt rjmt (pt )qlmt (pt )        mM,lJmt hl qlmt (pt )

where rjmt (pt ) is the risk score determined by CMS as a function of the plan AV and enrollee
characteristics, hj is an expected utilization factor set by regulation that captures the plan AV and
moral hazard, and p is the weighted market average premium. The total transfer RAjmt (pt ) equals
           RAjmt (pt ;  ) = rajmt (pt )qjmt (pt ) = [rsjmt (pt ) - usjmt (pt )] Rt (pt ;  )            (6)

The firm's total transfer RAf t (pt ) = mM,j Jf mt RAjmt (pt ). Total premium revenue in the mar-
ket is Rt (pt ) = f Rf t (pt ;  ). The plan's "risk share" rsjmt (pt ) accounts for adverse selection,
moral hazard, and plan AV, whereas the plan's utilization share accounts for moral hazard and plan
AV. Thus, the plan's relative risk due to adverse selection is captured by the difference between the
plan's risk share and utilization share. The plan's risk share of total claims rsjmt (pt ) in formula (6)
then equals:
                                                  rjmt (pt )qjmt (pt )
                              rsjmt (pt ) =
                                                 mM,lJmt rlmt (pt )qlmt (pt )

where Jmt is all plans offered in market m and year t. Although plan risk scores are not directly
observed in our data, we observe all other variables in formula (6) and can hence back out the plan
risk scores from equation (6). The plan's "utilization share" usjmt (pt ) equals:
                                                    hj qjmt (pt )
                                 usjmt (pt ) =                           .
                                                   mM,lJmt hl qlmt (pt )

If the risk share exceeds the utilization share, then the plan has high risk compared to expected uti-


                                                     21
lization and it receives a transfer from the risk adjustment program. If the utilization share exceeds
the risk share, then the plan has low risk compared to expected utilization and it pays a transfer.
    The first-order conditions corresponding to equation (5) are:
                M Rjmt (pt ) + M RAjmt (pt ) = (1 - f t )M Cjmt (pt ) + M Vjt (pt )                  (7)

where f t is the AV of the reinsurance contract. Note that this solution accounts for portfolio ef-
fects in which each firm internalizes the effects of one plan's premium on the enrollment in other
                                                                         Rf t (pt )

ministrative costs M Vjt (pt ) are given in Appendix B. To reduce the computational burden of es-
timating and using the model for counterfactual simulations, we assume firm entry decisions are
exogenous. In alternative market and policy settings, firms may decide to enter or exit specific
markets or the exchange altogether, and any such shifts in market participation may have implica-
tions for our welfare estimates in the next section. Our analysis should thus be considered partial
equilibrium.
    We use our enrollment and insurer rate filing data to estimate every term in equation (7). Our
strategy is to write equation (7) in terms of the household choice probabilities qijt (pt ), plan risk
scores rjmt (pt ), and plan average claims cjmt (pt ). We calculate the household choice probabilities
using equation (3). We do not observe all of the enrollee characteristics used by regulators to
compute plan risk scores, and our simulations require a model of how counterfactual enrollment
patterns will impact plans' risk scores and claims. Accordingly, we predict risk scores as a function
of plan AV and observed household characteristics using the following estimating equation:
                   ln rjmt (pt ;  ,  ) =         d sdjmt (pt ;  ) + M Tj  M T +   r
                                                                                  jmt .              (8)
                                           dD


where sdjmt (·) is the share of plan j 's enrollment with demographic characteristic d, M Tj is a vector
of metal fixed effects, and r  jmt is the error term. The parameter vector  = ( , 
                                                                                      d  MT
                                                                                             ) captures
how plans' risk scores scale with demographic variables and plan generosity. We predict average
claims using the estimating equation:
            ln cjmt (pt ;  ,  ,  ) = r ln rjmt (pt ;  ,  ) + xj x + u ut + nm n +         c
                                                                                          jmt        (9)

where xj is an HMO dummy, ut is a linear trend, nm are market fixed effects, cjmt is an error term,
and  = ( ,  ,  ,  ) are parameters to be estimated.
            r x u n

    We estimate the model parameters using four groups of moments: (1) moments that match
the predicted household choice probabilities from equation (3) with the observed plan choices; (2)


                                                   22
moments that match observed and predicted risk scores in equation (8); (3) moments that match
observed and predicted average claims in equation (9); and (4) the first-order conditions in equation
(7). Because there are more moment conditions than parameters, we use two-step feasible GMM
to estimate the model parameters.
    Table 6 summarizes our estimates of the parameters  and  . As expected, risk scores are
increasing monotonically across the metal tiers. The bottom panel reports the estimated coefficients
in the claims equation. If the predicted risk score increases by one percent, average claims are also
predicted to increase by about one percent. For plans with the same risk score, HMOs are predicted
to have 12% lower average claims, which is similar to the efficiency advantage of HMOs used in
Cutler and Reber (1998). Predicted claims are also increasing about 1.3% each year.

3     Counterfactual Simulations
The key focus of our paper is a series of simulation exercises in which we use the above model esti-
mates to: (1) estimate the effect of removing inertia on equilibrium premiums, enrollment, and wel-
fare in the observed ACA setting; (2) evaluate how the effects of eliminating inertia would change


                                                        23
in the absence of firm market power and/or risk adjustment; and (3) provide insight into how three
significant features in managed competition--the design of premium subsidies, consumer churn
between markets, and provider network generosity, each of which is sensitive to policy choices--
interact with inertia.


3.1   Simulation Methodology
We assumed that the observed ACA premiums define a Nash equilibrium that satisfies the firms'
first-order conditions for profit maximization (i.e., equation (7)) to estimate the model. This equi-
librium occurs in the ACA setting where consumers have inertia, firms have market power, and
risk adjustment is in effect. In our main simulation analysis, we construct counterfactual scenarios
that involve combinations of three changes: eliminating inertia, eliminating risk adjustment, and
eliminating firm market power. We simulate the elimination of inertia by setting the lagged choice
variables in the consumer's utility function to zero and re-solving for the equilibrium premiums. We
simulate the elimination of risk adjustment by removing the marginal transfer from the first-order
conditions and re-solving for the equilibrium premiums. We simulate the elimination of market
power by solving for the vector of premiums that sets the profit for each plan equal to zero. We run
every simulation once for the years 2015-2018 and report a simple average across years.
     We also conduct three analyses where we (1) eliminate the ACA's endogenous subsidy; (2) elim-
inate consumer eligibility churn; and (3) consider the extent to which provider network attachment
drives the impact of inertia. We simulate the replacement of the ACA's endogenous subsidy with an
exogenous subsidy or voucher by not allowing the observed ACA subsidy to adjust with premiums
in alternative scenarios. This change implies that subsidies will remain fixed if all market premi-
ums increase, thus raising consumers' out-of-pocket premiums. It also changes firms' first-order
conditions. Mathematically, equation (4) simplifies to

                                  pilt (pt )     it    l=j
                                             =             .                                    (10)
                                  pjmt           0     l=j

We simulate the elimination of consumer eligibility churn by assuming that, for each year pair t and
t + 1, all consumers eligible in year t maintain eligibility for the exchange in year t + 1. We then
re-solve for the equilibrium premiums. Lastly, we explore whether provider network attachment is
a key driver of inertia by re-estimating our entire model with additional interactions between the
lagged choice indicator variable and two network variables: network breadth (i.e., the percentage
of providers covered in the market (Polsky et al., 2016)) and network inclusivity (i.e., the number


                                                 24
of providers within each network that overlap with other insurers' networks, as a percentage of the
total possible number of shared connections (Graves et al., 2020)).15 A limitation of this sensitivity
analysis is that provider network data are unavailable for approximately 20% of plans, requiring us
to drop these plans.
    For each simulation, we compute total social welfare in year t as SWt  CSt + t -  
GSt , where CSt is consumer surplus, t is total firm profit, and GSt is total government spending
adjusting by a factor  to account for the deadweight loss of taxation. We let  = 1.3 following
Hausman and Poterba (1987) and Decarolis et al. (2020). Consumer surplus is
                                                            
                                                                                  y

                                                                                     -ip

where the premium parameter ip is in dollars (not hundreds of dollars as in Table 6) and  is the
fraction of inertia that is assumed to be an error. The first term of equation (11) is the standard nested
logit formula for consumer surplus and the second term of equation (11) "corrects" the first term
to reflect the fraction  of inertia that is an error. The parameter  = 0 if inertia is a true switching
cost (e.g., the effort associated with researching plans and re-enrolling) and  = 1 if inertia is
the result of behavioral error (e.g., inattention) that impacts choices, but not welfare (Handel and
Schwartzstein, 2018). We assume  = 1 in our main analysis, but consider the sensitivity of our
results to  < 1. Formula (11) assumes consumer welfare is accurately measured using consumers'
revealed preferences.16
    We compute firm profit using equation (5). Government spending equals the sum of premium
subsidies, CSRs, and uncompensated care for the uninsured, minus revenue collected from the
mandate penalty. Premium subsidy spending is the sum of subsidies received by each consumer in
equation (2). Spending on CSRs is computed as
                                CSRt =                   sg
                                                          j qijt (p;  )cjmt (pt ;  ,  ,  )
                                                iI,j J

                                                                             17
where sg
       j is the expected share of claims paid by the government for plan j .    Coughlin et al.
  15
      There is little variation in network breadth and inclusivity variables over time, implying that the level variables are
absorbed into the insurer-market fixed effects. We therefore focus on the interaction terms.
   16
      Our model assumes that we can use revealed preference to measure consumer surplus. That is, other than the
decision frictions or mistakes associated with inertia, consumers correctly value health coverage and its consequences
for their health and mortality. If consumers underestimate the value of health insurance, our welfare calculations could
underestimate the reduction in consumer surplus that results from consumers exiting the exchange.
   17
      Ignoring moral hazard, the government's expected outlay is 94 - 70 = 24% of claims for the 94% CSR plan,
87 - 70 = 17% of claims for the 87% CSR plan, and 73 - 70 = 3% of claims for the 73% CSR plan. To account for
moral hazard, we follow Pope et al. (2014) and assume there is no moral hazard for consumers in the 73% plan, while


                                                            25
(2014) estimate the per-capita amount of medical costs paid by the government on behalf of the
nonelderly uninsured to be $2,025. Uncompensated care spending is calculated as the product of
$2,025 inflated to the timeframe of this study using data from the National Health Expenditure
Accounts (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2018) and the change in the uninsured
population's risk score. Penalty revenue collected by the government equals iI qi0t it , where
qi0t is the household's probability of choosing the outside option.


3.2     Simulation Results: Removing Inertia in the ACA Environment
We summarize our key simulation results on premiums, coverage, claims, and welfare in Figures 3-
5; more detailed results are available in Appendix Table A2. Figure 3 summarizes the effects
of removing inertia on average premiums (panel a), enrollment (panel b), and claims (panel c).
Figure 4 summarizes the same results by metal tier. The left-most bars and lines in each figure
summarize the Base (ACA) setting where firms have market power and risk adjustment is in place.
Panel (a) of Figure 3 indicates that eliminating inertia in the Base setting results in a large decrease
(13.2%) in equilibrium premiums. This result suggests that inertia is a significant source of firm
market power. The premium decrease is due to firms re-pricing; average premiums would decrease
only slightly if consumers re-sorted, holding premiums fixed (see Appendix Table A2). Panel (a)
of Figure 4 shows that these premium changes occur fairly evenly across the metal tiers.
    Panel (b) of Figure 3 indicates that eliminating inertia leads to a 3.1% decline in total exchange
enrollment in the Base setting. This result suggests that for a small share of exchange enrollees,
forgoing exchange coverage is optimal in the absence of inertia. Panel (c) of Figure 3 shows that
average claims decline by 3.9% in the Base setting if inertia is removed. This relatively small
effect is driven both by reductions in claims within each metal tier that occur when consumers
select less costly plans within tier (see panel (c) of Figure 4) and by consumers shifting from more
generous metal tiers (e.g., platinum) and to less generous metal tiers (e.g., bronze) (see panel (b) of
Figure 4).18
    The top panel of Figure 5 shows that removing inertia increases average annual per-capita so-
cial welfare by $902 in the Base setting after the deadweight loss of taxation factor  is applied
to government spending.19 Consumers benefit by reoptimizing plan selection and from reduced
consumers in the 87% and 94% plans increase consumption by 12%. Including moral hazard, the sg     j = 26.88% for the
94% CSR plan, sg   j =  19 . 04% for the 87%  CSR   plan, and sg
                                                               j = 3% for the 73% CSR plan.
   18
      The large differences in premiums and claims across metal levels makes the scale of the vertical axes in Figure 4
fairly large, and the effects of inertia visually small by comparison. See Appendix Table A2 for these effects in dollar
terms.
   19
      All dollar values are reported in Appendix Tables A3 and A4.

Notes: Figure reports the impact of inertia on average premiums (panel a), share of eligible consumers enrolled in an
exchange plan (panel b), and average claims (panel c) by simulated setting. The base setting corresponds to the ACA
where firms have market power and risk adjustment is in place. Three modifications to the base setting are
considered, including: (1) eliminate risk adjustment; (2) eliminate market power; and (3) eliminate both risk
adjustment and market power.

Notes: Figure reports the impact of inertia on average premiums (panel a), share of exchange enrollment (panel b),
and average claims (panel c) by metal tier and simulated setting. The base setting corresponds to the ACA where
firms have market power and risk adjustment is in place. Three modifications to the base setting are considered,
including: (1) eliminating risk adjustment; (2) eliminating market power; and (3) eliminating both risk adjustment
and market power. Average platinum premiums and claims are capped at $800 in the eliminate risk adjustment setting
for presentational purposes.




                                                                                                                                               28
premiums. Taxpayers benefit primarily through reductions in premium subsidy spending. Welfare
gains for consumers and taxpayers more than offset the $221 decrease in per-capita firm profit.
    The bottom panel of Figure 5 shows how consumer surplus and net social welfare vary with the
proportion of inertia  that is assumed to be the result of a behavioral error (the top panel assumes
 = 1). The positive social welfare impact of eliminating inertia in the Base scenario is fairly
robust; over 81% of inertia would have to represent a true switching cost for the social welfare
change to be negative.


3.3    Simulation Results: Removing Inertia, Market Power, and Risk Adjust-
       ment
Next, we evaluate the effects of removing inertia in the absence of risk adjustment and/or market
power. Panel (a) in Figure 3 shows that premium decreases are substantially smaller in the al-
ternative settings than the 13.2% decrease in the Base setting. Removing inertia reduces average
premiums by 10.9% in a counterfactual setting without risk adjustment, 0.9% in a counterfactual
setting without firm market power, and 2.9% in a counterfactual setting without risk adjustment or
firm market power. Panel (b) of Figure 3 indicates total enrollment declines are similar in the three
counterfactual settings.
     Risk adjustment leads to premium compression across metal tiers, whereas oligopoly compe-
tition leads to heterogeneous markups within metal tiers. When risk adjustment and market power
are removed, there are accordingly disparate patterns of consumer sorting across versus within
metal tiers. Removing inertia amplifies these patterns of consumer sorting and in turn leads to very
different premium impacts of inertia across settings. First, consider the effect of removing risk ad-
justment alone (i.e., with inertia and with market power). Removing risk adjustment eliminates the
transfer payments from plans with lower-than-average risk (e.g., bronze) to plans with higher-than-
average risk (e.g., platinum). As expected, this exacerbates adverse selection across plans, inducing
a steeper gradient in premiums across metal tiers (Figure 4, panel a), and a similarly steep gradient
in claims across metal tiers (Figure 4, panel c). In equilibrium, this leads to bronze plans increasing
market share from 27% to 40%, while the market share of the gold and platinum tiers combined
nearly unravels from 10% to 1% (Figure 4, panel b). Eliminating inertia in the absence of risk
adjustment then has a somewhat smaller effect on average premiums than in the Base setting. This
is because removing risk adjustment on its own leads to dramatic shifts in enrollment away from
the gold and platinum tiers, and to drops in bronze and silver premiums. The incremental effect of
removing inertia is then layered on top of those effects, generating slightly smaller additional pre-

                      (b) Sensitivity of Welfare to Whether Inertia Is True Switching Cost

Notes: Figure reports the impact of inertia on average annual per-capita welfare by simulated setting. Panel (a)
displays consumer surplus, firm profit, government spending (including premium subsidies, CSRs, mandate penalties
collected, and uncompensated care), and net social welfare for each simulated scenario. Net social welfare calculation
applies the deadweight loss of taxation to government spending before aggregating. Panel (b) shows how consumer
surplus and net social welfare vary with the proportion of inertia  that is the result of a behavioral error (the first
panel assumes  = 1).


                                                                                  30
mium decreases and enrollment shifts. For example, the combined gold and platinum tiers' market
share declines 1.9 percentage points in the Base setting when inertia is eliminated, but only 0.5
percentage points in this setting.
    Next, consider the effect of removing market power alone (i.e., with inertia and with risk ad-
justment). As expected, removing market power decreases premiums in all metal tiers (Figure 4,
panel a) and increases enrollment in the market (Figure 3, panel b). The premium decreases vary
significantly within metal tiers depending on which plans have higher markups in the Base setting.
Because some silver and platinum plans have particularly high markups in the Base setting (Figure
4, panel a), consumers sort into these plans and away from bronze plans when market power is re-
moved (Figure 4, panel b). Eliminating inertia then enhances this pattern of consumer substitution
from less generous to more generous tiers. The combined gold and platinum market share declines
by 1.9 percentage points in the Base setting, but increases by 4.6 percentage points in the setting
without market power. Given that the more generous tiers are adversely selected, this increase in
market share leads to further decreases in premiums (Figure 4, panel a) and claims (Figure 4, panel
c) in the gold and platinum tiers. On net, eliminating inertia without firm market power has a min-
imal impact on average premiums because it shifts demand towards cheaper plans within the more
expensive gold and platinum tiers.
    Given the very different interactions risk adjustment and market power have with inertia on their
own, we would expect eliminating inertia without risk adjustment or market power to have an inter-
mediate effect on premiums. Indeed, premiums decline in all metal tiers when both risk adjustment
and market power are removed, but the gradient in premiums across metal tiers is considerably
steeper (Figure 4, panel a). Consequently, the enrollment shifts associated with eliminating risk
adjustment alone and market power alone are both present when risk adjustment and market power
are removed. Bronze plan market share expands, but so does gold and platinum market share.
Eliminating inertia enhances these demand shifts. Hence, eliminating inertia without risk adjust-
ment and market power has a smaller impact on average premiums than in the setting without risk
adjustment, but a larger impact than in the setting without market power.20
    Eliminating inertia has the largest impact on social welfare in the Base setting. The top panel
of Figure 5 indicates that when inertia is eliminated, per-capita social welfare increases $902 in
the Base setting, compared to $658 in the absence of risk adjustment, $547 in the absence of mar-
   20
      Appendix Table A5 provides further insight into this phenomenon; when inertia is removed in a scenario without
market power, consumer sorting into lower-cost plans within metal tier causes monthly premiums to decrease by $38 in
the platinum tier if risk adjustment is applied, but by $74 in the platinum tier if risk adjustment is not applied. Adverse
selection across metal tiers then causes platinum premiums to rise by $15 if risk adjustment is applied, and by $67 if
risk adjustment is not applied.

ket power, and $250 in the absence of both market power and risk adjustment. Consumer surplus
changes are similar in all four settings, in part because the ACA's endogenous subsidies shield con-
sumers from premium changes. However, taxpayers fare far worse in the counterfactual settings
because the average premium reductions are smaller than in the Base setting, resulting in substan-
tially smaller reductions in government subsidy spending. In fact, government subsidy spending
slightly increases in the setting where both risk adjustment and market power are eliminated be-
cause of an increase in silver plan premiums (recall that the ACA's endogenous subsidy is tied to
the second-cheapest silver plan premium).
     In the bottom panel of Figure 5, eliminating inertia is much less likely to be welfare-improving.
For example, in contrast to the Base scenario, eliminating inertia in a setting without risk adjust-
ment and market power would result in a negative welfare impact if only about 25% of inertia
represents a true switching cost. In this setting, removing inertia would reduce welfare by $709 if
all of inertia were a true switching cost. Thus, there are settings in which "nudging would hurt" in
the California exchange as in Handel (2013)'s analysis of employer-based health insurance. This
sensitivity exercise demonstrates that the ranking of inertia's impact on social welfare is preserved
for all values of  . Eliminating inertia in the Base setting has the largest welfare benefit if inertia is
purely a behavioral error and the smallest welfare cost if inertia is a true switching cost.


3.4       Simulation Results: Inertia Interactions with Subsidy Design, Consumer
          Churn, and Provider Networks
Finally, we explore how several policy-driven features of the ACA environment interact with inertia.
First, we convert the ACA's endogenous, price-linked subsidy to an exogenous subsidy or voucher.
Second, we eliminate churn in exchange eligibility. Third, we evaluate the impact of provider net-
works on inertia by removing only the part of inertia not driven by provider network inclusivity.
The results are presented in Figure 6.
    Eliminating inertia when subsidies are set exogenously at the observed ACA subsidy has a
smaller overall impact than in the Base setting where subsidies are endogenous.21 This is because
switching from endogenous subsidies to exogenous subsidies already reduces firm market power.
Converting the ACA's endogenous subsidy to an exogenous subsidy reduces average premiums by
$2 per month. This premium decrease would be significantly larger in a market with less competi-
tion than in the California exchange, particularly if only one firm participated and could exert full
control over the benchmark premium; see, e.g., Jaffe and Shepard (2020). With exogenous subsi-

dies, average premiums fall by 8.7% (panel a) and exchange coverage falls by 1.3% (panel b) when
inertia is eliminated. The reduction in coverage is less than half of the 3.1% reduction in the Base
setting. The elimination of inertia is more beneficial for consumers with an exogenous subsidy
because consumers fully benefit from premium savings associated with switching plans (panel c).
Conversely, government spending is largely unchanged when we remove inertia because subsidy
levels are fixed. Annual per-capita social welfare increases by only $532, compared with $902 in
the Base setting.
    Eliminating inertia in a market without churn has a larger impact than in the Base setting where
churn is significant.22 This is because eliminating eligibility churn increases the proportion of
inertial enrollees over whom incumbent insurers have greater market power; on its own, eliminating
churn causes average premiums to increase from $442 to $451 (panel a). Eliminating inertia without
churn reduces average premiums by 16.8%, compared with 13.2% in the Base setting. The 4.5%
reduction in coverage is more than 30% larger than the 3.1% reduction in the Base setting (panel b).
Consumers who churn in the Base setting are more premium-sensitive and have weaker preferences
for insurance. Annual per-capita social welfare increases by $965 (panel c), which is slightly larger
than the $902 increase in the Base setting. These simulation results indicate that high consumer
churn in the ACA exchanges mitigates some of the impact of inertia.
    In our final analysis, we investigate whether consumer attachment to a plan's provider network
could be a key mechanism driving the impact of inertia in the ACA exchanges.23 Attachment to a
provider network could be a key driver if there are hassle costs, health costs, or other costs associated
with disrupting relationships with providers once established (Drake et al., 2021; Sabety, 2021).
Appendix Table A8 indicates that network breadth has only a minimal effect on plan choice, but
network inclusivity has a statistically significant and negative impact on plan choice. For example,
a standard deviation increase in the network breadth of an enrollee's lagged plan (13.6%) is valued
equivalently to a $0.02 increase in monthly premiums, but a standard deviation increase in the
network inclusivity of an enrollee's lagged plan (14.8%) is valued equivalently to a $8.34 decrease
in monthly premiums. Inertia is therefore smaller when a plan's network has more in common with
other plan networks and larger when the network contains more exclusive providers. These effects
are too small to affect our simulation results. Figure 6 indicates that eliminating inertia except for
the part due to network attachment has a similar impact on premiums, enrollment, and welfare as
eliminating all inertia in the Base setting. Hence, network preferences do not appear to be a key
mechanism driving the welfare impact of inertia.

exchange plan (panel b), and social welfare (panel c) by simulated setting. The base setting corresponds to the ACA
where firms have market power and risk adjustment is in place. Three modifications to the base setting are
considered, including: (1) make subsidy exogenous; (2) eliminate churn; and (3) consider the role of provider
network inclusivity. The third modified setting compares a reestimated base model with inertia that includes an
interaction term between the lagged choice and network inclusivity, with a scenario where inertia is eliminated except
for the portion linked to network inclusivity.            34
4    Conclusion
The provision of health insurance in the U.S. relies heavily on managed competition markets. The
goal of managed competition is to encourage private firms to compete and offer high-quality, low-
cost benefits to consumers. In this paper, we present new evidence on how consumer choice frictions
dampen firm competition in an important environment: the California ACA health insurance ex-
change. We also illustrate how the fairly intricate policy choices common to managed competition
markets can amplify or mitigate these effects.
    The choice friction of interest in this paper is inertia, the tendency of consumers not to switch
product choices over time even when other products become preferable. We present three novel sets
of results regarding inertia in the ACA environment. First, we find high average annual per-capita
switching costs of $2,324, or 44% of average premiums, and we estimate that the elimination of
these switching costs would reduce average premiums by 13.2%. These results indicate that inertia
is a significant source of firm market power. The premium decreases benefit consumers and the
government through reduced subsidy spending, increasing annual per-capita welfare by $902.
    Second, we observe a substantially smaller impact from eliminating inertia on average premiums
and social welfare when firm market power and/or risk adjustment are removed. Eliminating inertia
in the absence of market power increases consumer surplus by allowing consumers to switch into
better plans. However, the net impact on social welfare is smaller than in the ACA setting because
government subsidy reductions are small (due to the minimal change in premiums) and firm profit
is unaffected (by construction). Removing risk adjustment on its own nearly leads to unraveling of
the most generous gold and platinum plan tiers. Eliminating inertia in this setting therefore has a
smaller incremental impact on consumer surplus, firm profit, and government spending than in the
ACA setting because the market for generous coverage has already largely collapsed.
    Third, we analyze several channels through which the effects of inertia are sensitive to policy.
Eliminating inertia has a smaller role to play in mitigating market power if premium subsidies are
converted to vouchers, but has a larger impact if churn in the exchanges is reduced (e.g., through
changes to subsidy eligibility rules or the enactment of a BHP program). The impact of inertia is
not sensitive to provider network generosity.
    Our study results support the case for reducing choice frictions in the ACA exchanges, partic-
ularly in highly-concentrated markets where insurers have considerable market power. However, a
primary limitation of our analysis is that we do not identify the economic mechanisms underlying
inertia. Thus, we cannot quantify the potentially variable effects of diverse policies intended to re-
duce inertia. This is currently an active area of research complementary to our own (Brot-Goldberg


                                                 35
et al., 2021; Domurat et al., 2021; Drake et al., 2021; Kling et al., 2012). Of particular interest are
policies that may reduce switching frictions while encouraging enrollees to remain insured, partic-
ularly in light of the ACA's central goal of expanding affordable health insurance coverage to the
substantial uninsured population. We find that removing inertia would lead to a small increase in
the rate of uninsurance. If one takes our model at face value, this is optimal from a social welfare
perspective. However, inertia may not be the only choice friction at work in the ACA or other insur-
ance markets (Abaluck and Gruber, 2011; Handel and Kolstad, 2015). If other frictions exist that
lead consumers to place too little weight on the mortality consequences of their insurance choices
(Abaluck et al., 2021), then our model parameters may not fully reflect the impact of reductions in
insurance on welfare.24
    In spite of these limitations, our paper offers novel evidence on the predicted consequences of
removing inertia for premiums, government spending, and enrollment in an important new mar-
ketplace. Our paper also offers a tractable framework for evaluating those consequences as further
evidence develops on the mechanisms underlying inertia, and as new managed competition policies
are developed and tested.

A     Constructing the Outside Option
In this study, we use five years of administrative longitudinal data on exchange enrollees. Previous
studies of the California exchange treat demand as static and construct the outside option by merg-
ing the administrative data with survey data on the uninsured from sources such as the American
Community Survey (ACS) or Current Population Survey (CPS) (Tebaldi, 2020; Domurat, 2018;
Saltzman, 2019). Our focus is on switching between plans and transitions between exchange plans
and other options (i.e., no insurance or exiting the market for another insurance option). Hence, we
construct the outside option population using enrollees in our administrative data for years in which
they were not enrolled in an exchange plan, subject to remaining eligible for exchange coverage. For
example, a consumer that appears in our administrative data in 2016 and 2017 would be deemed
uninsured in 2014, 2015, and 2018, subject to remaining eligible for exchange coverage.
    In our administrative data, we do not observe whether consumers become uninsured or become
ineligible for exchange coverage in years that they do not appear. We impute eligibility for exchange
coverage using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). The SIPP is a panel data set that asks respondents their in-
surance status during each month. The SIPP also asks respondents why they may have changed
coverage status. Potential reasons include obtaining or losing an offer of employer-provided insur-
ance, moving into or out of the state, or becoming eligible for public insurance such as Medicare
or Medicaid. To conduct the imputation, we first identify SIPP respondents who transitioned into
or out of the individual market. For these respondents, we then construct a transitioned variable
indicating whether the respondent became newly eligible or ineligible for the individual market.
This variable equals 1 if at least one of the following criteria are met: (1) the respondent is a mem-
ber of a household that lost or gained an employer-sponsored insurance offer; (2) the respondent
moved into or out of California; (3) the respondent experienced a drop in income that made him
or her eligible for Medicaid; and (4) the respondent turned 65 and became eligible for Medicare.
We estimate a binomial logit model that regresses the transitioned variable on observable demo-
graphic characteristics available in both the SIPP and the administrative data, including age, gender,
race, income and size of household. We then used the estimated logit to perform an out-of-sample
prediction of the probability of exchange eligibility in our administrative data. If this probability
exceeded a random draw from the uniform distribution on the interval (0, 1), then the consumer was
flagged as exchange eligible. We remove from our outside option population any consumer-year
combinations that correspond to years during which the consumer was predicted to be ineligible
for exchange coverage. For the example consumer above, the logit prediction would be used to


                                                 42
determine if the consumer transitioned into or out of the market and was therefore ineligible for
exchange coverage in 2014, 2015, and 2018.

Notes: Table reports the impact on premiums, coverage, and claims for each scenario. The Base (or ACA) column
reports the observed premiums and coverage. In scenario (1), we eliminate inertia and allow consumers to choose a
new plan, but keep premiums the same as in the Base scenario. In scenarios (2) through (8), we simulate
combinations of 3 changes: (1) eliminating inertia; (2) repealing risk adjustment; and (3) changing the market
structure from oligopoly to perfect competition. The first panel defines each of the scenarios. The second panel
summarizes enrollee-weighted average unsubsidized premiums by metal level, insurer, and plan network type. The
bottom two rows of the second panel show overall enrollee-weighted average premiums ("Average") and subsidized
average premiums ("Subsidized Avg."). The third panel shows total enrollment, the percentage of consumers enrolled
in coverage, and market shares by metal level. The final row of the third panel indicates the percentage of consumers
who switched plans from the Base scenario. The fourth panel reports average claims by metal tier and on average
across all enrollees.

Notes: Table reports the change in annual per-capita social welfare for each scenario relative to the Base (or ACA)
scenario. In scenario (1), we eliminate inertia and allow consumers to choose a new plan, but keep premiums for each
scenario the same as in the Base scenario. In scenarios (2) through (8), we simulate combinations of 3 changes: (1)
eliminating inertia; (2) repealing risk adjustment; and (3) changing the market structure from oligopoly to perfect
competition. The first panel defines each of the scenarios. The second panel reports the change in annual per-capita
consumer surplus, firm profit, government spending (including premium subsidies, cost sharing reductions,
individual mandate penalties, and uncompensated care), and total social welfare relative to the Base scenario.

Notes: Table reports the sensitivity (as measured by the percentage of inertia  that is considered to be a choice error)
of the change in annual per-capita consumer surplus and social welfare for each scenario relative to the Base (or
ACA) scenario. In scenario (1), we eliminate inertia and allow consumers to choose a new plan, but keep premiums
for each scenario the same as in the Base scenario. In scenarios (2) through (8), we simulate combinations of 3
changes: (1) eliminating inertia; (2) repealing risk adjustment; and (3) changing the market structure from oligopoly
to perfect competition. The first panel defines each of the scenarios. The second and third panels report the change in
annual per-capita consumer surplus and social welfare, respectively, relative to the Base scenario.

Notes: Table summarizes weighted average premiums using four different sets of markets shares: (1) market shares
under the base case/ACA (panel 1); (2) market shares that allow consumers to choose a new plan in the same metal
tier as they chose in the base case; (3) market shares that allow consumers to choose any new plan, but not forgo
insurance; and (4) market shares that allow consumers to choose a new plan or forgo insurance (panel 4). The
premiums in the bottom panel are the same as the premiums in Table A2.

Notes: Table reports the impact on premiums, coverage, and claims for each scenario. Scenarios Base and (2) are the
same as in Table A2. In scenarios (9) and (10), we simulate eliminating inertia and converting the ACA's endogenous
subsidy to an exogenous subsidy. In scenarios (11) and (12), we simulate eliminating inertia and churn. The first
panel defines each of the scenarios. The second panel summarizes enrollee-weighted average unsubsidized premiums
by metal level, insurer, and plan network type. The bottom two rows of the second panel show overall
enrollee-weighted average premiums ("Average") and subsidized average premiums ("Subsidized Avg."). The third
panel shows total enrollment, the percentage of consumers enrolled in coverage, and market shares by metal level.
The final row of the third panel indicates the percentage of consumers who switched plans from the Base scenario.
The fourth panel reports average claims by metal tier and on average across all enrollees.

Notes: Table reports the change in annual per-capita social welfare for each scenario relative to the Base (or ACA)
scenario. Scenarios Base and (2) are the same as in Table A2. In scenarios (9) and (10), we simulate eliminating
inertia and converting the ACA's endogenous subsidy to an exogenous subsidy. In scenarios (11) and (12), we
simulate eliminating inertia and churn. The first panel defines each of the scenarios. The second panel reports the
change in monthly per-capita consumer surplus, firm profit, government spending (including premium subsidies, cost
sharing reductions, individual mandate penalties, and uncompensated care), and total social welfare relative to the
Base scenario.

Notes: Table reports the impact of inertia and provider networks on monthly premiums, coverage, monthly average
claims, and annual per-capita welfare. These simulations were run on a subset of the data because provider network
data are missing for some plans. Scenario Base* reports the observed data for the non-missing plans. The first
counterfactual scenario reports the complete elimination of inertia, based on demand estimation with network
inclusivity. The second counterfactual scenario reports the elimination of inertia except the portion linked to network
inclusivity.
