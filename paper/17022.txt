The Quantification of Systemic Risk and Stability: New Methods and Measures

                                              ABSTRACT

We address the question of the prediction of large failures, busts, or system collapse, and the necessary
concepts related to risk quantification, minimization and management. Answering this question requires
a new approach since predictions using standard financial techniques and statistical distributions fail
to predict or anticipate crises. The key points are that financial markets, systems, trading and manoeuvres
are not just about money, debt, stocks, instruments and assets but reflect the actions and motivations
of humans, which includes the presence or absence of learning effects. Therefore we have the possibility
of failures or rare or low frequency events due to human involvement. The rare or unknown event
is directly due to human influence, and reflects both learning and risk taking, with the presence of
the finite and persistent human error contribution while taking or exposed to risk. This presence of
humans in the marketplace explains the failure of present purely statistical methods to correctly estimate,
predict or determine the onset of financial crises, busts and collapses.

In this essay, we unify the concepts for predicting financial systemic risk with the general theory for
outcomes, trends and measures already derived for other technical and social systems with human
involvement. We replace words and qualitative reasoning with measures and quantitative predictions.
The paper is therefore written with an introductory section devoted to the measures relevant to risk
prediction in other modern technological systems; and is then extended and applied specifically to
risk prediction for financial and business systems. The resulting measures also provide useful guidance
for risk governance.

1. The Risk Measures and Assumptions


Financial markets do not just involve money and statistics; just like all other modern systems
they include people. Therefore, to understand and predict markets it is essential to understand
people, predicting their actions, mistakes, skills, decisions, responses, learning and motivation.
To understand people we must explicitly include their learned and unlearnt behavior(s) with
experience and risk exposure. This is what we attempt here, based on what has been learnt from
other systems data. We treat all outcomes such as failures, crises, busts and collapses as
occurring with some probability, and that these adverse or unwelcome events reflect the inherent
stability characteristics of financial markets. As noted by a well known investor [1]: “Since
markets are unstable, there are systemic risks in addition to risks affecting individual market
participants…Participants may ignore these systemic risks…but regulators cannot.”
   We wish to make a failure prediction, using objective measures for risk and risk exposure,
since all homo-technological systems have failures and we learn from them. The past outcomes
for all homo-technological systems (industrial, transportation, production facilities) show clear
evidence of trends, and the failures, busts and crises are due to both known and unknown causes
and may be “rare” or “unlikely”.
   Failure to predict failures is due to the improper and incomplete treatment of human error,
learning and risk taking as part of the overall system. Traditional risk analysis and prediction
techniques do not explicitly include the dynamic variability due to the inherent human
characteristics embedded in and inseparable from the system. All major events and disasters,
especially financial ones, include the dominant contribution not only from individual mistakes,
but also management failures and corporate-wide and regulatory errors and blunders. Risk is a
measure of our uncertainty, and that uncertainty is determined by the probability of error. We
must also estimate and predict risk that also includes the unknown or rare event.
   We try to find a dynamic objective measure that would actually anticipate instability, thus
allowing predicting the onset of failure or large excursions (i.e. hence managing that risk and its
consequences – equivalent to “emergency preparedness”). In the popular finance articles, the risk
mitigation process seems to be referred to as “pricking bubbles”, and traditionally involves some
kinds of ad-hoc debt, credit and trading limitations and/or restraints. These types of regulation or

Journal, 2010.


reactions are very much a posteriori and case-by-case, but are neither predictive nor general. As
noted for risk in Nanotechnology: “the real issue is how to regulate in the face of uncertainty”
[2]. Our work suggests that learning is effective as a risk management and predictive tool, but
only if we have adopted the “correct” risk exposure and uncertainty measures which we now
attempt to determine.
   Obviously, as humans, we learn from experience, both good and bad. We also take risks and
must make mistakes in order to improve. A universal curve is derived for both collective and
individual learning trends, naturally including the inevitability of outcomes and risk. Based on
our work studying and analyzing over 200 years of real data on and for risk in technological,
medical, industrial and financial systems, five measures are presented and discussed for the
objective measure of risk, failure probability and risk exposure. Correct measure(s) for
experience enable the prediction and uncertainty estimation for the entire range of rare, repeat
and unknown outcomes (e.g., major industrial disasters, facility accidents and explosions, every
day auto accidents, aircraft crashes, financial busts and market collapses).
   We also introduce and present the unifying concept of risk and uncertainty derived from the
information entropy as a quantitative measure of randomness and disorder. We show how this
allows comparative risk estimation and the discerning of insufficient learning. Since these risk
measures and learning trends have been largely derived from data including the financial arena,
we show how to generalize these to include the presence of market pressures, financial issues
and risk measures. We define and present the bases, analyses and results for new risk measures
for the quantitative predictions of risk exposure, failure and collapse using relevant experience
including:
    a) Universal Learning (ULC), similar to the Black-Scholes concept;
    b) Risk Ratios (RR) and exposure, as derived from empirical hazard curves;
    c) Repeat Event Predictions (REP) or ‘never happening again’, equivalent to birthday
        matching and re-occurring echoes;
    d) Rare and Unknown Outcome occurrences (UU), as in the black swan concept;
    e) System and Organizational Stability (SOS) or resilience criteria, using the information
        entropy concept.

Journal, 2010.


   We provide quantified examples for production processes, transportation losses, major
hazards and financial exposure. These new concepts also provide the probability of success, the
emergence of order and the understanding and quantification of risk perception. Note that these
measures replace and do not include in any way the standard financial techniques utilizing net
value, value at risk, or variations about or from the mean.
   In our analysis we assume financial markets are just another homo-technological system and
the past failure rate(s) inform the future, and that the inherent apparent randomness and chaos
conveys and contains information. We avoid using traditional statistical approaches where past
failure frequencies define invariant future failure probability distributions. We also explicitly
avoid the impossible modeling of all the internal details of assets and trading, and avoid any
filtering of data; we consider only emergent trends at system level based on what we know. We
treat risk as determined by experience or risk exposure, thus avoiding using comfortable calendar
time intervals (i.e., as in daily, hourly, monthly, quarterly or annual reporting) as markets operate
according to their experience. As in medical and other systems, this risk measure is often
determined by the dynamic accumulated “volume” which also provides the learning opportunity.
Our research approach is predicated on extrapolating known and unknown past failure rates
based on experience and future dynamic risk exposure, and is tested against data, so the concept
and measures of risk and stability are truly falsifiable.


2 Risk: How we learn from experience and what we know about risk prediction


Risk is measured by our uncertainty, and the measure of uncertainty is probability.
   The definition, use and concepts of risk adopted in the present paper utilizes measures for
risk exposure and for uncertainty that encompass and are consistent with that proposed before in
the financial literature [3]:
“Risk entails two essential components:
         Exposure, and
         Uncertainty
Risk, then, is exposure to a proposition of which one is uncertain.”
   What is the risk of system failure? What is the measure for exposure? What is the measure of
uncertainty? To answer those questions we must understand how and why systems fail, and show
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


how to make a prediction, noting that while financial systems constitute a distinct discipline with
its own terminology, they actually must behave just like all others that are prone to the all-to-
common vagaries, actions and motivations of humans. We use probability and entropy to
quantify uncertainty; and use past and future experience to quantify exposure.
   We first review what is known and not known about predicting and managing risk in
industrial, energy, transportation, nuclear, medical, and manufacturing systems, and the
associated risk exposure measures. We address the question of the predictability of a large
systems failure, or collapse, and the necessary concepts related to risk quantification and system
stability that are emerging from the physical sciences, cognitive psychology, information theory
and multiple industrial arenas that are relevant to current financial and economic market and
stability concerns. We have defined the risk of any outcome (being a proposition of which one is
uncertain) as caused by uncertainty, and that the measure of the uncertainty is probability, p. We
attempt to use some of these risk concepts, learning and applications from mainly operational
systems to inform risk prediction for financial systems.
   Risks are due to the probability/possibility of an adverse event, outcome, or accident. Simply
put, we learn from our mistakes, correcting our errors along the way. We all know that we have
had a serious failure of the financial and investments markets due to excessive risk exposure and
losses. The key observation that markets are random, which is confirmed by sampling
distributions, but we also know that conventional statistics of normal distributions (such as used
in VaR and CoVaR techniques) do not work when applied to predicting dynamically changing
accident, event and outcome trends [4, 5]. So while the instantaneous behaviour appears to be
random and hence unpredictable, the failure to predict is due to the failure to properly include
the systematic influence of human element, which is non-linear, dynamic and varies with
experience and risk exposure.
   In industrial operations, the cardinal rule of operation applicable to any system is due to
Howlett [6] which is:
“Humans must remain in control of their machinery at all times. Any time the machine operates
without the knowledge, understanding and assent of its human controllers, the machine is out of
control.”
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


   Further the limits to operation are defined by a Safe Operating Envelope, with limits that
include margins and uncertainty that define “guarantees” for the avoidance of failure. Risk
management is then employed to protect or mitigate the consequences of failures that might
occur anyway [6]. These well-tried concepts are all translatable to and usable in financial
systems, just as they are for industrial systems, since all systems include human involvement and
hence involve the uncertainty due to risk taking and learning.
   We have previously shown that the dominant contribution to all management and system
failures, outcomes and accidents is from that same inextricable and inseparable human
involvement. Be they airplane, auto, train or stock market crashes, the same learning principles
also apply. We have shown that to quantify risk we must include the learning behaviour,
quantifying outcomes rates and probabilities due to our experience from human decision making
and involvement with modern technological and social systems, including industrial,
transportation, chemical, financial and manufacturing technologies [5, 7]. These ideas and
concepts include naturally not only the collective system (e.g., a bank, railway, power plant or
airline) but also the individual human reliability (e.g., an investor, driver, manager or pilot).
   What we know is that provided we have prior (outcome or failure) data we can now predict
accurately the future outcomes rates, and define the risk exposure based on the past known and
the future expected experience. That we can learn from experience is what all the data show, and
that experience is the past risk exposure we have all so painfully acquired as a human society.
The experience measure is a surrogate for our very human risk exposure, of how long, how
many, how much we have been exposed to the chance of an outcome, or to the risk of an error.
   The prediction of the future rate of failures or outcomes is given from the Learning
Hypothesis, being simply on the principle that humans naturally learn from their mistakes, by
correcting and unlearning during and from the accumulated experience – both good and bad. The
experience – however it is defined or measured – represents also not only the learning
opportunity, it also is a measure of the risk exposure. The probability of error, accident,
catastrophe or mistake, p, is determined by the failure rate, which derives from the number of
either a successful or a failed (unsuccessful) outcome. The rate of outcomes decreases
exponentially with experience, in the form of a Universal Learning Curve (ULC). Over 200 years
of experience and millions of prior, past or historic data allow the ULC to be defined. The

validation derives from massive datasets of both frequent and rare events [5, 7], and now
includes multiple sources and outcomes, with the historical time spans covering the past 200
years with major data available from the last -50 or more years.
   We analysed auto passenger deaths, railway injuries, coal mining deaths, oil spills at sea,
commercial airline near misses, and recreational boating deaths.
   Globally, the learning data set we have amassed now contains multiple technologies
worldwide: coal and gold mining; 20 million pulmonary disease deaths; cataract operations;
infant heart surgeries; the international total of rocket launches; pilot deaths in Australia; train
derailments and danger signals passed on railways; and notably the anti-missile interception and
destruction effectiveness over England of German V1 bombs in World War II. Cost data on
specific unit price variations with increasing output or commercial sales demonstrate the learning
trends and so-called “progress curves” for manufacturing are observed for millions of units
produced in factories and production lines.
   The millions of outcome data analyzed are well represented by the Learning Hypothesis [5,
7], which states that the rate of decrease of the outcome or failure rate, λ, with experience units,
τ, is proportional to that same rate. Thus, very simply, the differential equation is the
proportionality:


(dλ/dτ) – λ.


   The above cases and data sets show variations in the learning constant: when learning trends
are present an average learning rate “constant” of proportionality value of k~3, is reasonable
(see also Figure 1).
   Systems exist that do not show significant learning, as measured by decrease or declining loss
and error trends, are those where the continuing influence and reliance on the human element and
historic practices overrides massive changes in technology and the robustness of system design.

3 Individual Actions: Predictable and Unpredictable


It is reasonable to ask how the behaviour of entire systems reflect the individual interactions
within them, and vice versa, including the myriads of managers, accountants, traders, investors,
speculators, lawyers, and regulators that make up a financial market or system. This link is
between the unobserved multitudinous and microscopic interactions and the observed
macroscopic and emergent system trends, distributions, responses and outcomes. For just
individual actions (as opposed to system outcomes), data are available in the psychological
literature from many thousands of individual human subject task and learning trials. These trials
have established the rate of skill acquisition is described by so-called Laws of Practice. We have
shown [5] that these Laws are entirely consistent with the ULC for entire systems, have the same
learning constant (or K value) with repeated trials. Thus, the data show that external system-
learning behaviour mirrors the internal learning trends of the individuals within. The predicted
probability of error also agrees with published nuclear plants events, simulator tests and system
recovery action times. Probabilities for power restoration for power losses at over 100 US
nuclear power plants, are also in agreement; as is the power blackout repair probability for
customers over a period of several days.
   In all these data, we have, n, outcomes occurring in some experience, τ. The resulting form of
the learning curve is shown in Figure 1, which is a log-log plot with arbitrary units on each axis
of the rate of the undesirable errors and outcomes, dn/dτ, versus the accumulated experience,
which is a surrogate for the risk exposure during actual system operation. This risk exposure or
experience measure, τ, is unique for each and every system: for aircraft is the number of flights
flown; for railways the train-miles travelled; for ships the shipping-years afloat; for
manufacturing the number of units produced; for human errors in decision making, skill
acquisition and response time it is the number of repetitive trials, etc., etc.
   As we increase our experience and risk exposure, as both individuals and systems, the event
or outcome rate depends on whether, either collectively and/or individually, we follow a learning
curve of decreasing risk or not, or we are somewhere in between. In Figure 1, the line labelled
“learning curve” (from the Minimum Error Rate Equation) is the desirable ULC, where learning
occurs to rapidly reduce the rate. This is the most likely path, and is also that of the least risk as
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau

Journal, 2010.


we progress form being a “novice” with little experience to becoming an “expert with
progressively more exposure and experience. There are no “zero defects”; there is always a
finite, non-zero residual rate of error, λm, so say all the world’s data. The equation that describes
the learning curve is an exponential with experience1:


Failure rate, λ(τ)=Minimum rate, λm+(Initial rate, λ0–Minimum rate, λm) x exp–(kτ)


      If we simply replace the rate, λ, by the value or specific cost, C, and change the sign, the
MERE turns out to be identical in form to that of the trending part of the Black-Scholes equation
for portfolio cost and value. For manufacturing or production there is a “tail” of non-zero value
that corresponds to the minimum possibly achievable, Cm, in any competitive market system.
Reducing cost with increasing “volume”, or units produced, thus also holds for manufacturing
and production cost decreases, just as “patient volume” does for improving individual surgical
skill, thus reducing inadvertent deaths with increasing patient count (being practice or trials). The
difference is that in these cases the experience parameter, τ, is conventionally taken as either time
(for stock or equity values variation) or accumulated units manufactured (for production prices
changes), and a key question is what measure to adopt in financial systems for the relevant
experience and risk exposure.

 Figure 1 The ULC and Constant Risk Lines; Failure rates with increasing experience and/or risk exposure.

   Since Figure 1 is a log-log plot (scale units are factors of ten on each axis), any line of
constant risk is then a straight line of slope minus one, where the event rate, , times experience,
, is the constant number of events, n. Hence,  = n/, and for the first or rare event, n = 1, which
is the dashed “constant risk” line for any first or rare event shown in Figure 1. The rate decreases
inversely with the risk exposure or experience, so importantly, at little of no experience or little
learning, the initial rate is given by λ0 = 1/τ, which is exactly the form of the rare events as
derived from commercial aircraft crashes. As we shall see this risk path is the initial rate and also
produces the “fat tail” that worries and confounds conventional risk and value analysts. We call
this prediction a White Elephant when it underestimates the risk, since it has no value as a
prediction.
   In terms of probabilities as a measure of risk, instead of rates, the above equation can be
integrated to yield an expression that in words implies:
   Risk exposure probability is due to the minimum risk plus the initial risk exposure less the
reduction in risk due to learning.

Journal, 2010.


   For any real, not hypothetical system the minimum achievable failure rate does not appear to
change and has not changed for over 200 years, depending solely on our experience and risk
exposure measure for a given system. So conversely, the systemic risk (the probability of failure
or a bust) is dependent on the risk exposure measure.


4 The Seven Commonalities of Rare and Terrible Events: Risk Ratios and Predictions


What do large disasters, crises, busts and collapses in financial systems like the Great Crash of
2008 [8] have in common with the other major events? These have happened in multiple
technologies and industries, such as in industries as diverse as aerospace (Columbia and
Challenger Shuttle losses) [9], nuclear (Davis-Besse plant vessel corrosion) [10], oil (Texas City
refinery explosion) [11], chemical (Toulouse ammonia plant explosion) [12] and transportation
(the Quebec overpass collapse) [13]. The common features, or as we may call them the Seven
Themes, cover the aspects of causation, rationalization, retribution, and prevention that ad
nauseum are all too familiar:
   First, these major losses, failures and outcomes all share the same very same and very human
Four Phases or warning signs: the unfolding of the precursors and initiating circumstances; the
confluence of events and circumstances in unexpected ways; the escalation where the
unrecognised unknowingly happens; and, afterwards, denial and blame shift before final
acceptance.
   Second, as always, these incidents all involved humans, were not expected but clearly
understandable as due to management emphasis on production and profit rather than safety and
risk, from gaps in the operating and management requirements, and from lax inspection and
inadequate regulations.
   Third, these events have all caused a spate of media coverage, retroactive soul-searching,
“culture” studies and surveys, regulation review, revisions to laws, guidelines and procedures,
new limits and reporting legislation, which all echo perfectly the present emphasis on limits to
the “bonus culture” and “risk taking” that are or were endemic in certain financial circles.
   Fourth, the failures were so-called “rare events” and involved obvious dynamic human lapses
and errors, and as such do not follow the usual statistical rules and laws that govern large quasi-
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


static samples, or the multitudinous outcome distributions (like normal, lognormal and Weibull)
that dominate conventional statistical thinking, but clearly require analysis and understanding of
the role of human learning, experience and skill in making mistakes and taking decisions.
   Fifth, these events all involve humans operating inside and/or with a system, and contain real
information about what we know about what we do not know, being the unexpected, the
unknown, the rare and low occurrence rate events, with large consequences and highlighting our
own inadequate predictive capability, so that to predict we must use Bayesian-type likelihood
estimation.
   Sixth, there is the learning paradox, that if we do not learn we have more risk, but to learn
perversely we must have the very events we seek to avoid, which also have a large and finite risk
of re-occurrence; and we ultimately have more risk from events we have not had the chance to
learn about, being the unknown, rare or unexpected.
   Seventh, these events were all preventable but only afterwards  with 20/20 hindsight soul-
searching and sometimes massive inquiries reveal what was so obvious time after time; the same
human fallibilities, performance lapses, supervisory and inspections gaps, bad habits, inadequate
rules and legislation, management failures, and risk taking behaviours that all should have been
and were self-evident, and were uncorrected.
   We claim to learn from these each time, perhaps introducing corrective actions and lessons
learned, thus hopefully reducing the outcome rate or the chance of re-occurrence. All of these
aspects were also evident in the financial failure of 2008, in the collapse of major financial
institutions and banks. These rare events are worth examining further as to their repeat frequency
and market failure probability: recessions have happened before but 2008 was supposedly
somewhat different, as it was reportedly due to unbridled systemic risk, and uncontrolled
systemic failure in credit and real estate sectors. This failure of risk management in financial
markets led to the analysis that follows, extending the observations, new thinking and methods
developed for understanding other technological systems to the prediction and management of
so-called “systemic risk” in financial markets and transactions. We treat and analyze these
financial entities as “systems” which function and “behave” by learning from experience just like
any other system, where we observe the external outcomes and failures due to the unobserved

   The past outcome data provide the past failure rate. To determine the future risk, we must
distinguish between the past (statistically, the known prior) and the future (statistically, the
unknown posterior). So what does the past tell us about the future? To predict an outcome, any
event, we must go beyond what we know, the prior knowledge. Somehow we have to project
ourselves into an unknown future, with some measure of confidence and uncertainty, based on
both our rational thoughts and our irrational fears, using what we know about what we do not
know. This leads us into the somewhat controversial arena of prediction using statistical
reasoning, a subject addressed in great detail elsewhere [14].
   The conditional future is dependent, albeit with uncertainty, on the past, as per Bayes
reasoning [14, 15]. The probability or chance of an unknown event is dependent on something
called the likelihood, which itself is uncertain but provides a rational framework for projection.
The likelihood itself is inversely dependent on the prior number of outcomes, and if there are
none so far, we just have the Bayesian failure rate of the past based on our (known) experience to
date.
   The Likelihood formally adjusts the past, prior or known probability and produces the future
or Posterior probability. So conditionally dependent on what we already know we know has
already happened in the past, according to the thinking of the Reverend Thomas Bayes (1763)
and of Edwin Jaynes’ (2004) rigorous analysis:


   Future chance (posterior probability, p(P)) = Past or prior probability, p, times Likelihood


   The Likelihood multiplier, p(L), whatever it is and however derived (by physical argument,
guess, judgment, evidence, probabilistic reasoning, mathematical rigour or data analysis) is the
conditioning factor which always alters the past whatever and however it is estimated. Even if
the past was indeed “normal” the likelihood can even change the future to include rare events
and unknown unknowns.
   The risk ratio (RR) can then be defined as ratio of the future posterior probability, p(P), of an
adverse event (accident, outcome, error, or failure in the future) to some known past or present
failure probability, p(τ), based on the prior accumulated experience, as a function of the future
risk exposure or experience, or
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.




RR = p(P)/p(τ).


   From the above Bayesian equation this risk ratio is equivalent to defining the Likelihood,
p(L), where for low probabilities or rare events the posterior, p(P), itself is numerically very
nearly equal to the rate of events, or the failure rate, p(P)~f(τ)~λ. This result follows directly
from the so-called “generalized Bayes formula” [16, 5] that defines the Likelihood as the ratio of
the probability of outcomes occurring in the next experience interval to the probability that
outcomes have already occurred during the past experience.
   So for low probability events, outcomes or disasters (p(τ)<<1), the Risk Ratio becomes
simply the future predicted by the past since:


RR = p(P)(1-p(τ))/p(τ) ~p(P)/p(τ) ~λ(τ)/p(τ)


which is the ratio of the known past rate and prior probability.
   We show the Risk Ratio, RR, prediction for rare events with little learning (k~0.0001) in
Figure 2 versus a series of curves (k from 0.1 – 0.001) representing slow to negligible learning,
where the Risk Ratio clearly has a slope varying as, 1/τ. The key observation is that the future
risk predicted by the risk ratio, RR, still does not fall much below ~10-5 at large risk exposure,
which corresponds to the plateau, or “fat tail”, caused by the lowest attainable but finite and non-
zero failure rate that is observed for any system anywhere and everywhere in the world.

                      So what then is the resulting Posterior probability, p(P) in the future? It is shown in Figure 2
for a series of cases with varying learning or knowledge acquisition from increasing risk
exposure or accumulated experience. These cases are represented by the range of values shown
for the learning “constant”, k, where progressively lower values mean less and less learning. As
can be seen, if learning is negligible so, k, is very small (say, 0.0001) then the event probability
decreases almost as a straight line of constant risk, 1/τ, as it should; for larger k values a distinct
kink or plateau occurs due to the presence of the always finite, non-zero failure rate due to the
human involvement.


5 Predicting Rare Events: Fat Tails, Black Swans and White Elephants


Colloquially, a black swan is an unexpected and/or rare event, one that dramatically changes
prior thinking and expectations.
                      Because rare events do not happen often, they are also widely misunderstood. Perhaps even
previously unobserved, they are called “unknown unknowns” [17], or “Black Swans” [4]
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau

Journal, 2010.


precisely because they do not follow the same “rules” when having many or frequent events.
Think of the space shuttle crashes we have already seen, the global collapse of financial
companies that have occurred, or an aircraft apparently falling from the sky as it did recently
over the Atlantic. They are the things we may or may not have seen before, but certainly did not
expect to happen. So when they do happen, perhaps even when being thought not possible, they
do not apparently follow the trends, expectations, rules or knowledge we have built up for more
frequent happenings.
   There is no assured, easy or obvious “alarm”, indicator or built in warning signal, derivable
by adjusting “filters” or data smoothing techniques. As noted in [18], “Whether these alarms are
deemed informative depends on their association with subsequent busts. The choice of a
threshold above which an alarm is raised presents an important trade-off between the desire for
some warning of an impending bust and the costs associated with a false alarm. Nonetheless,
even the best indicator failed to raise an alarm one to three years ahead of roughly one-half of
all busts since 1985. Thus, asset price busts are difficult to predict.” This is a 50% or even
chance, which are no better odds than just tossing a coin.
   In statistical language and usage, the rare events do not follow or fit in with the usual
distributions of previous or expected occurrences. The frequency and/or probability of
occurrence lies somewhere outside the usual many expected multiples of the standard deviation
for any sample distribution. We may not even have a distribution of prior data anyway. In fact,
Taleb [4] spends a considerable part of his popular book “The Black Swan” discussing,
discounting and dismissing the use of so-called “normal distributions” such as the Gaussian or
bell-shaped curves simply because they do not and cannot account for rare events even though
many humans may think that they do. Also rare events, like all events, as we have said, are
always due to some apparently unforeseen combination of circumstance, conditions, and
combination of things that we did not foresee, and all include the errors in our human made and
managed systems (the Seven Themes).
   By citing many empirical cases, Taleb [4] also further argues forcibly that this “scale”
variation destroys any and all credibility of using any Gaussian or “normal” distribution for
prediction. In that limited sense, he is right, as conventional sampling statistics based on fitting
to some “normal” distributions using many observations is totally inapplicable for low

Journal, 2010.


probability, one-of-a-kind rare, so-far-unobserved or unknown events. To make a true prediction
we must still use what we know about what we do not know, and we now know that the relevant
“scale” is in fact our experience or risk exposure, which is what we have anyway, and is the
basis for what we know or do not know about everything.
      In Figure 3, we show the one-on-one head-to-head comparison of a normal (Gaussian) bell-
shaped distribution2, compared to the reality of learning variations as they affect probability: it is
clear that the Gaussian or normal distribution seriously underestimates risk, in this case the
probability of an outcome, for large experience. This inability of standard methods to predict the
extrema of the distributions is itself is well known- but less well known is that the probability
increase or plateau is due to the human element.
      So the future chance, or posterior, of any event, even of an unknown unknown, is in fact
given by estimating the Likelihood, p(L), something Taleb does not discuss at all. Instead, the
concept of “scalability” was invoked, which we have now shown and will demonstrate is
actually the same thing as a conditional probability of whether it will occur, but disguised as
another White Elephant.

    The example Gaussian (or normal) distribution shown in Figure 3 is p(P) = 23exp(-0.5 (τ+290)/109)2, and was
fitted to the MERE learning curve using the commercial statistical software routine TableCurve 2D.

                     The impact of rare events can vary, particularly because they were somehow disruptive,
unexpected or not predicted. So impacts can be large, as for a financial crisis that affects
everyone’s credit or bank account, [4]; or they can be negligible because they do not affect the
overall industry but only the participants, as for a commercial airplane crash. But both do not
happen very often. Because events occur randomly, we find it difficult to predict when and
where they will happen, and can do so only with uncertainty. So with rare events we are more
uncertain as we have had limited learning opportunity, and we fear the unknown. The risk we
determine or sense can be defined as the uncertainty in the chance of such an event happening. It
is perceived by us, individually and collectively, as being a high risk or not based on how we feel
about it, and have been taught, trained, experienced, learnt, or indoctrinated. The randomness is
then inherent in the learning processes, in the myriad of learnt and unlearnt patterns, neural
firings, legal rules, acquired skills, written procedures, unconscious decisions, and conscious
interactions that any and all humans have in any and all systems. Perversely, only by having such
randomness, learning, skill, trial and error can order and learning patterns emerge. We create

order from disorder, learning as we go from experience and risk exposure, discerning the right
and unlearning the wrong behaviours and skills. So a rare Black Swan even if of major impact is
indeed a White Elephant of no intrinsic value unless and only if we are learning.
    We need to know what we do not know. We cannot know what happens inside our brains and
see the how the trillions of neural patterns, pathways and possibilities are wired, learnt,
interconnected, rationalized and unlearned. We cannot know the millions of things that any
group of people will talk about, learn, exchange, review, revise, argue, debate, reject, use and
abuse, each and every day, 24/7. We cannot know all about how a machine or system will
behave when subjected to the whims of inadequate design, poor maintenance, extreme failure
modes, external damage, and poor or unsafe operation. What we do know is that, because we are
human, we do learn from our mistakes: this is the Learning Hypothesis [19, 20, 7]. The rate at
which we make errors, produce outcomes, and cause events reduces both as we gain experience
and if and as we learn. We make mistakes because we are human: the fat tail, the rare event, is
because we are human. If and as we gain experience, this is equivalent to increasing our risk
exposure too. The risk increases whether by driving on the road, by trading stocks and
investments, or by building and operating a technological system like a ship, train, rocket or
aircraft.
    Consistent with the principles of natural selection, those who do not learn, those who do not
adapt and survive, are the failures and extinctions of history, overtaken by the unexpected and
mistakes, the errors and the Black Swans of the past.


6 Failure to Predict Failure: Scaling Laws and the Risk Plateau


What do we know about what we do not know? We know that the four categories of knowns and
unknowns are the Rumsfeld quartet:
Known knowns  what is expected and already observed (in the past)
Known unknowns  unexpected but observed outcomes (past outcomes)
Unknown knowns  expected and not yet observed (in the future)
Unknown unknowns  unexpected and not yet observed (future outcomes or rare events)

Journal, 2010.


      This is analogous to drawing both outcomes and non-outcomes from Bernoulli’s urn [5], and
the probability of a rare (unknown) event is determined if all we do is assume that it exists. Thus,
we have turned a Black Swan into a White Elephant  the fact that we have not observed it, do
not know if it exists, but can rationally discuss it allows the fear, dread and risk perception to be
quantified. This is precisely what Taleb recommends  taking precautions against what it is we
do not know about what we do now know.
      We have defined a risk ratio, RR, which depends on the prior failure rate. But for a rare or
unknown event the posterior probability of an unknown unknown, p(U,U) which has not
happened yet is finite and is given by analogy to the “case of zero failures” [21]. We can then
obtain the estimate for knowing the posterior (future) probability of the unknowable as [5]:


P(U,U) ~ (1/Uτ2) exp-U,


where, U, is some constant of proportionality. This order of magnitude estimate shows a clear
trend of the probability decreasing with increasing experience as an inverse square power law, τ-
2
    . For every factor of ten increase in experience measured in some tau units, τ, the posterior
probability falls by one hundred times. It does not matter if we do not know the exact numbers:
the trend is the key for decision making and risk taking. The rational choice and implication is to
trust experience and not to be afraid of the perceived Unknown.
      The risk of an unknown unknown therefore decreases with our increasing experience, or risk
exposure. So the White Elephant is precisely the case of little or no learning corresponding
exactly to a scaled probability inverse law, i.e., p(P) = n/τ, where the number of events, n, is one
(n=1), simply because it is that first and rare event that was never previously observed or known.
So the probability, p, of any single rare event is always, 1/τ, the inverse of (one divided by) the
exposure or experience measure, or “scale”. As shown before in Figure 2, this is also a measure
of the Risk Ratio, RR, and is equivalent numerically to the failure rate, λ. So also shown in
Figure 4 are the so-called “scalable” or pure “power” laws discussed by Taleb [4], where the
probability is assumed to fall as the more general inverse power law, p(P) = 1/τα.
      Corresponding to the prior and the posterior variations without significant learning, for
illustration, the “slope” parameter, α, is often taken as lying in the range between 1 and 2 which
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau

Journal, 2010.


assumed values nicely cover the “true” curves for novice or zero experience, varying as, 1/τ, and
for “unknown unknowns” varying as, 1/τ2. But these are “constant risk” lines that do not give the
detailed shape or slope variations since they do not reflect the learning opportunity and the finite
non-zero risk rate. Basically the incorrect inexorable decrease in risk predicted by a scale law is
offset by the inevitability of risk due to the human element, causing the “fat tail” or plateau in the
probability graph. At a future (posterior) probability of order p<10-5 the line intersects the
learning curves, the rare event or Black Swan truly becomes a White Elephant, being of less
value or lower risk than the actual and hence of no predictive value.

of economics (known as an “elasticity”) when fitting the exponent to price or response time
reduction [22]; in cognitive psychology (known as a “law of practice”) when applied to trials that
constitute repetitive learning [23]; and in damage estimation for industrial failures and collapses
[24]. This general “power law” form also fits social trends, such as word usage, books sold,
website hits, telephone calls, and city populations, leading Taleb [4] to further argue that this

Journal, 2010.


form represents true “scalability” which we can now recognise as the fundamental connection to
learning and risk exposure. Arbitrary adjustment of the exponent, α, in economics, social science
and cognitive psychology is an attempt to actually account for and fit what we observe, but
without trying to understand why the exponent is not unity nor placing limits on the
extrapolations made beyond the known data used for the original fits.
     The exponent is roughly constant only over limited ranges of data, otherwise it fails in
extrapolating magnitude or trend [5]. In fact in statistics, this form of inverse “power law” type
of relation is often known as a Pareto distribution3, and Woo [25] explicitly further cautions that:
“parametrizing a natural hazard loss curve cannot be reliably reduced to a statistical analysis of
loss data, e.g., fitting a Pareto curve: damaging events are too infrequent for this to be sound.”
     In fact, this failure to predict may even explain the proven poor capability of many economic
models that by using a constant “elasticity” between price and demand and extrapolating we now
know from data do not predict well! We now know and can see from Figure 4 that the exponent
is not constant and the variation in reality is due to the presence and effects of learning, with the
larger exponent values and steeper slope encompassing the variation between the learning curves
(Figure 3). This variation represents uncertainty and constitutes the measure of risk if taken as a
technique for making investment decisions.
     Figures 3 and 4 contain much useful information. Not only are the trends with learning clear,
there is the tendency for risk to be smaller initially with more learning; and greater at larger
experience due to the forming of a “plateau” of nearly constant risk (a Fat Tail, or potential
Black Swan). If we neglect this large human contribution and effect at large risk exposure then,
Pareto lines, power laws, “normal” and log-normal distributions become White Elephants of
little value, as being extrapolated they underestimate the risk. A similar argument can be made
for not using results from static or equilibrium VaR and CoVaR techniques (see [4], and the
papers presented at this Conference) which fit standard statistical distributions to financial asset
data and then seek significance in the differences and trends out at the 1-2% “tail”, while
ignoring again the dynamic human contribution and hence unaware of and not accounting for the
systematic existence of the systemic risk plateau.

    Also termed the hyperbolic or power-law distribution, the form given by Woo for natural catastrophes is:
p()=bab/b+1, where a and b are constants, the so-called “location” and “shape” parameters.

   This presence of learning effects explains nicely the actual range of empirical values for the
exponent, α, quoted by Taleb and others of between 1 and 2 - some systems evidently exhibit
more or less initial learning than others as is shown in Figure 4. In the inverse power law
simplification by definition, if there are no events there is and can be no learning. Strictly we
know this is not true, as we also learn something from the many and often irritating non-events,
minor losses and near misses. This so-called incidental learning leads to the other extreme case
of “perfect learning” [5], where the event outcome probability still follows a learning curve until
we have just one event, and then subsequently plummets to zero.
   We stress here, in italics, that the power law form is a natural, simplified limiting variant of
the more general “learning curve”, which naturally then also encompasses the occurrence of
rare events.
   The analysis of risk ratios due to the financial cost of individual events assumes that big
losses or damage occur less often i.e., are rare or lower in frequency. For example, Hanayasu and
Sekine [24] argue that the rate of financial “damage” of events in industry decreases with the
inverse of the damage or loss. So generally the frequency of an event decreases with increasing
cost as the probability density,


dp/dτ ≈ constant / hq+1


   Here, q, is yet another power law exponent chosen to fit some damage data, and is always
such that q>1 so Hanayasu and Sekine assume that it lies in the range 2<q<3. When the slope is
an inverse cube such that, α ~3, there is a very rapid decline. We analyzed this approach [3] and
found the risk ratio, RR, or damage ratio referenced to some initial known value, h0, and
probability, p0, is then given by:


RR = (h/h0) = (p/p0)1/q


   Extrapolation of the fitted line beyond the data range given shows a much faster decrease in
risk ratio than usually observed, or expected from a learning curve with a finite minimum that
flattens out. So the basic problem is that extrapolation of the size of the loss according to this
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau

Journal, 2010.


“power law” (although it is not really a law at all) produces inaccuracy outside the known data
range, does not account for learning, and also does not allow for the finite non-zero contribution
of the human element (the extra “fat tail” shown in Figure 2). We have fitted a MERE curve also
to these damage data, and as a result the forward risk exposure, financial loss or uncertainty is
grossly underestimated because of omitting the human learning element. This is really
uncertainty: we are predicting the variation in how big the losses will be for unknown events,
based on what we know.
   The chance of an unknown unknown or rare event also depends on whether or not you learn!
Conversely, rare events and Black Swans are also simply events for which we have little or no
learning. The argument is then wrong that this type of inverse power variation represents “true”
randomness, where there is no pattern other than that which is “scale” invariant (like fractals). In
fact the variation in probability or risk in reality is all due to whether we have been learning or
not, at what rate we make or have made mistakes both in the past and in the future. The true
natural “scale” for all human-based systemic risk we have shown repeatedly is our experience,
however that is defined and accumulated, as learning is not invariant with risk exposure. What
we know about the unknown is that we are human and remain so, learning as we go.
   For the future unknown experience, the average future failure rate, <λ >, we will observe
over any future risk exposure or operating interval, τ-τ0, is obtained by averaging the varying
failure rate over that same observation or risk exposure interval, so:


                 
          1         0

                         d
       (   0 ) 
  



   Clearly, the apparent average rate also depends on the risk exposure interval, τ-τ0, over which
we start and finish observing, or choose to record outcomes, or happen to be present, or are risk
exposed.
   We can show how these ideas work in practice by comparing to actual data for rare events,
although this is strictly an oxymoron, as if the outcomes occur they are no longer “rare” or
become known unknowns. The data available is the case we have analyzed in detail before [5, 7]
for fatal commercial airline crashes between 1970-2000. The case is relevant as the airline
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


industry is regarded as relatively safe, and having perhaps attained the lowest possible event rate.
Over this 30-year period using modern jets, some 114 commercial passenger airlines
accumulated about 220 million flights, and there were about 270 fatal crashes, excluding hull
losses (plane write-offs) with no deaths. The data show a lack of further learning trends, as
airline crashes attain the lowest rate currently known or achievable of about one per 200,000
flying experience or risk exposure hours. What has actually happened is that because they have
actually become rare events there is an almost constant risk, as shown in Figure 5, where the
fatal crash rate indeed varies inversely as, λ~1/τ, the number of accumulated flights being the
measure of both the learning experience and risk exposure4.
      The analysis shows that the airlines having the least experience have the highest rate per
flight, the airlines overall having descended the learning curve and achieved their lowest possible
“rare” crash rate. So for this case, flights accumulated represent a convenient measure of the risk
exposure and learning “scale”. The only larger interval found is for systems like dams, where
humans are passive and not actively and/or continuously involved in the day-to-day system
performance and operation.




4   The fundamental problem and seeming paradox with using event rate as a measure of risk for rare events is that the
rate and number seemingly fall with increasing experience (not just time), giving an apparent decrease when in fact
the risk of a random outcome is effectively still constant.

   But the relative future risk of a mature technology, as measured by the non-dimensional
posterior outcome rate, is negligible compared to that for new technology. The plunge in the
future prediction, p(P), of the risk at large experience, or the “thin tail” appearing in the end of
the fat tail, is due to the prior probability becoming nearer and nearer to certainty (p→1) at large
enough experience or risk exposure since the failure rate (according to all the world’s known
outcome data) is never, ever zero. Thus, we have found a basis on which to make predictions of
all such rare unknown unknowns, based on the (equally) rare prior outcomes from many
disparate sources.
   We have already recently used the methods and ideas discussed here and in our book [5] to
risk, failure rate and reliability prediction for many important cases. These include human errors
and recovery actions in nuclear power plants [26]; predicting rocket launch failures and space
crew safety for new systems [27]; the time it takes for restoration of power following grid failure
(or “blackout”) [28]; predicting the rate of failure of heat exchanger tubing in new designs [29];

Journal, 2010.


and the quantitative tracking of learning trends (“safety culture”) in management and operation
of large offshore oil and gas facilities [30]; and about 30 other key examples. While each case
has its own fascinating and unique experience and data, all examples and cases can be reduced to
the common learning basis, and all follow the universal laws and rules for the outcomes due to
us, as humans, functioning in modern society and technological systems, whether we know it or
not.


7 The Financial Risk: trends in economic growth rates, failure and stability


The fundamental question is what are the relevant prior data, predictive failure rate and risk
exposure measures in financial and economic systems when including the essential influence of
the human involvement?
   Like other systems with failures and outcomes, there are a lot of financial system data out
there, both nationally and globally, and data are key to our understanding and analysis. What are
the right measures for failure (errors) and experience in financial systems? Can the market
collapse be predicted using these measures? As an exercise in examining those questions, we
explored the publicly available global financial data from the World Bank and the IMF, covering
the years up to the Great Crash or “bust” of 2008. This was widely attributed to the failure of the
credit markets, due to the collateralizing of risky (real estate) debt assets as leveraged securities
in the developed economies and financial markets. The present analysis is to determine the
presence or not of precursors, the evidence or not of learning trends, and prediction of the
probability of failure using the prior data.
   Let us make a financial market system prediction based solely on what we know about other
system failures. According to the data (and as shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4), we have learnt that
there is an apparent fundamental and inherent inability, due to the inseparable involvement of
humans in and with the technological systems, for the posterior (future) probability of an
outcome to occur with a probability of less than p(P) < 10-5. This corresponds to the lowest
observed rate of one outcome or failure in about 100,000 to 200,000 experience or risk exposure
units [5, 7]. If the global financial “market”, including real estate equities and stocks, is now
defined as the relevant system with human involvement, and a trading or business experience of
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


24/7/365 taken as the appropriate risk exposure or experience measure, this implies we may
expect and predict an average “market failure” rate ranging from not less than about once every
ten years and not more than every twenty years. If lack of economic (GWP and/or GDP) growth,
with financial credit and market collapse is taken as a surrogate measure of an outcome or
failure5, there has been apparently four relatively recent “crises” in the World (in about 1981-2,
1992-3, 1997-8 and 2008-9), and five “recessions” in the USA (circa 1972, 1980, 1982, 1990,
and 2008) in the forty-year interval 1970–2010 [8], being an average risk interval of between
eight (nationally) to ten (globally) years. In fact, in the full interval of 1870-2008, the IMF listed
eight globally significant financial crises in those 138 years (the above four listed plus 1873,
1891-1892, 1907-1908, 1929-1931), or ten when including the two World Wars [see 8, Figure
4.1]. All these various crises give an average interval of about one failure somewhere between
every 8 to 17 years, an agreement surprisingly close to and certainly within our present
predictive uncertainty range of one about every ten to twenty years of risk exposure.
      This present purely “rare event” prediction is a result that was not anticipated beforehand,
and is based on failure data from other global and national non-financial systems, implying that
the very same and very human forces are at work in financial systems due to human fallibility
and mistakes. The present rate-of-failure approach contrasts squarely with many other
unsuccessful predictive measures [31], and short and long-term bond rate spreads using “probit”
probability curves tuned to the market statistical variations [32]. So although we cannot yet
predict exactly when, we can now say that the “economic market place” (EMP) is behaving and
failing on average in the same manner and rates as all other known homo-technological systems.
We presume for the moment that this is not just a coincidence, and that the prior historical data
are indeed telling us something about the commonality and causes of random and rare fiscal
failures, and our ability or inability to predict systemic risk. So we can now seek new measures
for predictors or precursors of market failure and stability based on what we know.
      We already know that the chance of such a major event “ever happening again” is given by
the matching probability using conventional statistics, and this has the value of ~0.63, or about
an equal chance of happening or not [5]. This is a sure Repeat Event Prediction (REP) of a nearly

5
    The recent IMF World Economic Outlook 2009 in fact shows for the 2008 crisis there is a relation between
household liabilities and credit growth in relation to GDP growth ([18, Figure 3.10]).

Journal, 2010.


equal chance. So for managing risk, we should expect another collapse based solely on this
analysis, and probably with about the same average 10 to 20-year interval unless some change is
made that impacts the human contribution. The inevitably of failure is rather disheartening, and
although uncomfortable seems to be the reality, so we should all at least proactively plan for it
and hence be able to manage and survive the outcome, which is risk mitigation.
      Having established the possible relevance of GWP and GDP, as an initial step the measure of
the outcome rate is taken to be the % growth in GWP and GDP (positive growth being success,
negative growth being failure), and the relevant measure for experience and risk exposure for the
global financial system as the gross world product, GWP (T$), not in the usual calendar years as
the interval over which the data are usually presented.
      The result of the ULC analysis is shown in Figure 6 for the interval 1980-2003 [18], where
the GDP growth rate, R, is the MERE learning curve form:


R, % GWP = Rm + (R0 – Rm) exp - k (accGWP)


where numerically, from the data comparison in Figure 6,


R = 0.08 + 8 exp-(accGWP/80)


      The growth rate, R, is decreasing exponentially, and this expression is correlated with the
data to an r2 = 0.9, and importantly shows that by a GWP of order $600T the overall global
growth rate is trending towards being negligible (<0.1%).
      In non-dimensional form, relative to some initial growth rate, R0, this equation can be written
as:


R* = R/R0 = (1/R0) {0.08 + 8 exp - (accGWP/80)}

                                               Figure 6 The GWP Growth Rate Curve



      It is worth noting that, as might be expected in global trading, the magnitude and growth
many economies are apparently highly correlated with the accumulated GWP, so will follow
similar trends as we see later. For example, the straight line that gives the relation between the
USA GDP and the GWP for the interval 1981 –2004 is:


GDP (USA, $B) = 15{accGWP($T)}+3210,


with a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.99. The magnitudes are hence very tightly coupled; but
here we do not have to decide which is cause and which is effect (i.e., is the change in one due to
the other, or vice versa?)6
      To be clear, we really wish to determine a global financial failure rate and the rate we are
learning. So what is the relevant measure of the failure rate? Now, globally governments and
economies usually aim for increasing, or more slowly declining and hopefully non-negative
growth. We postulate that either of the following extrema can be taken as an equivalent and



6
    As pointed out by one of the Discussers of this paper, the “tight coupling” condition is one of those qualities
proposed for the occurrence of so-called “normal accidents” [33].

immediately useful measure of “economic failure” both varying with increasing accumulated
GWP as a measure of total risk exposure:
(a) the rate of decline in GWP growth rate; or
(b) the rate of GWP growth rate itself.
      By straightforward differentiation of the growth rate, R, we have the global failure or decline
rate, λf, given by:


λf ≡ - dR/dGWP = k(R0 – Rm) exp - k (accGWP)


So, numerically, we may expect the rate of decline of growth (the global financial failure rate) to
decrease with increasing risk exposure and experience and be given very nearly by, in units of
%/GWP:


λf = 0.1 exp - (accGWP/80)


with the natural limit, λ0 = 0.1, so the relevant non-dimensional equation is,


E* = λf / λ0 = exp – (accGWP/80).


      The equations for R* and E* now allow a direct comparison to the systemic learning trends
given by the ULC form, E*=exp-3N*, so we also plotted these two growth decline predictions
(shown as the large crosses and circles7) in non-dimensional form against all other world
outcome data with the result shown in Figure 7. The data are bracketted by the two extreme
assumptions basically: (a) the rate of decline of growth rate, λf, when equivalent to “financial
failure”, is tracking somewhat below other adverse outcome data; while (b) the simple decline in
growth rate R, is somewhat above other adverse data. We can indeed establish and cover the
range with these two failure measures, generally within the data scatter.

    This graph and comparison now responds to a point arising in the Discussion at the first draft presentation of this
paper as to the relevant measure for “failure” in global systems that exhibit varying growth rates.

   To our knowledge this is the first time that financial and economic systems have been
compared to other modern systems. We take the extraordinary fact that we can bring all these
apparently disparate data together using the learning theory as evidence that the human
involvement is dominant, not just in accidents and surgeries but also in economics, through the
common basis of the fundamental decision and learning processes. Globally, therefore, we can
state that we have indeed learnt to reduce and manage the rate of overall economic decline, just
as we have learned to correct errors and failures in other systems.

   The implication is intriguing: if a declining rate of economic growth decline is indeed
equivalent to an error, then the economies suffering declines in growth had even “learnt” to
further reduce their rate of decline in growth. They have learnt or managed how not to grow,
eventually reaching an almost infinitesimal asymptotic rate of decline. Further this result
suggests that GWP is a useful measure for estimating risk exposure and the learning opportunity.


8 Developing and Developed Economies: The Learning Link

It has been suggested that this decline in growth rate represents “saturation” of the developed
economies, and that major growth then only occurs in the developing economies. To compare
growth rates, the IMF and World Bank have also separated out the percentage GDP growth rates
for “emerging” or developing countries/economies from “developed” or “advanced”
countries/economies [18].
   Now the percentage growths are based on very different totals, so just for a comparison
exercise, the % growth rate, πGR, in each grouping was defined relative to the absolute growth in
the world, or GWP, as:


πGR (%/$T) = % GDP Growth/(GWP $T x World % Growth)


   In effect, this is a measure of the rate of economic growth rate relative to the total available
economic growth “pie”. The relative growth rate data calculated in this manner for the two
groupings are shown in Figure 8 as a function still of the accumulated GWP, as well as the delta
(or difference) in relative growth rate, {πGR (developed) – πGR (emerging)}, between the two
“types” of economies. The reason for taking the accumulated GWP as the experience measure is
this is presumable some measure of available learning experience and risk exposure in the global
trade between the two groups, and of the total available “pie”.

                                      Figure 8 The differential decline of rates of GDP growth



   What is seen is illuminating: the two growth rates (top dashed lines) are in anti-phase or
negatively correlated: when one goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa. One grows
literally at the expense of the other. There is also some periodicity in the divergence pattern, and
evidence of emerging positive divergence in growth rates towards $600T in 2003+. The opposite
correlation between the growth rates is clear  the developing economies have a positive
correlation of ~ +0.9 and the developed economies a negative correlation of about –0.7 with
increasing accumulated GWP. As world wealth increases, one is declining, and the other is
increasing in growth rate. The implication is that the relative growth shares part of the global
economy “pie” growth, and hence the economies themselves are indeed closely coupled, which
is perhaps obvious in hindsight.
   The prediction is clear based on these trends. The developed world economies would actually
go into near zero or into negative GDP growth rate in 2003+ (the projection is around 2005-2006
when GWP exceeds $600T), after many years of decline. The emerging economies would

Journal, 2010.


continue to grow positively at 5% or more. The difference in rates was highly oscillatory and is
perhaps not stable, as the liquidity (credit) needed to fund growth in emerging economies cannot
come from those developed economies whose available assets and economies are in decline. So
the implication is that  in a globalized economy where all the individual economies are linked
or “tightly coupled”  there are unknown feedback and stability relationships at work that we
need to examine.
                 A very first attempt was also made to predict the actual rate of the known global fiscal crises,
where the key is again finding the relevant units for the measure of the risk exposure/experience,
τ. For the preliminary results shown in Figure 9, as listed in the IMF’s WEO2009, the experience
was taken as GWP-years for the interval 1870-2009 with eight non-wartime crises. The resulting
global crisis rate , λG, is,


λG = (Number of crises, per accumulated risk exposure years from 1870, accY).

      The theory line also shown in Figure 9 is derived from a MERE failure rate, which is firmly
based on human learning, so that the equation is:


λG = 0.059 + 0.2 exp-(accGWPy/230),


with a correlation of r2 = 0.958.


      Clearly the predicted “tail” is nearly constant with the lowest presently attainable crisis rate
of about 0.06 per year (or averaging one every 17 years), suggesting a plateau in the finite
minimum rate due to human involvement. Crises are occurring much faster than might have been
expected using simple extrapolation with a power law: the number and rate of crises increases
with risk exposure (i.e., with increasing GWP), which might seem to be rather obvious,
producing yet another “fat tail”. While not asserting completeness at this early stage of the
analysis, it is possible and highly desirable in the future to further examine the trends in these
crisis data in more detail.


9 Risk: Quantifying the Uncertainty


How can we estimate the stability of a global or national system? The whole system is too
complicated to predict its every move, behaviour or state: so how do we proceed? How can we
estimate and predict the stability of a system when it is unpredictable? Here we introduce the
only known objective measure of uncertainty, complexity and randomness, and illustrate how it
can be used to predict system stability.
      Early work on economic stability [34] focussed on presumed and arbitrary functional growth
relationships between labor (employment) and wealth generation (capital) for determining
equilibrium conditions8. The actual form of the economic growth function was not given or
known, but using simple analytical functions, the possibility was shown for the existence of
multiple alternate steady-states or equilibria. But as clearly stated by Soros [1]: “The financial

8
    The author is grateful to Ms. Christina Wang for pointing out both this reference and its relevance: for the present
discussion we presume that “wealth creation” can be related or correlated to GWP and GDP.

Journal, 2010.


system is far from equilibrium… The short term needs are the opposite of what is needed in the
long term.”
       Since financial markets are actually unstable and dynamic and not in equilibrium, the real
need is to determine and predict the instant of and conditions for instability, not whether some
ideal equlilibria or new steady state is achievable. Markets just like the entire physical world are
random, chaotic and unpredictable, so predicting frequent and rare events is risky and uncertain9.
Learning and randomness are powerful and unpredictable issues for risk prediction because we
tend to believe that things behave according to what we know and, consciously or unconsciously,
dismiss the risk what we have not seen or do not know about. After all, we do not know what we
do not know. We, as humans, are the very product of our norms and patterns, our knowledge
skills and experience, our learning patterns and neural connections, our social milieu and moral
teachings, in the jobs, friends, lovers, lives, teachers, family and managers we happen to have.
We perceive our own risk based on what we think we know, rightly or wrongly, and what we
have experienced. But in key innovations and new disciplines, where knowledge and skill is still
emerging  areas like terrorism, bioengineering, neuroscience, medicine, economics, computing,
automation, genetics, law, space exploration, and nuclear reactor safety  we have to know and
to learn the risk of what we know about what we do not know. We cannot possibly know
everything, and these are all complex systems, with new and complex problems and lots of
complexity, with much uncertainty.
       The way to treat randomness and uncertainty has been solved in the physical sciences, where
it was realised that unobserved fluctuations, uncertainty and statistical fluctuations govern and
determine the actually observed behaviours and distributions. Events can happen or appear in
many different ways, which is literally the “noise” that surrounds and confuses us, whereas what
we actually observe is the most likely but also contains information about the “signal” that
emerges or is embedded, as order emerges from disorder, and we process and discard the
complexity. In fact, not just the physical world but the whole process of individual human
response time and decision-making has been shown to be directly affected by randomness, in the
so-called Hick-Hyman law [5]. As individuals and as collectives, we do and must process
complexity, both in our brains and in our behaviour, seeking the signal from all the noise, the
9
    The inherent randomness is often termed the aleatory uncertainty by statisticians.

Journal, 2010.


learning patterns from the mistakes, the information from all the distractions. Systematic
processing and the perverse presence of complexity are essential for establishing learning
distribution patterns.
   The number of different ways something can appear, or be ordered, in sequence, magnitude,
position and experience, is mathematically derivable and is a measure of the degree of order in
any system [5]. The number of different ways is a measure of the complexity, and is determined
by the Information Entropy, H, which is also a measure of what we know about what we do not
know, or the “missing information” [35], which is a measure of the risk. The relation linking the
probability of any outcome to the entropy is well known from both Statistical Physics and
Information Theory, and is the objective measure of complexity:


Information Entropy, H = Sum (p x natural logarithm, p) = - Σ p lnp


   Note that the units adopted or utilized for the entropy are flexible and arbitrary, both by
convention and in practice as being a comparative measure of order and complexity. So this
measure of uncertainty requires a statement of probability. Now Taleb [4] noted in his notes that:
“I am purposely avoiding the notion of entropy because the way it is conventionally phrased
makes it ill-adapted to the type of randomness we experience in real life”. We dismiss this
assertion, and proceed to make this very subtle notion applicable to financial systemic risk
simply by rephrasing it.
   To make the entropy concept adaptable and useful for “experience in real life” all we have to
do is actually relate and adapt the information entropy measure to our “real life experience”, or
risk exposure interval, as we have already utilized [5, 7] and have also introduced above. So we
can now change the phrasing and the adaptability, since above we unconventionally phrase
entropy as being “an objective measure of what we know about what we do not know, which is
the risk”. In support of this use and phraseology, other major contributors have remarked:
“Entropy is defined as the amount of information about a system that is still unknown after one
has made….measurements on the system” [36].
“This suggests that … entropy might have an important place in guiding the strategy of a
business man or stock market investor” [14].
Presented at Federal Reserve Board – NBER Research Conference on Quantifying Systemic Risk, National Bureau
of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


“Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty and the uncertainty, or entropy, is taken as the measure
of the amount of information conveyed by a message from a source” [37].
“The uncertainty function … a unique measure for the predictability (uncertainty) of a random
event which also can be used to compare different kinds of random events” [38].
   There is no other measure available or known with these fundamental properties and
potential, particularly for handling uncertainty and randomness, the processing and influence of
complexity, and providing the objective measure of order. This measure also has direct
application to the subjective concept of ‘resilience engineering’, where ‘resilience is the intrinsic
ability of an organisation (system) to maintain or regain a dynamically stable state, which
allows it to continue operation after a major mishap and/or the presence of a continuous stress’
[39]. But ‘resilience’, just like “culture”, has not been actually measured or quantified anywhere:
it is simply a desirable property. We have developed the numerical and objective system
organizational stability (SOS) criterion that incidentally unifies the general theory and practice of
managing risk through learning [5]. This criterion is also relevant to ‘crisis management’ policies
and procedures, and emergency response centres in major corporations, facilities and industries.


10. System and Organizational Stability: SOS


The function of any “management system” is to create order from disorder, be it safety,
regulatory, organizational or financial and hence to reduce the entropy. Hence, for order to
emerge from chaos, and for stability in physical systems, the incremental change in entropy,
which is the measure of the disorder, must be negative [40]. Our equivalent stability of
organizational systems (SOS) criterion then arises imply from the fact that the incremental
change in risk (information entropy, H) with changes in probability must be negative, or
decreasing with increasing risk exposure. In any experience increment we must have the
inequality, expressed in differential form:


dH/dτ ≤ 0

of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass., 06 Nov 2009, paper submitted for publication in the NBER Conference
Journal, 2010.


   This key condition requires that a maximum (‘peak’) exists in our changing missing
information or state of order as a function of experience and/or risk exposure. To illustrate this
variation, consider the limit cases of concern of the probability/possibility/likelihood of another
collapse event, having observed a similar one already, considering all our previous knowledge.
From the past experience we showed that the prior probability for repeat events (REP) is, with
little learning, p≈(1-1/e)=0.63, and also this same value holds for novice mistakes with little
experience (when τ→0). For the future risk, the posterior probability, with little learning, is
p≈1/τ, for rare events and also for highly experienced systems (when τ→∞).
   For the two limited learning cases of the prior (past MERE) and posterior (future rare event)
the entropy increment, dH=-plnp in any risk interval can be calculated. The results are shown in
Figure 10 as a function of the experience or risk exposure interval, N*, which purely for
convenience has been non-dimensionalized to the maximum experience or risk exposure. For the
example known “prior” case, entropy is calculated from the MERE probability result with little
learning (k=0.0001); the decrease in entropy at larger experience or risk exposure for the prior
case is due to the probability of an outcome finally reaching a certainty, p~1, as ultimately there
is no uncertainty. For the unknown “posterior” case, the entropy is calculated from p=1/τ; the
peak in entropy at small experience is simply due to the greater uncertainty, which decreases as
experience is gained.
   Also shown in the Figure 10 is the purely theoretical prediction obtained from SEST, the
statistical error state theory [5], which treats outcomes as appearing randomly. The theory
derives the most likely statistical distribution of outcomes, and relates the probability of the
outcomes with variation in the instantaneous depth of experience or risk exposure in any given
risk interval. The information entropy, H, is the measure of the complexity in any interval and is
given by integrating the resulting exponential probability distributions, to obtain:


H = ½ (p0 exp – aN*)2 (aN* + ½)


   At small experience, as N*→0, the above SEST result becomes, H→0.25, which is close to
the prior value with little learning of H→0.29, so the two results are also consistent in their limits
as they should be. The value of the slope parameter or learning exponent, a, is derived

deliberately from very diverse prior data sets for failure distributions which are very detailed and
complete10. The theory line in Figure 10 utilizes the “best” a=3.5 in the above exponential
distribution as a working approximate estimate for comparison purposes, which is close to the
learning rate constant value, k~3. For most of the experience or risk range shown the entropy is
not decreasing significantly until sufficient experience is attained.
      Figure 10 itself contains information about what we know about what we do not know, so is
worth some more discussion. Knowns (prior or past) apparently contain more uncertainty (H is
larger) than unknowns (posterior or future), except at very early or little experience (N*<10-4).
The shapes of the curves are of interest for another reason: for evaluating the system
organizational stability (SOS) criterion. By inspection of the two cases in Figure 10, this stability
condition is only met or satisfied at small experience for the unknowns, and at large experience
for the knowns.

     Specifically, we used: (a) US commercial aircraft near mid-air collisions (NMACs) for 1987-1998, where
experience and risk exposure is measured by total flights; and (b) Australian traffic fatalities from 1980-1999 where
experience and risk exposure is measured in driver-years (as shown in [5, Figure 8.8]).

   Basically, at small experience unless learning is occurring the existing system is unstable and
in danger of repeat events until very large experience is attained. Conversely, any future system
is also initially unstable until sufficient post entry experience has been attained. So learning  or
decreasing complexity  is essential for stability, and this is plainly relevant to the market
stability when introducing the use of new and/or complex financial instruments.
   The data points shown as circles in Figure 10 are for the trial “crisis entropy” estimates
calculated using the preliminary probability values for rare events, p ≈ n/accGWP, where, n, is
simply the number of observed crises, and the risk interval or experience has been non-
dimensionalized on the basis of the accumulated GWP from 1870-2009. The general data trend
is downward (i.e. stable) until the last few data points for the crises of 1997 and 2007, clearly
indicating the potential for systemic instability. Moreover, the greater the GWP becomes, the
greater the risk. This comparison suggests that entropy is indeed a potentially significant
indicator that should not be simply “avoided” as Taleb does, and represents our best and most
refined state of knowledge regarding systemic risk. We have now actually quantified the
behavior of the chaotic and random financial market. As to regulation of systemic risk, this is
really about regulating such unknown uncertainty [2], while meeting the stated goals [2,41]: “to
be effective and worthy of public trust, any governance system must be able to demonstrate
technical competence. Effective and trustworthy governance arrangements must have four key
qualities: informed, transparent, prospective and adaptive”. We have provided new technically-
founded measures for the basis of a governance system which are: (a) informed by the actual
world data and validated; (b) transparent both in their calculation and in using the precepts that
describe human learning and risk taking; (c) prospective and future orientated by being able to
make actual predictions; and (d) adaptive to generally encompass changes in chaotic markets,
risk exposure and financial systems.


11 Concluding Remarks: Our New Methods and Measures provide this framework for
objective and predictive governance.

An exercise such as predicting the “next” recession or crisis becomes simply equivalent to
determining the probability of and risk interval for the “next” event or outcome. This probability
must be based on relevant and correlated measures for experience and risk exposure, which
include the presence or absence of learning. We have analyzed the world economic data to make
a prediction of the “next” crisis probability based on the presence and influence of human risk
taking and decision making in financial markets11.
      We have summarised some recent ideas on risk prediction for multiple technological
systems, using the existing data, and have explicitly included the key impact of human
involvement using the learning hypothesis, namely that we learn from our mistakes. We have
related these ideas to the prediction of rare events, systemic risk, and organizational stability in
global systems and, although we do not pretend to have all the answers, there are clear directions
to follow. Risk is caused by our uncertainty, and the measure of uncertainty is probability. The
risk of an outcome (accident, event, error or failure) is never zero, and the possibility of an
outcome always exists, with a chance given by the future (posterior) probability. The key is to
include the human involvement, and to create and use the correct and relevant measures for
experience, learning, complexity and risk exposure.
      Standard statistical distributions and indicators presently used for financial systems (e.g., as
used in VaR, or yield spread) are known to not be applicable for predicting rare events, systemic
risk, crises and failures. Because of the human involvement, the risk becomes greater than just by
using a Gaussian, normal or simple power law, until we reach very, very large experience and
would have had a prior event anyway. We have a greater chance of outcomes and unexpected
unknown unknowns if we are not learning than we might expect even from and if using simple
“scaling” or “power laws”. This is simply because we are humans who make mistakes, take risks
and cannot be error free. In colloquial terms, the human adds another “fat tail” to an already “fat
tail.



11
     In response to a question raised in discussion at the Conference, the present estimate and prediction based on past
data is for one global financial crisis occurring at least every 8 to 17 years, becoming more frequent in the future as
the GWP and concomitant risk exposure grow. Knowing this fact, the keys are to be prepared for crisis and pro-
active in risk management.

   So the past or prior knowledge indeed informs the future risk: what we know from what we
already know from the probability of what were once past unknowns tells us about the
probability of the unknown unknowns in the future, too.
   The measure adopted and used and relevant for estimating risk exposure is key. Over some
seven to eight decades (orders of magnitude) variation in the rate and in the risk exposure or
accumulated experience, for the rare event the negligible learning prediction holds. At any future
experience or risk exposure, the error (or uncertainty) in the risk prediction is evidently about a
factor of 10 in future crisis occurrence probability, and about a factor of two in average crisis
frequency.
   We have suggested several major factors and useful measures that influence the prediction of
risk and stability in financial systems, based on what we observe for all other systems with
human involvement:
    a) the Universal Learning Curve provides a comparative indication of trends;
    b) the probability of failure/loss is a function of experience or risk exposure;
    c) the relevant measure of failure is the rate of decline in GDP growth rates;
    d) a relevant measure of experience and risk exposure is the accumulated GWP;
    e) stable systems are learning systems that reduce complexity;
    f) an absolute measure of risk and uncertainty is the Information Entropy, which reflects
        what we know about what we do not know;
    g) unique condition exists for systemic stability;
    h) repeat events are likely;
    i) existing systems are unstable unless learning is occurring; and
    j) new systems are unstable at small experience.
   The rare events are essentially all the same, whether they be aircraft crashes, space shuttle
losses, massive explosions, or huge financial crises: we know nothing about them until they
actually happen, when and if they occur almost magically becoming “known unknowns”. We
learn from them only after they have happened at least once. But based on what we know about
what we do not know, we can always estimate our risk and whether we are learning or not. The
rare unknown unknowns, or colloquially the “fat tails” or “Black Swans” of the unpredictable

rate distributions, are simple manifestations of the occurrence of these outcomes whenever and
wherever they happen. We can and must expect them to continue to appear.
      In our previous published work [5], we had quantified the uncertainty or complexity using the
information entropy, H, as an objective measure of other subjective organizational and
management desiderata of “safety culture” and “organizational learning” as a function of
experience. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that information entropy has been introduced
as an objective prediction of the subjective feeling of “risk exposure” in the presence or absence
of learning. As to regulation of systemic risk, this is about regulating uncertainty, so that we
demonstrate technical competence. We provide measures for the guidance of effective and
trustworthy governance arrangements that possess the four key qualities of being informed,
transparent, prospective and adaptive.
      The work and concepts discussed in this paper are only a necessary first step in developing
understanding for predicting and managing risk in complex systems with human involvement.
This new application to financial systems and markets, and the adoption of new measures
requires time, patience and can also introduce risk. Further work is clearly needed in this whole
arena of system stability, the selection of relevant experience measures, and the quantification
and prediction of future risk.

Appendix: probability definition


The outcome probability is just the cumulative distribution function, CDF, conventionally
written as F(τ), the fraction that fails by τ, so:


p(τ) ≡ F(τ) = 1- exp - ∫λdτ


where the failure rate:


λ(τ) = h(τ) = f(τ)/R(τ) = {1/(1-F)}dF/d τ, and the p.d.f. f(τ) = dF/d τ.


    Carrying out the integration from an initial experience, to any interval, τ, we obtain the
probability of an outcome as the double exponential:


p(τ) = 1 – exp {(λ- λm)/k - λτ)}


where, from integrating the minimum error rate equation (MERE), (dλ/dτ) = - k(λ-λm), the failure
rate is:


λ(τ) = λm + (λ0 - λm) exp - kτ


and (τ0) = 0 at the initial experience, accumulated up to or at the initial outcome(s), and 0 =
1/τ for the very first, rare or initial outcome, like an inverse “power law”.
    In the usual engineering reliability terminology, for, n, failures out of N total, the failure
probability,
    p(τ) = (1 - R(τ)) = # failures/total number = n/N, and the frequency is known if, n and N are
known (and generally N is not known).
