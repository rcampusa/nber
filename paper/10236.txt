                                            ABSTRACT

We analyze the relationship between financial development and inter-industry resource allocation

in the short- and long-run. We suggest that in the long-run, economies with high rates of financial

development will devote relatively more resources to industries with a 'natural' reliance on outside

finance due to a comparative advantage in these industries. By contrast, in the short-run we argue

that financial development facilitates the reallocation of resources to industries with good growth

opportunities, regardless of their reliance on outside finance. To test these predictions, we use a

measure of industry-level 'technological' financial dependence based on the earlier work of Rajan

and Zingales (1998), and develop new proxies for shocks to (short run) industry growth

opportunities. We find differential effects of these measures on industry growth and composition

in countries with different levels of financial development. We obtain results that are consistent with

financially developed economies specializing in 'financially dependent' industries in the long-run,

and allocating resources to industries with high growth opportunities in the short-run.

       Economists have long been interested in the role of financial development in resource

allocation. The hypothesis that financial development facilitates the efficient allocation of

resources dates back to at least Schumpeter (1912), who conjectured that banks identify

entrepreneurs with good growth prospects, and therefore help to reallocate resources to their

most productive uses. More recently, Levine (1997) describes a number of channels through

which financial development may affect allocative efficiency, including information generation,

risk-sharing, financing, and monitoring. Rajan and Zingales (1998) point out that allocation may

be differentially affected by industry characteristics: those that require a lot of upfront outside

financing (relative to generated cash flow), such as drugs and pharmaceuticals (perhaps due to

R&D costs), will be less likely to grow in the presence of capital market imperfections than other

industries where investment more closely coincides with cash generation. More recently, a

number of other researchers have used a similar approach to look at the interaction of various

‘fixed’ industry characteristics and different aspects of financial development in predicting

sectoral growth.

       In this paper, we suggest that there is an important theoretical distinction in considering

the role of financial development on industry growth in the short- and long-run that has

heretofore gone largely unrecognized. In the short-run, we emphasize the role of financial

institutions in reallocating resources to any industry that has experienced a positive shock to

growth opportunities. We contrast this with a long-run view of the allocative effects of financial

development, suggested by Rajan and Zingales (RZ), who argued that certain industries will

naturally be more reliant on financial institutions to finance growth. Intuitively, this leads to

separate predictions on the allocative effects of financial development in the short- and long-run.

In the short-run, sectoral growth will be more correlated with growth opportunities in countries
with well-developed financial institutions that allow firms to take advantage of these

opportunities. In other words, in an economy with high financial development, actual industry

growth in the short-run will be a function of growth opportunities (i.e. potential), regardless of

inherent industry characteristics. In the long-run, financially dependent industries will have

comparative advantage in countries with well-developed financial institutions and will thus

capture a larger share of total production (relative to an economy with a low level of financial

development), i.e., countries with high financial development will specialize in financially

dependent industries. Thus, sector share of financially dependent industries will be higher in

countries with high financial development.

          In order to examine these contrasting predictions empirically, we require proxies for

short-run shocks, as well as inherent industry reliance on financial intermediation. We develop

measures of short-run shocks based on the assumption that there exist global shocks to growth

opportunities that may be proxied for by actual growth in the United States. One interpretation of

this measure is that it is a reflection of U.S. companies’ optimal responses to worldwide shocks

(such as oil shocks). Based on the assumption that if the U.S. has very well developed financial

markets (as suggested by RZ), global shocks will be quickly reflected in actual growth rates in

the United States. Under this assumption, actual industry growth in the US may be used as a

proxy for growth opportunities for the same industry in other countries. Alternatively, we may

think of these shocks as originating in the United States (due to demand and/or productivity

shocks within the U.S.) and propagated to other countries with economic links with the United

States.     This interpretation allows for a further refinement of our measure of growth

opportunities: We allow actual growth in the United States to differentially affect industries in

different countries, based on their trade linkages to the United States. To implement this, we




                                                1
weight U.S. growth by the extent of trade with the United States for each industry in each

country. Thus, our assumption of U.S.-based shocks allows us to generate a country-industry

specific proxy for growth opportunities. This is in contrast to earlier work in this literature,

which has always taken U.S.-based measures to apply uniformly around the world.

        Our measure of underlying financial dependence builds on the earlier work of Rajan and

Zingales (1998), which measures financial dependence as the mismatch between cashflow and

investment, calculated using data on U.S. publicly traded firms. The rationale for this approach is

that there are exist time-invariant, i.e. ‘inherent’ industry characteristics, which make some

industries more (or less) reliant on external financing, and that this dependence will be reflected

in U.S. firms, due to the efficiency of U.S. capital markets. Financially dependent industries will

be at a comparative advantage in countries with well- developed financial markets that allow

firms to take advantage of opportunities in industries with such characteristics, and will thus

garner a larger share of production (which represents long-run accumulated growth rates) in

these countries. This stands in contrast to the idea of shocks to growth opportunities that is based

on temporary, i.e. time-specific, shocks which will be reflected in short-run growth.

       Our results are broadly consistent with the arguments laid out above: industry sectoral

growth is more correlated with our measures of industry shocks in countries with well-developed

financial markets; industry sectoral shares are more correlated with financial dependence in

countries with high financial development. Further, we find similar patterns for alternative

measures of financial dependence, including R&D intensity (Beck and Levine, 2002) and trade

credit dependency (Fisman and Love, 2003).

       Our results highlight the important distinction between the roles of financial development

in resource allocation in the short- and long-run, and also provide some guidance and structure




                                                 2
for future work in this area.             In particular, we introduce a broader measure of ‘growth

opportunities’ that we claim is more suited to studying allocation through sectoral growth, while

intrinsic industry characteristics (such as financial dependence) should be more useful in

predicting allocation of sector shares. Further, our paper suggests a reinterpretation and a

potential augmentation to a number of earlier works that follow the methodology of Rajan and

Zingales (1998). To cite just a few examples, Claessens and Laeven (2003) examine industry-

specific tangibility of assets and its relationship to property rights protection; Fisman and Love

(2003) study industry-specific trade credit affinity; and Cetorelli and Gambera (2003) analyze on

the relationship between different aspects of financial development, ‘external dependence,’ and

sectoral growth.

           The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 1 gives a brief overview of the

various mechanisms through which financial institutions may facilitate efficient resource

allocation; Section 2 describes our empirical approach; our data are described in Section 3; In

Section 4, we report our results; and in Section 5, we conclude.



1. Theories of Financial Development and Resource Allocation

While financial development may affect the level of economic growth through numerous

channels, we focus here on the role of financial institutions in allocating resources to firms or

industries with good growth opportunities. Even within this limited realm, there exists a vast

body of work; we provide only a brief and limited overview to highlight the fact that there exist

several functions of financial intermediaries that could have implications for both short- and

long-run sectoral growth.1           These include the provision of external financing; information


1
    See Levine (1997) for an overview with greater breadth and depth.


                                                          3
acquisition and dispersion; governance and oversight; and risk diversification.         We briefly

discuss each of these in turn, emphasizing the role of financial institutions in both the short- and

long-run.



Provision of External Finance – As described by Schumpeter (1912), financial institutions

provide funding to entrepreneurs with good growth prospects. Any industry with high growth

opportunities will require a relatively large amount of outside financing, since future cash flow

(and current investment) will be high relative to current cash flow. Since financial institutions

allow firms (and hence industries) that have good growth opportunities to better finance current

investment, industries with good growth opportunities should grow relatively more in countries

with high financial development. In addition, as suggested by Rajan and Zingales (1998), there

may be certain industries where there is a ‘natural’ lag between investment opportunities and

cash flow. Industries with this inherent need for external finance (i.e. financially dependent

industries) will be relatively advantaged in responding to growth opportunities at all times in

countries with well-developed financial institutions, i.e., these countries will have a comparative

advantage in finance-dependent sectors. These incremental relative advantages will accumulate

over time. Hence, we anticipate that a relatively large share of output in high financial

development economies will be in high external finance industries.

       We further note that conversely, some industries may be naturally better suited to obtain

external financing from sources other than formal financial intermediaries. One example is

suggested by Fisman and Love (2003), which examines trade credit access and intersectoral

allocation. Following their theoretical discussion, we suggest here that industries with ready

trade credit access should be less reliant on formal financial institutions to finance growth




                                                 4
opportunities, and should therefore be relatively well-represented in countries with low financial

development.



Information Acquisition and Dispersion – In addition to the financing role described above, King

and Levine (1993) emphasize the role of financial institutions in overcoming informational

problems that are likely to loom large in areas with new and emerging opportunities. Through

price signals and specialized resources devoted to evaluating firms’ prospects, well-functioning

financial institutions may both directly devote resources to promising ventures, and also signal

high potential sectors to the broader economy. In addition to facilitating growth in any new and

uncertain sector, therefore, this reasoning suggests that industries in which information is

inherently difficult to acquire (such as high R&D sectors, which we consider below) will obtain a

relatively large share of output in high financial development economies.



Risk and Uncertainty – In addition to limited information, the financing of new opportunities is

likely to be accompanied by risk. In the model of De la Fuente and Marin (1996), for example,

this leads entrepreneurs to devote resources to safer but lower growth projects. This implies a

weaker response to growth opportunities, and suggests that industries that are generally risky

(once again, we will suggest high R&D sectors have this attribute) will be a relatively large share

of production in high financial development economies.



Monitoring – The model of Blackburn and Hung (1998) focuses on the monitoring role of

financial institutions in promoting growth.     Closely related to their model is the idea that

financial intermediaries may ‘create winners’ in addition to ‘picking winners.’ That is, in




                                                5
addition to choosing to finance projects that are expected to grow through the provision of funds,

financial institutions may ensure that the firms that receive funding use their resources to best

take advantage of growth opportunities. Furthermore, it is plausible that high R&D industries (or

intangible-intensive industries generally) are more likely to be subject to concerns of moral

hazard.



2. Empirical Approach


2.1. Industry Growth and Growth Opportunities



In order to assess the responsiveness of resource allocation to growth opportunities, we first

require a proxy for these opportunities. Our first identifying assumption is based on the premise

that there exist global industry-specific shocks to growth opportunities i.e., some component of

growth opportunities is common across countries.

   These global shocks could arise as a consequence of technological innovations (for example,

the invention of semiconductors or cellular phones) or global shifts in factor prices (for example

oil shocks). Following the assertion of Rajan and Zingales (1998), we argue that because of its

well-developed financial market institutions, the United States will be well-positioned to take

advantage of these opportunities, so that GO*ict = USGrowthit + εict, where GO*ict are the

(unobserved) growth opportunities in industry-country ic at time t. That is, growth opportunities

include both global and idiosyncratic components, with actual USGrowth acting as our proxy for

worldwide shocks to growth opportunities. Our test of whether financial development facilitates

efficient responses to these shocks at time t is then:



                                                  6
       (1) Growthict = αi + αc + FDc*USGrowthit + εic



Next, we extend this model by allowing a proxy for growth opportunities to reflect the idea that

in addition to global shocks, there will be a U.S.-specific component (as described in the

introduction) that will be transmitted to countries with close trade ties to the United States. More

precisely, we define:



       (2) USShockict = USTradeict*USGrowthit



Where USTradeit is the share of trade (imports + exports) between the United States and country

c as a fraction of total output in industry i at time t. USShockit thus allows for the possibility that

growth shocks may originate in the United States (because of its large size), and be transmitted

to countries that have relatively significant trade ties to the United States.                      Although this

approach is still reliant on US-based measures, it is a step forward in allowing for the generation

of country-industry specific proxies for growth opportunities.2



2.2. Industry Share and ‘inherent’ needs for finance



       In contrast to the short-run relation between growth opportunities and financial development

discussed above, we expect that underlying industry characteristics, such as inherent need for

finance, will interact with financial development to affect sector shares, since sector shares are a

result of accumulated past growth rates. That is, economies with well-developed financial
2
    Fisman and Love (2004) provide an alternative assumption for country-specific proxies for growth opportunities.


                                                           7
institutions will specialize in industries that have an inherent reliance on outside financing.

Following the suggestion of RZ, we assert that some firms are dependent on financial institutions

because of an inherent mismatch between cash flows and investment, due to underlying

technological characteristics. We use the measure of external financial dependence constructed

by RZ, which we call USNeedsi and conjecture that:



    (3) Shareic = αi + αc + β1FDc*USNeedsi + εic



where Shareic is a share of industry i in total manufacturing output of country c. The hypothesis

that β1>0 implies that industries where expenses cannot be matched to cash flows will be more

prevalent in countries with high financial development because they will have a comparative

advantage in these industries.

         Note that there are complications in considering the effects of RZ’s variable, USNeeds

(as a measure of inherent financial dependence) on industry share and growth. This measure is

constructed as the difference between investment expenditures and current cash flow. Therefore,

it will simultaneously pick up the effects of growth opportunities that result in high current

investment (GO), as well as the differences across industries in the extent to which expenditures

to take advantage of these opportunities cannot be matched to generated cash flows

(Dependence).3 Hence,



    (4) Needsit = f(GOit,Dependencei)




3
  This alludes to the broader issue of constructing measures of underlying inherent industry characteristics using data
from a particular time period. We discuss this concern further in the data section below.


                                                          8
The nature of f(.) will depend on underlying technologies, so we do not attempt to assign a

functional form to this relationship. We simply make the observation that USNeeds will be

correlated with our proxy for global growth opportunities, USGrowth, but will also reflect the

differential ability of industries to rely on external finance due to the technological differences –

i.e. financial dependence. Thus, in our model, the interaction USNeeds*FD will be significant in

predicting Growthict, if the analysis is done without controlling more directly for growth

opportunities. This is the regression reported by Rajan and Zingales (1998). In other words,

USGrowth is a purer reflection of growth opportunities, while USNeeds is a reflection of

industry financing needs, which incorporates simultaneously elements of growth opportunities,

financial dependence, and the form of f(.) in (4) above. Thus, while USNeeds may be used as a

time-varying predictor of financing industry needs, we suggest that our USGrowth measure is a

more direct proxy for growth opportunities, as in (1) above.4 Hence, we suggest that when we

include the USGrowth*FD interaction in addition to USNeeds*FD, this more direct measure of

growth opportunities will dominate in the growth regression. This will not be the case in sectoral

share regressions, where we expect the underlying industry characteristic of financial

dependence to be the dominant explanatory factor. The main difference in our two approaches is

the following: we argue that inherent needs for funds affect industry shares while RZ argued that

they affect industry growth. In our model, growth is primary affected by temporary shocks to

growth opportunities; the effect of underlying industry characteristics on sectoral growth is third-

order.




4
  Our discussion on sector shares suggests that the interactive effect of growth opportunities and financial
development on sectoral growth should be stronger in financially dependent industries. This is a third-order effect
(i.e., a triple interaction). When we looked at the triple interactions of FD*USGrowth*Dependence, the coefficients
were of the predicted signs, but were not generally significant.


                                                         9
       In summary, our approach provides sharply contrasting hypotheses regarding the

importance of USGrowth and USNeeds in predicting industry growth versus predicting industry

shares: USGrowth, as a proxy for growth opportunities, will dominate US Needs in predicting

sectoral growth across countries, while USNeeds, as a proxy for external finance dependence,

will dominate USGrowth in predicting sector shares.

       Our claim regarding the relationship between underlying industry characteristics and

sectoral allocation is a more general one, and will be applicable to any underlying feature of an

industry that leads to greater (or lesser) reliance on (formal) financial markets. We therefore

include two additional ‘robustness’ tests based on earlier work on financial markets and

intersectoral allocation. First, we draw on the work of Beck and Levine (2002) who claim that

R&D intensity may also lead to a relatively high reliance on financial intermediaries. We predict

a similar effect of R&D intensity on sector shares as with USNeeds: R&D intensive industries

will be relatively well-represented in high financial development economies. Also, we examine

the effect of trade credit availability, as suggested by Fisman and Love (2003), who argue that

firms in industries with easy access to trade credit (i.e., high payables) will be able to finance

growth with less need to access formal financial markets. Therefore, we predict an opposite

effect: industries with higher ‘trade credit afinity’ will be relatively well-represented in countries

with low financial development. Thus, we also run regressions of the form:



   (5) Shareic = αi + αc + β3*FDc*USR&Di + εic, where β3 > 0

   (6) Shareic = αi + αc + β4*FDc*USAPAYi + εic, where β4 <0




                                                 10
Where, USR&Di and USAPAYi are industry-specific measures of R&D intensity and trade credit

affinity (measured by accounts payables over assets ratio) respectively.



3. Data

Our data are drawn primarily from Rajan and Zingales (1998), and described in detail in that

paper. For comparison with their work, the main outcome variable is real growth in valued

added, estimated for each of 37 industries in 42 countries over the period 1980-1990. The

original data source is Industrial Statistics Yearbook published by United Nations (1993). We

use the original measure of external financial dependence constructed by RZ, which we refer to

as USNeeds to highlight the fact that this measure captures the need for external finance and that

it is calculated using US data (obtained from the Compustat database). The original measure is

calculated as a ratio of investment minus cash flow divided by investment and captures the

percent of total investment that is financed by the external funds (see RZ for more details on

calculation of this measure).

         To construct our first measure of growth opportunities, USGrowth, we calculate industry-

median of real sales growth between 1980 and 1990 using all firms from Compustat.5 This

industry-specific measure of growth opportunities assumes that there is some component of

growth opportunities that is common across all countries – i.e. a global shock. Our second

measure of growth opportunities, denoted by USShock, is USGrowth, adjusted for the trade

flows. First, we construct USTrade, which equals to the ratio of (exportscj + importscj)/(total

outputcj), where exports and imports measure trade of country c with the US in each industry j.

5
  We first calculate the real average growth rate for each firm in the sample for the decade of 1980’s and then take
the industry-level median of the firm-level averages of growth rates. We excluded 1% of the top and bottom tails of
the distribution of firm-years of sales growth to eliminate cases of mergers, acquisitions, or disposals of assets. This
parallels the approach used by RZ in calculating their external financial dependence measure.


                                                           11
This measure captures the importance of trade with the US for each industry-country

combinations. We obtain export and import data for each country-industry from Compatible

Trade and Production Database, COMTAP, distributed by OECD and described in Harrigan

(1996). The advantage of this trade data is that it uses the same industry classification as in the

original RZ data (i.e. ISIC classification). We obtain total output data from the same Industrial

Statistics database published by UN that was used by RZ to construct original industry growth

measure. To reduce potential endogeneity, our trade measure is constructed for the year 1980 and

it captures the trade at the beginning of the decade for which the growth data are constructed.

Then, our second measure of country-industry specific growth opportunities, USShock,                                      is

constructed as a product of USGrowth*USTrade.

         Two additional industry-level measures - R&D intensity, USR&D, and Trade Credit

Affinity, USAPAYTA - are constructed from Compustat for the same sample of firms and same

time-period as was used for original financial dependence measure. R&D intensity is measured

as industry median of a ratio of R&D expenses (summed over the decade) over the total sales

(again summed over the decade). USAPAYTA is measured as a ratio of accounts payable to total

assets. It captures the industry’s reliance on trade credit finance and is described in detail in

Fisman and Love (2003).

         Finally, we utilize RZ’s primary measure of financial market development, given by the

sum of market capitalization and total domestic credit provided by banks to private borrowers,

referred to as “Total capitalization”.6 A complete list of the variables used in this paper with the



6
  Note that we recognize the potential endogeneity of financial development. However, it is not clear that
appropriate instruments exist for this variable. When we use the set of instruments that are commonly used in this
literature, legal origin and settler mortality (see, for example, Beck et al, 2004), we obtain results that are statistically
significant at the ten percent level in both our share and growth regressions, and consistent with those reported
below. However, it is not clear that these variables satisfy the conditions required of instruments, so we do not
report those results in our tables. These results are all available from the authors.


                                                            12
original sources is given in Table 1; Table 2 Panel A shows the basic summary statistics for all

measures used in the paper and Panel B reports industry-level measures. We note that the

correlation of USgrowth and USNeeds is 0.65, (significant at 1%) which is in line with our

hypothesis that they are both related to growth opportunities. On the other side, the correlation of

USR&D and USNeeds is even higher, at 0.78, which is at least suggestive of the possibility that

they may both be capturing an industry-specific measure of financial dependence.

        As a final observation, we note that we have generated both our time-varying measure of

growth shocks, as well as our industry characteristic variables that should not be susceptible to

the time period chosen. We will therefore follow RZ by generating our industry variables using

data from the 1970s as well, to make sure that our sector share results are not sensitive to choice

of decade for the generation of our time-invariant characteristics. We will also examine the

relationship between growth in the 1980’s and our measures of shocks, derived from 1970’s

Compustat data. Our ‘time invariant’ measure of financial dependence should still predict sector

shares, while our ‘non-event window’ growth data should not be predictive of 1980’s growth.

We therefore define the variables USNeeds70, USGrowth70, and USShock70 that are generated

precisely as described above, using data from 1970-80. It is interesting to note that the

correlation between USGrowth and USGrowth70 is 0.10, while the correlation between

USNeeds and USNeeds70 is 0.63. This lends some credence to the proposition that USNeeds

variable represents ‘structural’ characteristics, while USGrowth represents a temporal

characteristic.



4. Results

4.1. Financial Development and (Short-Run) Growth



                                                13
We begin by examining the hypothesis that financial development helps to channel resources to

industries with good growth opportunities. These results, based on equation (1) above, are

reported in Table 3, column (1). We find that the coefficient on USGrowth*FD takes on the

value 1.07, and is significant at the 1 percent level. Its magnitude implies that an improvement

in financial development from 0.46 (Philippines, the 25th percentile) to 0.98 (Italy, the 75th

percentile) will result in an increased responsiveness to global growth shocks of 0.56. In column

(2), we replicate the results of Rajan and Zingales (1998), which shows that USNeeds*FD is a

significant predictor of growth in a regression where we have not directly controlled for growth

shocks. In column (3), we report results with both USNeeds*FD and USGrowth*FD as

regressors. Consistent with our hypothesis that USNeeds is a weaker proxy for global growth

prospects, we find that when both USNeeds and USGrowth are included in the same regression,

the USNeeds interaction is no longer significant.7 In columns (4) and (5) we use our measure

of industry-country specific growth opportunities, USShock. We find that the interaction term

USShock*FD is significant at a higher level than the USGrowth interactions reported in (1) and

(3). However, the coefficient on USShock*FD implies a considerably smaller effect of financial

development on resource allocation, since the standard deviation of USShock is about a tenth of

that of USGrowth, while its coefficient is only four times greater. This is consistent with

USShock picking up only a part of global shocks (relative to USGrowth), but measuring this

component of shocks more precisely. We note finally that USNeeds is again is not significant in

model (5) at conventional levels.

 We examined the sensitivity of these results to outliers in growth rates first by dropping the top and bottom one
percent of observations of Growth and second by employing a robust regression approach. In both cases the
coefficient on USNeeds*FD was not significant, while USGrowth*FD remained significant at the one percent level.
These results are available from the authors.


                                                       14
       We next consider the possibility that financial development may be proxying for other

country-level characteristics that create US-specific correlations in sectoral growth. First, we

consider the possibility that USGrowth may be a better proxy for growth opportunities in

wealthier economies. Since financial development is correlated with income, our interaction

term USGrowth*FD may be picking up this wealth effect. This was recognized by RZ, with

reference to the theory of Dornbush, Fisher and Samuelson (1977), which finds that as

technologies mature, industries involving those technologies migrate from developed to

developing countries. Therefore, in columns (5) – (6) of Table 3, we include the interactions

USGrowth*log(GDP per capita) and USShock* log(GDP per capita). The coefficients on our

two interaction, USGrowth*FD and USShock*FD, remain significant at the 1 percent level in

both regressions. Second, we allow for the possibility that the level of human capital

development may affect growth in industries that require highly skilled workers. If growth

shocks during the 1980’s were in such industries, then the interaction with of USGrowth (or

USShock) and financial development could be picking up human capital effects. We use a

commonly utilized measure of human capital, average years of schooling in 1980, and find that

in columns (8) and (9) our main results remain robust to adding these controls. As a final

specification check, in columns (10) and (11) we repeat our basic specification using Compustat

data from the 1970’s. In column (10), we find that the interaction USGrowth70*FD is

marginally significant (t=1.74). Note, however, that unlike our 1980’s interaction, this effect is

highly unstable, and may be an artifact of the moderate correlation of USGrowth and

USGrowth70: Removal of outliers, adding basic controls, or adding the USGrowth*FD

interaction, all cause this effect to evaporate. In column (11), we find that the interaction

USShock*FD is not significant.




                                                 15
4.2. Financial Development and Sector Share



We now examine the relationship between fixed industry characteristics and sector share. In

Table 4, column (1), we report results based on equation (2). Consistent with the hypothesis that

countries with well-developed financial institutions specialize in industries that require high rates

of external finance, the coefficient on USNeeds*FD is significant at the 1 percent level. Its

magnitude, 0.015, suggests an even larger allocative role for financial development than the

growth regressions described previously, since the standard deviation of Shareic is about 20

percent of that of Growthic. To ensure that this result is not simply the result of correlated

growth shocks, we include USGrowth*FD as a control in column (2). The coefficient on this

interaction term is not significant, and has very little effect on the coefficient on USNeeds*FD.

Thus, while our flow measure, USGrowth, has a significant impact on changes in allocations

(i.e., Growthic), it is not a significant predictor of shares in allocation (i.e., Shareic). As

additional controls, we include USNeeds*log(GDP per capita) and USNeeds* Human capital in

columns (4) and (5). The first is to account for the possibility that countries at similar levels of

economic development will specialize in similar sectors (see, for example, Chenery, 1960). The

second interaction allows for the possibility that industries with inherent needs for external funds

may also have high needs for skilled labor; since human capital development is correlated with

financial development (Table 2), our interaction could be picking up this effect. The original

interaction term USNeeds*FD remains significant in both cases. Finally, we use

USNeeds70*FD to examine the sensitivity of our results to the choice of time period; in contrast




                                                   16
to the growth results above, we find that USNeeds70 implies an even larger effect on sector

share than USNeeds, though we cannot reject the hypothesis that the effect is the same.

       In columns (8) and (9), we show results for two alternative measures of financial

intermediary dependence: accounts payable intensity, and R&D intensity. Column (8) uses the

measure of reliance on trade credit finance proposed by Fisman and Love (2003). Consistent

with the hypothesis laid out in this earlier work, we find that industries that are able to rely more

on trade credit finance attain a larger share of production in countries with less-developed

financial markets, due to a comparative advantage in these industries. We obtain significance at

only the 7% level. Trade credit remains a significant predictor of sector shares when

USNeeds*FD and/or USAPAY*GDPPC are included as controls. Column (3) shows R&D

intensity as a final measure external finance dependence, as suggested in Section 1. The

coefficient on USR&D*FD is significant at one percent, and its size implies a similar effect as

that of USNeeds. Note, however, that this result is unstable: the inclusion of both USNeeds*FD

and USR&D*FD in the same regression causes the R&D interaction to lose significance. This

may be because the two variables are proxying for similar industry characteristics: To a large

degree our R&D may be picking up the fact that research and development requires upfront

investments, as suggested by the very high correlation between USNeeds and USR&D.




5. Conclusions
       In this paper, we point out an important distinction between the long- and short-run

effects of financial market development. We emphasize that in the short-run, financial

development will facilitate the reallocation of resources to any industry with high growth

potential. Empirically, we find that actual growth is more highly correlated with our measure of



                                                 17
growth opportunities in economies with high financial development. One important spin-off of

our research is that in order to test this implication, we develop a plausible proxy for industry-

country growth shocks. In the long-run, we emphasize the implications of financial development

for the types of sectors that come to dominate economic activity: Countries with high financial

development specialize in industries with an inherent reliance on external finance. We believe

that this work will help to guide future work examining the role of financial development, and

allocative institutions more broadly defined, in the development process.

                           all years for each firm before dividing) for US. This variable measures the portion of capital
                           expenditures not financed by internally generated cash. From Rajan and Zingales (1998).

USGrowth                   Growth in real sales, industry-level median of firm average growth rages over 1980-1990 for
                           US firms, from Compustat.

USAPAYTA                   Industry-median of ratio of accounts payables over total assets calculated for all firms in
                           Compustat (from Fisman and Love (2003).

                           (both are summed over the decade of 1980 before taking a ratio) calculated for all firms in
                           Compustat.

Country-Industry level variables:

Industry growth            Annual compounded growth rate in real value added estimated for the period 1980-1990 for
                           each ISIC industry in each country from Rajan and Zingales (1998).
