                      BUSINESS CYCLES AND FERTILITY DYNAMICS IN THE U.S.:
                                 A VECTOR-AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL


                                                 ABSTRACT
        Using recent developments in                    time-series econometrics, this
paper investigates            the behavior          of fertility       over the business

cycle. The sex-specific unemployment rates, the                         divorce rate and

the fertility rate are shown to be governed by stochastic trends.

Furthermore, fertility is determined to be co-integrated with the

divorce and unemployment rates.
        In     the     bivariate        vector-autoregressions between fertility

and unemployment, an increase in the female or                         male unemployment

rates        generate     a   decrease       in     fertility,       which     confirms the

findings       of      previous         time-series         research     concerning     the

procyclical          behavior      of     fertility.        However,    when     the models

include the divorce rate and the proportion of young marriages as

additional           regressors,        shocks     to     the unemployment rates bring

about an increase in              fertility, implying            the countercyclicality

of fertility.
