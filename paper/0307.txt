     This paper examines the argument that restricting domestic firms' production
abroad by for example, imposing a tax on foreign source income, can increase
domestic welfare and alter the income distribution to favor labor. These argu-
ents follow directly from a characterization of the international producer as
a facilitator of capital flows. The available evidence suggests, however, that
U.S. multinational firms have a much broader role than transferring abundant
U.S. capital abroad. In this paper the firm Is viewed as able to compete
abroad for a variety of reasons, including an ability to make use of technological
and other cost advantages over local producers. Then, the effect of its opera-
tions abroad on the domestic capital stock is no longer so obvious. It is
argued that at most a part of the marginal capital employed abroad is obtained at
the expense of the capital stock of the domestic economy. The paper then presents
a simple model which indicates that domestic labor can either gain or lose
relative to capital, and home country welfare can either increase or decline, as
a result of restricting the foreign operations of domestic firms. The results
depend on the ultimate source of the capital placed abroad, the relative factor
intensity of production by the multinational firm, and whether the multinational
firm produces the home country's importable or exportable good. Since none of
the cases considered seems totally implausible, the case for reducing international
production cannot be made on the traditional grounds without further empirical
evidence.

I. Introduction

       For a number of years, a minority of the United States Congress has been

urging adoption of measures to reduce the level of foreign operations of U.S.-

based firms. The discussions have centered on a more restrictive policy of

income taxation, but proposals for more direct restriction of foreign invest-
ment have also been advanced. Organized labor has given strong support to such

policy changes, arguing that workers are harmed by the employment abroad of U.S.

capital and know-how. Their position is holstered by the long-held theory of

economists that national welfare can be improved by the appropriate reduction

in foreign investment from its free-market level.

       Labor's case for restricting the firms' foreign operations is often

expressed in terms of a loss in home country jobs. Several studies, which are

reviewed in Bergsten, et al (1978), estimate the net effect on employment of U.S.

foreign investment. Since the loss of jobs is a temporary adjustment problem

and also depends on government macroeconomic policies, these estimates are

difficult to interpret. Other authors have, however, pointed to a more permanent

impact on labor, the reduction in wages caused by the decline in the home country's

capital-labor ratio which results as capital moves abroad.1

       There are two distinct strands to the national welfare argument for restric-

ting the foreign production of U.S. firms.2 The first depends on the existence

of host country taxes on the income earned in the host country by U.S. firms.

Profit-maximizing firms, it is argued, will equate marginal returns to capital, net

of U.S. and host country taxes,   across all countries in which they operate.

This implies that under the current system of crediting foreign tax payments

against the U.S. income tax liability, the U.S. earns less, by the amount of the

foreign tax, on the marginal unit of capital placed abroad than it would if the
                                            2



capital were to remain at home. That is, firms transfer too much capital abroad

from the standpoint of national welfare; the U.S. would do well to reduce the

level of foreign investment. Taking into account only this "foreign tax effect",

it would appear that home country welfare could ho maximized by allowing a

deduction, rather than a credit, for foreign tax payments.3

       Other writers have pointed to a second source of gain.to the home country

from   restricting   foreign investment. They have argued that the home country can

increase its earnings on the stock of capital employed abroad by insuring that a

higher, not equal, return is earned at the margin on capital placed abroad.

Achieving this monopoly gain requires government intervention, of course, only

if the home country firms themselves do not act as a monopoly supplier of capital

(cfJasay (1960)).        In other cases even a home country system of "taxation with

deduction of foreign taxes" is apparently insufficiently restrictive from the

standpoint of home country welfare. Thurow (1976) uses this argument as a basis

for estimating the gain available to the U.S. from "optimal taxation" of the

income earned abroad by U.S. firms.

       The grounds on whichgovernment restriction of firm's foreign investment

has been proposed are, then, that such a restriction is thought to alter the home

country's income distribution in favor of labor and to improve home country welfare

in general. Both arguments, as just described, rely crucially on a characteriza-

tion of the multinational firm     as   a transferor of domestic capital abroad.4 It

seems curious that this view of the firms has persisted in discussions of optimal

policy, as accumulating evidence seems to contradict the notion that capital

 transfers play a major role.
                                       3




     Critics of the hypothesis that foreign investors operate primarily to

facilitate capital flows include Hymer (1960), Vernon (1966), Gruber, etal

(1967), Caves (1971), and Horst (1972). This criticism is supported by recent

evidence. The rapidly growing flows of portfolio capital and direct investnt

into the U.S. argues against the view that U.S. firms are investing abroad

primarily to take advantage of an abundance of capital at home. Also, a

substantial fraction of the capital employed abroad by U.S. firms is obtained

outside the U.S.

     The effects of government restrictions on the foreign operations of firms

have previously been studied using an overly simplistic characterization of the

multinational firm. This paper takes a broader view of the nature of the firm's

foreign operations, allowing for a variety of factors, including technological

and managerial advantages over local producers, which may explain the firm's

competitiveness abroad. The policy conclusions which result differ substantially

from those of the traditional analysis. Specifically, both the usual national

welfare and distribution arguments for restricting production abroad are shown

to hold only in particular cases.

     The impact of restrictive government policies on the domestic capital stock

is a highly important factor in our analysis. Having rejected the traditional

approach to determining the effect of foreign investment on the domestic capital

stock, it is necessary to formulate an alternative. So, before considering the

policy issues, we address the question of whether the domestic capital stock is

affected by international production decision.
                                          4



II. The Impact of Foreign Investment on the International Distribution of Capital

     In examining this crucial issue of the source of capital employed abroad by

*iltinational firms,   it   is only the ultimate source in the aggregate that is of

interest. For that reason, the individual firm's decision on how to finance its

investment is not of concern here. Furthermore, even the observed aggregate

financial behavior of multinational firms may not have relevance in this context.

     For example, if there were compensating long-term portfolio capital flows

which were perfectly interest-elastic, the worldwide distribution of real capital

would be unaffected by the financial decisions of firms, even in the aggregate.

In this case of perfectly elastic capital flows, the issues of policies towards

capital movements and the remainder of a multinational firm's operations would

be separable .   Since the effects on the home economy of restricting capital

flows have been examined in detail,5 only the impacts of a change in the level of

foreign production would remain to be explored. While we will consider, as a

special case, the restriction of international production when no change in the

capital stock takes place, there are a number of reasons for believing that the

operations of multinational firms do affect the distribution of capital across

nations. That is, the international character of total assets held by the home

country is altered as the level of international production changes.

     One factor of importance is the ability of multinational fi.rms to overcome

barriers to capital mobility. The existence of barriers to portfolio capital

flows has been described as providing an additional advantage to the multinational

firm. The multinational firm is favored because of its ability to transfer funds

internally without being required to engage in market transactions. This ability

is particularly advantageous if local capital markets are inefficient or non-

existent or if government interference with capital transactions is pervasive.
                                       5




Clearly, if multinational firms perform this arbitrage function to any significant

extent, their operations' impact on the capital stocks of the nations in which

they operate cannot be ignored. Discussions of the ability of multinational

firms to facilitate capital flows can be found in Agmon and Lessard (1977) and

Rugman (1977).

     A second factor tending to result in the domestic capital stock and the level

of international production not being separable issues is uncertainty. Not wanting

to be dependent upon any assumption that risk is a matter of concern to individual

firms, we will look through the corporation to the desire of individuals who own

shares in the firm's returns to minimize the riskiness of their portfolios.

A convenient way of attacking the issue of capital transfer is to question whether

firm owners, when faced with an increased Incentive to employ capital abroad (in

order to increase production), would increase net borrowing abroad in equal amount

to the capital requirement of the production increase.6 The answer, in general,

is that a portion of the required capital is obtained at the expense of the home

country's capital stock.

     Borrowing in the host country requires that the capital return be paid in

the local currency. Individuals are concerned about the correlation of real

returns to assets with real costs of holding liabilities in their portfolios.

So, the attractiveness of increased local borrowing by U.S. investors depends

on the relationship between unexpected changes in the dollar return to capital

employed abroad and unanticipated changes in the exchange rate. The incentive

to obtain a marginal unit of capital locally is smaller the more likely are unan-

ticipated exchange rate changes to reflect fluctuations in input and output prices

faced by the multinational firm in the host country. Since the available evidence
                                           6




points to relative prices being affected by exchange rate changes, except over

a very long period (Dornbusch and Krugman (1976) and Krugman (1978)), there is

a clear reason for firms to obtain capital locally. On the other hand, the

possibility of an unanticipated inflation at home being reflected in exchange

rates makes capital transfer relatively less risky. Further complicating decisions

is the possibility of government interference in exchange markets.

     To the extent that U.S. multinational firms are superior vehicles for

international portfolio transactions, the capital transfer from the U.S. which

accompanies aggregate investment overseas may be indicative of the overall effect.

rt has been observed that about half of the capital from sources external to

foreign affiliates of U.S. firms   is   obtained outside the U.S. at the margin.7

This fraction appears to have been relatively stable, except for periods of

government intervention. So, both the traditional view that the home country's

capital stock declines by the amount of the capital required for an increase in

home country firms' production abroad and the other extreme of no capital transfer

seem to be contradicted in the U.S. case.

     It seems safe to assume that investors would not desire that multinational

production be carried out using entirely host country capital at the margin.

Investors in the rest of the world will, similarly, be conscious of risk when

making long-term portfolio capital investments. Therefore, government restrictions

on multinational firms will tend to cause an increase in the home capital stock

which portfolio capital flows will not entirely eliminate. If portfolio capital

flows were perfectly interest-elastic, the national welfare and distribution

questions which motivated this paper would be uninteresting.

III. The Effects on the Domestic Economy of Reducing the Level of Production

         by Domestic Firms Abroad

      From the discussion of the previous section, it seems appropriate to take

a new look at the effects of policies toward multinational corporations. Since

our theory suggests that the home economy does not necessarily supply one hundred

percent of the capital used in production abroad, the traditional policy model

is not applicable. We will now explore the implications of the relationship

between capital and international production.

      This model will follow the tradition of assuming that there are only two

countries and two traded goods produced with capital and labor available in

fixed supply. Since the results are to be regarded as only illustrative of

possible solutions, free trade without transportation costs is also assumed to

prevail. This assumption precludes, of course, any analysis of simultaneous

restriction of International production and imposition of tariffs.8 The multi-

national firm   is   viewed as producing one of the goods (X) abroad because of

its advantages over local producers. A policy measure is introduced which

causes production abroad by the home country's firms to decline, with a correspond-

ing decline in capital used in that production, according to the relationship

given by (1).

The host country is indicated by a "h" and           is the capital required for pro-

ducing a unit of X. Equation (1) allows for the possibility that the restrictive

policy causes a change in the real wage in the host country and, hence, in
                                                      8


The increase in the home country capital stock which results from the production de-

dine abroad is, then, given by equation (2), where 6 is the fraction of the capital

previously used to produce dX* which returns to the home country.


(2)
                                            =

      This model is specified assuming that the government simply mandates a reduc-
tion in   X*. Other policy measures, such as taxing foreign source income at a higher

rate, could be analyzed in the same way. However, it is useful to consider a simple

reduction   in X, as it facilitates examination of two limiting cases of interest.

In addition, we assume that the host economy has imposed no taxes or other restric-

tIon,s on foreign investment. Therefore, the analysis abstracts from the "foreign

tax effect" for simplicity. It causes no confusion, however, to think of any policy

prescriptions following from this discussion as deviations from the basic "taxation

with deduction for foreign tax payments" policy.

      With domestic prices and factor costs held fixed, the injection of capital in-

to the domestic economy would change production of good X as indicated by (3)

Equation (3) follows from the necessity that all of the additional capital be ab-
sorbed by the production of X or Y, at initial relative factor costs. Therefore,

the total effect on world production of good X, at initial prices, would be given

by equation (4).

     The impacts on the domestic economy as prices and factor rewards are allowed

to vary are now usefully explored by considering two polar cases. First, the

analysis is done assuming that all capital formerly used abroad returns to the

domestic economy, and then repeated under the assumption that none of the capital

was used abroad at the expense of the home economy at the margin.

        A. Full Capital Transfer       In this case, a government-induced reduction

        in the production abroad of good X is accompanied by an increase in the

        home country's capital stock by the full amount previously used to pro-

        duce good X abroad (that is,          =   1).   To determine the effects on prices

        of the government's policy, we first examine the fixed-price change in

        production of good X.

             At the initial relative prices, a capital inflow will increase home

        country production of X if X is the home country's capital-intensive good,

        and it will decrease if X is relatively labor intensive. With labor

        assumed immobile across national borders, the Rybcyzynski theorem dicates

        that production of good Y changes in the opposite direction.

             In determining the effect of the policy on worldwide production of

        X given by (4), the sign of the final term must first be determined. Since

        the host country labor which formerly produced dX* must be absorbed by

        the host economy without any change in the stock of capital available

        for producing the host country good Y, the wage rate in the host country

        must decline. Therefore, the last term in (4) is positive.

             It is, then, clear that if multinational firms produce the good which

        is capital intensive in production in the home country and if the firms do

        not use sufficiently less capital-intensive methods abroad, the government's

        action results in an increase in the total world production of good X. The

        relative price of X must, then decline. By the Stolper-Samuelson theorem,
                                 10




the price decline for X leads to a rise in the wage and a decline in

capital's return in line with the traditional conclusion about such a

policy
     The exception, just noted, of firms which use significantly less

capital-intensive methods abroad may or may not be of practical importance.

But, since it results from the most traditional case of full capital

transfer, even the theoretical possibility is surprising.

     Conversely, if good X is the labor-intensive good in the home economy,

its worldwide production declines in response to a capital repatriation,

as both production at home and    abroad decline (at fixed prices). As a
result, the price of good X must rise, leading to an increase in the home

country's wage-rental ratio.

     So, labor will not usually lose relative to capital as a result of

government restriction of international production when all capital used

abroad is obtained at the expense of the home economy. Only if the factor

proportion used in domestic production of good X differs appreciably from

that used abroad,can a counter-intuitive result be obtained.

     With respect to national welfare, it is useful to consider two effects

which, while clearly related, will be discussed separately. The first

factor to be considered is the change in the real return to the existing

stock of home country capital abroad. As pointed out above, the wage in

the host country declines unambiguously as a result of a restriction on

foreign investment. So, the return to capital used by producers of X'

increases. Therefore, beginning from a situation of no restrictions on

international production, the imposition of some such restrictive policy

tends to increase U.S. national welfare by raising the return to the stock

of capital held abroad.
                                  11



       The change in the home country's terms of trade could obviously affect

domestic welfare in either direction depending on the sign of the relative

price change and on which good is the home country's exportable. So,

even in the case of full capital transfer when production of a good abroad

is coupled with the transfer, the implications for national welfare become

ambiguous

B. No Capital Transfer      When no capital employed abroad is obtained at

the expense of the home country capital stock, the cases normally made for

restricting international production are even less clear. Such a govern-

mental policy move causes a reduction in the production of X* abroad,

without any corresponding change in the domestic capital stock. The only

effects on the home country arise, then, because of the relative increase

in the price of X. The resulting (Stolper-Samuelson) effect on the home

country's wage-rental ratio is given by the familiar equation (5).

P   is the relative price of good X, and el is the determinant of the matrix

havingrepresentative element, 0..,          the share of the price of good j which

represents a payment to factor i. The sign of let is determined by the

relative factor intensities in the home country. If the good produced

internationally is capital intensive in the home economy, home country

labor will lose when international production is restricted. On the other

hand, restricting production abroad of a good which is labor intensive at

home causes the home country's wage-rental ratio to rise. So, labor's
                                          12


         traditional argument for reducing the level of operations of multi-

         national firms does not necessarily hold.

                The national welfare argument gives equally ambiguous conclusions.

         A   reduction   in host country production X does not generally free up capi-

         tal and   labor   in the correct proportion for production of Y* at existing

         factor costs. The wage-rental ratio in      the host    economy rises of Y*   is
         relatively labor intensive, and it fails if *      is    relatively capital

         intensIve. The real return to the intra.-marginal capital employed abroad

         by the home country can, therefore, be changed in either direction by

         the government's restrictive policy. Since the relative price of X rises,

         the direction of the terms of trade effect on national welfare depends

         on whether good X is the Importable or exportable good.

         C. Partial Capital Transfer As was pointed out in Section II, the case

         of full capital transfer and of no capital transfer are to be regarded as

         only limiting cases, with neither likely to have wide applicability.

         Since examining the two extreme cases produces such a wide range of possi-

         ble results (see Table 1,) we must conclude that a government limitation

         on U.S. firms' production abroad could affect both factor rewards and U.S.

         welfare in either direction.



IV. The Need for Further Research

        Clearly, the effects of even a very straight-forward policy change cannot

be predicted without a great deal more empirical evidence than is currently available.

The relative capital intensity of U.S. firms' production abroad is controversial,

with existing studies providing insufficient reason to choose either alternative.

Also, while firms often produce abroad as a substitute for exporting, some goods

produced by the firms are imported by the U.S., so the direction of the terms of

trade effect is uncertain. Finally, although the sources of capital employed by

U.S. firms abroad has been studied, this evidence provides at most a partial

answer to the question of effects on the domestic capital stock.

        Furthermore, the very simple analysis presented in this paper, although

seemingly more realistic than previous discussions of the issue, falls far short

of the type of model needed to confidently recommend a particular policy. The

analysis, for example, has assumed the initial position to be one of free trade.

Since one    of   the primary reasons given for producing a good abroad is that tariffs

iipede the good's export, one refinement of the basic model would be to include

tariffs. Also, the results hinge critically on the assumptionthat the host

country does not begin production of X as the multinational firms' production de-

clines. One       attractive   way of including host country production might be to in-

clude more goods which, while not precisely the same as the multinational firms'

production, are close substitutes. The addition of more traded goods could moderate

the results in another way as well. The existence of multiple goods, to which dis-

placed host country labor may flow, may tend to lessen the impact of reduced X'

production on wages. A further extension of the model would allow exploration of

the implications of business being truly multinational, i.e., operating in several

countries.

        As with any comparative static analysis, this paper has ignored the process

of adjustment. Since labor's case for restricting international production may

be partially based on the adjustment costs imposed on labor as production shifts

abroad, the adjustment process may be important in a policy decision. However,

any major policy change imposes the same sort of adjustment costs, so the issue is

one of comparative costs.

        Any of these extensions would produce a model with highly complex relation-

ships among variables. Use of such a model would probably require empirical

evidence to be used for obtaining simulation estimates of policy effects. In any

event, the model in this paper must be regarded as illustrative.



V. Conclusions

        In a world of foreign exchange risk, some portion of the capital employed

abroad by multinational firms will be obtained locally and some portion will be

transferred from the home country. Since portfolio capital flows, by the same

argument, are not perfectly elastic, the aggregate distribution of capital across

countries is changed as a result of international production, but does not change

by the full amount required by the multinational firms' operations abroad. So,

factor rewards and home country welfare are affected by policies which alter inter-

national production levels, but not necessarily as traditional policy analyses

would Indicate. This paper has shown, using a simple model, that labor can either

gain or lose relative to capital and that the home country welfare can either in-

crease or decline as a result of restricting the foreign operations of home country

firms. Since none of the examples considered seems totally implausible, the case

for reducing multinational activity cannot be made on any of these grounds without

further empirical evidence.

1.   Recent work by P. Musgrave (1975) and Thurow (1976) has provided estimates
     of the oss to U.S. labor derived from such an analysis.

2. A more complete review of these discussions can be found in 1ergsten, etal
     (1978).

3. This argument is associated with P. Musgrave (1969 and 1975)'.

4.   In addition to the studies just cited, this emphasis on capital flows has
     dominated studies of optimal host country policy (see, for example, MacDougall
     (1960) and Corden (1974)).

S.   In addition to the work previously cited, which discussed capital flows as the
     characteristic feature of foreign investment by U.S. firms, see Jones (1967).

.    This includes, of course, the possibility that individuals would cut previous
     net lending abroad.

8.   In a model of portfolio capital flows, Jones (1967) •considers taxation of both
     capital and trade flows.

9. Considering domestic aggregate economic welfare with no concern for the effects
    of policy on other nations is, of course, limited as a criterion for policy,
    but may be useful nevertheless in describing the policy impacts.
