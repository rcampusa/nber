    Estirrating the   Revenue   Maximizing Top Personal Tax Rate



                                ABSTRCr



    The idea that marginal tax rates and tax revenue may be
inversely related is at least as old as Adam Smith's Wealth

of Nations. The emergence of the "Laffer Curve" in the
modern public debate on the subject has rekindled interest

in this idea. The present paper uses data from the 1982
tax rate reductions to estimate the revenue maximizing top
personal tax rate.

    This paper also examines the components of taxable
income to consider the sources of taxpayer response to

changes in marginal tax rates. The National Bureau of
Economic Research TAXSIM model was used extensively in this

study to estimate the magnitude of taxpayer response to tax
rate changes.

                  ESTIMATING THE REVENUE MAXIMIZING

                        TOP PERSONAL TAX RATE


                        Lawrence B. Lindsey*



    The possiblili.ty that marginal tax rates and tax
revenue may be inversely related has received an increasing
amount of attention in recent years. The so-called Laffer

Curve suggests that above a certain point, higher marginal

tax rates will produce lower revenue. However, this idea
is at least as old as The Wealth of Nations. Adam Smith
argued:



          High taxes, sometimes by diminishing the con-
          sumption of the taxed commodities, and some-
          times by encouraging smuggling, frequently
          afford a smaller revenue to government than what
          might be drawn from more modest taxes.'

    Most modern economic analyses of taxation focus on
the issue of excess burden or economic efficiency and

neglect the relationship between tax rates and tax
revenue. This neglect is a corollary of the objective
being studied. When minimizing the excess burden of
taxation subject to a revenue constraint, tax rates

above the revenue maximizing point on the "Laffer

                           —2—
Curve" are irrelevant to consideration. At the revenue
maximizing point, the excess burden of an additional

dollar of revenue is infinite because the behavioral
response of taxpayers makes collection of additional

revenue impossible.
    Even at tax rates slightly lower than the revenue
maximizing level, the additional excess burden caused
by collecting the added funds is likely to be well in
excess of the shadow price of government revenue.
Therefore, some of the mystique associated with the

maximand of the Laffer Curve is misplaced. Consider
for example the claim of Jude Wanniski, a proponent of

the Laffer Curve, regarding its maximum point:


        It is the point at which the electorate
        desires to be taxed. At (lower rates), the
        electorate desires more goods and services
        and is willing -- without reducing its
        productivity —— to pay higher rates con-
        sistent with revenues (at the maximum
        point).. .It is the task of the statesman to
        determine the location of (the maximum) and
        follow its variations as closely as
        possible 2


Far from being a preferred rate of taxation, the Laffer
Curve's maximum point represents a limiting case. States-
men should be aware of its location only as a level of
taxation to be avoided.

    Fullerton3 used a general equilibrium model to test

the hypothesis that tax rates were above the revenue
                           —3—
maximizing point and concluded they were not. However, his
model limited taxpayer response to rate changes to factor
supplies. However, behavioral responses which affect tax
revenue are not limited to factor supply. For example,

Feldstein and Slemrod4 argued that lowering the tax rate
on capital gains would increase tax revenue. Clotfelter5
found a strong relationship between tax price and the use
of business travel and entertainment deductions by

partnerships. Gwartney and Long6 and Lindsey7 found a
negative relationship between tax rates and tax revenue for
high income individuals and noted behavioral responses
which were unrelated to factor supply.

    A recent study8 performed using the National Bureau
of Economic Research TAXSIM model concluded that roughly 40
percent of the revenue loss from the 1982 rate reductions

was recouped by the behavioral response of taxpayers. This
implies that, in general, the income tax system is levied
at rates below the revenue maximizing level.

   However, the evidence also indicated that top bracket

taxpayers, representing the top 180,000 tax returns,
actually paid more taxes under the lower rates than what
was to be expected under the earlier, higher set of tax
rates, given the macroeconomic environment of 1982. This
suggests that the revenue maximizing top tax rate of the
personal income tax is below the 70 percent level which

prevailed prior to 1982.

   The purpose of the present paper is to take a detailed
                           —4—
look at the 1982 data to estimate the revenue maximizing
top tax rate. Section 1 summarizes the available data,
proposes a means of modelling the results, and estimates
the model. Section 2 applies the resulting parameters to
the current distribution of income to find a revenue

maximizing top marginal tax rate. Section 3 examines the
various components of taxable income to consider the

sources of taxpayer response to tax rates.


Section 1: The 1982 Tax_Base
    Estimation of the behavioral response of taxpayers to
changes in tax rates involves comparison of the actual
behavior of taxpayers with an expected behavior given the
initial tax rate structure. In this study, the National
Bureau of Economic Research TAXSIM model was used to create
a baseline, or expected, income distribution for 1982 given
the historic relationship between macroeconomic conditions
and taxable income. This baseline was then contrasted with
the actual level of taxable income in that year.
    The TAXSIM model permits behavioral modelling at a
highly disaggregated level. The taxpayers in the baseline
data set were ranked according to income and then compared
with taxpayers of identical rank in the actual data. For

example, the top 8408 taxpayers in the 1982_Statistics_of
Income reported incomes over $1,000,000. They were matched
against the top 8408 taxpayers in the baseline income

distribution. The next group of taxpayers in the
                                  —5—
Statistics of Income   ——   the   $500,000 to $1,000,000 group -—
were then matched against taxpayers of identical rank in
the baseline distribution. The process was repeated until
all taxpayers were grouped.
    The results are presented in Table 1. The actual
taxable income of the taxpayers in each group is contrasted

with the amount of taxable income historic relationships
would predict from taxpayers equally situated in the income

distribution.

    The data show that taxable income was 33.5 percent

higher for the top taxpayer group, or top 0.01 of the

taxpayer population. Among the top 0.18 percent,
corresponding to taxpayer incomes of $200,000 or more,
taxable income was $9.6 billion. This represents 17
percent more than the level predicted by the baseline. The
difference between the actual and baseline levels declines
down the income distribution, and the baseline level

exceeds the actual level at very low incomes.
    If personal income tax revenues are inversely related
to the level of marginal tax rates at some point, it is
because they affect the incentive to realize increased
amounts of taxable income. The marginal after—tax value to
the taxpayer of a change in taxable income is one minus the

taxpayerts marginal tax rate.
    The marginal after—tax value of taxable income was

computed for each taxpayer group using the baseline income

distribution for both ERTA and the pre-ERTA tax laws. In

the case of pre—ERTA tax law, each taxpayer had two

marginal tax rates computed: one for wage income and one
for interest income. A weighted average of these rates was
then computed for each taxpayer where the weights depended
on the shares of earned and unearned income in total

income. This averaging method corrected for the
peculiarities of the Maximum Tax on Earned Income and the
earned income credit. It therefore represented the share

of income the taxpayer would keep if his income from all

sources rose 1 percent. The resulting average rate also
corresponded to the effective tax rate on incremental
amounts of itemized deductions. Each tax return was then
weighted by its sample weight in the tax file to obtain an
average marginal rate for its taxpayer class.

    Table 2 presents these tax rates and the resulting
ratio of marginal after—tax values under the post—tax cut
and the pre—ta.x cut rate schedules. The table compares
this ratio with the ratio of taxable incomes in the actual
and baseline income distributions.

    Figure 1 plots the relationship between after-tax
shares and taxable income. A positive relationship between
the ratio of actual to baseline taxable income and the
ratio of after—tax shares is clearly indicated. Similarly,

an intercept value below unity is apparent. That is,
taxpayers with little or no change in their tax rates, and

therefore their after—tax shares, reported actual income
below the level predicted by the baseline.

    The reason for this latter observation can be found in

the   means used to create the baseline income distribution.

That distribution relied on the actual macroeconomic

conditions of 1982 to determine the baseline level of

taxable income. If there were a behavioral response to the
rate change which affected the macroeconomic conditions of

1982, it would be reflected in the baseline income

distribution for that year. To the extent this were true,
the baseline distribution overestimates the true level of
income. This overestimate is allocated proportionally
across the population on the basis of income.

      It is interesting to note that the actual behavioral

response creating this overestimate was uneven across the
population. In particular it was concentrated on people
with large changes in their marginal tax rates. Therefore,
taxpayers with little change in their tax rates receive a
disproportionately large share of this macroeconomic
feedback from the rate reductions. The baseline therefore
exceeds their actual level of income.

      Figure 2 illustrates this phenomenon. The line denoted
"True Macroeconomic Effects's represents the level of

taxable income which would have occurred had there been no
rate reductions. On the other hand, the "Baseline
Estimate" includes both the exogenous macroeconomic

situation and any behavioral feedbacks which resulted from
the rate reductions which changed the macroeconomic

situation. In the baseline, these aggregate macroeconomic
feedback effects are distributed evenly across all income

groups.   Thus, the "Baseline Estimate" is modelled as a
parallel line above the "True Macroeconomic Effects."

    However, the actual effects of the tax change varied
with the changed incentive to realize taxable income.

Upper bracket taxpayers saw their rate reduced from 70
percent to 50 percent while persons not subject to income
tax saw no change in their tax situation. These tax
effects, represented by the line labelled "Macroeconomic
and Tax Effects," therefore are modelled as beginning at
the "True Macroeconomic Situation" line and rising
thereafter.

    By averaging the macroeconomic feedback effects from
the tax rate reduction across all taxpayers to obtain the

baseline, the result exceeds the true measure of these
effects for some taxpayers, and underestimates it for
others. However, the variable response of taxpayers in
different tax situations permits estimation of both the
behavioral response to the tax rate reduction and the
amount of overestimate of the true macroeconomic situation
by the baseline.

    The data can be fitted to a. model describing a constant

elasticity response to marginal take-home shares. The
amount of income a taxpayer would have reported had he had

a zero marginal tax rate, or alternatively, if there were
no tax system, will be denoted -- C. -- and the take home
share of income at the margin as --

      Under this formulation, if the tax rates in the two
regimes are identical for a given individual --                       =

      —— then the reported taxable incomes should also be

identical. Given that there was a tax rate reduction for
all taxpayers in 1982, only taxpayers with no tax liability

      t1. =   t1   = 0 -- would have the same income -—

     = Y0.    Furthermore, assuming             >   0, all taxpayers would
report income greater than that projected by the baseline:

Yl > YO.
      However, as noted above, the baseline income
distribution was an overestimate of the true baseline as
                              — 14       -


the macroeconomic aggregates on which it was based included
behavioral feedback from the tax rate reduction. That

implies that C11 < C01, that the exogenous factors
assumed in the baseline were higher than their true values
for 1982. Note, however, that since the exogenous factors
were computed at the aggregate level, there is no reason to

expect that C11/C0. differs over the income
distribution.

      Therefore, the value of C11/C01 is computable. A
linear regression equation given by equation 4 can be
estimated with the null hypothesis that C11 =
                                                           c01.

      The intercept term in the regression equation would

provide the extent of the overestimate in the absence of

any tax change. That is, if t1 =             t0,   we would expect
no change in taxable income:             =          If the baseline
                                             Y0.
differs from the actual tax data, it will be picked up by
a ,where a is the value of the intercept.

      The sample on which the data is based is stratified so

that roughly equal numbers of observations, averaging about
1500, are provided for each income group. These relatively

large samples for each group suggest that the variance of

the values for each group is likely to be small and, given

roughly equal numbers of observations, unlikely to vary
much among groups. Therefore, the use of weighted least
                                  — 15 —

squares to provide estimates corrected for hetero—
skedasticity is not required. Equation (5) reports the
results of the regression where Y is defined as taxable
income:

               Y1   =   —0.0164 + 0.7466     in

                        (—0.0356) (0.2239)


      The standard errors for the regression are in
parentheses below the corresponding estimate. In equation
(5), the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the
after-tax share at the margin is about 0.75 and is

significant. The intercept parameter, a, has the expected
sign. This indicates that the baseline does overestimate
the actual macroeconomic situation of 1982, but it is not
significant. Given these parameters, the next section
estimates the revenue maximizing top marginal tax rate by
applying them to the current distribution of income.


Section 2: The Revenue Maximizing Top Marginal Rate
      The preceding section estimated that the elasticity of
taxable income with respect to a taxpayer's marginal after—
tax share was 0.75. This parameter can be applied to the
current distribution of income and tax schedule to compute

a revenue maximizing top marginal personal income tax rate.
      Consider first the case of a proportional income tax
                             — 16 —

levied   at rate "t" on an individual with taxable income

equal to Y. Given the model described above, we can
describe the taxes paid by an individual, T1, as a
function of the marginal tax rate and the taxpayer's income
if there were no taxes, C.


(6) T1 = tY1 =    tC(lt)
In the case of a proportional tax described by equation 6,

the revenue maximizing tax rate is a function of "b":


(7) t* = 1/1+(3



    A value of 13 of 0.75 implies a revenue maximizing tax

rate of 57 percent. The revenue maximizing tax rate does
not depend upon income. Increases in t above this point
will reduce taxable income proportionately more than the
percent increase in the tax rate.

    However, if the tax system is not proportional, and if
inframarginal income is taxed at a rate unrelated to the

top marginal rate, increases in t will reduce taxable
income by the same amount, but will gather additional
revenue from the higher rate on fewer inframarginal

dollars. A lower revenue maximizing tax rate is implied.

    Consider a tax system described by a top marginal tax
rate, m, applied to all income above level Z. Infra—
marginal dollars up to rate Z will be taxed at a rate v,

which is not dependent on m. Rate v may be higher or lower
                                 — 17 —

than m, but a higher v reduces to the trivial observation
that lump—sum taxes are least distortionary. Both
theoretical and practical interest focus on a value of v

lower than m. The tax on a taxpayer with income

higher than Z is defined by equation (7).



(8)      T1 = vZ + m(Y—Z) = vZ + mC1(1—m) - mZ


      With this more complicated tax system, a higher top
marginal tax rate implies the same loss from a lower

taxable income as the proportional tax system, but a gain

from the higher rate only on Y.-Z. The result is that
the revenue maximizing top marginal rate varies with
income. To model this we require the income distribution
for taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of Z, the

income threshold at which the top marginal rate begins.
The revenue collected from taxpayers below this level of
income, and the tax liability on the first Z dollars of

income are assumed to be unchanged. If we define a
function f(Y) as the distribution of taxpayers reporting
taxable incomes of Y and n as the number of taxpayers with
income over Z, the revenue maximizing top marginal tax rate

becomes:

                                nZ    —
                   1-
                        S f(Y)YdY

                                 nZ

                            I
                            z    f(Y)YdY
                             — 18 —

     Estimation   of this parameter requires an iterative
 procedure because f(Y) is dependent on the value of m which
 is chosen. Convergence is dependent upon the local

 properties of the distribution of income. The current tax
structure and income distribution seem appropriate starting

points for discovering at least a local maxima.
     In 1986, the value of Z is scheduled as $174,900.

Estimates using the NBER TAXSIM model for the 1986 tax year
suggest 226,000 taxpayers will have taxable incomes over
that level. The total taxable income of that population is

approximately 90.4 billion. The value for the final term
in equation 8 therefore equals 0.437. A revenue maximizing
top marginal tax rate of 43 percent is therefore implied.

    As noted above, the distribution f(Y) is dependent on
the level of the tax rate selected. The 43 percent top

rate increases the reporting of taxable income and also the
number of taxpayers with taxable incomes above the
threshold amount Z.    In equation (9), the nZ term in the
numerator of the last term increases proportionately more
than the income term in the denominator at this point in
the income distribution. This causes the revenue maximiz-
ing tax rate to fall. The 43 percent rate therefore repre-

sents an upper bound on the top rate for the income tax.
    In order to calculate a lower bound, the bracket

structure of the President's proposals for tax reform was
used, with the top bracket beginning at $70,000.   Again,
simulations for 1986 were performed which found 2,233,000
                                — 19 —
taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of this amount.
Total taxable income for these taxpayers was $308.2

billion. Using this calculation, a revenue maximizing top
marginal tax rate of 40 percent is implied. It should be
emphasized that these top marginal rates do not represent a
social optimum except in the extreme case that government
revenue is valued infinitely more than private consumption.
       The above analysis held the tax levied at an income of

Z constant while lowering the top marginal tax rate. This
change would require alteration of the bracket structure
below income Z in a multiple rate bracket system such as
that which describes current U.S. tax law. Consider for
example a constant elasticity model of a form described by
equation 9 for incomes up to and including Z:



(10)              T1 =      p



In this case, the income elasticity of tax revenue equals
p ,    which also is the ratio of the marginal tax rate to
the average tax rate. Such a tax system also defines the
tax rate at Z, the point where the top marginal tax rate is

applied. To avoid any non-linearities, it is necessary that
this top tax rate, m, be defined by equation 10.



(11)          m = PT     —1)



If such a top rate were not defined, the tax system

described above would ultimately produce a marginal tax
rate in excess of 100 percent.
                                     — 20 -

       The assumption of this tax rate schedule places another
constraint on the computation of the revenue maximizing top
marginal tax rate. In the case described above, the tax
liability collected at Z was unchanged but the marginal tax
rate at Z was allowed to fall. Equations (10) and (11)
show that this only can be done if the progressivity of the

income tax, indicated by p ,              is   cut, and the scaling

parameter, T ,       is   increased.

       Reduction of the top marginal tax rate would therefore
lower the apparent progressivity of the bracket structure.

If we constrain the progressivity of the bracket structure

to its current level, the revenue maximizing tax rate is

defined by equation 12:

                             1 -         (i-f;!   mnZ
                                     P
              m* =                        Z
(12)
                           1 + B —                )nZ
                                     P

       The income elasticity of the current bracket structure
around income Z is 1.36. Computation using the figures
above suggests a revenue maximizing top marginal tax rate
of 54 percent in this case.

       However, two points should be made about this revenue
maximizing rate. First, the higher value of the revenue
maximizing top marginal tax rate is due to the added
revenue collected on inframarginal dollars. If the
progressivity of the income tax is held constant and the

scaling parameter, t ,         is   increased, taxes at income Z and
                                   — 21 —
 all    incomes below that level will also rise. This will

 compensate for the corresponding reduction in the tax base
 resulting from the higher rates. A corollary of this is
 that across—the-board rate reductions to achieve a given
 top marginal tax rate will produce a higher revenue

 maximizing value for the top rate than simple reduction in
 the top rate.

     Second, the progressivity that is being preserved in
 this case is the apparent progressivity of the bracket

structure, and not the distribution of the tax burden. If

for example, we reduced the top rate from the current 50

percent to 43 percent and left the inframarginai tax
brackets unchanged, the taxes paid by upper income
individuals would rise while everyone else's taxes would

stay unchanged. The apparent progressivity of the tax
structure would be reduced because these added taxes from
the rich result from higher taxable income overwhelming the

lower income elasticity of tax revenue.



       2_ates and the Components of Income
       In   considering the   behavioral response of taxpayers to
rate   reductions, it is important to note that some
components of income appear more responsive to changes in
tax rates than do others. The following charts illustrate

the relationship between after-tax shares and the reporting
of income in 1982.
                              — 22 —

   Figure   3 shows the relationship between AGI and tax

rates. As in Figure 1, the ratio of actual to baseline
income is plotted on the y axis while the ratio of the
after—tax share after the tax cut to the after tax share

before the tax cut is plotted on the x axis. Again, as in
the case of taxable income, a distinctly positive slope is

present.
    Figure 4 shows the response of wages to tax rates.

Again, a pronounced positive relationship between reported
wages and after tax shares is evident. An intercept term
below unity is also implied. The baseline income
distribution includes an imputation for the effect of the
high unemployment rate in 1982. The data suggest that the
behavioral feedback from the tax reduction raised wages

above what they otherwise would have been in the NIPA data

and therefore in the baseline. This change would be
averaged across all income groups making the baseline
higher than the actual value for low income groups.

    The increase in wages was particularly dramatic in high
income groups. Wages and salaries were nearly $5 billion
 -- 20 percent --   higher   than predicted by the baseline for

 taxpayers with AGI over $200,000. This may seem surprising
 in light of the pre-existing Maximum Tax on Earned Income

 for eligible taxpayers. However, as both Sunley9 and
 Lindsey10 have shown, the tax was ineffective at reducing
 the marginal tax rate on earned income to 50 percent.     For

 example, only 32 percent of all taxpayers in brackets of 50

percent   or higher were eligible for the maximum tax
provisions in 1977. In view of this, it is not surprising
that a response to rate reductions occurred for wage and

salary income among these top bracket taxpayers.
    The level of wages and salaries may also be relatively

discretionary for these high income groups. The behavioral
choice for these taxpayers may be between higher cash

compensation and business expenses with consumption value
such as automobiles, travel, and entertainment. Given
earlier optimization of these forms of compensation at the

higher historical tax rate which existed before the change
in the tax law, it is not surprising that a lower actual
tax rate in 1982 would produce a level of taxable

compensation above what was predicted by that baseline.
    It must also be stressed that these figures do not

imply that the increase in wages and salaries was

paralleled by increased effort or labor supply. Although
some labor supply response might be expected, the bulk of

the explanation is probably a rearrangement of compensation
to suit the new tax regime. The many studies of labor
supply elasticities of prime age males --   comprising   most

of this group -- do not support a response sufficient to

explain increases of this magnitude in the wages, salaries
and business incomes of the rich. Furthermore, the tax cut
also involved an increase in income for these people that
would tend to discourage effort.
                             — 26 —

    This unexpected level of wages for high income
taxpayers was paralleled by a dramatic elevation of
reported business income by the same group. Business
income reported by taxpayers in the top three taxpayer
groups was 88 percent ——   $1.2 billion -— higher than
predicted by the baseline. This type of income had the
largest percent difference between the baseline and actual
data of any income category in any income class. It was

particularly striking because among taxpayer groups
corresponding to taxpayers reporting less than $100,000 of
AGI, the baseline overpredicted business income by more
than $1.0 billion.

    Figure 5 illustrates this response of business and

professional income (reported on Schedule C) to the tax

rate change. Interestingly, this rise in business income
in top brackets came in spite of liberalized depreciation
rules which would tend to lower business income, not
increase it. The effect of the 1981 tax act had the

unambiguous effect of lowering the price of cash compen-

sation to high income professionals. However, the effect
on non—cash compensation was ambiguous. Although
accelerated depreciation lowered the price of such items as
company cars and office equipment, the marginal rate
reduction had the effect of raising this price of fringe
benefits relative to cash compensation.

    It should also be noted that in both the case of

business income and in the case of wages, the actual

behavioral   response was probably greater than reported
here. The increased reporting of wages and salaries and
business profits due to lower consumption of fringes by the
rich raised the total level of these forms of income in the

national income accounts. This, in turn, was reflected in
a higher baseline level of these types of income for all

groups including the rich.

    Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between capital
gains reported in AGI to tax rate. The top 5 income groups
(AGI over $75,000) all had higher than anticipated capital
gains while all but one income group under that level of
AGI had lower than expected capital gains. These data
imply that the change in capital gains receipts was the
result of the tax rate change rather than overall

investment conditions. The largest tax rate reduction for
capital gains, like other income, came from taxpayers in
tax brackets over 54 percent. These began with taxable
incomes of $60,000, roughly corresponding to an AGI of
$75,000.

    Top bracket taxpayers saw a decline in their effective
rate on long term gains from 28 to 20 percent. Other
taxpayers received a reduction in their capital gains rate
equal to only 4 percent of their ordinary tax rate. For
example, a taxpayer in the 25 percent tax bracket saw a
reduction in his capital gains tax rate from 10 percent to
9 percent.

    Taxpayers in the over-$200,000 group reported capital
gains $3.1 billion -- 27 percent --   higher   than predicted
by the baseline. This large increase in capital gains
realizations by the rich occurred in spite of the fact that
capital gains declined by $1.2 billion or 7 percent for the
population earning under $100,000 between the baseline and
actual data. This decline may well have been the result of
a stock market which averaged lower in 1982 than in either
of the 2 preceding years. Thus, the rise in capital gains
realizations by the wealthy occurred in spite of a

deteriorating capital gains environment for most
taxpayers. This strongly suggests that it was the rate
reductions and not the market environment of 1982 which was
at work.

    Figure 7 presents the relationship between interest
income and after tax shares. 1982 marked the high point in
the emergence of low minimum balance money market accounts
which offered competitive interest rates. The aggregate
data suggested a trend to more equal distribution of this
income as a result. This trend was not incorporated into
the baseline. Extending this trend would have decreased
the baseline estimate of interest income received by the

higher income groups, implying a greater response of
interest income and taxable income to the rate reduction of

1982. As modelled, interest income appears unresponsive to
the rate reductions.

deductions and the price of taking those deductions. In
nearly every case, the level of itemized deductions was
below that predicted by the baseline. This would, of
course, be a natural response to an increase in the price

of deductions. Furthermore, there appears to be a greater
depression of itemized deductions among those groups who
saw the largest increase in price —— upper income groups.

    Regression coefficients describing the relationships
between the ratios of actual to baseline values for these

income terms is presented in table 3. The table shows
significant regression coefficients in the cases of taxable

income, adjusted gross income, wages, capital gains, and
business income. In each case, the coefficient of the
regression respresents the elasticity of that type of
income to the after—tax share the taxpayer keeps.

    Two particular elasticities are striking: capital gains
and business income. In the case of capital gains, the
income term was defined as gains included in AGI, so 60

percent of long term gains were already excluded. Using
the revenue maximization calculation discussed previously,

the elasticity of 1.9 implies a revenue maximizing tax rate

of 34 percent for gains included in AGI. This in turn
implies a revenue maximizing capital gains tax rate of 14

percent.

    These data suggest that types of income over which
taxpayers have significant amounts of discretion —— wage

and business income of upper income individuals and capital

gains   realizations -- have significantly higher degrees of

behavioral response than income in general. Lower maximum
marginal tax rates on wage and business income and a

greater capital gains exclusion are indicated.

    The data presented here suggest that there is no
conflict between revenue needs and a further reduction of

the top marginal personal income tax rate. However,

certain questions remain open. For example, it is an open
question whether this estimate of the revenue response for
1982 is an overestimate or an underestimate of the long run

response one might expect from tax rate reduction. On the
one hand, overestimation might be implied by a temporary
unlocking of capital gains. On the other hand, it is
likely that taxpayers learn avoidance behavior over time.
Unless one assumes that portfolio and labor supply

adjustments are sudden in response to changes in the tax
environment, underestimation of the behavioral response by
these data is implied.

    Determination of the long run implications of these
findings is complicated by the existence of future tax rate
reductions built into the law for middle income taxpayers.

Rates were scheduled to be 10 percent lower in 1983 than

1982, and 5 percent lower in 1984 than 1983 for all but the

top income brackets. Thus any possible postponement of
income and acceleration of deductions between 1981 and 1982

for high income taxpayers would imply similar behavior by
middle income taxpayers between 1982 and 1983. The
                           — 36 —

argument that the implied revenue response in these data is
exaggerated by temporary behavior must contend with the

corollary of temporarily diminished revenue response in
anticipation of future behavior.
