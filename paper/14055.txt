This paper shows how lifelong survival-contingent payouts can enhance investor wellbeing in the
context of a portfolio choice model which integrates uninsurable labor income and asymmetric mortality
expectations. Our model generates optimal asset location patterns indicating how much to hold in liquid
versus illiquid survival-contingent payouts over the lifetime, and also asset allocation paths, showing
how to invest in stocks versus bonds. We confirm that the investor will gradually move money out
of her liquid saving into survival-contingent assets to retirement and beyond, thereby enhancing her
welfare by as much as 50 percent. The results are also robust to the introduction of uninsurable consumption
shocks in housing expenses, income flows during the worklife and retirement, sudden changes in health
status, and medical expenses.

1 Introduction
This paper presents a dynamic model of rational consumption and portfolio choice

over the life cycle, in which uninsurable labor income and asymmetric mortality ex-

pectations are permitted to shape both the asset allocation and location decisions.

While prior studies have examined how mortality risk can inuence investment de-

cisions, this is the rst analysis to include real-world life-contingent products that
                                                                                   1
hedge the mortality risk in a realistic calibrated life cycle framework.               Specically,

we model nancial contracts that permit the investor to trade o asset illiquidity in

exchange for an extra return known as the 'survival credit;' at the same time, the

individual is permitted to allocate her entire investment menu. Conrming previous

ndings, we show that the fraction of wealth invested in risky assets will optimally

decline with age. But we also show that the investor will gradually move her money

out of liquid saving into an illiquid survival-contingent payout account, to take ad-

vantage of the survival credit up to and beyond her retirement date. This strategy

can enhance welfare by as much as 50 percent.

    Solving household nancial decision-making problems such as these is complex,

inasmuch as they involve long time horizons, stochastic investment opportunity sets,
                                                          2
shocks to consumption, and other uncertainties.               Recent work has evaluated how

asset illiquidity can shape investor behavior, mainly focusing on housing and non-
                           3
tradable labor income.         Less attention has been devoted to examining nancial

1 Prior  work includes Dus, Maurer, and Mitchell (2005); Gerrard, Haberman, and Vigna (2004);
  Horne, Maurer, Mitchell, and Dus (2008); Kaplan (2006), Kapur and Orszag (1999); Kingston
  and Thorp (2005); Milevsky (1998); Milevsky and Young (2002); Milevsky, Moore, and Young
  (2006); Mitchell, Poterba, Warshawsky, and Brown (1999); and Stabile (2003). A handful of
  researchers compare variable payout life-contingent products to other asset classes on a 'stand-
  alone' basis: for instance Blake, Cairns, and Dowd (2003) show that an equity-linked variable
  annuity would appeal to many retirees, as compared to either a simple phased withdrawal plan
  or a xed payout annuity. Feldstein and Ranguelova (2001) assume full annuitization at the
  beginning of retirement with an equity exposure of 60 percent. Brown, Mitchell, and Poterba
  (2001) demonstrate that variable payout annuities should be invested in ination-indexed bonds,
  though they nd that pure equity-linked annuities can generate greater utility than real annuities
  for a broad range of risk aversion parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulation, Milevsky (2002)
  analyzes the risk/return prole of variable payout annuity payout streams and compares them to
  xed and escalating annuities. He concludes that variable payout annuities may hedge ination
  better than escalating annuities. Koijen, Nijman, and Werker (2006) focus on the annuity risk
  during the accumulation period when full annuitization is required at age 65. Interestingly, they
  report that ination and interest rate risk have only a marginal impact on the welfare eects;
  for this reason we do not model ination and interest rate risk separately in what follows. None
  of these previous studies focuses on the asset location versus allocation pattern over the entire
  lifetime, allowing for income, health, and other consumption shocks, as here.
2 For instance interest rate risk is examined in Brennan and Xia (2000) and Wachter (2003);
  ination risk is analyzed by Campbell and Viceira (2001) and Brennan and Xia (2002). Changing
  risk premiums are considered in Brandt (1999), Campbell and Viceira (1999), Wachter (2002),
  and Campbell, Chan, and Viceira (2003). The long run implications of stock market volatility
  have been addressed by Chacko and Viceira (2006).

products that oer investors the opportunity to give up liquidity in exchange for a

survival-contingent premium known as the survival credit. One exception is Richard

(1975) who elegantly modeled longevity insurance; however that work did not take

into account irreversibility of the longevity product purchase, labor income risk, or

borrowing constraints.

   In what follows, we dene a lifelong survival-contingent product as a nancial

contract between an insured person and an insurer which, in exchange for an initial

premium, pays a regular periodic benet as long as the purchaser is alive (Brown

et al., 2001).   The essential attraction of such a payout benet is that, despite

uncertainty about one's remaining lifetime, the investor cannot outlive her assets

because she pools longevity risk across all purchasers in the pool (Mitchell et al.

1999). The provider invests the premiums in a portfolio of riskless and risky assets

which may be selected and directed by the buyer, and then pays to the retiree an

annual stream of income for life. As members of the pool die, the forfeited funds

are reallocated among survivors in the pool; this generates the survival credit that

rises with age. Of course, buying the payout annuity introduces illiquidity to the

investor's asset portfolio, as the initial premium cannot be recovered after purchase.

   Theoretical groundwork on annuitization dates back as far as Yaari's (1965)

seminal study.    Yaari suggested that a rational retiree lacking a bequest motive

would annuitize all her assets.   In his framework, the investor is exposed only to

mortality risk (other sources of risk due to interest rates, stocks, and ination are

omitted).   In an important recent extension of that work, Davido, Brown, and

Diamond (2005) conclude that a retiree will still fully annuitize nancial wealth in

the presence of a complete market if there is no bequest motive, when the net return

on the annuity is greater than that of the reference asset. Partial annuitization could

be optimal if the assumption about complete markets is relaxed, or if the investor

has a bequest motive. We extend prior literature by endogenizing the annuitization

decision and asset allocation of variable payout annuities in a dynamic portfolio

choice framework.

   Introducing such survival-contingent products into a life cycle framework implies

that the investor now must make both asset location and allocation decisions, decid-

ing not only how much of the risky and riskless asset to buy, but also how and when

to move into irreversible life-contingent payout products over the lifetime. To this

end, we derive an optimal endogenous asset allocation and gradual annuitization

strategy for a risk-averse retiree facing a stochastic lifetime with uncertain labor in-

come, who can hold her wealth in riskless bonds or risky stocks. Our paper extends

previous work by augmenting the investor's asset menu to include so-called variable

(2005); Damon, Spatt, and Zhang (2001, 2004); and Gomes, Michaelides, and Polkovnichenko
(2006).


                                           2
payout life annuities where payments vary with stock returns. Such annuity pur-

chases are irrevocable, but the investor can optimally rebalance both her liquid and

her illiquid portfolios. In this way, we endogenously derive the optimal dynamic as-

set allocation path over the life cycle, taking into account the potential to gain from

the equity premium as well as the survival credit.             Sensitivity analysis integrates

bequests and loads, as well as uninsurable income shocks (during the work life and

after retirement), housing, and medical expenses.            Also we analyze the impact of

sudden deteriorations in health status.

    Our ndings may be summarized as follows. The investor will optimally begin

purchasing these survival-contingent payout annuities at least by the middle of her

worklife, and she will continue to do so until (in expectation) she is fully annuitized in

her late 70s. The investor will also hold a large fraction of equities in both her liquid

and illiquid accounts when young, while the fraction in equity falls with age; this

pattern is consistent with previous studies which have not incorporated the value-

added of life contingent holdings. Adding the survival-contingent asset is shown to

have a large positive impact on welfare. When the product is priced fairly, a 40-year

old investor lacking any bequest motive would be willing to give up as much as half of

her liquid wealth to gain access to the life-contingent product. Even with a moderate

bequest motive, she would be willing to give up almost one-third of her wealth to gain

access to the survival-contingent benet. In other words, variable payout annuities

provide a considerably higher standard of living, and those who survive capture

not only the equity premium but also share in the survival credit. Our results are

robust to uninsurable shocks in housing expenses, income, and medical expenses,

as well as a sudden severe deterioration in health status. The contribution of this

article is to solve a realistically calibrated life cycle model of consumption, portfolio

location, and portfolio allocation with illiquid variable life annuities while taking

into account important uninsurable risk factors. One study which comes closest to

ours is Horne, Maurer, Mitchell, and Stamos (2007), which evaluates the role of

a life contingent asset in a model of asset location and allocation.               Nevertheless,
                                                                                                 4
that work limits its attention to decisionmaking only during the retirement period.

We contribute to the literature here by including the entire life cycle - from age 20

forward - and assess how labor income uncertainty and access to the survival credit

drives key decisions of interest. We also permit gradual timing of the purchase of

these survival-contingent assets as well as the asset allocation of both the liquid and

4 Fora review of prior literature see Horne, Maurer, Mitchell, and Dus (2008). One related
 study by Horne, Maurer, and Stamos (2008a) derives an optimal annuitization strategy when
 an investor is limited to holding bonds in her life contingent product; this generates a co-called
 constant payout or xed annuity. But that work does not allow equities in the annuity portfolio,
 as we do here.

illiquid portfolios.     In what follows, we briey describe our model. Next, we analyze

the asset location with and without product loads. We describe the pattern of asset

allocation. Subsequently we conduct a sensitivity analysis and examine the welfare

gains from expanding the asset space. A nal section concludes.




2 A Dynamic Asset Allocation and Location Model
2.1     Preference

We employ a time discrete model with     t â {0, ..., T + 1}, where t determines the
investor's adult age (computed as actual age minus 19). T is the investor's maximum

possible age. Individual preferences are characterized through the CRRA utility

function dened over a single non-durable consumption good; the value function Vt

is recursively dened as:

                                                                  1âÏ i
                              Ct1âÏ

                       Vt =   1âÏ
                                  + Î²Et pst Vt+1 + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ        and
                                                                                               (1)
                                   CT1âÏ
                                                h          1âÏ
                                                               i

    Here   Î²   is the time preference discount factor,       k   is the strength of the bequest

motive, and  Ï is the                       Ct is the amount of wealth consumed in

period  t and Bt+1 isthe level of bequest in t + 1 if the investor dies between t and

t + 1. The individual has subjective probabilities pst that she survives until t + 1
given that she is alive in t. Below, we permit her subjective survival probability

to potentially dier from the objective survival table assumed by the insurer. As

the investor gains utility from consumption and from leaving estate an additional

motive for liquid wealth is induced. Having a bequest motive              k>0    means that the

investor will always keep some wealth liquid (not annuitized), in order to be able to

bequeath the desired amount of wealth to potential heirs.




2.2     Labor Income

Several studies have recently highlighted the importance of including labor income
                              6
as a non-tradable asset ; in particular, stochastic labor income is shown to create

demand for buer stock saving early in life. Including stochastic income into our

  Salisbury (2003), Milevsky and Young (2006), and Milevsky and Young (2007). None of these en-
  dogenize the asset location and allocation decisions dynamically, as in the present paper. Browne
  et al. (2003) assess welfare losses from a stylized case where only xed/equity linked annuities
  can be exchanged for each other.

                                                 4
analysis is important in explaining the trade-o between the inexibility created

by the survival-contingent benet versus the return-enhancing survival credit when

labor income is uncertain.               We assume that the individual earns uninsurable real

labor income       Yt   during the accumulation phase                  (t â¤ K),     where   K   is the retirement

adult age. This risky labor income follows the process (as in Cocco et al., 2005):



                                              Yt = exp(f (t))Pt Ut ,                                             (2)

                                              Pt = Ptâ1 Nt ,                                                     (3)



where    f (t)   is a deterministic function of age to recover the hump-shaped income

prole observed empirically.                 Pt   is a permanent component with innovation                  Nt   and

Ut   is a transitory shock. The logarithms of                    Nt   and   Ut   are normally distributed with

means zero and with volatilitiesÏN , ÏU respectively. The shocks are assumed to be
uncorrelated. After retirement (t > K ), we assume that the individual will receive

a constant pension benet payment of Yt = Î¶ exp(f (K))PK , where Î¶ is the constant
                         7
replacement ratio .




2.3       Capital and Payout Annuity Market Parameters

The individual can invest via direct investments in the two nancial assets: riskless

bonds and risky stocks. The real bond gross return is denoted by                                Rf ,   and the real

risky stock return in        t   is   Rt .   The risky log-return        lnRt is also normally distributed
with expected return             Âµ   and volatility     Ï.   The      term Ïn (Ïu ) denotes the correlation

between the stock returns and the permanent (transitory) income shocks.

     Capital market securities can be either accessed via liquid savings or the illiquid

annuities.       But in contrast to direct stock or bond investments, annuities cannot

be sold by the individual, which makes them irreversible and creates illiquidity for

purchasers. Turning to the variable annuity, this is an insurance contract between

an annuitant and an insurer; the purchaser receives a pre-specied number of fund

units    nt   conditional on survival in each period                   t > 0.       When the price of a fund

unit at time      t is Zta , the survival-contingent income received from this annuity is
PÌt = nt Zta , t â (0, ..., T ). To receive this income stream, the annuitant must pay the

 and labor supply endogenously.

units the individual is supposed to receive.

    The evolutionary equation for the price of the fund unit can be written as follows:


                                                       a
                                            Zt+1 = Zt Rt+1 ,                                                (5)


            a
where     Rt+1  = (Rf + Ïta (Rt+1 â Rf )) is the growth rate of the underlying fund and
where     Ï a is the stock fraction inside the variable annuity. The investment return
will be random when the fund is invested in risky stocks. Accordingly, the income

evolution of a single annuity purchased previously can be recursively expressed as:


                                                           a
                                                      PÌt Rt+1
                                           PÌt+1 =             .                                            (6)
                                                     1 + AIR

This formulation shows that the annuity payout evolves according to a multiplicative
                                                        a                                a
random walk: it rises when the fund return             Rt+1 > 1 + AIR, decreases when Rt+1  <
                               a
1 + AIR, and is constant when Rt+1             equals the AIR. Sellers do not generally permit

changing the AIR after the annuity is purchased,                    implying that the annuity market

is incomplete. Nevertheless, the investor can still purchase new annuities throughout

the lifecycle, in order to align the income prole of all purchased annuities to her

8 This   expression shows that the discount rate is higher than the simple market return since
 [pa (t, s)]â1 > 1; this additional return increment is referred to as the survival credit. It arises from
 allocating deceased members' remaining assets among the surviving member of the insurance pool
9 The   assumed interest rate could in practice be time dependent but, in keeping with prior studies
 and industry practice, here we assume it is constant. For instance, a 4 percent AIR is widespread
 in the US insurance industry (c.f. the Vanguard and TIAA-CREF variable payout annuity web-
 sites); furthermore, the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) stipulates
 that the AIR may not exceed a nominal 5 percent.
10 The xed annuity can be dened as similar to the usual annuity factor whereby the riskless

   discount factor is replaced by the AIR Ts=1 (1+AIR)        sâ1 . In the case where the fund invests only

2.4       Wealth Accumulation

The household is assumed to decide annually how to spread her cash on hand,

Wt ,   across bonds, stocks, variable payout annuities, and consumption. Her budget

constraint is:

                                                Wt = St + At + Ct ,                                     (7)


where  St represents liquid saving comprised by her liquid bond and stock invest-
ments; At is the amount that the investor pays for annuity premiums in the current

period; and Ct represents consumption. Her cash on hand one period later is given

by:
                                                     s
                                          Wt+1 = St Rt+1 + Lt+1 + Yt+1 ,                                (8)

            S
where     Rt+1  = (Rf + Ïts (Rt+1 â Rf )) is growth rate of liquid                  saving;   Ïts   denotes

the    fraction of liquid saving St invested in risky stocks; Lt+1 is               the sum of annuity

payments which the investor receives from all previously purchased annuities; and

Yt+1    represents labor income.                The sum of all payments from previous annuities

purchased in           u â 0, 1, ..., t   is:


                                                     t
                                                     X
                                            Lt+1 =         Zt+1 (u)nt+1 (u)                             (9)
                                                     u=0


The price process of fund units of the annuity purchased at                    t = u can be written as:

                           Zt+1 (u) = Zt (u)(Rf + Ïta (Rt+1 â Rf )), Zu (u) = 1;                       (10)



where     Ïta   is the stock fraction at date         t inside the purchased annuities.    Substituting

(10) and (4) into (9) yields the recursive denition of the payout evolution:

            ï£®                                                        !â1 ï£¹

 Lt+1 = ï£°                 + At                                                                         (11)

                                                  (1 + AIR)sâtâ1

with    Zu (u) = 1;
      The recursive intertemporal budget restriction can be obtained as follows by

substituting (7) and (11) into (8):

If the retiree were to die at      t + 1,   her estate remaining would be given by   Bt+1 =

are precluded from borrowing against future labor, pension, and annuity income, by

imposing the following non-negativity restrictions:

2.5     Numerical Solution of the Optimization Problem

ity of the problem by one state variable. We note the normalized variables by the

lower-case letters of the variables already introduced:



                                         wt = st + at + ct                             (14)

The optimization problem is then given by:



                                                 max               v0 ,                (17)

where   v0 is the normalized value of utility from future consumption and the optimiza-
tion problem is subject to the restrictions listed above. Since analytical solutions to

this kind of problem do not exist, we solve the problem in a three-dimensional state

space    {w, l, t}    by backward induction (see the Technical Appendix). Although we

assume CRRA preferences, cash on hand                    w   cannot be omitted as a state variable

because illiquid annuities are included in the analysis. It is also necessary to include

the sum of current annuity payouts            l   as a state variable, because once purchased,

annuities can no longer be sold. Finally, the optimal policy depends on the retiree's

age because this inuences the price of newly purchased life annuities as well as the

present value of her remaining lifetime income.



2.6      Calibration

The individual lifespan is modeled from age 20 to age 100 (T                       = 81);   retirement

begins at age 65 (K         = 46).   As a result, the worklife can be, at most, 45 years long;

the maximum length of the retirement phase is 36 years. Preference parameters are

set to values standard in the life-cycle literature, including a coecient of relative

risk aversion     Ï   of 5, a discount factor     Î² = 0.96,       and initially, a zero bequest motive

(k = 0).    In sensitivity analyses we do allow positive bequest preferences                (k = 2)   as

empirical evidence on bequest motives is ambiguous (Bernheim et al., 1985; Hurd,

1987).    Parameter values of labor and pension income processes are set in accord

with Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005); our base case sets the deterministic labor

income function         f (t) and volatility parameters for transitory and          permanent labor

income shocks         (Ïu = 0.30 and Ïn = 0.1) to represent households               with high school

but no college education. The replacement ratio for Social Security pensions (but

exclusive of voluntary annuitization) is set at 68.2 percent.                   Mean equity returns

are set at    Âµ   = 4.41 percent and volatility              Ïs   = 16.86 percent, equivalent to an

expected return of 6 percent and standard deviation of 18 percent; the correlation

between stock returns and permanent (transitory) income shocks                       Ïn (Ïu )   is zero.

The assumed interest rate (AIR) is set to a real 2 percent, as is the case in practice.

With respect to the additional costs of buying annuities, the base case sets the

load at zero and assumes that annuities are priced actuarially fairly by equating

conditional survival probabilities of the investor and the insurer (as per the 2000

Population Basic mortality table). In extensions, we permit positive loads with the

expense factor        Î´ set to 2.38 percent (in line with industry leaders such as Vanguard);
and we implement asymmetric mortality distributions by using the 1996 US Annuity

2000 Aggregate Basic for annuity pricing and the 2000 Population Basic mortality

table to compute the investor's expected utility.

3 Asset Location and Allocation
3.1      Optimal Asset Location

In what follows, we rst consider no-load survival-contingent products. In such a

setting, we can isolate how stochastic labor income creates the need for liquid assets

early in the life cycle - even without a bequest motive              (k = 0).     We show how

the individual's need for such precautionary saving can inuence her demand for

annuitization, and how it delays the date at which full annuitization occurs. After

deriving the optimal policy for the no-bequest case, we then show how introducing a

moderate bequest motive        (k = 2)   induces further demand for liquid saving near the

end of life. Subsequently, we discuss how positive loads and asymmetric mortality

probabilities alter these predictions.

      No Loads. To illustrate the range of asset location and allocation strategies,
we next plot the optimal policies by age and cash on hand. Figure (1) illustrates

how the individual would act at each age, assuming she receives no payouts from
                                                                                                 12
previously-purchased annuities; subsequently we allow for gradual annuitization.

Panel (a) of Figure (1) shows that the investor with no bequest motive will optimally

purchase zero load life annuities at all ages with her net cash on hand. Because of

the need for precautionary saving to oset adverse stochastic labor income shocks,

the individual will also invest some portion of her liquid assets until about age

65. After that, all cash will be used to purchase life annuities, since she faces less

labor income uncertainty and the survival credit grows at older ages. It is also of

interest to note that wealthier people optimally devote more of their cash on hand to

annuities. Given their higher wealth levels, less liquidity is needed to protect against

labor income shocks; further, their higher annuity payouts compensate them for this

illiquidity.

      To illustrate how bequests might alter the analysis, Panel (b) indicates results

for   k = 2.      As before, we assume that the individual receives no payouts from

previously-purchased annuities.          Now she will need to keep more money in liquid

form, in case she experiences labor income shocks or early death. Consequently she

will optimally reserve a larger portion of her net cash on hand to meet these goals

(panel b). Nevertheless, similar to the no bequest case, partial annuitization is still

optimal, and in fact it could begin as early as age 20 if her cash on hand is high

enough. Interestingly, the annuitization fraction still exceeds 70 percent of net cash

on hand for the wealthiest individual, but it is a decreasing function of age because

the urgency of the bequest motive at older ages osets the rising survival credit.

12 Accordingly, Figure (1) cleanly illustrates the demand for de novo liquid versus illiquid annuity

Figure 1: Illustrative Optimal Dynamic Asset Location Outcomes Assuming
No Loads vs. Loads (top-bottom), No Bequest vs. Moderate Bequest Cases
(left-right). These gures represent optimal policies for annuity purchases, as a function
of cash on hand (w) and age; no prior annuitization is assumed (l = 0). For instance, in
Panel (a), a 20-year old with no bequest motive and with cash on hand w = 200 would
spend 70 percent of her net cash on annuities, and the rest on liquid investments. Panel (b)
shows that the 20-year old individual having a moderate bequest motive (k = 2) and the
same cash on hand (w = 200) would annuitize 40 percent. In Panel (c), the individual at
age 20 with no bequest motive and with cash on hand w = 200 would spend zero percent of
her wealth on annuities and devote all to nancial investments. Panel (d) shows that this
individual would also hold 100 percent liquid investments. Note: Calculations are based
on backward optimization of the value function given in (1). The base case individual
has CRRA utility with Ï = 5, Î² = 0.96; for the computations without loads: survival
probabilities are taken from the corresponding population mortality table to calculate
utility and price annuities. Loads for annuities are set to zero; for the computations with
loads: Survival probabilities are taken from the US 1996 Annuity 2000 mortality table
for females to price annuities and from the corresponding population mortality table to
calculate utility. Annuity loads are set to 2.38 percent. Yearly real stock returns are i.i.d.
log-normal distributed with mean 6 percent and standard deviation 18 percent. The real
interest rate and AIR are set to 2 percent.




                                                                                                                  11
At low wealth levels, by contrast, the annuitization fraction rises until the worker

retires; after that date, the pattern is complicated by the osetting eects of the

rising survival credit, on the one hand, and the desire to leave a bequest, on the

other.

    Loads. Next we explore how adding loads and mortality asymmetries inuences
optimal location choices. In particular, we assume that the annuity provider charges

a front load of 2.38 percent to account for administration, mortality changes, and
            13
reserves.        Further, we acknowledge that the annuity provider is aware of the fact

that healthier-than-average people are more inclined to purchase annuities (Mc-

Carthy and Mitchell, 2002).          This is implemented by taking survival probabilities

from the US female 1996 Annuity 2000 mortality table to price annuities and from

the corresponding population mortality table to calculate utility. Results appear in

Figure (1) panel (c) and panel (d) for         l=0    (no preexisting annuities) and assum-

ing no bequest motive (left side) versus a moderate bequest rationale (right hand

side). In particular, adding loads and asymmetric information induces the individ-

ual to defer annuitization to around the age of 50.              That is, she waits until the

survival credit is high enough to overcome the implicit and explicit costs related

to the annuity purchase. Nevertheless, an individual without a bequest motive will

fully annuitize after age 65, whereas she would only move to about a 60 percent

annuitization strategy if she had sucient wealth and a moderate bequest motive

(panels c versus d).



3.2        Optimal Asset Allocation and the Impact of Human Cap-

           ital

We next turn to a discussion of how the uncertain human capital inuences the

optimal allocation and location patterns. Figure (2) shows illustrative optimal stock

fractions in the combined annuity and nancial wealth portfolio for the no load, no

bequest case. Panel (a) provides the stock fraction as a function of age and cash on

hand (w ), and it can be seen that he stock fraction falls with the level of cash on

hand (w ). The rationale is that bonds are perceived as a closer substitute for human

capital than stocks. In turn, the decline in human capital over time is compensated

for by reducing the stock fraction in order to purchase bonds.

    Thus far, we have assumed that the individual has no income from pre-existing

annuities     (l = 0);   next we allow for gradual annuitization.       This means that she

can purchase new annuities as long as the budget constraint permits it, in which

case her asset allocation decision will depend on how much annuity income the

individual is already receiving.        Accordingly another dimension must be added to

13 This   corresponds to the industry average according to Vanguard.

Figure 2: Illustrative Optimal Stock Fractions in the Combined Annuity and
Financial Wealth Portfolios. These gures represent the relationship between the
individual's age and the optimal stock fraction in her combined annuity and nancial asset
holdings. The latter is dened as the stock fraction of her expected annuity wealth P V
(the present value of the remaining annuity payouts) plus the stock fraction of her nancial
wealth s, as a percent of nancial plus annuity wealth . Panel (a) shows how the total stock
fraction varies with age and cash on hand w; panel (b) shows how it varies with age and
pre-existing annuity payments l. Note: Calculations are based on backward optimization
of the value function given in (1). The base case individual has CRRA utility with Ï = 5, Î²
= 0.96; the computations are done for the no load, no bequest-case: survival probabilities
are taken from the corresponding population mortality table to calculate utility and price
annuities. Loads for annuities are set to zero. Yearly real stock returns are i.i.d. log-normal
distributed with mean 6 percent and standard deviation 18 percent. The real interest rate
and AIR are set to 2 percent.

the presentation.                                          Panel (b) of Figure (2) shows the stock fraction as a function

of age and payouts from pre-existing annuities (l ). The eects are quite similar to

panel (a).                                The more payouts one has, the less one must be invested in equity to

achieve the optimal split of augmented wealth. However, the stock fraction drops

much faster for the annuity payouts than for the level of cash on hand. Panel (b) also

shows the age eect due to the decreasing human capital. The older the individual,

the lower is the stock fraction.



3.3                                Expected Asset Allocation and Location

Next we conduct a Monte Carlo analysis of 100,000 life cycles to depict the expected

evolution of the investments in illiquid stocks and bonds (variable annuities), and

liquid equity and bonds, assuming that the individual behaves optimally over her

lifetime. Figure (3) traces expected asset allocation patterns for the same four cases,

with and without bequest motives and loads. For the no-load-no-bequest case (panel

a), the worker holds all her assets in non-annuitized form so as to protect against

labor income shocks; her liquid saving is fully invested in stocks. After about age



                                                                                                        13
60, she then shifts her holdings into an illiquid annuitized portfolio, after which time

she no longer has liquid wealth. She also begins to shift her optimal asset allocation

from illiquid stocks to illiquid bonds, because of her declining human capital. At

older ages, she would hold some 40 percent of her annuity portfolio in equities,

in expectation.   Interestingly, only a few bonds are ever held outside the annuity

portfolio. Including a bequest motive, as in Panel (b), we see that once again, the

bulk of her portfolio at younger ages is held in equity, but now the share of liquid

stocks is higher. Further, after about age 35, she again optimally shifts into liquid

bonds in order to safely accumulate her bequest during her early years when her

labor income is quite uncertain. Her fraction of wealth held in annuities now rises

to age 75, when about three-quarters of total wealth is annuitized. After that point,

her fraction of annuitized wealth shrinks, since survival probabilities decrease with

age. The fraction of liquid wealth becomes 100 percent again at the very end of the

life cycle. Overall, it is interesting that, with or without a bequest, the individual

will hold similar cumulative stock holdings in liquid and illiquid wealth. What is

dierent is that without a bequest, almost no bonds are held outside the annuity.

Having a bequest motive also leads the individual to invest substantial assets in

liquid bonds. Expected asset allocations are displayed in panel (c) and (d) of Figure

(3) for the case with loads and mortality asymmetry. The most notable dierence

is that now liquid bonds play a much larger role in the no-bequest (panel c) and

moderate bequest cases (panel b). Having a bequest motive means that liquid bonds

will play an important role all the way to the oldest possible age. At age 80, for

instance, the individual would be expected to hold about 70 percent of her wealth in

a variable annuity which is about two-thirds equities; her remaining non-annuitized

wealth would be mainly in bonds.




4 Sensitivity Analysis
We next ask how sensitive the results are to additional liquidity shocks. We use the

load, no-bequest case as the benchmark, and we ask how, at ages 30, 50, 60, and 80,

the baseline expected asset allocations compare with scenarios that include retire-

ment income shocks, housing expenditures, and health shocks. In the benchmark

case, liquidity shocks before retirement are the result of labor income risk (for more

detail see the Technical Appendix).

   Risky Retirement Income Streams. To analyze the impact of adding risk to the
retirement income stream on the need for liquidity reserves, we multiply what was

previously a constant retirement income ow      Yt = Î¶exp(f (K))PK    by a transitory

Figure 3: Optimal Expected Asset Allocation Over the Life Cycle Assuming
No Loads vs. Loads (top-bottom), No Bequest vs. Moderate Bequest Cases
(left-right). Panel (a) plots the expected trajectory for the fraction held in stocks inside
the annuity (illiquid) and outside the annuity (liquid) for a female with a maximum life
span of age 100, having no initial endowment and no bequest; in panel (b) the individual
has a bequest motive (k = 2). In Panel (c), the individual has no bequest motive while
in panel (d) the individual has a bequest motive of (k=2). In panel (a) and panel (b)
annuities have zero loads, while in panel (c) and (d) annuities are loaded. Note: Expected
values are computed by simulating 100,000 life-cycle paths based on the optimal policies
derived by the numerical optimization. The base case individual has CRRA utility with Ï
= 5, Î² = 0.96; for the computations without loads: survival probabilities are taken from
the corresponding population mortality table to calculate utility and price annuities. Loads
for annuities are set to zero; for the computations with loads: Survival probabilities are
taken from the US 1996 Annuity 2000 mortality table for females to price annuities and
from the corresponding population mortality table to calculate utility. Annuity loads are
set to 2.38 percent. Yearly real stock returns are i.i.d. log-normal distributed with mean
6 percent and standard deviation 18 percent. The real interest rate and AIR are set to 2
percent.

     We set the volatility of retirement income equal to the volatility during the

worklife       Ïr = Ïu = 0.3.   The results (Table (1), Row 2) show that the individual will

hold only slightly more liquid wealth, but the optimal fraction of annuitized wealth

is around 95 percent. This result indicates that transitory retirement income shocks

can largely be absorbed by the annuity income stream.                     Also the asset allocation

does not dier substantially from that of the benchmark case.

     To explore the sensitivity of results to permanent retirement income shocks, we

allow for a disastrous permanent retirement income downturn of 75 percent which

occurs with a probability           Ï   of 5 percent in each year, but it can only happen once.
14
     Such a shock can be thought of as signicant background risk, or it could be

conceived of as large medical bills incurred late in the life cycle. Row 3 of Table (1)

shows that annuitization rates in this scenario are similar to the benchmark case.

What responds, however, is the asset allocation inside the variable annuity: now the

bond fraction inside the variable annuity is substantially larger than before. In other

words, the individual will adjust for an anticipated bad income draw by increasing

the portion of xed permanent annuity income.

     Housing Expenditures. Next we introduce shocks to housing expenses by em-
ploying the polynomial function estimated by Gomes and Michaelides (2005) from

the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Specically, housing expenses                         ht ,   dened as

the annual mortgage and rent payments relative to labor income                       Y,   are given by:



                         ht = max(AÌ + BÌ1 Â· age + BÌ2 Â· age2 + BÌ3 Â· age3 , 0),                      (19)



where     AÌ   = 0.703998,    BÌ1   = -0.0352276,   BÌ2   = 0.0007205, and     BÌ3   = -0.0000049 (we

truncate       ht   to zero for age = 80). As Row (4) of Table (1) shows, such deterministic

housing expenses reduces the annuitization fraction by 2 percentage points compared

to the benchmark case. If we add a stochastic component to the housing expenditure

consisting of a lognormal shock:

                                                                

                                                         2

with   Ïh = 0.25,       then disposable income is now given as          (1 â hÌt )Yt   where:



                                                hÌt = ht Ht                                           (21)

14 Thistype of sensitivity analysis is similar to that carried out in Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout
  (2005) where they analyzed the impact of disastrous events on the asset allocation decision
  including stocks and bonds.

     percentages; expected values are computed based on 100,000 Monte-Carlo simulations by using the optimal policies. All results are for a female
     having a maximum life-span of age 100, having no initial annuity endowment, a CRRA utility function with Ï = 5 and Î² = 0.96, and AIR = 2 percent.
     Loads are set to Î´ = 0.0238 and the retiree faces mortality asymmetries (2000 Population female Basic vs. 1996 US Annuity 2000 Basic female
     mortality table). In Row (2), a transitory shock with a standard deviation of 30 percent is added to the retirement income. Row (3) includes the
     possibility of a disastrous permanent income drop of 75 percent of the retirement income with 5 percent probability. Row (4) includes deterministic
     housing expenses. Row (5) adds to (4) a transitory shock in housing expenses with a standard deviation of 25 percent. Row (6) aggregates the

Figure 4: Illustration of Health Shock at Age 65. To model the drop in survival
rates, we assume that the individual's force of mortality becomes 4 times the force of
mortality implied by the 1996 US Annuitant Mortality table if a health shock occurs.

It is shown in Table (1), Row 5, that the fraction of annuitized wealth is again quite

robust to this innovation. In Row (6), we combine both the transitory income and

housing shocks (equations 18 and 20). Remarkably, the fraction of annuitized wealth

never drops more than 10 percent below that of the benchmark case.

   Health Shocks. To implement health shocks, we assume that, in each year during
retirement, a sudden decline in the survival rate and a permanent 75 percent drop

in retirement benets occurs with a 5 percent probability. This scenario would be

equivalent to a sudden severe deterioration in health status accompanied by a spike

in medical or nursing home costs. To model the poorer survival rate, we assume that

the individual's force of mortality becomes 4 times that in the 1996 US Annuitant

Mortality table (see Figure 4).                                               Thus, survival rates after a health shock can be

expressed as   pst = (pat )4 ;                                     if, for instance, a health shock occured at age 65, the

remaining expected lifetime would fall from 22 to 12 years. Clearly a lower survival

rates means makes annuities less attractive. Nevertheless, the resulting reduction in

the fraction of wealth annuitized is remarkably small (Table 1, row 7).




5 Expected Life Cycle Proles
Next we turn to an analysis of the expected evolution of key decision variables over

the life cycle; results are from a Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 life cycles.

   No Loads.     First we assume no loads, and show in Figure (5) that expected

consumption rises remarkably steeply with age - in fact, so steeply (in expectation)

that the retiree's living standard greatly exceeds that she had during her worklife

Figure 5: Optimal Expected Consumption, Labor Income, Saving, and Annuity
Purchases Over the Life Cycle Assuming No Loads vs. Loads (top-bottom),
No Bequest vs. Moderate Bequest Cases (left-right). Panel (a) plots expected
trajectories for a female with a maximum life span of age 100, having no initial endowment,
in panel (b) the individual has a bequest motive (k = 2). In Panel (c), the individual has
no bequest motive while in panel (d) the individual has a bequest motive of (k = 2). In
panel (a) and panel (b) annuities have zero loads, while in panel (c) and (d) annuities are
loaded. Note: Expected values are computed by simulating 100,000 life-cycle paths based
on the optimal policies derived by the numerical optimization. The base case individual
has CRRA utility with Ï = 5, Î² = 0.96; for the computations without loads: survival
probabilities are taken from the corresponding population mortality table to calculate
utility and price annuities. Loads for annuities are set to zero; for the computations with
loads: Survival probabilities are taken from the US 1996 Annuity 2000 mortality table
for females to price annuities and from the corresponding population mortality table to
calculate utility. Annuity loads are set to 2.38 percent. Yearly real stock returns are i.i.d.
log-normal distributed with mean 6 percent and standard deviation 18 percent. The real
interest rate and AIR are set to 2 percent.

(panel a). Having a rising consumption prole might seem counterintuitive given the

investor's time preference, but it is driven by the survival credit generating rising

payouts from her previously-purchased variable annuities. Of course these are, in

turn, counterbalanced by their illiquidity; people cannot borrow against annuity

payout streams so they cannot use annuity payouts to smooth their consumption




                                                                                                                                               19
paths earlier in life.

    We also see that, when she has no bequest motive, the individual accumulates

rather low amounts of precautionary saving to cover transitory income shocks up

to age 65 (panel a).     She begins buying annuities in her early 20's, and her long-

term permanent income risk is diversied by the annuity income. Annuity income

also cushions the drop in income when transitioning to retirement.           After age 65,

her annuity payouts are suciently high that no liquid wealth is needed.             In the

moderate bequest case (panel b), once again pre-retirement consumption is lower

than post-retirement consumption which is mainly nanced by variable annuities

- though now, it is optimal to postpone a rst annuity purchase to age 27.             The

bequest motive drives a higher demand for liquid wealth; now, the rst 7 years of

the work life are used to build up an estate to bequeath to the heirs, instead of

purchasing annuities.

    Including Loads. Turning to the impact of loads, it is clear that even without
a bequest motive, saving levels now surge to much higher levels.            Obviously the

uncertainty of labor income cannot explain this dierence; rather, the individual

now accumulates liquid wealth in order to nance consumption until such time that

the survival credit improves enough to compensate her for the additional annuity

loads. This occurs around age 50, and later she moves all her saving into annuities.

Having a bequest motive moderates the shift to annuities, so as to preserve an estate

on the individual's death.




6 Welfare Analysis
To assess how consumers might value access to payout annuity products, compared

to the asset universe which includes only stock and bond investments, we now turn

to a welfare analysis. Specically, we compute the equivalent increase in nancial

wealth that would be needed to boost the investor's total expected utility given no

access to annuity products, to the level she could attain with access to the survival-
                   15
contingent assets.

    Table (2) reports the wealth equivalent values of calculations undertaken for

every year of life remaining, conditional on survival, for both a 40-year old and an

80-year old female. The equivalent increase in nancial wealth needed to compensate

the investor if she had no access to a xed annuity appears in the left column, and

for variable annuity products in the right column.         The results show, rst, that

all individuals are substantially better o if they can access survival-contingent

products, be they xed or variable in nature (Rows 1 and 2). Second, the utility

15 To compare xed and variable annuities on an equal basis, we set the AIR to 2 percent and
  derive the respective optimal policies.

gains are greatest for variable payout annuities. For instance, at age 40, an individual

facing realistic insurance loads but having no bequest motive would value a xed

annuity at 12 percent of her wealth, compared to having no annuity access, and a

variable annuity at 38 percent (Row 3). If she also has a bequest motive (Row 4),

the value of having access to a xed annuity is less, at 10 percent, but still half as

much again, 15 percent, for the variable annuity. Obviously, the investor would be

much better o if the insurance were priced fairly.     For instance, if a government

could mandate no-load annuities, someone with no bequest motive would be willing

to pay 21 percent of her wealth to gain access to a xed annuity and 53 percent for

a variable annuity (Row 1). It is also interesting that welfare gains for the 80 year

old lacking a bequest motive are lower, compared to the 40 year old, but they still

remain substantial: access to a variable annuity product is worth 28 percent of her

wealth in the actuarially fair case.




7 Conclusion
This paper contributes to the portfolio choice literature by integrating survival-

contingent payout products in the investor's menu, while incorporating uninsurable

shocks to housing, medical expenses, health, and income during the worklife and

retirement. We generate optimal asset location patterns, indicating how much to

hold in liquid versus illiquid assets over the lifetime, and also asset allocation paths,

explaining how to optimally invest in stocks versus bonds. By contrast, prior stud-

ies on annuitization strategies have focused mainly on xed annuities, or products

where only nominal bonds are held inside the illiquid annuity investment. Accord-

ingly, these studies have not acknowledged the substantial welfare-enhancing aspect

of variable payout annuities. We show that the investor will gradually move money

from her liquid saving into annuities as she nears retirement, and indeed she con-

tinues to do so until her late 70s. She will also optimally hold a high percentage of

equities in both the liquid and illiquid accounts while young, with the fraction in eq-

uity falling with age. This pattern is consistent with previous studies which have not

integrated the survival credit of life-contingent holdings. Sensitivity analysis shows

that uninsurable shocks increase the preference for liquid savings only marginally. In

addition, access to annuities allows the individual to capture the equity premium as

well as the survival credit, which enhances her welfare substantially. If the product

is fairly priced, a 40-year old investor with no bequest motive is willing to give up as

much as half of her liquid wealth to gain access to the life-contingent product. Even

with a moderate bequest motive, she would be willing to give up almost one-third

of her wealth to gain access to annuities. When reasonable loads and asymmetric

mortality distributions are included, the utility gains are still worth over one-third



                                           22
of nancial wealth.   In other words, this payout product provides a considerably

higher standard of living for those who survive, as they can benet not only from

the equity premium but they will also share in the survival credit. In future work we

hope to extend this analysis in several directions. One possible addition would be

to include ination and interest rate risk while keeping real annuities and including

nominal payout annuities as well.   It may also be worthwhile to endogenize labor

supply. Housing might be modeled endogenously to understand how much the indi-

vidual saves in housing vis-aÌ-vis life annuities. Life insurance could be included in

order to understand how annuities are aected by the interference of bequest and life

insurance. In general, however, it is clear that introducing survival-contingent pay-

outs into the life cycle framework adds many interesting dimensions to the investor's

asset location and allocation decisions.

8 Appendix (A): Technical Details
The irreversibility of the annuity purchase translates into a real option problem.

Due to the irreversibility it is necessary to record how much annuities have been

purchased to date.        We are required to introduce an additional state variable for

the base case. In order to reduce the problem by one state variable, we normalize

every evolutionary equation by the permanent income component which itself is a

state variable.      For solving the gradual annuitization problem after omitting the

permanent income component, it is necessary to construct a three dimensional state

space because the optimal policies still depend on three state variables: normalized

cash on hand      wt    which represents the level of liquid nancial wealth, normalized

annuity payouts from previously purchased annuities lt , and age                       t.   The continuous

state variables cash on hand         wt   and annuity payouts          lt   have to be discretized and

the only true discrete state variable left is age             t.   For most computations, we use a

45x45x81 grid with a log-scale for both the normalized wealth and for normalized

annuity payout. Moving backward along the                 t   dimension we calculate the optimal

policy and the value of the value function for each grid point. After applying a series

of monotonic transformation and normalizing the value function by the permanent

income, we can compute the new expectation operator as:

               RRR                                     b1âÏ 1âÏ
                     (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ

                                                      )Ï(Rt+1 )dRt+1              if   tâ¥K

The expectation operator is computed by resorting to Gaussian quadrature inte-

gration and the optimization is done by numerical constrained minimization. We

inter(extra-)polate the policy and value functions for points which do not lie on

the grid.    Therefore, we compute the policy functions for gradual annuitization

ÏS (w; l; t), ÏA (w; l; t), pr(w; l; t), c(w; l; t)   and the value function           v(w; l; t)   by cubic-

splines interpolation.




For the case of consumption shocks in retirement, we change the computation of

the expectation operator to:

                   RR                                    b1âÏ  1âÏ
                        (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ
                                                         t+1
                                                             )Nt+1 Â·         if   tâ¥K
                                                                                                         (23)

                                                  24
For the housing shocks, we have to alter the expectation operator as follows:

    RRRR                                      b1âÏ  1âÏ
             (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ
                                              t+1
                                                  )Nt+1 Â·                           if    t<K
    Ï(Nt+1 , Ut+1 , Rt+1 , Ht+1 )dNt+1 dUt+1 dRt+1 dHt+1                                              (24)
    RR                                 b1âÏ
       (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ
                                        t+1
                                            )Ï(Rt+1 , Ht+1 )dRt+1 dHt+1             if    tâ¥K

If housing shocks and retirement income shocks are combined the expectation oper-

ator for the retirement period changes to

                       RRR                                    b1âÏ
                             (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ
                                                              t+1
                                                                  )Â·   if   tâ¥K
                                                                                                      (25)
                       Ï(Ut+1 , Rt+1 , Ht+1 )dUt+1 dRt+1 dHt+1

For the medical consumption shock we have to introduce another binary state vari-

able   I.   The medical consumption shock leads to a permanent reduction in retirement

income with a certain probability. In total, we have four state variables: normalized

cash on hand, normalized annuity payouts, medical consumption state, and age.

The new binary state variable is (I          = 1) in case the medical consumption shock has
occurred and is zero otherwise. In order to attain the value function from the future

period, we use 4 dimensional cubic-splines inter(extra-)polation. Let                     Ï   denote the

probability that the medical consumption shock occurs. If no medical consumption

shock has occurred previously (I           = 0),   then the expectation operator in retirement

can be written as a weighted sum

                   R                                b1âÏ
                  Ï (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ

                                                         )Ï(Rt+1 )dRt+1
                                                                                                      (26)
                           R                                b1âÏ
                  +(1 â Ï) (âpst (âÎ½t+1 )1âÏ + (1 â pst )k 1âÏ
                                                             t+1
                                                                 )Ï(Rt+1 )dRt+1

If the medical consumption shock has already occurred                       (I = 1)      previously, the

expectation operator for retirement period can be stated as in (22). Then the optimal

policies and the value function are given by              Ï a (w; l; I; t), Ï s (w; l; I; t), a(w; l; I; t),
c(w; l; I; t), and v(w; l; I; t), respectively.      If we add health shocks, we need to replace

the subjective survival probabilities in the expectation operator by lower survival

probabilities for the case that a medical shock occurs or has occurred.
