Protectionism Isn’t CounterCyclic (anymore)

                                             ABSTRACT

Conventional wisdom holds that protectionism is counter-cyclic; tariffs, quotas and the like grow during
recessions. While that may have been a valid description of the data before the Second World War,
it is now inaccurate. In the post-war era, protectionism has not actually moved counter-cyclically.
Tariffs and non-tariff barriers simply do not rise systematically during cyclic downturns. I document
this new stylized fact with a panel of data covering over 60 countries and 30 years, using eighteen
measures of protectionism and seven of business cycles. I also provide some hints as to why protectionism
is no longer counter-cyclic.

1. In the Beginning

        It is widely accepted that protectionism is counter‐cyclic; tariffs, non‐tariff barriers and the like
are more numerous and/or intense during recessions. This modest paper has a single objective: refuting
that hypothesis. I wish to establish a new stylized fact; during the post‐war era, protectionism has not
been counter‐cyclic.

Conventional Wisdom

         The entire political‐economy literature without exception (to the best of my knowledge), agrees
that protectionism is counter‐cyclic. The abstract of Bagwell and Staiger (2003) begins “Empirical
studies have repeatedly documented the countercyclical nature of trade barriers”; for support, they
provide citations of eight papers which “all conclude that the average level of protection tends to rise in
recessions and fall in booms.” Rodrik (1995, p. 1486) states “That the average tariff level tends to rise in
recessions is a robust finding in the literature…” Costinot (2009, p. 1011) states “One very robust finding
of the empirical literature on trade protection is the positive impact of unemployment on the level of
trade barriers. The same pattern can be observed across industries, among countries, and over time …”
McKeown (1984, p. 215) states: “That tariff levels and economic growth rates tend to move in opposite
directions is a venerable piece of conventional wisdom. As early as 1879, Gustav Schmoller, the famous
economist of the German historical school, noted that, ‘The times of boom, of increasing exports, of
new openings of overseas markets, are the natural free trade epochs, while the reverse is true in times
of foreign slumps, of depressions, of crisis.’”1

        Most of the literature that studies the determinants and incidence of protectionism is cross‐
sectional in nature.2 That is, it addresses questions like “Why do certain industries/areas/interest
groups receive protectionism, while others do not?” Perhaps the most prominent recent example is
Grossman and Helpman (1994), a seminal paper which has generated a number of empirical tests,
including Goldberg and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000). By way of contrast, the
focus of this paper is on the time‐series variation of protectionism; I ask “How does protectionism
respond to business cycle fluctuations?”

Received Wisdom

        The literature provides evidence that protectionism was counter‐cyclic before the Second World
War. Hansen (1990) uses American pre‐WWII data and shows that (p. 539) “During economic
recessions, the federal government posted taxes [tariffs] 4.69 percentage points higher than it did
during expansions.” Gallarotti (1985) supports her theory of counter‐cyclic protectionism using pre‐
WWI data from Germany, the UK and the USA; McKeown (1984) uses similar data to support his closely‐
related theory. Magee and Young (1987) find that tariffs rise with unemployment using standard
regression techniques and data from twentieth‐century American presidential administrations.

         Bohara and Kaempfer (1991a) use American data from 1890 to 1970. They estimated a VAR
that includes: a) the real trade balance; b) the log of unemployment; c) the growth of real GNP; d)
inflation; and e) the growth rate of the average tariff on dutiable imports. They conclude that there is

                                                     1
significant Granger causality to tariff levels from all variables except the trade balance. Curiously, their
impulse response functions have signs that are “sensible” in the very short run (meaning that higher
unemployment and lower GDP are associated with higher tariffs), but are reversed within a few years.
Bohara and Kaempfer (1991b) use comparable data but with a 3‐variable VAR, excluding the trade
balance and inflation. In this context they find no significant effect of unemployment on tariffs, and
they also find that higher growth is associated with higher tariffs.

          A handful of papers use post‐war time‐series data to link protectionism to the state of the
macro‐economy. Takacs (1981) uses annual American data between 1949‐1979 on instances when the
USITC is petitioned for a temporary tariff, quota or other kind of protection. She finds that the use of
the “escape clause” is not correlated with cyclic (or trend) measures of economic activity. Feinberg
(2005) finds weak evidence of cyclicality in American anti‐dumping petitions, especially outside steel.
Grilli (1988) uses 18 annual observations for both the EC and the USA between 1969 and 1986, and two
measures of protectionism, the log of import penetration and petitions for anti‐dumping, subsidy‐
countervailing and safeguard actions. He is able to link these to the log real exchange rate and the
growth in industrial production (for the US) or the change in unemployment (for the EC). Grilli uses 2SLS
with a Cochrane‐Orcutt procedure, a time trend and dummy variables; he finds evidence of counter‐
cyclic movement in non‐tariff barriers. This is a heavily parameterized approach, long on assumptions
and short on sensitivity analysis and data. Knetter and Prusa (2003) find a linkage between antidumping
filings and macroeconomic factors. They use multilateral and bilateral data for Australia, Canada, the EU
and the USA between 1980 and 1998. Their particular focus is the real exchange rate; they find that
appreciation increases filings significantly. They also find that the effect of the three‐year growth in real
GDP is insignificant in multilateral data, but significantly negative in bilateral data. Finally, Bown and
Crowley (2012) use data for five major economies to estimate the effects of macroeconomic fluctuations
on protectionism. They exploit a recent quarterly bilateral data set that is dis‐aggregated by product.
While their main focus is on the responsiveness of temporary trade barriers to foreign growth, they find
evidence that protection is counter‐cyclic, especially for the United States and Australia. I take the latter
two findings seriously and consider anti‐dumping and other temporary trade barriers further below.
Still, the evidence of counter‐cyclic postwar protectionism seems less than overwhelming.



2. The Story in Pictures

         I start by exploiting the data set tabulated in the data appendix of Magee and Young (1987).
This provides series for the natural logarithm of the American tariff and unemployment rates (among
other variables), averaged over presidential administrations between 1904 and 1984. I provide time
series plots of these series in the top‐left graph of Figure 1. The graph immediately below is a scatter‐
plot of the tariff (on the ordinate) against unemployment (on the abscissa). This shows a positive
relationship over the whole period; counter‐cyclic protection. The sample is split into two in the scatter‐
plots to the right. Above, the data show a positive relationship between 1906 and 1942; high
unemployment in the 1930s tends to coincide with high tariffs. This relationship is strikingly reversed in
the graph below which scatters tariffs against unemployment for the period between 1946 and 1982.

                                                      2
Since World War Two, high American unemployment seems to coincide with low American tariffs;
protectionism seems to be, if anything, cyclic.

         This finding is not particularly sensitive. The census bureau provides annual data on American
duties (measured as a percentage of dutiable imports) between 1869 and 1997, when the series was
discontinued. This can be compared to (the natural logarithm of American) real GNP, taken from the
BEA and extended back by Balke and Gordon.3 The raw series on duties and GNP are plotted in the top‐
left graph of Figure 2; NBER recessions are also marked on the GNP plot.4 Both duties and aggregate
output trend strongly; accordingly, de‐trended series for both duties and output (after plain‐vanilla
double exponential univariate de‐trending) are plotted beneath.5 The scatter‐plots on the right show
again that the relationship between the two series seems to be different before and after the end of the
Second World War. Before WWII, de‐trended GNP and protectionism are negatively correlated;
business cycle upturns tend to coincide with lower protectionism.6 However, as can be seen in the
lower‐right scatter‐plot, this relationship is reversed after WWII when business cycle peaks and high
duties appear together.7

        Of course, the evidence in Figures 1 and 2 is by no means definitive. At least two issues spring
immediately to mind. First, the figures only use American data. Second, the only measure of
protectionism in the figures is the aggregate tariff rate (measured more or less directly), when non‐tariff
barriers (NTBs) are widely considered to be an important features of modern protectionism.8 One
plausible way to get around both of these problems is to use more global measures of both
protectionism and the business cycle. Accordingly, Figure 3 provides a time series plots of annual global
GDP growth and the number of commercial disputes initiated under the GATT/WTO dispute settlement
system.9 This is by no means a perfect measure of protectionism. Complaints are not formally initiated
against all protectionism, are not equally important, and are not randomly initiated across countries.
The inadequacies of the GATT system lead to considerable reform under the WTO in 1995. Still, this
measure covers both the world and NTBs.10 The message from Figure 3 is that, for the world as a whole,
global growth is essentially uncorrelated with the initiation of disputes under the multilateral
mechanism set up precisely to handle protectionism.11

         One of the most striking features of Figure 3 is at its extreme right; the “Great Recession” of
2009 was a collapse of global growth without any corresponding uptick in trade disputes. This is a
striking observation; the most serious recession in generations does not seem to have resulted in more
protectionism, despite an unprecedented collapse in international trade.12 The behavior of
protectionism around the Great Recession is worthy of further investigation.

        Figure 4 provides a series of scatter‐plots of “Trade Freedom” against de‐trended aggregate
output. The former is one component of the Heritage Foundation’s “Index of Economic Freedom.” Like
the overall index, the index of trade freedom is estimated annually and varies between 0 (North Korea)
and 100 (Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Switzerland currently share the highest score of 90). It is “a
composite measure of the absence of tariff and non‐tariff barriers that affect imports and exports of
goods and services” and is freely available recently for 155 countries.13 I scatter trade freedom (on the
ordinate) against de‐trended real GDP (on the abscissa, using Penn World Table 7 data for the latter).

                                                     3
Since series can de‐trended in many ways, I present results from four standard techniques: a) Hodrick‐
Prescott filtering; b) Christiano‐Fitzgerald filtering; c) residuals from a linear time trend; and d) annual
growth rates.14

         The top‐left graph of Figure 4 scatters trade freedom against (the natural logarithm of real PPP‐
adjusted) GDP, de‐trended via the Hodrick‐Prescott filter. The observations are averaged over 2004‐06
to get an idea of what the relationship was like in the period before the Great Recession. The
relationship between trade freedom and de‐trended output is insignificantly negative. As the graph
immediately below shows, this relationship becomes even more negative if one examines 2009 data;
the few countries above trend tend to have less trade freedom. The change between the two periods of
time is portrayed in the bottom‐left graph; this scatters the difference between 2009 and 2004‐06 trade
freedom against the difference between 2009 and 2004‐06 HP‐filtered GDP. The relationship is
negligible; the effect of the Great Recession on a country’s output is uncorrelated with its change in
trade freedom. This effect is not driven by the HP‐filter; the other three sets of graphs (arranged in
columns) use different de‐trending techniques and show similar results. The most positive is that for the
Christiano‐Fitzgerald filter, which shows a slight positive relationship between the change in trade
freedom and the change in de‐trended output (the correlation coefficient is a modest .17).

        The data I have examined thus far show no obvious strong relationship between protectionism
and the business cycle, at least for the period since World War Two. It is especially striking that the
Great Recession of 2009 does not coincide with any obvious increase in protectionism. Of course, there
may be some more subtle relationship waiting to be uncovered. The figures are bivariate; no account is
taken of other factors. Dynamics have been ignored, as have other measures of protectionism and the
business cycle. Accordingly, I now turn to more comprehensive statistical analysis.



3. The Story in Tables

Output and WTO Dispute Initiation

         I begin by tabulating results in Table 1 from the following regression:



                 NumDispit = {αi} + {βt} + γBCit + εit                                                (1)



where: NumDispit is the number of WTO disputes initiated by country i in year t; {α} and {β} are
comprehensive sets of country‐ and time‐specific fixed effects respectively; BCit is the deviation of (the
natural logarithm of) real GDP from its trend; and ε is a well‐behaved residual that represents the host
of other factors determining dispute initiation. Real GDP is extracted from the Penn World Table 7.0
(available through 2009); it is adjusted for PPP deviations. I estimate this equation between 1995 and
2009 using OLS, and present estimates of the coefficient of interest, γ, along with its standard error.

                                                         4
This set‐up is reduced‐form in nature, so structural claims are inappropriate; it is unclear whether γ
reflects the demand for protectionism, its supply, or both.15 I restrict myself to countries that have filed
at least one WTO dispute during the sample period and drop individual EU member countries (EU
member states do not file disputes individually).

         The number of disputes initiated through the WTO’s dispute settlement body is a natural
measure of protectionism. The system is designed to be accessible to all WTO members and covers all
manner of trade quarrels. However, I use other measures of protectionism below to check the
sensitivity of my results. The WTO dispute settlement literature does not focus on business cycles.16

         My results are presented in five columns, one for each de‐trending technique: a) Baxter‐King
filtering; b) Christiano‐Fitzgerald filtering; c) Hodrick‐Prescott filtering; d) annual growth rates; and e)
residuals from a linear time trend. Consider the top‐left entry in Table 1. This indicates that the effect
of an increase in output above the trend level of real GDP (de‐trended with the Baxter‐King filter) on
WTO dispute initiation is negative but negligible, both economically and statistically. The cells
immediately to the right show that this (non‐)result does not depend on the precise de‐trending
method. Succinctly, there is no evidence here that protectionism is counter‐cyclic.

         The rows beneath indicate that this result is insensitive to a number of underlying assumptions.
For instance, the results are robust to dropping time‐specific fixed effects, country‐specific effects, or
both. Adding an interaction between de‐trended output and a linear trend does not change the results,
nor does including all countries (instead of just those which have filed at least one dispute with the
WTO). Removing outliers from the data set – defined as those with a residual that is at least three
standard errors from zero – does have a slight effect. For this perturbation, two coefficients are
significantly different from zero at the 5% level and all the coefficients are consistently signed. These
coefficients are positive, providing (weak) evidence that countries above trend initiate more disputes;
again, pro‐cyclic protectionism. Restricting the sample to countries without high (or non‐high) income
or large populations also does not alter the result.

         Perhaps the relationship between protectionism and the business cycle is not
contemporaneous? To investigate, I sequentially substitute in place of contemporaneous de‐trended
output: a) the first lag of de‐trended output, b) the second lag, and then c) a moving average of these
lags. These perturbations provide little evidence of counter‐cyclic protectionism; the coefficients tend if
anything to become more positive. Likewise, using Poisson estimators instead of least squares (to take
account of the count nature of the regressand) or shifting to three‐year averages (in place of annual
data) does not strengthen the case for counter‐cyclic protectionism. The bottom row shows that using
historical evidence on disputes initiated under the GATT (as opposed to the WTO) also changes little.

Other Measures of Protectionism

        Initiating a dispute with the WTO is one manifestation of protectionism, but by no means the
only. In Table 2, I replace it with more than a dozen alternative measures. None of these is a perfect
measure of protectionism; the hope is that they are collectively persuasive.


                                                      5
          The results presented in Table 2 rely on the same estimation strategy as used in Table 1, and
simply substitute alternative measures of protectionism for the dependent variable. For instance, the
first row uses the number of anti‐dumping cases initiated; these are insignificantly related (but
positively) to business cycle fluctuations.17 This lack of significant counter‐cyclicality also characterizes
other temporary trade barriers, such as countervailing duties and safeguards.18 I also use a variety of
protectionist measures available from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) including:
the percentage of all products with protection at the bound tariff limit; the simple average of the bound
rate (averaged across all products); customs duties measured as percentages of goods imports, tax
revenue, and output; export taxes measured as a percentage of tax revenue; the share of tariff lines
(across products) with international peaks; and tariffs measured four ways (both applied and most‐
favored nation rates, averaged both simply and with trade weights.) I also use the index of trade
freedom (from Figure 4) and the number of regional trade agreements either initiated or completed (the
latter is taken from Moser and Rose, 2011). At the bottom of the table, I employ the common factor
extracted from seven different measures of protectionism using the method of principal factors.19

         The results from Table 2 are weak. Of the eighty‐five coefficients, only four are significantly
different from zero at the 1% significance level, and an additional four at the 5% level. The few
significant coefficients all rely on the most unreliable method of de‐trending GDP (residuals after the
effect of a linear trend has been removed). Different measures of protectionism also give inconsistent
results (protectionism rises significantly during good times when measured by bound rate averages or
export taxes). Succinctly, the message from Tables 1 and 2 seems to be that protectionism is essentially
acyclic.20 This is corroborated by the graphical analogue in Figure 5, which is a set of scatter‐plots of five
measures of protectionism (the [applied weighted] average tariff, duties measured as a fraction both of
imports and of GDP, anti‐dumping cases, and GATT/WTO disputes initiated) against real GDP de‐trended
in five different ways. The plots in Figure 5 provide no convincing evidence that protectionism is cyclic.21

Adding Controls

         The results in Table 1 model WTO dispute initiation, taking out all country‐ and time‐specific
fixed effects. Perhaps the results are masked by other influences and become stronger once other
controls are included? No. Table 3 includes eighteen other control variables, both individually and in
groups. These are mostly taken from the WDI and represent a wide range of economic phenomena:
income, population, labor’s share of income, unemployment, trade, membership in the GATT/WTO,
fiscal policy, and the real exchange rate. I also include value added in exports, measured as a
percentage of exports; this is an (admittedly imperfect) proxy for production fragmentation.22 At the
bottom of the table, I include controls for the nominal exchange rate regime; I then estimate equation
(1) only for countries with fixed nominal exchange rates.23 However, none of these controls change the
message from Table 1: this measure of protectionism simply does not seem to be cyclic.

Historical Data

       The evidence presented above indicates that protectionism since the Second World War does
not seem to be counter‐cyclic. Nevertheless, the literature reviewed above, as well as the (admittedly


                                                      6
limited) evidence of Figures 1 and 2 indicate that protectionism was counter‐cyclic before WWII. Before
trying to understand why there might have been a switch, it seems appropriate to confirm the counter‐
cyclicality of protectionism before WWII.

         It is difficult to find much reliable data that pre‐dates WWII and is available for many countries
on business cycles, and, especially, protectionism. From Brian Mitchell’s International Historical
Statistics, I take series on customs duties, imports, and national income. These series are available (with
gaps) for eighteen countries back to 1850. I normalize duties by imports and use this as a crude
measure of protectionism; I de‐trend output using the same five techniques as employed above. These
data are likely to be noisy, so I begin by using three year averages of the annual data, using the same
estimation strategy as I employ in Tables 1‐3.

         When I restrict my attention to the gold‐standard era before WWI, strong evidence of counter‐
cyclic protectionism emerges. All the coefficients in the first row of Table 4 are negative, consistent with
counter‐cyclic protectionism, and four of the five coefficients are significantly different from zero at the
1% significance level. The annual results are considerably weaker; only three coefficients are negative.
Only one of these is significantly negative, while one of the other two is significantly positive. Similarly,
the evidence that protectionism was counter‐cyclic during the period between the two world wars is
also weak; three of the coefficients are negative (none significantly so), while two are positive (one
significantly different from zero at the 5% level).24

        I tentatively conclude that while protectionism has not been counter‐cyclic since WWII, it may
have been counter‐cyclic before WWI. There is only mixed evidence of a switch in the cyclicality of
protectionism, primarily because the earlier evidence is cloudy. Further exploration of this seems
mostly a question for economic historians, given the data issues.



4. Why?

         It seems clear that protectionism is no longer counter‐cyclic. Understanding why is difficult; it is
easier to theorize about a finding than a non‐finding. Still, the literature makes it seem likely that
protectionism was counter‐cyclic before WWI (though the evidence presented above, not so much).
The question naturally occurs: is there systematic variation in the degree to which protectionism is
cyclic? A number of factors have been proposed to explain the purported counter‐cyclicality of
protectionism, and some of these vary across countries and/or time. Unfortunately, the most obvious
quantifiable hypotheses can all be rejected.

Why Should Protectionism Be Counter‐Cyclic?

        It is best to understand why protectionism might be (counter‐) cyclic, before investigating
whether the intensity of cyclicality of protectionism varies systematically. I thus begin with a brief
review of theories that have been advanced to explain the alleged (counter‐) cyclicality of protectionism,
with an eye towards focusing on testable implications. To quote McKeown (1984, p 219), “For


                                                      7
protection to occur during the trough of the business cycle, there must be some relation between the
benefits of protection and the time at which it is being given.” At least five theories have been
proposed; each explicitly links the net benefit from protectionism to the state of the business cycle.

1. To Counter Incentives to Manipulate the Terms of Trade
         Bagwell and Staiger (2003) assume (realistically) that fluctuations in trade volume are cyclic and
derive counter‐cyclic protectionism from the incentives a country has to improve its terms of trade.
They consider both business cycles that are perfectly correlated across countries and idiosyncratic
national business cycles. It is possible to test this theory indirectly by comparing large and small
countries, since the latter face exogenous terms of trade. It is also possible to control for (or interact
the business cycle with) trade volume, to test for differences between open and closed countries, and to
test for the relevance of formal GATT/WTO membership.

2. To Maintain Budget Balance
         Hansen (1990, pp. 528‐529) reminds readers that “For most of American history … tariffs were
instruments of revenue … Through most of the history of the republic, tariffs and taxes were virtual
equivalents… Until the Civil War … the U.S. treasury derived about 90 percent of its revenues from
customs duties… the tariff was the leading source of government funds until World War I, when the
newly approved federal income tax eclipsed it.” To keep the budget balanced (p. 532), “the governing
party will raise tariffs when the treasury is in deficit and will lower duties when it is in surplus. When the
government depends substantially on a tax, in short, fiscal imperatives will dominate its revision.”
McKeown (1983) also uses this argument. Budgets can reasonably be assumed to be cyclic, so this
seems to be a reasonable argument prima facie. However, it is difficult to understand the relevance of
this argument in a world of substantive persistent budget imbalances, and/or where much
protectionism takes the form of NTBs. It is possible to test the argument’s relevance by controlling for
fiscal factors such as the government’s budget or revenue, or interacting these with the business cycle.

3. As Second‐Best Strategy in a Fixed Exchange Rate Regime
         Eichengreen and Irwin (2009, pp 1‐2) argue that “the exchange rate regime and economic
policies associated with it were key determinants of trade policies of the early 1930s. Countries that
remained on the gold standard, keeping their currencies fixed against gold, were more likely to restrict
foreign trade.” A natural test of this sensible hypothesis is to see if the cyclicality of protectionism varies
systematically with the exchange rate regime.

4. As a Response to Pressure from Import Competitors
         It seems intuitive that rent‐seeking pressures grow disproportionately during recessions, but this
process has rarely been modeled rigorously. Cassing et al (1986) relies on regional differences in the
composition of immobile production factors. The theory can be tested by comparing countries of
differing size; it is more challenging for this theory to explain a switch in the cyclicality of protectionism.

5. As a Result of Search Frictions in the Labor Market
        Costinot (2009) provides a theory in which jobs have rents which depend on the level of trade
protection. A related but more informal theory is provided by Gallarotti (1985), who argues that the


                                                      8
reduced profits associated with business cycle downturns reduce entry and thus increase the incentives
of incumbents to lobby for protectionism; McKeown (1984) provides a similar argument. Such theories
should always be operative; evidence against the counter‐cyclicality of protectionism seems inconsistent
with them. Variation in the political importance of labor over time or country provides a way to test this
theory, at least informally.

Differences between pre‐WWI and post‐WWII that Cannot be Tested

          Some of the reasons why protectionism is no longer cyclic seem intrinsically impossible to test.
The GATT/WTO has only existed since WWII. It seems natural to suspect that the existence of a
multilateral institution dedicated to liberalizing trade and helping it flow as freely as possible, might also
affect the cyclicality of protectionism.25 Of course, the GATT/WTO may be a toothless organization;
Bagwell and Staiger (2003) emphasize that the GATT/WTO has no external enforcement mechanism, so
any agreement under the GATT/WTO must be self‐enforcing. Consistent with this, the results presented
below indicate that formal membership in the GATT/WTO has little demonstrable effect on the
cyclicality of protectionism; see also Evenett (2011). But since we have no data on a postwar
GATT/WTO‐free post‐war world, it is impossible to test the impact of the GATT/WTO directly. Similarly,
postwar protectionism (and its cyclicality) may be affected by the fact that all the leading capitalist
states are part of the same military coalition (McKeown, 1984, p. 232). Again though, it is hard to test
this hypothesis. International supply chains are becoming increasingly complicated, and growing trade
in intermediates may be responsible for declining protectionism and perhaps its cyclicality. Still, it is
difficult to quantify the importance of this phenomenon, at least with existing data. A final and more
pleasing idea is the fact that there are more economists (and free‐trade advocates like The Economist) in
circulation since WWII. A deeper understanding of the dangers of protectionism might be responsible
for the fact that there is less or less‐cyclic protectionism. Again, it is hard to test this idea directly.26

Variation across Time

         There does not seem to be a clear post‐war trend in the cyclicality of protectionism; Figure 6
presents some evidence. It contains slopes and confidence intervals from cross‐country regressions of
one measure of protectionism (trade freedom from the Heritage Foundation) on business cycles.
Consider the top‐left graph in Figure 6, which uses the Baxter‐King bandpass filter to de‐trend real GDP.
Plotted at the extreme left of the graph is the cross‐sectional estimate of the effect of Baxter‐King de‐
trended business cycles on trade freedom, using 1970 data (the estimate is ‐.31 with a standard error of
.72, derived from 65 countries). Estimates for later years are portrayed to the right; analogues for other
de‐trending techniques are presented in the other three graphs. There is no obvious trend over time in
the cyclicality of trade freedom; the coefficients seem to fluctuate around zero.27, 28

Variation across Countries

        Perhaps differences are more visible across countries than across time? Figure 7 provides
scatter‐plots of two different measures of protectionism (the applied weighted tariff rate above, and
trade freedom below) against de‐trended real GDP. There are two versions of each, one split by country
size and the other by the exchange rate regime. Consider the top‐left graph in Figure 7; this scatters

                                                      9
tariffs against the deviation of real GDP from its HP‐filtered trend. Two types of countries are included:
small countries with populations of less than a million (marked by x), and G‐20 countries (marked by ◦).29
The relationship between the tariff rate and the business cycle is similar for small and large countries, as
shown by the fitted regressions lines for the two samples, which are essentially parallel. The effect of
the business cycle on trade freedom is also similar for small and large countries, as shown in the graph
immediately below. To the right, the sample is split using the Reinhart‐Rogoff exchange rate regime
classification; observations for floating exchange rates (marked by +) are spread similarly to those for
fixers (marked by ∆).30 That is, countries with radically different exchange rate regimes seem to have
protectionism that responds similarly to business cycles. Figure 8 is an analogue to Figure 7, but splits
the data differently. To the left, I compare low‐income countries (annual real GDP per capita less than
$1005) with high‐income countries (those with annual real GDP per capita of greater than $12,275); to
the right I compare non‐members with members of the GATT/WTO.31 Similarly, Figure 9 splits the data
by years and the importance of duties in the tax base. None of these factors matters much in practice;
the cyclicality of protectionism does not depend strongly on size, income, exchange rate regime,
GATT/WTO membership, the fiscal importance of duties, or year.

         A different take on the data is provided in Figure 10. For each country with at least twenty years
of annual data on both the (weighted applied) tariff rate and real GDP (de‐trended via the HP‐filter), I
run a country‐specific time‐series regression of tariffs on output.32 Each of these regressions delivers a
slope coefficient for the responsiveness of, e.g., the Austrian tariff rate to the Austrian business cycle. I
then scatter these estimates (on the ordinate) against a variety of country characteristics (on the
abscissa); the latter are averaged over the sample period. Thus the top left graph in Figure 10 graphs
tariff cyclicality against country size, while the top middle graph graphs tariff cyclicality against country
openness (as measured by the import/GDP ratio). The only country characteristics that can be linked to
tariff cyclicality are the labor share of income and the real effective exchange rate. Both correlations are
positively and (barely) significant; countries with more highly valued real exchange rates and great labor
shares of income tend to have more pro‐cyclic protectionism.

        A more rigorous analogue to the evidence of Figure 10 is presented in Table 5. I estimate:



                Protectit = {αi} + {βt} + γBCit + δDFunditBCit + εit                                 (1’)



where DFundit = 0 for the lowest quartile of the univariate distribution of a fundamental variable Fundit,
is missing for the middle two quartiles, and =1 for the highest quartile. That is, it is a dummy variable
that allows one to compare the idea that the effect of business cycles on protectionism is different for
e.g., small (lowest quartile) and large (highest quartile) countries in the case of the fundamental being
country size. Country size, as gauged by population, is only one way to split the data; I also consider
openness (through the import/GDP share), the importance of labor (labor’s share of national income),
and fiscal dependency (duties as a share of total taxes). Splitting the data via quartiles is one way to
split the data, but I also divide the data set into halves. At the bottom of the table, I also split the data

                                                        10
by the exchange rate regime, using both the Reinhart&Rogoff and Levy‐Yeyati&Sturzenegger measures.
Finally, I use four measures of protectionism; the (applied weighted) tariff rate, duties/imports, trade
freedom, and the number of WTO trade disputes initiated. I use the HP‐filter to de‐trend output.

         The results are reported in Table 5, which tabulate p‐values for the null hypothesis δ=0. A high
value in Table 5 is consistent with the null, so that the cyclic nature of protectionism does not depend on
e.g., country size. The results are consistent with the idea that the cyclic nature of protectionism does
not depend on national fundamentals; of the forty coefficients, only one is significantly different from
zero at the five percent significance level. These results reinforce those provided by Figures 7 and 8.33, 34
I have been unable to find measurable dimensions upon which the cyclicality of protectionism depends.



5. Academic Scribbling

         The goal of this short empirical paper is to show that protectionism has not been counter‐cyclic
since the Second World War. This result is robust; I use eighteen measures of protectionism, seven
measures of the business cycle, and a variety of controls, in an annual postwar panel of data spanning
more than sixty countries over thirty years. This result seems natural; it is exemplified by the absence of
any dramatic outbreak of protection associated with the Great Recession of 2008‐09. But this result is
also striking; as a stylized fact, acyclic protectionism is grossly inconsistent with the literature. Any of
the theoretical studies of the determinants of protectionism that relies on this false generalization (five
are sketched above) may therefore be of limited interest. If the profession wants to understand the
determinants of protectionism it should do so from a solid empirical footing.

          I use a historical panel going back 140 years to show that protectionism was probably counter‐
cyclic earlier, though it is hard to be definitive because there is little quality data of relevance before
WWII. I have been unsuccessful in explaining why protectionism is no longer counter‐cyclic; there is
little support for any hypothesis that can be quantified. In contrast to more recent times, before WWI
tariffs contributed greatly to the national treasury, there was no GATT, and the gold standard ruled.
Recent data indicate that protectionist policies of countries with differing fiscal situations react similarly
to business cycles, as do those of countries inside/outside the GATT/WTO, those with fixed/floating
exchange rates, small/large countries, and open/closed countries. If there has been a shift in the
cyclicality of protectionism since WWII, it’s hard to be sure why. This topic awaits further research.

          Perhaps, just perhaps, the switch in the cyclicality of protectionism – if there has indeed been
one – is a triumph of modern economics. After all, there is considerable and strong consensus among
economists that protectionism is generally bad for welfare.35 And there is no doubt that economists are
aware and actively involved in combating counter‐cyclic protectionism; this was especially visible during
the Great Recession, which saw the successful launch of Global Trade Alert in June 2009.36 If – and it’s a
big if – the efforts of the economic profession are part of the reason that protectionism is no longer
counter‐cyclic, then the profession deserves a collective pat on the back. But in that case the profession
should also consider setting its sights higher. If economists have helped reduce the cyclicality of
protectionism, then perhaps they should focus on simply reducing protectionism.

Each cell stems from a separate OLS regression of a measure of protectionism (in columns) on: a) fixed time‐ and country‐specific fixed effects;
b) the deviation of log real GDP from HP‐filtered trend; and c) a dummy variable which is 0 for the lowest quartile/half of the sample, and HP‐
de‐trended real output for the highest quartile/half. The method of splitting the sample (tabulated in the left columns) differs by row. Each
cell is a p‐value of the null hypothesis that the coefficient on the dummy variable equals zero. Thus, a large p‐value indicates that the effect of
de‐trended real output on protectionism does not depend on the value of the fundamental tabulated in the left column. P‐values significantly
different from zero at .05 (.01) marked by one (two) asterisk(s).

Each cell stems from a separate OLS regression of a measure of protectionism (in columns) on: a) fixed time‐ and country‐specific fixed effects;
b) the real GDP growth; and c) a dummy variable which is 0 for the lowest quartile/half of the sample, and real GDP growth for the highest
quartile/half. The method of splitting the sample (tabulated in the left columns) differs by row. Each cell is a p‐value of the null hypothesis
that the coefficient on the dummy variable equals zero. Thus, a large p‐value indicates that the effect of growth on protectionism does not
depending on the value of the fundamental tabulated in the left column. P‐values significantly different from zero at .05 (.01) marked by one
(two) asterisk(s).

  These quotations represent the iceberg’s tip. Cassing, McKeown and Ochs (1986, p. 843) state “One feature of tariff policy is
that tariff levels tend to move in a cycle coupled with the business cycle. Tariff barriers are lowered during periods of relative
prosperity, only to be raised again during world recessions.” Gallarotti (1985, p. 157) writes: “The idea that there exists some
relationship between patterns of tariff legislation and a nation’s economic health is by no means new… Empirically, the
hypothesis has been strengthened by the identification of an inverse correlation between levels of economic activity and
protection. Historically, prosperous periods have been accompanied by free trade, and periods of depression by closure.”
Takacs (1981, p. 1987) states “It is generally agreed that in a modern industrial economy the cyclical state of the economy and
the country’s competitive position internationally are the principal determinants of the degree of protectionist pressure. Low
levels of economic activity, high unemployment, unused capacity, … all operate to increase the temptation to protect domestic
industries from import competition.” Bown and Crowley (2012, p. 2) state “… as Bagwell and Staiger (2003) and others have
established, … there is an empirical presumption that import protection rises during recessions … ”
2
  Hansen (1990, p 537) writes “Among quantitative studies, most model the rates of duty in the cross‐section, across industries,
usually in recent periods … Only a handful of quantitative studies examine policy variations over time.”

  The trend in real GNP is widely recognized, but the trend in duties is almost as strong. The latter has been discussed by Ray
(1987, p. 295) who states “Except for the brief interval of time associated with the Smoot‐Hawley tariff of 1930 … tariffs have
declined steadily in the United States from 1914 to 1986 (when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”) Tokyo
Round tariff cuts were scheduled to be fully implemented).”

6
  The United States raised tariffs in the early 1920 (through the Emergency Tariff of 1921 and the Fordney‐McCumber Tariff of
1922) and again in 1930 (the Smoot‐Hawley Tariff). The associated outliers are marked in the upper‐right scatter‐plot of Figure
2, and are also visible in the two left scatter‐plots.

7
     The correlation is .25 for the 1949‐1996 period.

8
  NTB data at an aggregate level is notoriously difficult to find, especially over time (e.g., from the TRAINS data set). Of course,
the aggregate tariff rate changes with the composition of trade, and an effective rate would account for tariffs on intermediate
inputs. Figure A2 is analogous to Figure 2, but replaces duties with the trade restrictiveness index from Irwin (2010); it delivers
the same message.

available at http://www.wto.org/.

10
   As a crude measure of public interest on the topic, I also add in a plot for the number of articles in The New York Times that
use the term ‘protectionism’. I note in passing that American (as opposed to global) growth is poorly correlated with both NYT
citations (.04) and American initiations of GATT/WTO disputes (.20).

11
   I also note in passing that mentions of “protectionism” in publications like the New York Times is essentially uncorrelated
with growth (the correlation coefficient is ‐.11 since 1995).

12
   For analysis of trade policy during the “Great Recession” and its aftermath, see Evenett (2009), Evenett et al (2010),
Gawande et al (2011), Kee et al (2011), and the analysis at http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4297. Bown and Crowley
(2012) find and analyze a switch in protectionist behavior during the great recession.

14
  I use standard parameter values for my filtering techniques: a smoothing parameter of 6.25 for Hodrick‐Prescott (as
suggested by e.g., Ravn and Uhlig); and for Christiano‐Fitzgerald and (later) Baxter‐King bandpass filtering, minimal/maximal
periodicities of two/eight years respectively, with a lead‐lag length of three years (as suggested by e.g., Baxter and King).

15
   I take no account of potential simultaneity bias; it strikes one as implausible that protectionism causes business cycles for
this sample of data. Larch and Lechthaler (2011) show theoretically that various types of protectionism have small effects on
output that are often negative (usually because of real exchange rate appreciation resulting from protectionism). They write
(p2) write “While tariffs and non‐tariff trade barriers increase domestic production, they decrease exports through their effects
on the real exchange rate. The latter effect dominates the former and, thus, GDP goes down.” Ostry and Rose (1992) use a
variety of models to show that the theoretical effects of tariffs on output are ambiguous theoretically and empirically negligible.
Irwin (2011, pp 118‐120) states “Throughout history, the business cycle has had a greater impact on tariff policy than tariffs
have had on the business cycle. When the economy goes into a recession, politicians often respond by raising tariffs… In sum,
there are no strong theoretical or empirical grounds for believing that higher average tariffs are the principal cause of business
cycle downturns or expansions.”
16
   Bown (2005) models a country’s decision to initiate a dispute through the WTO system using data from the first six years of
the WTO. Holmes et al (2003) study the use of the dispute settlement system; their goal is to search for indications of bias
against small or poor countries; like Bown, it ignores cyclic considerations. Reinhardt (1999) provides more analysis in the same
vein. Related work by Bown (2004a) studies the reasons that the dispute settlement system has the effects that it does by
inducing fear of retaliation, using a panel of data on import growth and its determinants, treating dispute initiation as
exogenous. Bown (2004b) empirically analyzes why countries choose to violate or adhere to GATT rules, using a panel of
disaggregated data; protection is determined endogenously, but using microeconomic phenomena.
17
  This is an important finding, in light of Knetter and Prusa (2003); I thank Chad Bown for access to this data set. The
estimation is restricted to the observations for which anti‐dumping observations are available.
18
   I use the World Bank’s Temporary Trade Barriers Database (http://econ.worldbank.org/ttbd/) and, as with anti‐dumping
cases initiated, restrict the sample to those for which observations are available.

19
   The principal factor is the first factor (eigenvalue of 3.1, 94% variation explained) extracted from: binding coverage %;
customs duties, % taxes; duties, % merchandise imports; share of tariffs with international peaks; applied tariff rate weighted;
trade freedom; and number RTAs initiated/signed.

20
   Appendix Table A1 gives analogous results when the unemployment rate (alternatively contemporaneous, lagged a year, and
a moving average of the first and second lags) is used instead of de‐trended real GDP (I restrict the sample to countries that had
at least 25 unemployment observations). The unemployment rate has the advantage over output of being largely trendless; it
delivers the message that protectionism is essentially acyclic. The presence of global business cycles (which are taken out by
time effects) may also be relevant; accordingly, Table A2 excludes time effects from the analysis of Table 2. It too delivers
comparable results. Finally, the analogy to Table 2, but for the effects of financial crises on protectionism (instead of business
cycles), is in Table A3. Protectionism rises significantly with banking crises for eight of the fifteen measures; it declines for one.

21
  Figure A3 is the analogue to Figure 5, but I replace raw protectionism data (on the ordinate) with the residuals of
protectionism after country‐ and time‐specific fixed effects have taken out via least squares.

22
   I thank Rob Johnson for allowing me access to the data set from his work with Guillermo Noguera;
https://sites.google.com/site/robjohnson41/research.

23
   I use two popular measures of exchange rate regimes. Description and data for the measure of Reinhart and Rogoff is
available at http://www.carmenreinhart.com/research/publications‐by‐topic/exchange‐rates‐and‐dollarization/. Similarly,
materials for the Levy‐Yeyati and Sturznegger measure is available at https://sites.google.com/site/md4stata/linked/exchange‐
rate‐classification .

24
   Table A4 is the analogue to Table 4 but provides estimates of the effect of financial crises; historical crisis dates are taken
from the same sources as Table A3. There does not seem to be any strong consistent effect of financial crises on protectionism
before WWII.




                                                                 39

   I note in passing that the 1947 Havana Charter for the International Trade Organization states in Article 2 of Chapter II (italics
added): “1. The Members recognize that the avoidance of unemployment or underemployment … is not of domestic concern
alone, but is also a necessary condition for … the expansion of international trade, and thus for the well‐being of all other
countries.” http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/havana_e.pdf. In the conclusion to the General Theory, Keynes states
(pp 382‐3): “… if nations can learn to provide themselves with full employment … there need be no important economic forces
calculated to set the interest of one country against that of its neighbours … International trade would cease to be what it is,
namely, a desperate expedient to maintain employment at home by forcing sales on foreign markets and restricting purchase
…”
26
     I have been unable to obtain circulation or sales data on The Economist by country and time.
27
   Most of the point estimates are insignificantly different from zero; two of the 1980 and three of the 2000 estimates are
significantly positive. The latter estimates indicate that countries harder hit during two recent global recessions tended to have
less trade freedom.

28
   The historical analogue to Figure 6 is in Appendix Figure A4; like Figure 6, there are few signs of any trend in the (repeated
cross‐sectional) historical impact of business cycles on duties collected.

29
     I use population data taken from the Penn World Table 7.

30
   I use the coarse annual classification for the Reinhart‐Rogoff data, and equate floating with “freely floating,” fixing with “no
separate legal tender, pre‐announced peg or currency board arrangement, pre‐announced horizontal band that is narrower
than or equal to +/‐2%, or de facto peg.”

31
   I choose my income cut‐offs from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/about/country‐classifications), and I use an
updated version of Mike Tomz’s data set on GATT/WTO membership
(http://www.stanford.edu/~tomz/pubs/TGR_AER2007_merged.zip).

32
     There are 28 such countries.

33
   Table A5 is the analogue to Table 5, but uses the growth rate of real GDP rather than HP‐filtered real GDP. As with Table 5,
there is no evidence in Table A5 that the cyclicality of protectionism depends on fundamentals.

34
   Tables 5 and A5 split the sample by fundamentals and test the hypothesis that the cyclicality of protectionism is similar
across samples. An alternative approach is to interact fundamentals with the regressors in (1) and test for the significance of
the interaction terms. I pursue that approach in Table A6; there is no consistent or strong evidence that any of the (dozen)
fundamentals I consider can be consistent and significantly linked to the cyclicality of protectionism.
