                                              ABSTRACT

This review paper, prepared for the forthcoming Russell Sage volume Changing Poverty, considers
the ability of different education policies to improve the learning outcomes of low-income children
in America. Disagreements on this question stem in part from different beliefs about the problems
with our nation's public schools. In our view there is some empirical support for each of the general
concerns that have been raised about public schools serving high-poverty student populations, including:
the need for more funding for those school inputs where additional spending is likely to pass a benefit-cost
test; limited capacity of many schools to substantially improve student learning by improving the quality
of instruction on their own; and the need for improved incentives for both teachers and students, and
for additional operational flexibility. Evidence suggests that the most productive changes to existing
education policies are likely to come from increased investments in early childhood education for
poor children, improving the design of the federal No Child Left Behind accountability system, providing
educators with incentives to adopt practices with a compelling research base while expanding efforts
to develop and identify effective instructional regimes, and continued support and evaluation of a variety
of public school choice options.

I. INTRODUCTION

         One of the best ways to avoid being poor as an adult in America is to obtain a good

education. As Magnuson and Votruba-Drzal (2009) note, individuals with higher academic

achievement and more years of schooling earn more than those with lower levels of human

capital. This is not surprising given that we believe that schooling makes people more

productive, allowing them to command higher wages in the labor market.

         Yet, in modern America disadvantaged children face an elevated risk for a variety of

adverse educational outcomes. According to the 2007 National Assessment of Educational

Progress (NAEP), only 16 percent of fourth grade students eligible for free lunch score at

proficient levels in reading compared with 44 percent of fourth graders whose family incomes

are above the eligibility cutoff for free lunch; the disparity in math scores is even larger, 21

versus 53 percent (NCES 2007). Equally large disparities in achievement test scores are

observed between whites and minority racial or ethnic groups, with gaps that show up as early as

age three or four (Jencks and Phillips, 1998, Neal, 2007).1

         Understanding why children’s outcomes vary so dramatically along race and class lines in

America is central to formulating effective education policy interventions. Disagreements about

how to improve schooling outcomes for poor children stem in part from different beliefs about

what problems underlie the unsatisfactory outcomes found in too many of our nation’s public

schools. Broadly speaking, critics tend to invoke, at least implicitly, one of the following

reasons why children in high-poverty schools are not performing as well as we would like:




1
  Note that these disparities in schooling outcomes along race and class lines are not simply due to immigration into
the U.S. by those with low initial levels of English or other academic skills, since for example reading and math
disparities in NAEP scores are large among 4th and 8th graders even between non-Hispanic whites versus non-
Hispanic blacks (www.nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nde, accessed on August 4, 2008).


                                                          2
1. Schools serving poor and minority students have fewer resources (e.g., text books, teachers,

   support services) than they need to educate the disadvantaged students they serve. In this

   case, a potential solution would be to provide more money to disadvantaged schools.

2. High-poverty schools lack the capacity to substantially improve student learning,

   independent of financial resources. Under this perspective the teachers and administrators in

   highly disadvantaged school districts are thought to lack the skills or knowledge necessary to

   improve the quality of instruction on their own. Potential solutions to this problem would

   involve helping schools improve the quality of their standard operating practices, for

   example by helping implement specific new instructional or organizational practices (i.e.,

   curriculum, instruction, school organization) and/or increasing the instructional capacity of

   staff in these schools through professional development or more selective hiring. The

   success of this approach depends critically on whether there are particular instructional,

   organizational, human resource or other practices that are known to be effective, and how

   easily these practices could be implemented across different contexts.

3. High-poverty schools do not have sufficient incentives and/or flexibility. High-poverty

   schools are under-performing because teachers and administrators are not working hard

   enough, they are not working toward the right goal, or they have good local knowledge about

   what would work best but they are not able to implement these ideas because of centralized

   authority. Proponents of this perspective often claim that without clarifying the key

   objectives of school and holding key actors accountable, additional spending will simply be

   squandered. Under this view, the solution would be to enhance incentives and provide local

   actors more flexibility through policies such as school choice or accountability.




                                                3
4. Schools matter only so much. The real problem rests with the social context in which

   schools operate – namely, the family, neighborhood and peer environments that low-income

   children experience. Adopting accountability or market-oriented education reforms without

   changing social policy more broadly will simply punish educators for factors beyond their

   control, and potentially drive the most able teachers toward schools serving less

   disadvantaged students. In this case, a necessary condition for making serious improvements

   in poor children’s schooling outcomes would involve fixing the other social ills associated

   with poverty that impair children’s learning outcomes, such as poor health care or high

   unemployment.

       For some reason current policy debates often seem to be argued as if the problems above

are mutually exclusive. In contrast, we believe that there is likely some truth to each of these

major explanations. Moreover, it seems plausible that the underlying problems confronting our

schools might interact in complicated ways. For example, it may be the case that certain

curriculum reforms are effective only if they are accompanied by an increase in resources such

as student support services, or by an increase in teacher quality generated by better professional

development and/or reforms to hiring and tenure policies

       Research over the past four decades has unfortunately fostered the impression that when

it comes to interventions for the most disadvantaged public schools in our country “nothing

works.” One of the first studies to do so was the landmark 1966 report by sociologist James

Coleman and his colleagues. By drawing on a large, nationally representative sample, the

Coleman Report found that most of the variation in student achievement occurs within rather

than across schools, that family background is the strongest predictor of academic achievement,

and that most measurable school inputs like student-teacher ratios are only weakly correlated




                                                 4
with student outcomes. Subsequent evaluation studies also tended to be disappointing and

helped contribute to a sense of pessimism about the ability of schools to lift poor children’s life

chances (Levin, 1977, Glazer, 1986, Jencks, 1986).

       In contrast, our chapter offers a message of tempered optimism. The past few decades

have seen a dramatic improvement in the technology of education policy evaluation, which has

enhanced our ability to uncover moderately-sized program impacts within the complex

environment that determines schooling outcomes. The available evidence reveals a number of

potentially promising ways to improve the learning outcomes of low-income children. This is

not to say that everything works: many current and proposed education policies either enjoy no

empirical support for their effectiveness, or in some cases have strong empirical evidence for

their ineffectiveness. But a careful sifting of the empirical evidence identifies a selected set of

interventions that seem to be promising.

       Our optimism is tempered by the recognition that even the most successful educational

interventions will reduce, but not eliminate, racial and social class disparities in educational

outcomes. But the usual standard of public economics for judging policy interventions is that

they generate benefits that exceed their cost. Under this benefit-cost standard, education policies

that are capable of improving poor children’s schooling outcomes by enough to justify the costs

of these new programs are worth doing, even if these programs by themselves are not enough to

equalize learning opportunities for all children in America.

       While we recognize that the social context of children’s lives plays a large role in their

schooling outcomes, the focus of this chapter involves school-specific policies. For a

comprehensive discussion of the direct link between a child’s family background and their

learning outcomes, see Magnuson and Votruba-Drzal (2009).




                                                  5
         The distinction between the role of family background and school-specific policies is

blurred by the fact that the concentration of low-income and minority students within schools can

have important implications for the success of school-specific policies.2 A growing body of

empirical evidence suggests that policies that can effectively reduce the amount of racial (and by

implication socio-economic) segregation within schools may help improve the schooling

outcomes of disadvantaged children (see Vigdor and Ludwig, 2008 for a review). Yet there are

substantial barriers – both logistical and political – to further integrating schools along race or

class lines. There is substantial residential segregation in our country, which limits the amount

of school desegregation that can be accomplished since the U.S. Supreme Court made it very

difficult to enact across-district plans in the Milliken v. Bradley decision (418 US 717, 1974).

More generally, the majority of Supreme Court decisions on school desegregation since the early

1970s have restricted the ability of districts to promote integration (Kahlenberg, 2001), including

two recent decisions striking down desegregation plans in Seattle and Louisville. It may be that

school desegregation efforts are unable dramatically improve the lot of poor children in

American schools. In any case in what follows, we assume that the distribution of poor and

minority children across schools is fixed, and consider the ability of different education policies

to improve their learning outcomes given this reality.

         The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. In Section II, we review three

specific areas in which we believe increased resources may yield important benefits for poor

children: early childhood interventions, class size reductions in the early grades that hold the

quality of teachers constant, and bonuses to attract and retain the highest-quality teachers in

disadvantaged schools. In Section III, we examine reforms that do not require a large investment

2
  For example, all else equal the typical teacher seems to prefer working in schools that serve more affluent and less
racially diverse student bodies (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 2004), which may have implications for policy efforts
designed to improve the quality of teachers in high-poverty areas.


                                                          6
of resources, but instead seek to make specific changes in the ways schools operate, ranging

from changes in curriculum and instruction to changes in teacher hiring and promotion policy.

The available evidence for effective changes in school practices are limited, but this problem

could be overcome if federal and state governments did more to require schools to use methods

that have been proven effective (Jacob and Ludwig, 2005). In Section IV, we review the

literature on school accountability and school choice policies, which aim to change the goals,

incentives and organizational structure within which schools and families operate. The evidence

on school accountability is moderately encouraging, though recent findings suggest that the

design of accountability policies matters a great deal. There is less evidence that current public or

private school choice plans improve student outcomes, but there are likely to be benefits from

continued experimentation with and evaluation of a variety of choice options by states and

school districts. Finally in Section V, we summarize what we believe the available empirical

evidence suggests are the most promising education policies for improving the life chances of

disadvantaged children.

II. SCHOOL RESOURCES

       The question of whether “money matters” has been the subject of contentious debate in

the research literature for the past 40 years. Isolating the causal effects of extra school funding is

complicated by the possibility that compensatory spending may be directed towards those

schools serving the most disadvantaged students, and adequately controlling for all aspects of

student disadvantage is quite difficult in practice. A few recent studies have used policy changes

that generate sharp changes in school funding and find some impact on student outcomes (Figlio,

1997, Card and Payne, 2002, Guryan, 2003). Overall, however, there is fairly weak support for

the idea that increases in unrestricted school funding will improve student outcomes (see for




                                                  7
example Hanushek 1997). In contrast, there is stronger evidence that some targeted increases in

specific school inputs can improve student outcomes. In this section, we discuss three specific

areas in which we believe increased resources may yield important benefits for poor children:

increased investments in early childhood education; class size reductions in the early grades; and

targeted salary bonuses to help disadvantaged schools recruit and retain better teachers.

A. Early childhood education

       Disparities in academic achievement by race and class are apparent as early as age three

and four, well before children enter kindergarten. Recent research in neuroscience,

developmental psychology, economics, and other fields suggests that the earliest years of life are

a particularly promising time to intervene in the lives of low-income children (Shonkoff and

Phillips, 2000, Carniero and Heckman, 2003, Knudsen et al., 2006). Studies show that early

childhood educational programs can generate learning gains in the short-run and, in some cases,

improve the long-run life chances of poor children. Moreover, the benefits generated by these

programs are large enough to justify their costs.

       The Perry Preschool and Abecedarian programs are commonly cited as examples of how

high-quality preschool services can change the lives of low-income children. A small group of

children who participated in the these programs in the 1960s and 1970s have been followed for

many years and on average have better outcomes in a range of domains compared to a randomly

assigned group of control children (Schweinhart et al., 2005; Ramey and Campbell, 1979;

Campbell et al., 2002; Barnett and Masse, 2007). Despite the high cost of these programs, these

studies suggest that the total economic benefit of these programs exceeded their costs (Belfield et

al., 2006; Barnett and Masse, 2007). While these results are encouraging, it is important to keep




                                                    8
in mind that these are model programs that were unusually intensive and involved small numbers

of children in just two sites.

         Yet evidence on publicly funded early education programs, which illustrate what can be

achieved for large numbers of children in programs of variable quality, is also very encouraging.

A recent random-assignment evaluation of Head Start found positive short-term effects of

program participation on a variety of cognitive skills on the order of .2 to .4 standard deviations,3

with typically positive effects on non-cognitive outcomes as well that are usually not statistically

significant. A rigorous evaluation of Early Head Start, a program serving children under age

three in a mix of home and center-based programs, found positive effects on some aspects of

parent practices and children’s development, but the effects were generally smaller than for Head

Start (Love et al. 2002).

         Wong et al. (2008) find that several recent state-initiated universal pre-K programs have

even larger impacts on short-term cognitive test scores than does Head Start (see also Gormley et

al., 2005; Gormley and Gayer, 2005). Why might the new state pre-K programs generate larger

cognitive gains than does Head Start? One explanation is that pre-K programs hire more

qualified teachers, pay them more, and offer a more academically oriented curriculum than do

Head Start programs. Another explanation is that the Head Start comparison group received

more center-based care than did children in the pre-K comparison group.4 A third possible

explanation is that the recent Head Start study relies on a rigorous randomized experimental




3
  The official evaluation of the program found impacts on elementary pre-reading and pre-writing skills equal to
about 0.3 and 0.2 of a standard deviation respectively (Puma et al. 2005; Ludwig and Phillips, 2007). If one
calculates Head Start impacts by pooling together the three- and four-year-olds in the experiment, the increased
statistical power leads to significant program impacts on math scores and on almost all of the other main cognitive
skill outcomes in the report (Ludwig and Phillips, 2007).

design, while the research design of the new state pre-K studies is more susceptible to bias from

selection problems (see Ludwig and Phillips, 2007). 5

        While these short-run achievement gains from both Head Start and newer state pre-K

programs are impressive, the crucial question is whether these effects persist over time. In order

to explore longer-run impacts, one must rely on non-experimental studies of children who

participated in Head Start decades ago and control for potential confounding factors (Currie and

Thomas, 1995; Garces, Thomas and Currie, 2002; Ludwig and Miller, 2007; Deming, 2007).

These studies suggest lasting effects on schooling attainment and perhaps criminal activity,

although test score effects appear to fade out over time. Nonetheless, the positive long-term

effects seem large enough to generate benefits that likely outweigh the program costs.

        It is possible that the long-term effects of Head Start on more recent cohorts of children

may be different from those for previous cohorts of program participants because program

quality changes over time, or because the developmental quality of the environments that

children would experience as an alternative to Head Start change. But the short-term test score

impacts that have been estimated for recent cohorts of Head Start participants appear to be

similar to what we see for earlier cohorts of children for whom we also now have evidence of

long-term benefits. So there is room for cautious optimism that Head Start might improve the

long-term outcomes for recent waves of program participants as well, even though this cannot be

directly tested for many years (Ludwig and Phillips, 2007).

        Although preschool interventions represent a promising way to improve the life chances

of poor children, their success is not well reflected in federal government budget priorities,

which allocate nearly seven times as much money per capita for K-12 schooling as for pre-

5
 Some prior research has found that while pre-kindergarten programs improve cognitive outcomes, they may have
adverse effects on non-cognitive outcomes like self-control (see, for example, Magnuson, Ruhm and Waldfogel,
2004). The evidence on this issue is not yet available for the new state pre-K programs.


                                                      10
kindergarten (pre-K), other forms of early education and child care subsidies for three- to five-

year-olds. Most social policies attempt to make up for the disadvantages poor children

experience early in life. But given the substantial disparities between poor and non-poor

children that already exist among very young children, it is perhaps not surprising that many

disadvantaged children never catch up. There may be very high returns indeed to increased

investments in improving young children’s school readiness with proven, high-quality programs.

B. Class size reduction

           Reducing average class sizes may enable teachers to spend more time working with

individual students, tailor instruction to match children’s needs, and make it easier for teachers to

monitor classroom behavior. Class size reductions are not inexpensive, however. They require

hiring additional teachers and in some cases expanding a school’s physical space. Nonetheless,

the best available evidence suggests that class size reduction, holding teacher quality constant,

can improve student outcomes by enough to justify these additional expenditures, with benefits

that are particularly pronounced for low-income and minority children.

           The evidence in favor of class size reduction comes mainly from Tennessee’s Project

STAR, which randomly assigned 11,600 students in grades K-13 and 1,330 teachers to small

classes (13-17 students), regular size classrooms (22-25 students), or regular size classrooms that

also included a teacher’s aide.6 Teachers were also randomly assigned to different classroom

environments in this study, which ensured that the average quality of teachers in small versus

regular size classrooms is the same, a critical point to which we will return within the context of

policy efforts to take class size reduction to scale. Class size reductions of around one-third

during these early grades increased Stanford-9 reading and math scores by around 0.12 standard

deviations for whites and 0.24 standard deviations for blacks. Impacts were larger for students
6
    This section is based on the summary of Project STAR research by Schanzenbach (2006/7).


                                                        11
attending mostly black schools, although even within such schools, black students benefited

somewhat more than did whites (Krueger and Whitmore, 2002). Similarly, impacts were

somewhat larger for students eligible for the free lunch program.

         Follow-up evaluations of STAR find long-term benefits of attending a small elementary

school class – the test score impacts seem to persist through 8th grade, although they decline by

one-half to two-thirds (Achilles et al., 1993, Nye et al., 1995, Krueger and Whitmore, 2001). As

with the short-term effects, the eighth grade test scores reveal larger gains among low-income

and minority students. Moreover, black students in the treatment group were roughly 5

percentage points (or 15 percent) more likely to take a college entrance exam (i.e., the SAT or

ACT) during high school (Krueger and Whitmore, 2001, 2002).7 The test score gains induced by

smaller classes in STAR are probably large enough to justify the costs, even when we focus just

on the benefits that arise from test scores on future earnings alone (Krueger, 2003, Krueger and

Whitmore, 2001, Schanzenbach, 2006/7).

         The results from Project STAR are encouraging, but they come from a controlled

experiment that held the quality of teachers constant by randomly assigning teachers as well as

students across classrooms. A sobering example of the challenges of taking class size reduction

to scale comes from the California experience. California introduced a statewide initiative to

reduce primary grade class sizes in 1998-99, which required schools to not only hire a large

number of new teachers, but also find additional physical space for the new classrooms

(Borhnstedt and Stecher 2002; Jepsen and Rivkin 2002). The policy was implemented over a

short time period. Many low-income school districts found it difficult to hire qualified teachers,

and had trouble arranging for adequate classroom space. Jepsen and Rivkin (2002) argue that


7
 Effects for outcomes such as criminal involvement or teen births yield point estimates that are in the direction of
beneficial CSR impacts, but are imprecisely estimated (Schanzenbach, 2007).


                                                          12
much of the benefit from smaller classes in California was lost due to reductions in average

teacher quality, particularly in lower-income urban school districts.

         California’s experience suggests the complexity of taking education policy reforms to a

large scale. It suggests the potential value of focusing class size reductions in low-income

districts or schools, as well as the importance of careful implementation of the program so as to

minimize any adverse effects on teacher quality or physical capital. So long as these

implementation efforts did not raise costs too much relative to STAR, it still seems plausible that

a large scale program to reduce class sizes might pass a benefit-cost test.

C. Bonuses for teaching in high-needs schools or subjects

         Research has identified substantial variation across teachers in the ability to raise student

achievement. These studies estimate teacher effectiveness by comparing changes in student

achievement scores across classrooms, controlling for student, classroom and school

characteristics that influence achievement regardless of the teacher. Because these studies

attempt to isolate the value that a teacher adds to student achievement, they are referred to as

“teacher value-added” studies. These studies document substantial variation in teacher

effectiveness, both within and across schools. According to a recent analysis of NYC elementary

school math teachers, for example, students whose teacher falls in the top quarter of

effectiveness learn roughly 0.33 test score standard deviations more in a single year than students

whose teachers are in the bottom quarter (Kane et al. 2006).8 If disadvantaged children were

taught by the most effective teachers, disparities in schooling outcomes might be narrowed.


8
  There are three concerns with value-added measures of effectiveness. One involves the statistical precision of the
measures; the other involves the possible biases inherent in such measures. First, given the small number of
students that an individual teacher works with in any given year (i.e., 15 or 20 for many elementary school teachers)
and the imperfect reliability of student achievement tests, teacher “value-added” measures are generally measured
with considerable error (Kane and Staiger, 2002a,b). That is, the “confidence interval” around an estimate of a
teacher’s effectiveness is often quite large. A second problem is that students are not randomly assigned to


                                                         13
         Value-added measures of teacher effectiveness are not very strongly correlated with the

easiest-to-observe characteristics of teachers. On the one hand, novice teachers are less effective

than more experienced ones, but this experience premium disappears after the first few years of

teaching (Rockoff 2004). Teachers who have higher scores on the SAT or various teaching

exams are generally more effective than others (Harris and Sass 2007, Clotfelter et al. 2007). On

the other hand, there is little if any difference in the achievement gains of students assigned to

traditionally certified, alternatively certified or uncertified teachers (Kane et al. 2006; Boyd et al.

2005). Similarly, researchers have found that teachers who have advanced degrees are not more

effective than other teachers (Hanushek 1997).

         Hence, the policy challenge in this domain is to induce more effective teachers to teach in

schools serving the most disadvantaged children, knowing that effectiveness cannot easily be

measured. Given the relationship between wages and teacher labor supply (see, for example,

Hanushek, Kain, & Rivkin, 2004; Stinebrickner 2002; and Scafidi, Stinebrickner, & Sjoquist,

2007), one strategy is to entice teachers to work in hard-to-staff schools and/or subjects through

financial incentives such as targeted salary increases or bonuses since. While many states have

adopted some sort of financial assistance programs (e.g., loan forgiveness, mortgage assistance,

salary supplements), there has been little systematic evaluation (Imazeki 2007, Gaurino et al.

2006, Glazerman et al. 2006).

         Evaluation of a targeted teacher bonus in North Carolina suggests the program was

successful in reducing teacher turnover rates in low-income or low-performing schools

(Clotfelter, Glennie, Ladd and Vigdor, 2006). In California from 2000 to 2002 the Governor’s



classrooms, and hard-to-measure student characteristics may influence the rate of growth in children’s test scores
not just their levels. So value-added measures may partly confound the causal contribution of the teacher to student
learning with those of the characteristics of their students (Rothstein 2007). A third concern is that the impact of
having an effective teacher may fade out over time (Jacob et al. 2008).

Teaching Fellowship program offered academically talented teaching candidates $20,000

bonuses to work in low-performing schools, which was found to increase the rate at which such

teachers started working in disadvantaged schools but did not seem to influence subsequent

retention rates (Steele et al. 2008). Key questions that remain include whether such programs

will successfully lure new teachers into the profession who would not otherwise have taught,

rather than just re-sort a fixed pool of teachers across schools, and how long any talented new

teachers who are drawn into teaching will remain. Moreover, financial incentives that are not

tied to teacher performance might induce ineffective teachers to locate in hard-to-staff schools.

III. CHANGING SCHOOL PRACTICES

       In the previous section, we identified several reforms that seem likely to improve

achievement of poor children. Yet all of these policy changes are expensive, and so must

compete for scarce government resources with a variety of other pressing societal concerns.

Some observers of America’s schooling system remain skeptical that additional spending is

needed to improve the learning outcomes of poor children. They argue that by improving the

ways in which schools are organized, including the way they deliver instruction, one could

improve student achievement with few additional resources. This line of reasoning assumes there

is good evidence on which practices are most effective, but that school personnel do not have the

capacity to identify or implement these programs on their own.

       In the section below, we review the evidence on a variety of reforms, and find some low-

cost changes in school operating practices that seem to improve student outcomes, including

changes to school organization, classroom instruction and teacher hiring and promotion. What

remains unclear is the degree to which these “best practices” have not been more widely adopted




                                                15
because of a lack of information, political resistance, bureaucratic inertia or some combination of

these (or other) barriers.

A. Curricular and Instructional Interventions

        In 2002, the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) within the U.S. Department of

Education created the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) in order to collect and disseminate

scientific evidence on various educational interventions. A brief review of the WWC website

highlights the lack of convincing evidence on curricular interventions. For example, WWC

found only one program with strong evidence of improving reading achievement among

beginning readers (i.e., Reading Recovery), one program for elementary school math (i.e.,

Everyday Mathematics) and two programs for middle school math (I Can Learn Algebra/Pre-

Algebra and Saxon Middle School Math). Moreover, WWC excluded many studies that did not

meet a minimal standard of evidence, and even the programs for which there is strong evidence

of success according to WWC show a disappointingly low level of rigorous research. For

example, the Everyday Mathematics curriculum was introduced in 1983 and has been used in

175,000 classrooms by around 2.8 million students (WWC 2007). Yet, WWC only found four

studies of Everyday Mathematics that met their minimal standards of evidence “with

reservations.” This lack of success is not limited to traditional “paper and pencil” curricula.

There is also little evidence that educational software programs have significant impacts on

student learning despite their growing popularity (Dynarski et al. 2007).

        A more recent approach to school improvement known as Comprehensive or Whole

School Reform (CSR), attempts to improve many different aspects of the school at the same

time, hopefully in a fashion that makes the changes complementary and reinforcing. For

example, a CSR model may combine curriculum materials, professional development, teacher




                                                 16
mentoring, reorganization of the school day (e.g., block scheduling) and school structure (e.g.,

schools-within-a-school). Examples include Success for All (Borman and Hewes 2003), Comer

Schools (Cook et al. 2000), Direct Instruction (CRSQ 2006), Accelerated Schools (Bloom et al.

2001), America’s Choice (CRSQ 2006), Career Academies (Kemple and Scott-Clayton 2004),

Project GRAD (Snipes et al 2006), First Things First (Quint et al 2005) and Talent Development

(Kemple et al 2005). Unfortunately the evaluation evidence about the effectiveness of CSR

programs is, like with curricular reforms, quite limited.

        At the elementary school level, a few models have been shown to improve student

outcomes. One of the more promising interventions seems to be Success for All (SFA), a

comprehensive whole-school reform model that operates in more than 1,200 mostly high-poverty

Title I schools.9 SFA focuses on reading, with an emphasis on prevention and early intervention.

Children receive 90 minutes each day of reading instruction in groups that are organized across

grade levels based on each child’s current reading level, which helps teachers to target

instruction. Students engage in cooperative learning exercises in which they discuss stories or

learn from each other, which helps reinforce what teachers do and build social skills. Children

are assessed at eight-week intervals, using both formal measures of reading competency and

teacher observations. Children who fall behind are given extra tutoring or help with other

problems, such as health or behavior problems. The program utilizes regular classroom teachers

who receive brief initial training, ongoing coaching, and other forms of support and professional

development.




9
  Several other elementary school models show promise, including Direct Instruction (CRSQ 2006). One of the only
other reform models that has been rigorously evaluated is the Comer Schools program, although one problem
identified by the research is the limited degree of difference between Comer treatment schools and control schools in
the implementation of Comer-style school practices (Cook et al. 1999, 2000).


                                                        17
       A random assignment evaluation of SFA documented that at the end of three years,

students in the treatment schools scored roughly 0.2 standard deviations higher than students in

the control schools on a standardized reading assessment. These effects were equivalent to about

one-fifth the gap between low and high socioeconomic-status children (Borman et al., 2007).

SFA costs about $950 per student per year (Borman and Hewes 2003), with about two-thirds of

this cost associated with the program’s tutoring component. Current spending under the federal

government’s Title I program is around $880 per eligible student, and that there is little evidence

that Title I funding as typically deployed by public schools translates into much gain in student

learning (Gordon, 2004, van der Klaauw, 2008). One implication is that in schools serving

predominantly poor students, SFA could be implemented mostly by just redeploying existing

Title I funds. If the experimental evaluation of SFA is correct and the program’s impact is

anything like 0.2 standard deviations, this type of funding shift would easily pass a benefit-cost

test, since Krueger (2003) shows that test score increases of this magnitude would increase the

present value of each student’s lifetime earnings profile by thousands of dollars.

       At the high school level, CSR models incorporate similar features, often involving a

reorganization of the larger high school into smaller learning communities, referred to as “small

schools,” “schools within a school,” and “learning academies.” Small learning communities aim

to provide a more personalized learning environment that will better engage and motivate

students, and prevent at-risk students from “falling through the cracks.” Other common reform

features include work-based learning opportunities (e.g., internships) and assistance for students

who enter high school with poor academic skills (Herlihy and Quint 2006).

       However to date there is little evidence that, as currently implemented, these high school

CSR approaches improve student outcomes. The most rigorous evaluation of a high school CSR




                                                18
is the random assignment study of Career Academies, which are organized as small learning

communities of between 150 and 200 high school students (often housed within larger,

comprehensive high schools) that focus on a specific occupation or industry. Unlike the

vocational education programs that were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, career academies

combine academic and technical curriculum, often using the technical curricula relevant to a

particular industry to motivate students. One hallmark of these programs is to establish a

connection with employers in the given field, which occurs through mentors and internships of

students with local employers.

       Early results of the Career Academy evaluation indicated that students in the program

reported that their school provided a more personalized learning environment relative to students

in the control group. The program raised attendance and completion of course credits in the

early years of high school. A later follow-up found no differences in high school completion

rates between program and control groups, but did find a substantial impact on earnings among

high-risk students (Kemple and Willner, 2008). More research is needed to assess this approach,

including evidence about whether the positive effects documented in the prior research would

generalize to students who do not volunteer for the program, and whether the career academies

studied as part of this evaluation are of higher quality than the typical career academy.

       The federal government could do more to improve the quality of research and

development of curricular improvements or CRS, by for example holding “design competitions.”

Federal, state and local governments could provide curriculum developers with incentives to do

more rigorous evaluation of their products by requiring that schools devote resources to only

those products that have been proven to be effective in randomized trials (see Jacob and Ludwig

2005). The Institute for Education Sciences is moving in this direction. But the FDA’s




                                                19
requirements that new drugs be subject to at least three phases of clinical trials highlights how far

we are from providing parents the same assurances about the value of their children’s learning

experiences at school.

B. Teacher Labor Markets

         A key policy challenge for school districts is to induce more effective teachers to teach in

high-poverty schools. As discussed above, one strategy is to offer targeted financial incentives

to individuals teaching in hard-to-staff schools and/or subjects. But there are also a variety of

potential inefficiencies in the way that schools hire, promote, and dismiss teachers. At least

some of the problems might be addressed without substantial increase in resources.10

         One promising approach is to promote alternative pathways into teaching. Traditional

certification requirements impose a high cost (both in terms of money and time) on individuals

interested in teaching, particularly on those with the best outside labor market options. As a

result certification requirements may help dissuade some highly skilled people from entering the

teaching profession. Many studies have explored the relative effectiveness of teachers with

traditional versus alternative (or no) certification. The emerging consensus is that differences

between the groups are relatively small, and that in certain grades and subjects, teachers with

alternative certification may actually outperform those with traditional certification (Boyd et al.

2005; Kane, Rockoff and Staiger 2006, Glazerman et al. 2006). Hence, alternative certification

may improve the supply of teachers without reducing quality.

         Given the wide variation in effectiveness, policies that help school officials identify and

hire the best applicants could have an important impact on student outcomes. Unfortunately,

10
  There has been little research on teacher “demand” policies. One reason is the perception that disadvantaged
school districts are in a state of perpetual shortage, and thus hire anyone that walks through the door. In reality,
while there are often shortages in certain subjects and grade levels, many disadvantaged districts have an ample
supply of teachers for most positions. For example, the Chicago Public Schools regularly receives 10 applications
for each position.


                                                         20
there is little guidance that researchers can provide in this area. For example, staffing rules, late

state budgets and inefficient human resource procedures dissuade many qualified applicants from

teaching in urban schools (Levin and Quinn 2003; Levin et al. 2005). This suggests that changes

to collective bargaining agreements that reform staffing rules and a more efficient, customer-

focused approach to HR would improve teacher quality.11

        Whatever system is used to hire teachers, it is inevitable that some teachers will not

perform well in the classroom. Recognizing that the hiring process is imperfect, virtually all

school systems place new teachers on probation for several years, subjecting them to an up-or-

out tenure review. However, in practice, public schools typically do not take advantage of the

probationary period to obtain additional information about teacher effectiveness and weed out

lower-quality teachers.12 In New York City, for example, only about 50 out of roughly 75,000

teachers were dismissed for performance-related reasons in recent years.13 In the Chicago Public

Schools, only 15 out of 11,621 teachers who were evaluated in 2007 received a rating of

unsatisfactory, and only 641 out of 11,621 (roughly 5.5 percent) received a rating of satisfactory.

The remaining teachers were rated excellent or superior.14

        One possible solution is to raise the tenure bar for new teachers, and to deny tenure to

those who are not effective at raising student achievement. Some have suggested that this type

of evaluation should be based at least in part on teacher value-added scores (e.g., Gordon et al.

2006). Other criteria could also be used in making high-stakes decisions such as teacher

dismissals, given the concerns about the reliability and validity of value-added measures


11
   The discussion draws on Jacob (2007). Professional development, including mentoring for novice teachers, is
another strategy for enhancing teacher ability. Such policies are complements to the policies discussed in this
section. For a review, see Hill (2007).
12
   As mentioned earlier, professional development is clearly an important complement to the dismissal of
underperforming probationary teachers.

discussed earlier. For example, while commonly measured teacher characteristics have little

correlation with student achievement, principals do recognize which teachers are most effective.

Jacob and Lefgren (2007) compare principal ratings of teacher effectiveness with “objective”

measures of teacher effectiveness calculated using student achievement gains. They find that

principals can identify the best and worst teachers, but have little ability to distinguish between

teachers in the middle of the ability distribution. This suggests that principal evaluations could

also be included as one factor in teacher tenure ratings, both because they may add additional

information beyond student test scores, but also because they reduce potential negative effects of

relying solely on an output-based measure (e.g., teachers cheating, or teaching narrowly to the

test in order to maximize short-run student test scores at the cost of skills that will maximize

long-term learning).

       One might still be concerned that principals would be hesitant to deny tenure to many

teachers. Several years ago, the Chicago Public Schools and Chicago Teachers’ Union signed a

collective bargaining agreement which gave principals considerable latitude to dismiss untenured

teachers. Jacob (2008) finds that the teachers who were selected for dismissal did have more

absences and lower value-added scores than other probationary teachers in the same school who

were not selected for dismissal, suggesting that principals did consider productivity in making

their decisions. However, Jacob (2008) reports that 30-40 percent of principals – including many

at very low-performing schools – did not dismiss any teachers, suggesting that some

administrators may be reluctant to remove poorly performing employees. One reason may be

that it is difficult to hire high-quality replacements, and so principals might be reluctant to risk

the chance of getting an even worse replacement. It is also possible that principals are reluctant

to incur the social and political costs associated with dismissal. In either case, any policy to raise




                                                  22
the tenure bar will inevitably have to grapple with incorporating some system to ensure that

difficult decisions are made.

IV. INCENTIVES AND ACCOUNTABILITY

       Class size reduction is an “input-based” educational intervention, based on the

assumption that schools will perform better with additional resources. Comprehensive school

reform is based on the assumption that schools are not utilizing optimal pedagogical practices,

and therefore seeks to improve schooling outcomes by prescribing a more effective instructional

approach. Both strategies assume that educators are willing to work as hard as they can given

resource constraints. Prescriptive approaches that push schools to adopt specific practices also

assume that it does not make sense for individuals to continually “reinvent the wheel” and thus

relies on centralized decision makers who presumably have better information about “best

practices” for any given school than local principals and teachers. An alternative approach to

school reform focuses on enhancing both the incentives and flexibility enjoyed by school

personnel. While the theories underlying school choice and school accountability differ in

important ways, both strategies rely on the core notions of incentives and flexibility. In this

section, we review the existing empirical work on how accountability and choice reforms impact

student outcomes.

       The available evidence to date is probably strongest on behalf of the ability of school

accountability systems to change the behavior of teachers and principals, although one lesson

from that body of research is the great importance of getting the design of such policies right.

A. Teacher merit pay

       Teacher compensation often arises in discussions of school reform. Most public school

teachers are paid according to strict formulas that incorporate years of service and credits of




                                                 23
continuing education including Master’s and doctorate degrees, despite the fact that research

consistently finds that advanced degrees are not associated with better student performance and

experience only matters in the first few years of teaching. For this reason, reformers have

suggested that a teacher’s compensation should be tied directly to her productivity as measured

by student performance or supervisor evaluation. Proponents of “pay-for-performance,” also

known as “merit” or “incentive” pay, argue that it would not only provide incentives for current

teachers to work “harder” or “smarter,” but also could alter the type of people who enter the

teaching force and then choose to remain.

       Critics of merit pay emphasize instead that teaching is a collaborative venture and that

incentive pay for individuals could harm the teamwork necessary for effective schools. They

note that it is difficult to monitor teachers, and that because there are multiple objectives that we

would like teachers to accomplish, a system that focuses on one easily observable outcome such

as student test scores will likely distort teacher behavior in ways that harm other outcomes. For

example, teachers may focus attention more on the subjects that “count” under the performance

system, or they may neglect students who they view as too far behind (or even too far ahead).

Proponents counter that pay-for-performance systems can focus on teams of teachers or schools,

and that one might incorporate principal evaluations as well as test scores to mitigate distortions.

       As Murnane and Cohen (1986) note, incentive pay has a long history in American

education, though few systems that directly reward teachers on the basis of student performance

have survived. While many teachers indicate that their compensation incorporates some aspect

of incentive pay, there are few examples of pay that is tied very closely with student

performance. One prominent example is the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP), which

incorporates incentive pay along with pay for additional professional development activities and




                                                 24
other service. This program is more popular than many “old style” merit pay programs, and

there is some evidence that they may improve student performance on standardized tests

(Springer et al. 2008). Given this tentative but positive evidence, there could be some benefit

from continued experimentation by schools and districts with pay for performance, particularly if

this experimentation is subject to careful evaluation as well.

B. School accountability systems

       Recent studies suggest that accountability reforms can foster positive changes in behavior

by school administrators, teachers, and students. At the same time research provides some

warnings that incentive-based reforms often generate unintended negative consequences, such as

teachers neglecting certain students, cutting corners or even cheating to artificially raise student

test scores. The fact that actors within the school system do respond to changes in incentives

highlights both the promise and pitfalls of accountability reform, and underscores the importance

of the specific design details of accountability policies.

       While studies of school-based accountability policies in the eighties and nineties found

mixed results (Jacob 2005), two major accountability reforms from the late 1990s – in Chicago

and Florida – have demonstrated positive results. In 1996, the Chicago Public Schools (CPS)

introduced a comprehensive accountability policy designed to raise academic achievement. The

first component of the policy focused on holding students accountable for learning, by ending a

practice commonly known as “social promotion” whereby students are advanced to the next

grade regardless of ability or achievement level. In addition, the CPS also instituted a policy that

placed low-performing schools on probation, which entailed a modest amount of additional

resources along with enhanced monitoring and the threat of future closure.




                                                  25
       Jacob (2005) finds that math and reading achievement increased sharply following the

introduction of this accountability policy, in comparison to both prior achievement trends in the

district and to changes experienced by other large, urban districts in the mid-west. However, for

younger students, the policy did not increase performance on a state-administered, low-stakes

exam. His analysis suggests that the observed achievement gains were driven by increases in

test-specific skills and student effort. This finding is consistent with prior work suggesting that

test preparation associated with high-stakes testing may artificially inflate achievement,

producing gains that are not generalizable to other exams (see for example Koretz et al. 1991,

Koretz and Barron 1998). Note that the policy did lead to substantial achievement gains for older

students, and that for older students the test-specific gains did likely represent real learning of the

skills found on the high-stakes tests.

       Figlio and Rouse (2006) study Florida’s A+ Plan for Education, a school-based

accountability system that was implemented several years before the introduction of No Child

Left Behing. In 1999, schools received “grades” based on their students’ test scores on the

Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT). Under the A+ Plan, schools that received a

failing grade (i.e., “F”) in two consecutive years were required to offer their students vouchers to

enroll in private schools. Schools that faced declining enrollments were subject to staff cuts, and

additional sanctions. It was hoped that the stigma associated with the highly visible failing

grade, coupled with the threat of competition induced by the vouchers, would provide low-

performing schools with an incentive to improve.

       Figlio and Rouse (2006) find that the designation of a school as failing led to a significant

increase in student math performance, on the order of 5 scale score points, roughly 0.1 standard

deviations. The impact of receiving an “F” on a low-stakes math test is about half as large.




                                                  26
Researchers studying later versions of Florida’s accountability system find similar effects

(Chiang 2007, Rouse et al. 2007). Moreover, they find that much of these learning gains were

sustained in the following few years.

         While these studies suggest accountability policies can improve student achievement,

other studies show that educators respond strategically to test-based accountability in many

unintended ways, some of which may have negative consequences for students. Jacob (2005)

finds that educators in Chicago responded to the accountability program by placing a larger

fraction of low-performing students in special education (thus removing them from the test-

taking pool15), retaining a larger fraction of students before they reached the grades where they

were subject to accountability mandates (i.e., in kindergarten through second grade), and by

shifting attention away from subjects such as science and social studies that were not used to

determine student or school sanctions under the accountability policy. Each of these responses

increased a school’s measured performance, even though they seem inappropriate and

detrimental to student learning. However, it is also possible that some, and perhaps most,

educators viewed these steps as appropriate responses, which would benefit students.16 A

growing body of research also suggests that accountability systems generate larger

improvements among students who are relatively closer to the passing threshold used to reward

schools (Chakrabarty, 2006; Neal and Schatzenbach, 2007). Finally, Jacob and Levitt (2003)

find that the prevalence of teacher cheating rose sharply in low-achieving classrooms following

the introduction of Chicago’s accountability policy.



15
   Unlike more recent accountability reforms, the program in Chicago did not explicitly monitor the fraction of
students who were tested so that placing students in special education would benefit a school rating.
16
   A struggling student may benefit from placement in special education services. Similarly, teachers and
administrators often believe that holding children back in an earlier grade provides them additional opportunities to
mature and to master basic skills before moving on to higher grades. Also, the focus on math and reading relative to
science and social studies was one intended goal of the program.


                                                         27
        Two recent studies utilize data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress

(NAEP) to assess the impact of standards-based accountability across a variety of states, rather

than focusing on case studies of a single jurisdiction’s policy. These studies are important

because the NAEP data was not used by any state as part of its accountability program, which

means educators had no incentive to manipulate test scores in the way that prior studies

document has occurred for high-stakes exams in individual states. Both studies find positive

achievement effects overall, although they do not find evidence that accountability policies have

consistently reduced the racial achievement gap (Carnoy and Loeb 2003; Hanushek and

Raymond 2005).

        A review of simple national time trends in the recent NAEP data suggests that NCLB

may have improved student achievement, particularly the math performance of younger children.

However, to our knowledge, there has not been any systematic investigation of the impact of

NCLB at a national level which attempts to account for prior achievement trends or the presence

of other policies.

        Even without evaluation evidence of NCLB directly, the available accountability research

suggests a number of modifications to NCLB that could potentially increase the effectiveness of

the legislation. The first of these is the adoption of a single achievement standard for all districts

in the country. The provision that allowed states to choose the tests they use for measuring

student performance has resulted in vast disparities in the academic rigor of accountability

requirements across states. Given the political difficulty in imposing a uniform national

standard, some national associations of state officials and educators have worked to voluntarily

adopt common standards. A second feature of NCLB that has come under scrutiny is the use of

a single proficiency level --that is, holding schools accountable for the share of students with




                                                 28
scores above some single cutoff value – since this provides students an incentive to neglect

students who are far above or below this threshold. An alternative approach is for schools to be

held accountable for the gains that all students make each year. A third change to NCLB that

has been discussed is to provide states and districts with flexibility to focus on the schools most

in need of improvement, particularly if the current level of federal funding for NCLB is not

increased substantially.

C. School Choice

         Another way to clarify goals or change incentives is to provide parents greater choice of

schools for their children through public magnet schools, charter schools, or vouchers for

students to attend private schools. Choice proponents suggest that by creating a marketplace

where parents can select schools, a choice-based system might generate competition among

schools that would improve the quality of schools throughout the marketplace. This theory rests

on several assumptions, including that the degree of choice will be large enough to generate

meaningful competition. For example, a handful of charter schools with limited enrollment

capacity are unlikely to generate meaningful competition in a large district. This suggests that a

choice system must permit relatively easy entry into the market by potential suppliers, which

includes individuals and organizations wishing to open schools. There must also be easy “exit”

from the market that allows (and, indeed, forces) unsuccessful schools to close.17

         The second set of assumptions involves the information available to parents and the

preferences they have for their children’s education. Parents must have sufficient information to

make an informed choice. Data on school performance must be transparent, accessible and

easily understood by parents with varying degrees of sophistication. The effects of choice will

17
  If the administrators and teachers in a public school that loses half of its students to a nearby charter school
continue teaching the smaller group of students, or are merely reassigned to other schools in the district, they may
not change their practices despite the pressure exerted by the nearby charter.


                                                          29
also depend in large part on the nature of the preferences themselves. Expanded choice is only

likely to increase student academic outcomes if achievement is a central concern for parents.

       The most rigorous studies to assess parental preferences typically find that parents place a

high value on proximity and student racial composition (Glazerman 2000, Calvo 2006, Hastings

et al. 2006). On average, parents place limited value on the “academic quality” of the school as

measured by things like student test scores, though parents with higher income tend to place a

higher priority on test scores (Hastings et al. 2006). While these results suggest that choice plans

may not lead to higher performance among poor children, there is some evidence that providing

poor families with more transparent information about school quality does lead parents to select

“better” schools in terms of academic performance (Hastings et al. 2007).

       Even if school choice does not foster competition that increases the productivity of

schooling overall, the opportunity to choose may still have a positive effect on students. Choice

might allow a student to attend a school with better teachers, more resources, or more studious

peers. Whether this re-sorting of children across schools improves average outcomes for all

children, or simply changes the distribution of academic achievement across children, depends

on whether some children gain more from “better” peer settings than others. Of course, if the

goal is to reduce inequity in schooling opportunities and outcomes, and school choice provides

choices to disadvantaged students who would not have them otherwise, then choice may still

have served a worthwhile purpose. Some argue that choice provides poor parents the

opportunities that wealthier parents have always had.

       The availability of choice may also improve student outcomes if it allows parents to find

schools that are a better “match” for their individual child’s needs, which in principle could




                                                30
allow most students to benefit from choice.18 Some would argue that if choice allows parents to

select the type of schools they want, the system should be considered a success. While this may

be true from the parents’ perspective, if society values certain outcomes more than others, then

free choice on the part of parents may not maximize social welfare.

        There are hundreds of studies on school choice, ranging from studies of charter schools to

private voucher plans. However, the vast majority of research in this area suffers from a critical

limitation, which researchers refer to as selection bias. Students who utilize school choice

(whether it is a public magnet school, a charter school or a private school) differ from students

who do not, both in terms of easily observable ways such as race, income and achievement level,

but also likely in more subtle ways such as personal motivation or family support. If researchers

do not account for such differences when comparing, for example, charter schools with

neighborhood public schools, then the results can be misleading.

        The best studies of the impact of attending a public school of choice on student

achievement overcome the problem of selection bias mentioned above by focusing on choice

schools that are oversubscribed and use random lotteries to determine admission. By comparing

the outcomes of students who win and lose lotteries, the researchers can estimate the causal

impact of attending a public school of choice. Looking at elementary and high schools in

Chicago, Cullen et al. (2006, forthcoming) find that winning a choice lottery has no effect on a

wide range of academic outcomes.19 In a study of school choice lotteries in the Charlotte-

Mecklenberg school district, Hastings et al. (2006a) find that, on average, students do not benefit

from winning one of the lotteries and attending their preferred school. However, when they

18
   For example, the back-to-basics, discipline-oriented “academy” may be a good fit for some students, while other
children may thrive more in an environment that provides more flexibility and autonomy. The match may reflect
more mundane needs, including proximity to the parents’ work or the availability of a particular elective.
19
   For high school students, the authors find some evidence that winning a choice lottery improves certain non-
academic outcomes such as the likelihood of getting into trouble with the police.


                                                        31
examine children whose parents seemed to place a greater value on academics (based on the type

of schools they chose), the authors find that these students do experience higher test scores from

winning the public school choice lottery. Finally, as noted above, there is some evidence that

career academies, one prominent type of public choice school, have positive effects on student

outcomes (Cullen et al. 2005, Kemple and Willner, 2008).

       A parallel literature analyzes the effect of attending a charter school on academic

outcomes, and yields similarly mixed outcomes. Several studies find small negative or zero

effects (Hanushek et al. 2005, Bifulco and Ladd 2006, Sass 2006). A recent random evaluation

of New York City charters uses a lottery-based research design, comparing students who win and

lose lotteries to oversubscribed charter schools, and finds robust positive effects (Hoxby and

Murarka 2007). This approach removes concerns about selection bias, but has the drawback of

focusing on a small number of particularly successful (or at least popular) charter schools.

       Perhaps the most contentious form of school choice involves vouchers that allow students

to attend private schools. Voucher experiments in Milwaukee, New York, Dayton and

Washington, DC have been evaluated. These studies typically focus on comparing outcomes

between students who are versus are not offered the chance to attend private schools. While the

results in most cities were discouraging, the evaluation in NYC pointed to some modest test

score gains for African-American children, although the magnitude of these results has been

debated (Howell et al. 2002, Krueger and Zei 2004).

The most difficult area of school choice to analyze empirically is the claim that choice will foster

competition that will, in turn, improve the productivity of all schools. Hoxby (2000) compared

geographic areas, and found that those areas with more school choice for largely historical

reasons (e.g. the presence of streams and rivers which made transportation difficult in earlier




                                                32
times, and thus encouraged areas to divide themselves along the boundary of such waterways),

had more productive schools, suggesting that greater choice is associated with greater efficiency

in schooling. However, others have argued that these results are not particularly robust

(Rothstein 2006, Hoxby 2006). Urquiola (2005) finds evidence of sorting: the “best” public

school students left for the private sector. Areas with greater district choice tend to have a

smaller fraction of students attending private schools, but these districts also have schools that

are more racially homogenous.

       In summary, there is mixed evidence on whether the opportunity to attend a choice

school – public magnet, charter or private – has substantial academic benefits for poor children

as well as on the question of whether large scale choice programs might improve the productivity

of schools in a general. It is premature to make strong claims about whether such policies can

have substantial benefits for disadvantaged children. Perhaps the main risk associated with

expanded choice opportunities is the possibility of exacerbating the segregation of poor, minority

or low-performing students within a subset of schools. This seems to have happened to some

degree in New Zealand and Chile under the large-scale choice plans adopted there (Fiske and

Ladd, 2000, Ladd and Fiske, 2001, Hsieh and Urquiola, 2006). However as both Neal (2002)

and Ladd (2002) point out, the effects of any choice plan is likely to depend crucially on the

details of key design questions, such as whether schools are allowed to select the best students

from their applicant pools. Many of the current public school choice plans require over-

subscribed schools to admit students on the basis of lotteries, providing some guard against this

type of sorting. Additional experimentation by states and districts with different forms of public

school choice (e.g., magnet or charter schools) would provide additional opportunities to learn

more about their potential impacts.

V. CONCLUSIONS

       The release of the landmark Coleman Report in 1966 fostered pessimism about the ability

of schools to improve the life chances of poor children. The report found that a variety of school

“inputs” such as teacher educational attainment and per pupil spending were only weakly

correlated with student test scores, and raised questions about what schools could accomplish

without broader changes in social policy. The Coleman Report and subsequent research pushed

policymakers to consider outcome-based measures of success and spurred interest in reform

strategies that focus on changing the incentives within the public school system.

       A careful review of the empirical evidence, however, suggests a variety of policies that

are likely to substantially improve the academic performance of poor children. Importantly, we

found examples of successful programs or policies within each of the three broad categories

outlined in the introduction. Targeted investment of additional resources in early childhood

education, smaller class sizes and bonuses for teachers in hard-to-staff schools and subjects seem

likely to pass a cost-benefit test, even without a fundamental re-organization of the existing

public school system. At the same time, researchers have identified some ways of changing

standard operating procedures within schools that can improve the outcomes of poor children

even without large amounts of additional spending. Examples include the adoption of

comprehensive school reform models like Success for All and Career Academies and the

expansion of alternative certification opportunities. Finally, policies that seek to change

incentives within schools, such as the accountability policies adopted by districts and states since

the mid-1990s, offer some promise of improving schooling for poor children.

       Given limited financial resources and perhaps even more limited political attention, it is

unlikely that policymakers could adopt all of the “successful” practices discussed in this chapter.




                                                34
Based on our read of the empirical literature, the following education policies seem likely to

generate the largest gains in academic achievement among poor children:

       1. Increased investments in early childhood education for poor children. Even though

           short-term gains in IQ or achievement test scores diminish over time, there is

           evidence of long-term improvement in a variety of outcomes such as educational

           attainment that will help children escape from poverty as adults. Increased

           investment in early childhood education may be particularly productive and important

           given the limited investment our society currently makes in the cognitive

           development of very young children.

       2. Taking advantage of the opportunity provided by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) to

           better utilize accountability reforms to improve outcomes for poor children. NCLB

           was enacted in 2001 with bipartisan support, although it has received considerable

           criticism in recent years. But the debate over the existence of NCLB seems to miss a

           fundamental lesson we have learned about accountability in the past decade: the

           specific design of the program matters enormously. Potentially productive changes to

           NCLB (as well as to co-existing state or district accountability systems) include:

           adopting common achievement standards across states, focusing accountability on

           student growth rather than proficiency levels, providing states and districts with the

           flexibility to focus limited resources on the most needy schools, and reconciling

           federal and state accountability systems.

       3. Provide educators incentives to adopt practices with a compelling research base while

           expanding efforts (including resources) to develop and identify effective instructional

           regimes. One of the lessons from the accountability movement is that highly




                                                35
   disadvantaged schools (and districts) often lack the capacity to change themselves.

   There is good evidence that certain comprehensive school reforms such as Success

   for All can raise achievement levels among poor children with little additional

   expenditures. Similarly, there is compelling evidence that alternative certification

   routes into teaching can expand the supply of teachers willing to work in hard-to-staff

   schools and subjects while maintaining, or perhaps even increasing, teacher quality.

   State and district officials could ensure that disadvantaged schools, particularly those

   that have continued to fail under recent accountability system, adopt instructional

   practices and related policies with a strong research base. This would help avoid the

   constant reinvention of the wheel. At the same time, the Federal government could

   help spur such advantages through more focused R&D spending (e.g., perhaps

   through “design competitions” as suggested by Slavin 1997), and governments at all

   levels could help increase the supply of high-quality practices by requiring schools to

   use programs that have been rigorously evaluated (Jacob and Ludwig, 2005).

4. Continue to support and evaluate a variety of public school choice options. The other

   noteworthy trend in output-based reform aside from NCLB is the spread of public

   school choice at the local level. While we believe that the current evidence on the

   benefits of public school choice is limited, the risk associated with these policies

   seems small so long as they are implemented in ways that do not substantially

   exacerbate school segregation along race or class lines. Hence, there could be

   considerable benefit to expanding magnet and charter schools, and to carefully

   evaluating the impact of these schools on the students they serve as well as the

   surrounding schools.




                                        36
       Most anti-poverty policies focus on lifting adults out of poverty. These policies are often

controversial because of an unavoidable tension between the desire to help people who have

been unlucky and the motivation to encourage hard work and punish socially unproductive

behavior. In contrast, successful education policies can not only help reduce poverty over the

long term by making poor children more productive during adulthood, but also foster economic

growth that expands the “pie” for everyone. Educational interventions arguably also benefit

from a compelling moral justification as well. Many people believe that disadvantaged children

should not be punished for the circumstances into which they are born, and improved education

policy is one of the best ways to prevent this from happening.
