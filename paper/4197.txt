                                           ABSTRACT

    Recently, there has been extensive experimental evaluation of reforms of the unemployment
insurance (UI) system. The UI experiments can be divided into two main areas: reemployment
bonuses and job search programs. The four reemployment bonus experiments offered payments
to UI recipients who found jobs quickly and kept them for a specified period of time. The six
job search experiments evaluated combinations of services including additional information on
job openings, more job placements, and more extensive checks of UI eligibility.
    The bonus experiments show that economic incentives do affect the speed with which people
leave the unemployment insurance rolls. They also show that speeding claimants' return to work
appears to increase total earnings following the claim, but the evidence is less strong. They also
suggest that the rate of pay on the new job is not adversely affected by an earlier return to work.
Despite these encouraging results, I argue that the experiments do not show that permanent
adoption of a reemployment bonus would be beneficial as they cannot account for the effect of
a reemployment bonus on the size of the claimant population.
    The job search experiments test several reforms that appear more promising. Nearly all of
the combinations of services and increased enforcement reduce UI receipt, and have benefits that
exceed Costs. The treatments which mainly increase enforcement of work search rules have small
but often statistically significant effects. The experiments which focus more on providing
services induce much larger reductions in UI receipt, but at a higher cost of services per claimant,
Nevertheless, these experiments have very favorable ratios of benefits to costs.

      Recently, there has been extensive experimental evaluation of proposed reforms

of the unemployment insurance (UI) system in the U.S. The proposed reforms have

generally sought to improve the reemployment prospects of UI claimants and reduce the

budgetary costs of UI. These recent evaluations are novel because most have been social

experiments. Individuals were randomly assigned into either a group subject to special

treatment and incentives, or a group that received existing services and incentives.

Despite the large number of experiments, there is no comprehensive analysis of their

results to date. In this paper, I summarize what can be learned about the effects of UI

policy from these experiments.

      The UI experiments have taken two main forms: cash bonuses and job search

programs) Cash bonus experiments make payments to UI recipients who find jobs

quickly and keep them for a specified period of time. To date, four experiments have




     'A third area of experimentation has tried to encourage self-employment as an
alternative to unemployment. Demonstrations are currently underway in Minnesota and
Washington State. These experiments waive the work test which requires UI recipients
to look for work actively. Lump sum payments to start a business are also part of both
experiments, but they receive greater emphasis in Washington State. These
demonstrations are not evaluated here because their goals differ from the other
demonstrations and they have not been completed. It is also clear from the interim
reports that self-employment only interests a few percent of UI recipients (see Johnson
and Leonard (1992) and Benus et al. (1992)).

examined cash bonuses.2 Job search experiments have evaluated combinations of

services inbluding additional information on job openings, more job placements, and

more extensive checks of UI eligibility. To date, six experiments have analyzed various

forms of job search assistance.3



THE REASONS FOR THE EXPERIMENTS



      Several forces seem to have caused this outburst of experimentation. Recently,

there has been increased concern about both the long-term unemployed and displaced

workers. Between 1975 and 1985 the unemployment rate was persistently higher than it

had been in the first 30 years after World War II. Much of this change was attributed to

increases in unemployment among people with very long periods of joblessness.

Structural changes in the economy seemed to be eliminating a large number of jobs. The

Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 5.1 million workers vith at least three years of

job tenure became separated from their employer during the 1981-85 period. These

increases in joblessness seemed to call for new measures to provide for the unemployed.




   2The fourbonus experiments are the Illinois UI Incentive Experiments, New Jersey
UI Reemployment Demonstration, Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus Demonstration,
and Washington Reemployment Bonus Experiments.
    3The six job search experiments are the Nevada Claimant Placement Program,
Charleston Claimant Placement and Work Test Demonstration, New Jersey UI
Reemployment Demonstration, Nevada Claimant Employment Program, Washington
Alternative Work Search Experiment, and Re-Employ Minnesota.
Identifying displaced workers and targeting services to them was one goal of the

experiments.4

       On the other hand, the large increases in unemployment during this period

drained state UI trust funds forcing many states to borrow to pay their benefits. By the

beginning of 1983, 28 states owed $13.7 billion to the federal government. The sorry

financial state of the UI system pushed many policy makers to look for ways to save

money on UI programs. Reducing the costs of the UI program was a goal of all of the

experiments. There has recently also been a growing desire to get the unemployed back

to work. The experiments emphasize this objective. These forces seem to have been a

particularly important impetus in the case of the bonus experiments.

       The job search experiments were spurred by these forces as well as ideas about

reforming UI operations. Some of the early experiments pointed to abuses of the UI

system such as overpayments. A prime cause of overpayments that is mentioned is the

failure of claimants actively to seek work. These experiments also mentioned a conflict

between the goals of the UI offices which must monitor eligibility and the state

Employment Service (ES) which refers people to jobs. Often these two functions are

provided in different locations and they are generally provided by different individuals.

While the conflict is often described in vague terms, it seems that the ES has an incentive

to be more selective in whom it refers to employers than might be desirable for the UI




    4See Anderson. Corson and Decker (1990), p. 1.
                                             4
system in the short-run. Several of the experiments sought to increase UI/ES

cooperation.5

       The first bonus experiment, which took place in Illinois, was a state effort. The

Illinois experiment appeared to be very successful. This success spurred further

experimentation, much of it hoping to fine tune the bonus idea rather than firmly

establish whether the broad idea of bonuses makes sense.6 The three bonus experiments

that followed were partly supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. Most of the other

experiments were at least partly supported by the Department of Labor, but some were

wholly state funded.



THE USE OF RANDOM ASSIGNMENT



       These UI demonstrations are novel because they are all examined through

random assignment. Whether a claimant is assigned to a treatment group or the control

group is usually determined by the last two digits of his or her social security number.

Estimates of the effect of the programs can be made by comparing outcome measures

such as benefits paid or earnings for those who received the special treatment to the

same measures for those who did not. At least until recently, this use of random




    5See Steinman (1978), pp. 1-6 and Corson, Long, and Nicholson (1985), pp. 2-4.

   6See Spiegelman, O'Leary, and Kline (1991), pp. xii-xiv, and Carson, Decker,
Dunstan, and Kerachsky, p. 1.
                                              5

assignment to evaluate social programs has not been common in any Western country

besides the U.S.7

       For two reasons, this paper focuses on reforms that have been evaluated using

true experiments. First, experimental evidence, if properly conducted and interpreted, is

likely to be the most convincing to social scientists and policy makers alike.

Experimental evidence is easy to explain to policy makers, and the assumptions necessary

for its validity are often weaker than those required in nonexperimental empirical work.8

However, experimental evidence can have important weaknesses. I will return to this

point later. The second reason to focus on experiments is purely practical; the focus

narrows the scope of the paper to a small group of reforms that can be adequately

analyzed.



EVALUATING THE EVALUATIONS



      The degree of success of the experiments can be measured in a number of

dimensions. In most cases I will report the available statistics on whether the

experiments achieved their objective of reducing weeks of benefits paid and costs.

Because we might be concerned that a speedier exit from the UI rolls might result in a

worse job placement, I also focus on claimants' subsequent earnings. Some other




    7See Nathan (1988).

    8See Hausman and Wise (1985) for a discussion of these issues. Of particular
interest are the papers and comments in Chapters 3 and 5.
                                              6

outcome measures are analyzed below when available. Explicit analyses of the overall

costs and benefits of the reforms are available for some of these experiments. These are

discussed along with summaries of some of the costs and benefits that are available for

the other experiments. I then discuss the long-term implications of adopting these

programs, which may differ sharply from short-run analyses.

       A number of conclusions can be drawn from the unemployment insurance

experiments. The bonus experiments show that economic incentives do affect the speed

with which people leave the unemployment insurance rolls. Ut is not a completely

bentgn transfer; it affects claimants' behavior. This is shown by the declines in weeks of

UI receipt found for all of the bonus treatments, several of which were statistically

significant. The experiments also show that speeding claimants' return to work appears

to increase total earnings and hours worked following the claim, but the evidence is less

strong. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that the rate of pay on the new job is not

adversely affected by an earlier return to work. This would be an important finding and

would imply that small changes in time out of work induced by small changes in UI are

unlikely to appreciably affect the reemployment wage of claimants.

       Despite these encouraging results, I do not believe that the experiments show that

permanent adoption of a reemployment bonus would be beneficial to the UI system or

society. The key drawback of the experiments is that they cannot account for the effect

of a reemployment bonus on the size of the claimant population. A reemployment bonus

makes the ftrst trip to the UI office much more valuable for claimants as they become

eligible for a large payment if they find a job soon. Such a payment is most valuable to
                                               7

someone who plans to start a job soon and may not currently believe filing for UI is

worth the trouble. The UI experiments clearly show the effect of monetary incentives on

the propensity to continue receiving benefits. There would likely be a similar effect on

the propensity to file initially as the compensation for short UI spells increases. Changes

in initial filing could eliminate or reverse the positive effects of a bonus.

       The job search experiments test several alternative reforms which appear more

promising. The six experiments try several different combinations of services to improve

job search and increase enforcement of work search rules. Nearly all of these

combinations reduce UI receipt, and have benefits that exceed costs. The treatments

which mainly increase enforcement of work search rules have small but often statistically

significant effects. The experiments which focus more on providing services induce much

larger reductions in UI receipt, but at a higher cost of services per claimant.

Nevertheless, these experiments have very favorable ratios of benefits to costs.



                                 2. The Bonus Experiments



       The cash bonus experiments made payments to UI recipients who found jobs

quickly and kept them for a specified period of time. This section describes in turn the

design of the experiments, the outcomes of the experiments, and then whether the results

suggest that permanent adoption of a bonus program would be sensible.
                                              8

A. The Experimental Designs



       Table 1 summarizes the main design characteristics of the four bonus experiments.

The experiments differed along a large number of dimensions. These dimensions

included the amount of the bonus payment, the period during which a person had to find

a job to qualify for the bonus (the qualification period), and the period the individual had

to remain at the new job to receive the bonus (the reemployment period). In addition to

these elements, the point at which the offer of a bonus was made known to the claimant

differed, as did the population of claimants offered the bonus, and the eligibility of

people returning to their previous employer or hired through a union hiring hall.

       The first bonus experiment in Illinois offered all claimants, regardless of their

previous earnings or weekly benefit amount, a $500 bonus. To put this dollar amount in

perspective, it was about 4 times the average weekly unemployment insurance benefit.

The qualification period was 11 weeks for all claimants and the reemployment period was

4 months. In other words, to receive a bonus a person had to start a job within 11 weeks

of filing for benefits and keep that job for four months. The other experiments had

different benefit amounts, qualification periods, and reemployment periods. The later

experiments, particularly those in Pennsylvania and Washington, tried several different

combinations of benefit amounts and qualification periods. Washington tried 3 different

formulas for the bonus amount combined with 2 different formulas for the qualification

period, for 6 different treatments in all. Pennsylvania also had 6 different treatments.

Random asstgnment was also used to assign individuals to these alternative treatments.
                                              9

       While the bonus amount was the same $500 for all claimants in Illinois, in the

three other experiments it was a multiple of a person's weekly benefit amount (which

depends on their previous earnings). In Washington, the qualification period also varied

across individuals within a treatment group, depending on their potential duration (which

in turn depends on the stability of a person's earnings over the previous year). These

formulas which determined the benefit amount and qualification period were the same

svithin a treatment group, but differed across treatment groups. One of the treatments in

the original Illinois experiment offered the $500 bonus to employers who hired claimants.

This treatment had a much smaller impact than the one which paid the $500 to

employees, and this approach was not tried in any of the later experiments.

       Each of the experiments randomly assigned eligible UI claimants to either a

control group which received existing benefits and services, or one of the treatment

groups. However, 3 of the 4 experiments excluded several groups prior to this

randomization. Generally, those with a definite recall date and those typically hired

through a union hiring hall arrangement were excluded. The unemployment durations of

these individuals were thought to be unlikely to be affected by a bonus. The experiments

following the one in Illinois all excluded individuals recalled to a previous job. This

exclusion eliminated the subsidy to temporary layoffs that would have been present if the

Illinois bonus design had been permanently adopted.

       There were some other aspects of the treatments that somewhat complicate

comparisons across treatments and states. Several of the experiments combined the

bonus offer with the provision of other services. The New Jersey experiment was a
                                             10

hybrid between a reemployment bonus experiment and a job search experiment. New

Jersey had a mandatory job-search assistance (JSA) program which was part of all

treatment groups (but not available to the controls). I discuss the bonus elements of the

New Jersey demonstration here, while the job search treatments are discussed in Section

3. However, to assess the effects of the bonus alone, it seems most natural to compare

the bonus with JSA treatment to the JSA only treatment. For some of the published

statistics one can make such comparisons, but for other outcome measures one must

make the comparison informally. Pennsylvania also tried a job search workshop, but it

was optional and the participation rate was under three percent. Therefore, I follow

Corson et al. (1991) and assume that we can ignore the effects of the workshop.



B. Effects on Weeks of Benefits and Earnings



       Table 2 reports estimates of the effects of the four experiments on weeks of

unemployment benefits received and measures of reemployment earnings. Reducing the

weeks of UI received by claimants was an explicit goal of all of the experiments. I report

the weeks of benefits received in the benefit year9 rather than dollars of benefits or

weeks in the first spell of UI receipt because benefit year weeks are precisely measured,

and are easier to compare across experiments. In all cases, I report the mean for the




    9The benefit year is the 52 week period beginning with the week the individual filed
for UI benefits.
                                              11

treatment group in question minus the mean for the control group.'° This statistic

provides an estimate of the effect of the bonus on the number of weeks of UI benefits

received. When available, I also report the same statistic obtained after one accounts for

the effects of individual characteristics in a regression analysis. These individual

characteristics typically include age, sex, race, and other variables such as location in the

state and recall expectations. The control group mean weeks of benefits and earnings

are reported in the notes to Table 2.

       Several of the evaluation reports overstate the case for using regression controls

for individual characteristics in the estimates of experimental effects. As long as the

randomization is done properly, comparisons of means are unbiased and probably more

convincing to policy makers. The improved precision of the estimates with regression

controls appears small in all cases in Table 2, which is expected given the small

proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the equations.'1

Large differences between the estimates with and without regression controls should be

taken as evidence that random assignment was not carried out properly.

       The negative numbers reported in the first two columns of Table 2 indicate that

the number of weeks of UI benefits received was lower for those who were offered a

reemployment bonus. The bonus offers appear to have caused a decline in UI receipt in

all of the experiments, though many of the declines are not statistically significant at


    '°The mean for a treatment group is the mean for all those assigned to the treatment
group not just those who participate or receive a bonus. This method allows us to use
the controls as a valid comparison group.

    "For example, the New Jersey benefit year weeks equations has an R2 of .064.
                                              12

conventional levels. The Illinois claimant experiment had by far the largest effect and

the one that is statistically the strongest. Mean weeks of benefits fell by over 1 week

when individuals were offered $500 for starting a job within 11 weeks of fling for

benefits. The employer experiment in Illinois had a moch smaller impact on weeks of

benefits, and payments to employers were not tried in any of the later experiments.

Some reasons for the differing resolts of the two experiments are mentioned in Section 5

below.

         The three subseqoent experiments, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington,

all estimate moch smaller effects of reemployment bonuses. In New Jersey, the job-

search assistance (JSA) and bonus treatment has a large estimated effect of almost one

week, and this difference from the control group is statistically significant. However,

when one compares this treatment to the JSA only treatment, one sees that the

estimated additional effect of the bonus is much smaller and only marginally statistically

significant. In both Pennsylvania and Washington the estimated effects of the different

bonuses on weeks of benefits are mostly small and of weak statistical significance. To

put the magnitudes of the estimated effects in perspective, the average weeks of UI

received in the benefit year by the control group ranged from 15 to 20 weeks in the

different experiments. The effects of the bonuses cluster around one-half of a week, or

about 3 percent of the average duration of receipt.

         There is some tendency for the larger bonuses and those with a longer

qualiflcation period to have a larger effect, but this relationship is not strong. In both

Pennsylvania and Washington, regressions were estimated to determine if there was any
                                              13

statistical evidence that the effects of the bonuses rose with either the bonus amount or

the qualification period. In both experiments a higher bonus and longer eligibility period

were associated with greater impacts, but neither effect was statistically significant. Each

thousand dollars of a bonus was estimated to reduce UI recei.. one-third of a week in

Pennsylvania and almost one-half of a week in Washington.

       Other measures of UI receipt, such as weeks in the first spell and dollars of

benefits received, show a similar pattern of decreases by those offered bonuses. Overall,

the experiments show the tendency of people to find a job more quickly if there are

monetary incentives to do so. However, the evidence comes from the consistent negative

values for the treatment minus control differences in weeks of UI receipt rather than

from precisely measured effects of each treatment.

       A key measure of the success of the bonus offers is their effect on claimant

earnings. I focus on two distinct measures of earnings: weekly or quarterly earnings

which is an indicator of the quality of the job; and total earnings during a period of

several quarters after filing the UI claim which is largely determined by the number of

weeks worked. If claimants are induced to find a job more quickly, the job they find may

be less desirable. I examine quarterly earnings because it is an easily quantifiable

measure of the desirability of a job and it is available for all of the bonus ecperiments.

The last column of Table 2 reports the estimated impact of the different bonus offers on

quarterly earnings. As with the weeks of UI estimates above, I report the earnings of

those who received the bonus offer minus the earnings of those in the control group.

The reports on the different experiments did not use a common measure of earnings, so
                                               14

1 have used what was available, supplemented by my own calculations and numbers

obtained through private correspondence) The measures reported io Table 2 are

intended to capture quarterly earnings after leaving the UI rolls. The measures are

either earnings during the flrst full quarter after ending receipt of UI or earnings 3 or 4

quarters after first claiming benefits.

       The estimated effects of the experiments on earnings are somewhat encouraging.

The experiments show no statistically significant declines in earnings, and many of the

bonuses offered to workers actually indicate no change in earnings or small increases. In

Illinois the claimant experiment group has slightly higher earnings than the control group,

but the difference is not significant. Treatment group earnings for the employer

experiment are lower, but not significantly lower than the claimant experiment or control

group. In New Jersey the difference in the change in earnings between the JSA only and

the JSA plus bonus group is positive. In Pennsylvania there are slight increases in

earnings for all treatment groups except for the "low bonus short qualification period"

group where the hypothesis of no change in earning cannot be rejected.'3 In

Washington the estimates are that earnings fell somewhat, but the changes are

statistically insignificant as they are for the other experiments.




   '2Paul Decker of Mathematica Policy Research kindly supplied quarterly earnings
numbers for Pennsylvania.

    '3The inclusion of the job search workshop as part of the treatments may have
affected these results somewhat, but as less than 3 percent of claimants attended the
workshop the bias is likely to be small.
                                               15

       Even if quarterly earnings on the new job were unchanged, an individual's total

earnings after filing for UI might have increased if he or she worked more weeks. The

bonus offers reduced weeks of UI received, but did this translate into an equivalent

number of more weeks worked? Earnings data from three of the experiments, Illinois,

New Jersey and Pennsylvania allow the examination of this hypothesis.'4 All three

experiments suggest increases in earnings in the $100 to $200 range which are consistent

with this hypothesis.'5 These figures can be compared to control group quarterly

earnings which ranged from $ 2,517 to 3,121 for the three experiments for which the

numbers are available.



C. Other Outcomes



       Several of the other objectives of the bonus experiments were not achieved. The

New Jersey experiment attempted to target displaced workers who were implicitly
defined as those at least 25 years old with 3 years of job tenure and without a definite

recall date. These screens eliminated three-fourths of the claimants and selected a group

that had 17.9 weeks of UI receipt on average compared to 15.1 for those not selected.

While those selected are statistically different from those not selected, it is not clear

these differences are large enough to merit special treatment. Furthermore, the



    'I examine labor earnings and thus exclude UI and bonus payments in these
comparisons.
    'tSee Meyer (1988), p. 39 for evidence on Illinois, Corson et al. (1991), p. 22 for New
Jersey, and unpublished Pennsylvania tabulations.
                                             16

differential effect of the treatments on different groups should also be taken into account

when targeting groups. While all of the experiments examined whether the bonuses had

larger UI benefit and/or earnings effects on certain groups, no clear patterns emerged as

to which groups responded the most to the treatments.

       The Pennsylvania and Washington experiments sought to determine an optimal

bonus amount and qualification period. Optimal is not prccisely defined in the

evaluations, but can be taken to mean a treatment which maximizes net benefits in a

cost/benefit analysis. Each experiment tried six differcnt treatments with different benefit

amounts and qualihcation periods. The small number of observations per treatment

caused the impacts to he imprecisely measured and makes comparisons among the

treatments difficult. As mentioned above, regression models which assumed a linear

relationship between the outcome measures and the benefit amount and qualification

period also yielded imprecise coefficients. Thus, the imprecision of the results makes the

design of an optimal offer impractical.



D. Analysos of Costs and Benefits



       To assess whether a reemployment bonus is a desirable policy to adopt

permanently, we need an overall accounting of the costs and benefits of such a program.

The reports on the experiments have cost-benefit analyses usually undertaken from a

number of perspectives. These perspectives usually include that of the UI system,

government as a whole, and society in general. I believe that the cost-benefit analyses in
                                              17

the published reports are easily misinterpreted, as they all ignore likely effects of a

reemployment bonus on the inflow to unemployment and the UI claims pool as discussed

in Section 2.E below. Nevertheless, for completeness I summarize their results.

       The cost-benefit analyses from different perspectives differ as to what is included

among the costs and benefits. From the perspective of the UI system, the costs of a

bonus program are the bonus payments and administrative expenses.'6 The benefits are

the reduced UI payments. From the perspective of the government as a whole, the

benefits also include tax revenues on any earnings increases. A societal perspective

ignores bonuses and UI payments as they are just transfers between the government and

individuals. The costs are the administrative expenses, and the benefits are any increases

in claimants' earnings and fringe benefits. This is the procedure that is followed in the

evaluation of most of the experiments. The evaluations do not try to quanti' work costs

such as childcare, or the leisure value of time Out of work which would enter a complete

accounting.

       I should emphasize that the cost-benefit analyses make several strong assumptions.

They generally assume that workers who take a job more quickly do not displace other

workers from those jobs. They assume that the short run response by current UI

claimants is a good estimate of the long run response to a permanent bonus program.




   '6This perspective is that of a narrow administrator who wants to insure as large a UI
budget surplus as possible without altering taxes.
    '7One should also note that these are not true economic measures of changes in
welfare such as compensating or equivalent variation. Thus, they ignore changes in dead-

 Lastly, they assume that there is no new entry into the pool of UI claimants after the

financial rewards for a short UI spell have increased.

       The Illinois claimant experiment sharply reduced UI payments without paying a

large number of bonuses. Consequently, both the UI system and the total government

cost-benefit analyses were strongly favorable. Total earnings also increased, so that a

societal level cost-benefit analysis was also favorable. In New Jersey, there were only

small differences between the bonus with the JSA, and JSA only estimates for all cost-

benefit measures. Thus the additional benefits of the bonus beyond that of the JSA were

essentially zero. In Pennsylvania, the UI system lost a small amount in 4 of 5 treatments,

all government was about even, and society tended to benefit due to increases in worker

earnings. In Washington, most treatments had costs to the UI system and to all

government that exceeded beneftts)8 However, the increases in worker earnings caused

5 of 6 treatments to have positive net societal benefits.

       These cost-benefit analyses should not be surprising given the UI benefit and

earnings responses described above. The Illinois experiment was a success from all

perspectives because it elicited a large reduction in weeks of UI benefits claimed. In the

other experiments, there were small responses of weeks of benefits to the bonuses,

leading to small or negative effects on the UI system or total government. Because total

employee earnings, when available, increased in all of the experiments, there was a net

societal gain from the bonuses.



   '8The Washington earnings changes are not calculated using earnings estimates.
Rather, weeks worked are assumed to go up one for one when weeks of benefits go
down. In the other experiments, measured earnings after filing for UI go up.

E. Interpreting the Long Run Effects of Bonus Offers



       It is unclear whether the experimental impacts of bonuses just described can be

directly applied to a permanent program. There are at least three sources of uncertainty.

First, if one group of individuals is encouraged to go back to work early, they may gain

employment at the expense of others who are unable to get jobs. Second, vith a

permanent program a different fraction of eligible claimants might apply for the bonus

causing a change in the costs of the bonus offer. Third, by increasing the financial

reward for short UI spells, a permanent bonus would probably increase the number of

people unemployed between job changes and increase the number of UI filers. These

three arguments imply that the simple cost-benefit analyses in Section 2.D overstated the

benefits of a reemployment bonus. I will discuss displacement, participation rates, and

entry effects in turn.

       Displacement occurs if by taking jobs more quickly, those eligible for a bonus

reduce the number of job vacancies available to other unemployed workers. This

possibility has been mentioned by a large number of researchers.'9 The easiest way to

understand this possibility is to consider a situation where the number of jobs is fixed. If

such displacement occurs, the cost-benefit analyses have overstated the net benefits of



     9See Johnson (1979), Solow (1980) and Bassi and Ashenfelter (1987) for discussions
of displacement in training programs, and Atkinson (1987) for displacement and Ull

                                            20

bonuses, because the gains to those eligible for a bonus come partly at the expense of

longer unemployment for other workers. Theoretical examinations of displacement have

led to ambiguous results: some theories suggest no displacement, while equally plausible

theories suggest near complete displacement.2° In the end, the issue must be settled

empirically. Unfortunately, we have little direct evidence from any source to determine

the importance of displacement.21 However, some indirect evidence of little or no

displacement comes from the literature on immigration. This literature suggests that

large increases in the number of immigrants looking for jobs has little effect on low-wage

natives. Other indirect evidence that suggests some displacement comes from work on

cohort crowding effects. This literature finds that larger cohorts of workers tend to have

lower employment rates and receive lower wages. As current evidence on the

importance of displacement is inconclusive, the possibility of displacement remains as a

caveat on the results in the paper.

      The issue of participation also affects the long run net benefits of a reemployment

bonus. A substantial portion of those eligible for a bonus in each of the experiments did

not fill Out the required paperwork to receive the money. The Illinois claimant

evOeriment estimated that 55 percent of eligible claimants received the bonus, in


    See Davidson and Woodbury (1991b) for a simulation study of the displacement
effects of a reemployment bonus.

    21Bassi and Ashenfelter (1987) state that there have been no formal analyses of this
issue. Levine (1991) has recently examined displacement for UI recipients, but additional
research in needed before strong conclusions can be made.

   See Card (1990) and the references given there.

   23See Bloom, Freeman and Korenman (1987) for example.
                                             21

Washington the estimated takeup rate was 66 percent, and in Pennsylvania a lower

bound was estimated to be 65 percent. If all of these additional claimants received a

bonus, the UI system and total government cost-benefit analyses would be much less

favorable. However, it is unclear whether long-run participation would be any higher

given the low participaon rate for many permanent social programs.24 The issue of

incomplete participation is discussed further in Section 5.

       The last reason to pause before extrapolating the experimental results to a

permanent program is the possibility that a bonus would affect entry Onto the UI rolls.25

The experiments estimate one important behavioral response to financial incentives, but

implicitly set several other behavioral responses to zero. A bonus offer substantially

raises the reward for initially contacting the UI office for someone who knows he will

begin a new job within the qualification period, and raises the reward by something less

for all others.26 Recall (from Table 1) that the bonus amounts ranged from 3 to 10

times the weekly benefit.

       A permanent bonus program may have larger costs than the temporary

experiment for three reasons. First, the currently unemployed who do not file could

respond to the increased incentives to file for UI benefits. Second, those currently not

unemployed but changing jobs could start work slightly later and file for UI benefits.



    24See Moffitt (1983) for participation rates in 3 programs that range from 38 to 69
percent.
   25The following paragraphs are an updated version of a section of Meyer (1991).

    26A claimant would also need to know that he would hold the new job until the end
of the reemployment period.
                                            22

And third, firm layoff policies could respond to the increased compensation for short UI

spells. Using results from previous work as well as new evidence, the following

paragraphs document that all of these responses are potentially large.27

       First, those who become unemployed under existing incentives, but do not file,

could respond to the new incentives. Blank and Card (1991) estimate that only 68

percent of those eligible for UI in the Current Population Survey (CPS) during 1982-87

and 83 percent of household heads eligible for UI in the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID) during 1980-82 received benefits. Additional evidence comes from

1989 and 1990 supplements to the CPS which contained questions about UI application,

receipt, and reasons for 000receipt (see Vroman (1991)). only 37 percent of the

unemployed applied for UI. Of those that did not apply, only 53 percent said they didn't

think they were eligible. Putting these two numbers together suggests that 45 percent

of those eligible may not apply for benefits. The most frequent reasons given for not

applying are: expected to get another job soon (29.7%), don't know (18.5%), too much

work to apply (5.9%), didn't know how to apply (5.7%), and too much like charity

(5.2%). The vast majority of these reasons do not sound as if they would preclude

monetary incentives from encouraging a claim. In summary, these data sources indicate



    27The argument here is similar to that in Moffitt (1992) who argues for the possibility
of similar entry responses in the context of welfare and training programs.

    See Blank and Card (1988) for a discussion of the differences between the CPS and
PSID numbers. The samples of unemployment spells in the two surveys differ along
several dimensions.

    Fhe other main reasons for not applying were 'expected to get another job soon"
(14 percent), "don't know" (11 percent) and "other" (9 percent).
                                             23

that a large number of the currently unemployed could respond to additional incentives

to file for UI.

       There is some evidence that UI filing rates depend on the financial rewards for

filing. When explaining aggregate state/year data on UI receipt rates, both Corson and

Nicholson (1988) and Blank and Card (1991) find a large and highly significant

coefficient on the fraction of earnings replaced by UI.3° Using individual data from the

Youth Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey, Gritz and MaCurdy (1989) find

substantial effects of the level and duration of benefits on the probability of UI receipt

conditional on unemployment. The results in Meyer (1992) are also consistent with a

large effect of benefits on the take-up rate. I find that claims increase disproportionately

among individuals who experience a benefit increase in New York State. Earlier

evidence in Meyer (1989) suggests little effect. Another factor to consider is that many

people wait a few weeks before filing for benefits. More than one-fourth of those who

eventually file take at least four weeks to do so.3' The increased incentives to file

promptly would tend to increase the number of weeks of UI received.

       Second, those who currently change jobs without an intervening spell of

unemployment32 could become unemployed for a few weeks, start work slightly later,


   30When Blank and Card estimate a similar relationship on PSID individual data
however, they do not find a significant relationship.

   3This figure is for Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and South Carolina,
and comes from data described in Meyer (1989).

    321 was able to find three estimates of the frequency of job changes without an
intervening spell of unemployment. Mincer (1991) finds that over 30 percent of job
changes do oot involve unemployment, Gottschalk and Maloney (1985) report 24 percent
for a sample of involuntary separations which includes fires, and Gibbons and Katz
                                              24
and file for UI benefits and the bonus. Continuous Wage and Benefit History (CWBI-I)

data can be used to determine what fraction of job separations could potentially become

UI claims. Data reported in Table 6 of Meyer (1991) indicate that in 6 states the

percentage of individuals with separations that are monetarily eligible (i.e. have sufficient

base period and high quarter earnings) for UI varies from 55 to 74. Of those eligible,

only 10 to 32 percent (depending on the state) actually file for UI benefits. Some of the

68 to 90 percent who do not file are nonmonetarily ineligible due to quitting or being

fired for misconduct, but a large percentage could be eligible. This suggests that a large

number of individuals could choose to have short unemployment spells between jobs if

the reward for the first week of benefits increased by a factor of three to ten (see Table

1).

       Anderson and Meyer (1992) provides the most direct evidence on the effect of

benefit generosity on the UI claims rate of people who change jobs, but who do not

necessarily become unemployed. Using CWBH data on over 80,000 separations in six

states, we find a pronounced effect of the level of UI benefits on the probability of

receiving UI. In addition, several authors find positive effects of benefits on layoff rates.

These results lead to the third behavioral response.

       Firms will probably change their layoff policies in response to the large increase in

compensation for short UI spells provided by a reemployment bonus. Brechling (1981),

Clark and Summers (1982), and Topel (1983) find large and statistically significant effects




(1991) give 14 percent for displaced workers.
                                             25

of higher UI benefits on the probability of entering layoff unemployment.33 The

approaches of Brechling and Topel are particularly designed to capture the incentives

firms face when considering layoffs. Their results suggest that higher compensation for

short UI spells will make layoffs more attractive to firms. While much of the effect of

benefits is probably on layoffs that are initially thought to be temporary, in about one-

third of such layoffs the worker is not recalled?4 Therefore, even if recalled individuals

Cannot receive a bonus, there will probably be an effect on layoffs as part of the

compensation package in cyclical and seasonal industries increases. In addition, if we

increase the compensation for laid off workers, it makes jobs with a high probability of

layoff more attractive. The incentives wil] subsidize the expansion of cyclical and

seasonal industries, also tending to increase layoffs and unemployment.35 While changes

in the take-up rate would only tend to increase UI payments, increases in claims between

jobs and increased layoffs would raise unemployment as well.

       It is possible that part of the experimental impacts of the treatments were due to

Hawthorne effects. The term Hawthorne effects refers to responses that come from the

act of experimentation itself rather than the intended treatment?4 For example,


   33Topel interacts benefits with the fraction of benefits that a firm will not pay through
experience rating.
    34See Katz and Meyer (1990).

   35See Deere (1991) for empirical evidence on UI induced industry cross-subsidies,
expansion of high layoff industries, and unemployment.
    The term Hawthorne effects comes from experiments conducted at the Hawthorne
plant of the Western Electric Company in Chicago between 1924 and 1933. The first of
the experiments appeared to show that changes in the level of illumination resulted in
increases in worker productivity and job satisfaction whether the lighting was increased or
                                             26

claimants may have reduced their receipt of UI because they were under study per se,

rather than because of the bonus offer. This explanation is not precise so, it is hard to

rule it out. However, Hawthorne effects are a less plausible explanation if larger bonuses

tended to produce larger responses and if groups that were expected to be more

responsive to a bonus did respond more. Such evidence would suggest responses to the

character of the treatment rather than the act of experimentation per se. There is only

weak evidence of this form. As mentioned above, there is a tendency for the larger

bonuses to elicit greater responses, but this tendency is not pronounced. There is also

little evidence of a larger response by low earnings individuals to the fixed $500 bonus in

Illinois (see Meyer (1991)).



F. Additional Comments



       While the initial reaction of policy makers and academics to the bonus experiment

idea was very positive, I believe the initial optimism is fading. With time we can see

more clearly the weaknesses of the experiments as a guide to the viability of a permanent

bonus program. The initial results from Illinois were so striking that additional bonus

experiments were tried. If the Illinois experiment had produced weak results, the idea

probably would oot have been repeated.

      The large magnitude of the Illinois responses is still puzzling. Davidson and

Woodbury (1991a) have argued that the availability of extended benefits during the first


decreased. For a critical examination of these experiments see Franke and Kaul (1978).
                                              27
part of the Illinois sample period interacted with the bonus to produce larger effects.

They find larger differences between the treatments and control groups during the period

that extended benefits were available. However, the Illinois claim duration effects were

still larger than the others during the period when extended benefits were not available.

Other possible explanations include the state of the macroeconomy (the unemployment

rate at the time of the experiments was by far the highest in Illinois) or that Illinois

allowed employees recalled by their former employer to receive the bonus.



                              3. The Job Search Experiments



       The job search experiments tried several different combinations of improved

provision of job finding services and increased enforcement of the job search

requirements for the receipt of UI. This Section describes in turn the design of the

experiments, the outcomes of the experiments, and then whether the results suggest that

permanent adoption of an expanded job search program would be sensible.



A. The Experimental Designs



       Table 3 summarizes the main design characteristics of the six job search

experiments. Each of the experiments was slightly different and several of the

experiments had more than one treatment. The main differences between the treatments

were the job finding services provided and when a claimant was required to report to the
                                              28
UI/ES offices. The experiments also differed according to when the new services or

requirements were provided and whether some claimants were excluded from the

demonstration.

       The job finding services provided in the experiments included materials on job

openings and more job referrals. In several experiments, Employment Service personnel

urged claimants to search in areas that they had overlooked or avoided. The Washington

and Minnesota experiments emphasized more personalized or individually tailored

assistance. The two Nevada experiments and the Minnesota project emphasized more

intensive and higher quality delivery of existing services. These three experiments also

insisted that all Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service contacts be provided

by the same person or pair of individuals (one from UI, one from ES). Two of the

experiments, the Nevada Claimant Employment Program and the New Jersey

experiment, also provided training or relocation assistance. These services were used by

so few individuals that an adequate evaluation of them cannot be made. Two other

experiments, Charleston and Washington, required that one of their treatment groups

attend a seminar on how to find a job.

      An important element of several of the experiments was more frequent checks of

claimant eligibility, and additional required visits to the UI or ES offices to maintain UI

eligibility. The Nevada Claimant Placement Program required weekly interviews and

eligibility checks, Charleston required a different number of in depth interviews

depending on the treatment group, and New Jersey required periodic contacts with the

Employment Service. This combination of additional services and tightened eligibility
                                            29
checks makes it difficult to determine what aspects of the experiments induced the

changes in outcomes below.

       One of the treatments in Washington tried the opposite approach of requiring

fewer checks of claimant job search activities. This exception reporting treatment was

based on the honor system, meaning that UI payments were sent to claimants until they

indicated that they were no longer eligible, i.e. had returned to work. Claimants were

instructed to make an active job search, but no job search services were provided and no

reporting of work-search contacts was required.

      The experiments differed according to when claimants were first contacted and

told of their obligations or opportunities. Some experiments excluded from the

population examined certain groups such as those on temporary layoff.37 The

experiments that delayed contacting claimants or excluded others generally did this to

exclude certain individuals who did not need to report to the Employment Service or

were thought to be unlikely to benefit from the job search services.



B. Effects on Weeks of Benefits and Earnings



      Table 4 reports estimates of the effects of the six job search experiments on weeks

of unemployment benefits received and measures of reemployment earnings when

available. See Section 2 B. for discussion of the reasons for using these outcome




   371n all experiments except Re-Employ Minnesota, the exclusions took place prior to
random assignment or were applied to both treatment and control groups.
                                              30

measures. The mean for the treatment group in question minus the mean for the control

group provides an estimate of the effect of the treatment on UI receipt. When available,

I also report the same statistic obtained after one accounts for the effects of individual

characteristics in a regression analysis.

       Three of the experiments show large declines in weeks of UI benefits received by

the treatment group. These experiments, two in Nevada and one in Minnesota, show

statistically significant average reductions in weeks of UI of 1.6 to 4.3 weeks. These

experiments emphasized higher quality delivery of existing services and required

claimants to return to the same ES/UI team for all contacts. Unfortunately, these

experiments have the least complete evaluations and suffer from some design weaknesses

that I discuss later. We have no estimates of earnings impacts for any of these three

experiments. Standard errors on the weeks of UI effects were not reported for two of

the experiments, so I have approximated them using the reported sample sizes and a

standard devistion of weeks of 10, which is slightly larger than the average from the

other experiments. For the second Nevada experiment, I have reported changes in

weeks of UI for two samples: including and excluding trainees. The treatment group was

offered access to a training program, though few enrolled. As these individuals were

expected to have long UI durations, including them probably biases the effect of the

experiment towards zero; excluding them probably has the reverse effect. Fortunately,

the results are qualitatively similar (1.6 versus 2.1 weeks) either way. Overall, the

Minnesota and two Nevada experiments seem the most promising, but they require more

study because their evaluations are incomplete.
                                                31

        The three other job search experiments had more modest effects on weeks of UI

received. Charleston, New Jersey and Washington all show reductions of about one-half

of a week in UI receipt from the more intensive services and oversight. Several of these

effects are statistically significant or nearly statistically significant. These impacts are
about the same size as those of the bonus experiments. The Washington exception

reporting treatment that did not provide any services and reduced the oversight of

claimants was associated with a large and statistically significant 3.34 week increase in

wee of UI received. As was the case for the bonus experiments, regression controls

have almost no effect on the point estimates or their standard errors.

       Earnings impacts are also available for two of these three experiments.

The earnings estimates agree with the earlier bonus results in that an early exit from the

UI rolls does not decrease quarterly earnings. The full year earnings results from New

Jersey (not reported in Table 4) as well as the Washington changes are of a magnitude

that suggests the one-half week reduction in UI receipt is associated with one-half week

more of work. However, neither of the estimates is significantly different from zero.

There does not appear to be a symmetric decline in earnings for the Washington

exception reporting treatment which removed almost all oversight by the Employment

Service and increased UI receipt by 3.34 weeks. These additional weeks of UI receipt do

not seem to have been translated into fewer weeks of work, as total earnings in the year

were only slightly lower while hourly earnings over the year were insignificantly higher

than the control group. While this treatment did not affect earnings during the year after
                                              32

claim, it did significantly increase the probability of a worker returning to the same

employer or industry.



C. Enforcement of the Work Search Requirements



       One of the goals of the job search experiments was to reduce abuse of the UI

system by claimants who do not search for work as required. This section reports the

effects of the experiments on the enforcement of work search rules. In four of the six

job search experiments, administrative measures of enforcement such as denials of

benefits increased significantly.

These four experiments required claimants to make additional trips to the Employment

Service and failure to report could result in denial of benefits.

The experiments differ whether the increased denials were due to failure to report or

to better enforcement of the work search rules. In Charleston it appears that better

enforcement of work search was more important, while in New Jersey and Washington

an increase in denials for failure to report was the only significant change.39 It is

possible that those failing to report would have been denied for work search reasons, but

the results suggest that part of the reduction in ur receipt in these experiments came



    Some of the experiments reported measures of enforcement other than denials.
For example, Washington reported conditional payments (payments made pending
resolution of an enforcement issue).

    39A hazard model analysis in the Washington report analyzes the timing of the effects
of the work search services. It suggests that the shorter durations of UI receipt are due
to the costs of appearing at the UI office.
                                             33

from the additional costs imposed on claimants. In all cases however, denials per se

would account for a small fraction of the decline in weeks of UI received. If increased

enforcement was responsible for most of the decline in UI receipt, the decline must have

come from indirect effects of tighter enforcement such as deterring violations of work-

search rules.

       In the second Nevada experiment (the NCEP) and in Minnesota there was no

attempt to impose more requirements on claimants or increase compliance with work

search rules. In Nevada, enforcement appears to have been unchanged or even fallen.W

Nevertheless, these two experiments were two of the three most successful in terms of

reduced weeks of UI receipt. The main reason for their success appears to be the

increased job search services provided.

       The Washington exception reporting treatment provides some evidence of the

effects of changes in the opposite direction, i.e. reducing reporting requirements. UI

duration increased over 3 weeks when this treatment had claimants notify the UI office

when they had found a job and did not require the reporting of work-search contacts. It

is unclear whether this increase indicates that claimants were slow in notifying the UI

office that they had found a job, or that eliminating the work-search reporting

requirement actually reduced search effort, or just reduced disqualifications for weeks

without search. As total earnings did not fall, it seems likely that the change in

requirements did not reduce search effort.




   Fhe number of disqualifications was slightly lower for the treatment group than the
control group.
                                            34

D. Job Searches, Referrals, and Placements



       Four of the six job search experiments generated large increases for the treatment

groups in measures of job search assistance such as job searches, referrals, placements

nd counseling. The three experiments with the largest reductions in weeks of UI were

among these four. The experiments generating large increases in services were the two

Nevada experiments, Charleston, and Minnesota. In all of these experiments referrals to

new jobs or placements more than doubled. At the other extreme, placements and

referrals tended to be lower for the treatment groups in Washington, and in New Jersey

the treatment groups received counseling but only modest increases in job referrals.



E. Analyses of Costs and Benefits



      To assess whether a job search program is a desirable policy to adopt

permanently, we need an overall accounting of the costs and benefits of such a program,

as we did for the bonus experiments in Section 2.D. Except for the Ncw Jersey

experiment, the costs of the job search treatments were always low compared to the

savings in UI benefits. Therefore, the UI system and total government benefitted from

the programs.4' The benefits of the job search experiments tended to exceed costs by a




        the New Jersey JSA only treatment UI system broke even and total government
gained, while the JSA and training treatment had higher costs than benefits.
                                             35

wide margin. For example, in both the Nevada CEP and Minnesota the costs of the

extensive additional services was only about half of the savings in UI benefits.

      Societal level cost benefit analyses compare the administrative expenses of the

experiment to the changes in claimant earnings. Unfortunately, earnings are only

available in New Jersey and Washington. With the exception of one of the treatments in

Washington, the results are consistent with decreases in weeks of UI being associated

with equal increases in weeks worked. However, I should emphasize that most of the

estimates of earnings impacts are not precise. If we are willing to assume this

relationship holds for the other experiments, societal level cost benefit analyses would be

strongly favorable for all of the job search experiments.



F. Interpreting the Effects of the Experiments



      A key advantage of the job search approach to UI reform is that it is unlikely to

increase entry into the pool of UI claimants. Unlike a reemployment bonus, job search

assistance does not increase the incentives to file for UI if one already has a job lined up

or expects to have a short spell. The possibility remains that those encouraged to find a

job quickly will do so at the expense of others who are displaced by those workers.

However, to the extent that job search assistance improves the matching of workers and

jobs, displacement may be less important. In addition, several of the experimental

treatments led claimants to use the employment service more intensively. It is an

important unresolved question as to whether this will draw down the quality and quantity
                                              36
of available job listings for others. Alternatively, it might induce employers to list more

jobs with the ES as the number (and possibly the quality) of potential applicants grows.

        It is possible that part of the experimental impacts of the job search treatments

were due to Hawthorne effects if claimants responded to being in an experiment per se

rather than the intended treatments. Hawthorne effects may be more plausible for the

job search experiments than the bonus experiments because they involved repeated

contact with claimants which the bonus experiments did not have. As mentioned above

in Section 2 E., the imprecision of this hypothesis makes it hard to rule out completely.

However, with the job search experiments there is stronger evidence that more intensive

treatments produced larger responses, and treatments which were expected to increase

UI receipt did so. The most intensive treatments were in the two Nevada experiments

and Minnesota which also had the largest UI duration responses. The intensity of these

treatments is indicated by the descriptions of the services, the large effects on referrals

and placements, and the large administrative expenses per claimant. Other experiments

such as New Jersey and Washington had small or no effect on service provision, and

Charleston and Washington administrative expenses were extremely low because few

servtces were provided. Washington also had two treatments which could have been

expected to have no effect or increase UI receipt, and the results supported this. Thus,

the pattern of the responses in the job search experiments is not consistent with

Hawthorne effects being the main cause.

       A potentially more important problem with several of the job search experiments

is that the job service personnel were not likely to be representative of the entire pool of
                                               37

service providers. I will focus my comments on the experiments with largest UI

responses: the Nevada experiments and Minnesota. In the first Nevada experiment, the

treatment group received assistance from four two-person teams while, in the second

experiment, they received assistance from two two-person teams. If job service personnel

differ substantially in their ability to assist claimants, a sample of 2 or 4 is not large

enough for such differences to average Out. The outcome differences between treatment

and controls may be partly a measure of the personnel's ability rather than the effect of

the services provided. The Minnesota treatment group was assisted by 18 volunteers.

The use of volunteers introduces the possibility that these service providers were different

from those for the controls, and that the results from the experiment are not

generalizable to all claimants and personnel. The results in Minnesota were very similar

across UI/ES office, so it does not appear that personnel differences were of crucial

importance.
       Additional aspects of the experimental designs of the second Nevada experiment

and especially the Minnesota experiment should cause us to interpret the results with

caution. In the second Nevada experiment, the randomization was done using digits of

the social security number that were not purely random. About 200 claimants with low

social security numbers were included in the control group accidently. From comparisons

of means of the treatments and controls, it appeared that these observations were

Idisproportionately   older males. 120 older males were excluded from the control group

to compensate, but once random assignment was compromised, we cannot be sure that

the treatment and control groups were completely comparable.
                                             38

        The comparability of the treatment and control groups in Minnesota is probably a

greater concern. The control group includes individuals with separation issues that would

lead to an administrative hearing. These individuals indicated when applying for UI that

their reason for leaving their last job was that they quit, were discharged, were on strike,

etc. Tabulations from Minnesota indicate that these individuals were 31 percent of the

control group. If these individuals had much longer spells, they would account for some

part of the difference between the treatment and control

mean weeks of UI receipt.



        4. Comparisons with Other Experimental and Nonexperimental Evidence



       One can compare the results of these UI experiments with those from other social

experiments. There is a large experimental literature on the effects of job search

assistance and other types of training on welfare recipients and other disadvantaged

people. One of the main conclusions of this literature is that job search assistance

appears to increase earnings and be cost-effective (see Gueron and Pauly (1991) and

LaLonde (1992)). The evidence from the UI job search experiments supports this

conclusion as the UI job search experiments are cost effective, and there is weak

evidence that earnings increase.

      The UI job search experiments do not show a clear pattern of larger effects for

certain groups. While women seem to benefit more than men from job search assistance

provided in other contexts, there is not a clear pattern of gender differences here.
                                              39

However, in four of the six experiments women have larger estimated changes in weeks

of UI receipt than men. The reverse holds in the Charleston and Nevada NCPP

experiments.
       One can also compare the results of the UI experiments to nonexperimental

evidence. While the bonus experiments show that monetary incentives affect job-finding

rates, this was also evident from the long literature on UI and unemployment durations

(see Meyer (1989) and the references there). This literature has assessed the effects of

UI benefits on unemployment spells and reemployment earnings. To perform these

studies, there are many differences in benefits across states, within states, and over time

that are easily quantifiable. To evaluate the employment service, there are few

quantifiable differences between state systems that one can use to estimate effects on

unemployment durations or earnings. The job search experiments provide evidence that

is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain from nonexperimental sources.

       To estimate the effects of the employment service referrals one needs a group to

compare to those who receive referrals. An appropriate comparison group is generally

not available. The decision to use the employment service is typically made by a worker

and cannot be considered to be independent of that worker's observable and

unobservable characteristics. In addition, if one examines the effect of ES referrals,

biases would result if ES employees select registrants to refer based on characteristics

that the researcher does not observe. Such selection would occur if ES employees select

the best registrants to refer to make ES performance look favorable. A further

complication arises because the use of the service takes place over time. The
                                             40

 unemployed typically use it only after they have unsuccessfully tried other means of

 finding work. Thus, simple comparisons between those that do and do not use the ES

 spuriously indicate that the ES lengthens their unemployment durations.42

       Various authors have tried to overcome this lack of an appropriate comparison

group in studies of the effectiveness of the employment service.43 One of the most

convincing papers is Johnson, Dickenson and West (1985). They try multiple approaches

to finding an appropriate group to compare to those who receive ES referrals. However,

there still are important differences between those referred and those not referred. In

particular, it appears that people use the ES after they have unsuccessfully searched

using other means. While this paper is an excellent nonexperimental study, the results are

not completely convincing because we do not know why certain individuals are referred

by the ES and others are not. Furthermore, overall estimates of the impact of the ES do

not indicate how the ES can be improved. As this kind of information can be obtained

from the job search experiments, I believe there is an important role for experimentation

in evaluating job finding services.

                         5. Other Uses of the Experimental Data



       A literature has emerged that uses the data from the UI experiments to test

economic theories. This use of the experimental data may be an important side benefit

of the bonus experiments. The experiments provide exogenous variation in some of the

parameters of the UI system, allowing various theories to be examined.

       A series of papers tests search theory and labor supply models of unemployment.

In a labor supply model, unemployment is treated as leisure and individuals maximize

over income and leisure. The effects of a bonus offer is captured in this model by an

upward shift in the budget constraint by the amount of the bonus over the range of

unemployment that makes an individual eligible for the bonus. On the other hand, a

search theory model summarizes a bonus through an increase in the value of a job during

the period of bonus eligibility. The higher job value increases search intensity and lowers

the reservation wage during the period of bonus eligibility.45

       Meyer (1991) examines several predictions of labor supply and search models

when applied to the Illinois experiment. Both theories imply higher job finding rates

during the period of eligibility for the bonus. They also imply increases in the rate of job

finding just prior to the end of the bonus eligibility period. Lastly, both models can be

shown to imply a larger effect of a fixed $500 bonus on lower wage individuals. The data




    See Moffitt and Nicholson (1982) for an example of such a model.
    45See Mortensen (1987), Levine (1991) and Anderson (1992) for examples of models
of this form.
                                               42
show clear support for the first hypothesis, but only weak support for the other two. In

Pennsylvania it appears that there was a small increase in job taking just prior to the end

of eligibi1ity. Thus, the Illinois and Pennsylvania data only weakly indicate the

increases in job finding predicted by labor supply and search theories.

        There is little evidence to distinguish between the two theories of unemployment.

However, the absence of a large number of people taking jobs at the end of the eligibility

period is a rejection of the labor supply theory in its strictest form. Such a theory would

predict many individuals to locate at the corner of the budget set located at the end of

the eligibility period. The small and often positive (though insignificant) effect of the

bonus offers on reemployment earnings supports the labor supply theory where the wage

is fixed. But the earnings numbers are also consistent with most of the adjustment to the

bonus offer in a search model coming through search intensity rather than the

reservation wage.

        Levine (1991) tests whether a simple search theory model fits the data from the

Illinois and New Jersey bonus experiments. He finds that it is difficult to reconcile the

results of the two experiments using these models, and that the degree of wage variability

is hard to explain. Given the large differences between the bonus responses in the two

states (see Table 2), it is not surprising that it is difficult to reconcile the data from the

two samples.




    One would not expect similar behavior in New Jersey since the bonus decreased to
zero at the end of the eligibility period. An examination of this issue is not possible in
the published Washington data since the length of the eligibility period varied across
individuals.
                                             43

      Anderson (1992) examines the rates of recall and new job finding in the New

Jersey experiment. This work provides a nice test of a search model where a person may

be recalled to a previous job. We would expect that an individual would revise

downward his expectation of being recalled as his unemployment spell continues. This

type of a model was proposed by Katz (1985). Anderson finds that the bonus offer and

the job search assistance workshop have little effect on the recall rate, as we would

expect since the experiment did not allow recalled workers to receive a bonus. She

further finds that the job search workshop seems to have much of its effect through

convincing people who initially expect to be recalled to consider searching for a new job.

She also finds a declining negative effect of recall expectations on new job finding, which

agrees vith Katz's model of worker updating of recall expectations. These results and

those for the other job search experiments suggest that the treatments may reduce

constraints faced by the unemployed. The provision of job finding information in the

form of referrals and suggestions of search areas and methods appears to reduce

unemployment durations.

       Besides their implications for theories of unemployment, the bonus experiment

results, in particular the low takeup rates, agree with past findings of low participation in

many social insurance programs. As indicated above, the takeup rates for the bonuses

ranged from 55 to 66 percent. This omits the employer experiment in Illinois where the

takeup rate was a minuscule 12 percent. These numbers provide further evidence of

stigma or transaction costs associated with government grants. It is surprising that there

would be such low participation given that UI recipients had already overcome any
                                               44

 stigma or transaction costs of initially applying. The receipt of a bonus typically only

 required filling out 1 or 2 forms, yet this often was not done.

        The low participation in the Illinois Employer Experiment (where the employer

received the $500 bonus) is the subject of an article by Donohue (1989). He argues that

comparisons of the Employer and Claimant Experiments in Illinois provide a test of the

Coase theorem. In its simplest form, the theorem states that who receives the bonus

payment should have no effect on the outcomes of the experiment, such as the changes

in unemployment duration or earnings. The results of the experiment clearly indicate

that it did matter who received the payment. While transaction costs, the difficulty of

bargaining over wages, or lack of information may prevent this comparison from being a

clean test of the theorem, this comparison does seem a better test than some others

which have been suggested in the literature.



                             6. Conclusions and Main Lessons



       A number of conclusions can be drawn from the four reemployment bonus and six

job search experiments. First, the bonus experiments show that economic incentives do

affect the speed with which people leave the unemployment insurance rolls. UI is not a

completely benign transfer; it affects claimants' behavior. This is shown by the declines

in weeks of UI receipt found for all of the bonus treatments, several of which were

statistically significant. The experiments also show that speeding claimants' return to

work appears to increase total earnings following the claim, but the evidence is less
                                              45

strong. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that the rate of pay on the new job is not

adversely affected by an earlier return to work. This would be an important finding and

would imply that small changes in the generosity of UI are unlikely to affect the

reemployment wages of claimants.

       Despite these encouraging results, I do not believe that the experiments show that

permanent adoption of a reemployment bonus would be beneficial to the UI system or

society. The key drawback of the experiments is that they cannot account for the effect

of a reemployment bonus on the size of the claimant population. A reemployment bonus

makes filing for UI much more valuable, as claimants become eligible for a large

payment if they find a job soon. Such a payment is of most value to someone who plans

to start a job soon and may not currently think filing for UI is worth the trouble. The UI

experiments conclusively show the effect of monetary incentives on the propensity to

continue filing for benefits. There would probably be a similar effect on the propensity

to file initially as the compensation for short UI spells increases. While this conclusion is

pessimistic with regard to reemployment bonuses, it is favorable to the current UI system

which pays people for as many weeks as they are unemployed.

       The job search experiments test several alternative reforms which appear more

promising. The six experiments try various combinations of services to improve job

search and increased enforcement of work search rules. Nearly all of these combinations

reduce UI receipt, and have benefits that exceed costs. The treatments which mainly

increase enforcement of work search rules have small but often statistically significant

effects. The experiments which focus more on providing services induce much larger
                                             46

reductions in UI receipt, but at a higher cost of services per claimant. Nevertheless,

these experiments have very favorable ratios of benefits to costs. An important proviso

should be made about the experiments in Nevada and Minnesota which appear to bc the

most successful in reducing time on UI. The experimental designs have weaknesses and

the evaluations of the results are incomplete. A more complete evaluation of these

approaches is needed before strong conclusions can be reached.

Sources: Published reports, unpub lished Pennsylvania tabulations, and the author's calculations.

Notes: (1) To aid interpretation of the results, the control group mean weeks of benefits were 20.1,
17.9, 14.9, 15.2 in Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, respectively. Quarterly
earnings were $ 3,121, 2,517 and 2,605 in the first 3 states; control group earnings are unavailable
for Washington. (2) The earnings measure for Illinois is earnings in the quarter after benefit
termination, for New Jersey is earnings in the 4th quarter after claim, for Pennsylvania is earnings
in the 3rd quarter after claim, and for Washington is earnings in the 1st quarter afler the end of UI
receipt. The New Jersey and Washington earnings numbers are the coefficients on dunsnsy variables
for the different treatments from regressions with demographic variables. The Illinois and
Washington earnings numbers are for those with positive earnings. (3) The sixtis Pennsylvania
treatment group that did not receive the voluntary job search workshop has been combined witls the
fourth treatment group in this table. See the text for a discussion.
