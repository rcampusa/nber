       I.    Introduction

       The ongoing savings and loan crisis in the U.S. and the bailouts of a

number of large banks in recent years in this country and similar rescues abroad

have prompted renewed interest in the topic of the lender of last resort.

       The need for a lender of last resort arises in a fractional reserve
                                                                             banking
system when a banking panic, defined as a massive scramble for high powered

money, threatens the money stock, and hence the level of economic activity. The

lender of last resort can allay an incipient panic by timely assurance that it

will provide whatever high powered money is required to satisfy the demand,

either by offering liberal access to the discount window at a penalty rate       or

by open market purchases.

      Henry Thornton (1802) and Walter agehot (1873) developed the key elements

of the doctrine of the lender of last resort (LLR) in England. They contended

that monetary authorities in the face of panic should lend freely but at a

penalty rate to illiquid but solvent banks. Monetarist writers in recent years

have reiterated and extended the classical notion of the LL?.        In contrast,

Charles Goodhart and others have recently posited an alternative view broadening

the power of LLR to include aid to insolvent financial institutions.

      This paper discusses the role for an LLR in preventing banking panics

(section I), then briefly considers classical and more recent concepts of the

LLR (section II).   Section III examines historical evidence for the U.S. and

other countries on the incidence of banking panics and LLR actions, and the

record of alternative LLR arrangements in the U.S. Scotland and Canada, as well

as the historical record on bailouts.      Section IV offers some lessons from

history.

                 II. Bankina Panics and the Lender of Last Resort

      The need for a monetary authority to act as LLR arises in the case of a

banking panic -   -a   widespread attempt by the public to convert deposits into

currency and, in response, an attempt by commercial banks to raise their desired

reserve deposit ratio. Banking panics can occur in a fractional reserve banking

system when a bank failure or series of bank failures produces bank runs which

in turn become contagious, threatening the solvency of otherwise sound banks.

      Two sets of factors, internal and external, can lead to bank failures.

Internal factors which affect both financial and non financial enterprises

include poor management, poor judgment and dishonesty. External factors include

changes in relative prices and in the overall price level.

      Changes in relative prices can drastically alter the value of a bank's

portfolio and force it into insolvency.

      Banking structure can mitigate the effects of relative price change. A

nationwide branch banking system that permits portfolio diversification across

regions enables a bank to absorb the effects of relative price change. A unit

banking system, even with correspondents, is considerably less effective. The

nearly 6000 bank failures that occurred during the decade of the 1920's in the

U.S. were small unit banks in agricultural regions. By contrast in Canada, with

nationwide branch banking, many bank branches in those regions closed but no

banks failed (with the exception of one, in 1923, due to fraud).

      A second external factor that can lead to bank failures is changes in the

overall price level (Schwartz, 1988). Price level instability (in a non-indexed

system) -- sharp changes from rising to falling prices or from inflation to

disinflation -   - caused either by gold movements under the pre-1914 gold standard,

or more recently, by the discretionary actions of monetary authorities, can
                                            4

produce unexpected changes in banks' net worth and convert ex ante sound
investments into ex post mistakes.

        Given that bank liabilities are convertible on demand, bank runs represent

a rational response by depositors concerned over their ability to convert

deposits into currency in the event of a bank insolvency.        Sank runs in normal

circumstances serve as a form of market discipline, reallocating funds from weak

to strong banks and constraining bank managers from adopting risky portfolio

strategies (Kaufman, 1988). Bank runs can also lead to a 'flight to quality'

(Benston and Kaufman et al, 1986). Depositors may not shift funds from weak

banks to those they regard to be sound, they may instead convert their deposits

into high quality securities.        The seller of the securities ultimately will

deposit his receipts at other banks with no loss of bank reserves.

        However on occasion, in the face of an external shock to the banking

system, incomplete and costly information may make it difficult for depositors

to distinguish sound from unsound banks. In that case runs on insolvent banks

can produce contagious runs on solvent banks leading to panic. A banking panic,

in turn, will lead to massive bank failures, as sound banks are being forced into

insolvency by a fall in the value of their assets when a scramble for liquidity

induces a fire sale of assets.

        By intervening at the point when the liquidity of solvent banks is
threatened - -   supplying   whatever funds are needed to meet the demand for cash
--   the monetary authority can allay the panic.

       Private arrangements can also reduce the likelihood of panics.        Branch

banking allows funds to be transferred from branches with surplus funds to those

in need of cash. Commercial bank clearing houses by pooling the resources of

its members can provide emergency reserves to meet the heightened liquidity
                                           5


demand. A clearing house moreover represents a signal to the public that in

time of panic help will be available to member banks.

      Neither branch banking nor clearing houses, however, can stem a nationwide

demand for currency occasioned by a major aggregate shock such as a world war.

Only the monetary authority -   - the   ultimate supplier of high powered-money - -

can be successful.

      Government deposit insurance can prevent panics by removing the reason for

the public to run to currency.1 Ultimately, however, a monetary authority is

required to back up an insurance scheme.

                     III. Alternative Views on the LLR Function

       i.    The Classical Position

      Both Henry Thornton (1802) in An InQuiry into the Effects of the Parer

Credit of Great Britain and Walter Bagehot (1873) in Lombard Street were

concerned with the role of the Bank of England in stemming periodic
                                                                              banking
panics. In Thornton's time, the Bank of England -- a private institution which

served as the government's bank -   - had   a monopoly of the note issue within a 26-

mile radius of London and Bank of England notes served as high         powered money
for the English banking system.2 For Thornton the Bank's responsibility, though

not a formal central bank, in time of panic was to serve as LLR.       It should then

provide liquidity to the market, discounting freely the paper of all but

insolvent banks, no matter how large or important [Humphrey. 1975).

      Bagehot, accepted and broadened Thornton's view. Writing at a time when

the Bank had considerably enhanced its power in the British financial         system,

he stated four principles for the Bank to observe as lender of last resort to

the monetary system.

      First, it should lend freely but at a penalty rate.3

             "Very large loans at very high rates are the best remedy
             for the worst malady of the money market when a foreign
             drain is added to a domestic drain" (Bagehot, (1873)
             p.56)

Second, the Bank should make clear in advance its readiness to lend freely.

Third the Bank should accommodate anyone with good collateral (valued at normal

pre panic prices). Fourth, it should prevent illiquid but solvent banks from

failing."5

      ii.    Recent Extensions of the Classical Position

      Recent monetartst economists have restated the classical position.

Friedman and Schwartz (1963), in A Monetary History, devote considerable

attention to the role of banking panics in producing monetary instability in the

United States (also see Cagan 1965). According to them, the peculiarities of

the US banking system as it developed in the nineteenth century, with its unit

fractional reserve banking system and reserves pyramided in New York, made it

highly susceptible to banking panics.       Federal deposit insurance in 193L.

provided a remedy to this vulnerability. It served to assure the public that

it could always convert deposits into currency.

      Friedman and Schwartz highlight the importance in the pre-FDIC system of

timely judgment by strong and responsible leadership in intervening to allay the

public's fear. Before the advent of the Fed, the New York Clearing House issued

clearing house certificates and suspended convertibility and, on occasion, the

Treasury conducted open market operations. In two episodes, these interventions

were successful, in three others they were not effective in preventing severe

monetary contraction.

      The Federal Reserve System, established in part to provide such

leadership, failed dismally in the 1929-33 contraction. According to Friedman

arid Schwartz, had the Fed conducted open market operations in 1930 and 1931 to

provide the reserves needed by the banking system, the series of bank failures

that produced the unprecedented decline in the money stock could have been

prevented.

      Schwartz (1986) argues that "a real financial crisis occurs only when

institutions do not exist, when authorities are unschooled in the practices that

preclude such a development, and when the private sector has reason to doubt
                                          8

the dependability of preventative arrangements" (p. 12). According to her all

the real financial crises in the United Kingdom and the United States occurred

when the monetary authorities failed to demonstrate readiness at the beginning

of a disturbance to meet all demands of sound debtors for loans and of

depositors for cash. Finally, she views deposit insurance as not necessary to

prevent banking panics.      It was successful after 1934 in the U.S. because the

lender of last resort was undependable.         Had the Fed acted on Bagehot's

principles, federal deposit insurance would not have been necessary, as the

record of other countries with stable banking systems but no federal deposit

insurance attests.

         Meltzer (1986) argues that a central bank should allow insolvent banks to

fail, for not to do so would encourage financial institutions to take greater

risks.      Following such an approach would 'separate the risk of individual

financial failures from aggregate risk by establishing principles that prevent

banks liquidity problems from generating an epidemic of insolvencies" (p. 85).

         The worst cases of financial panics, according to Meltzer, "arose because

the central bank did not follow Bagehotian principles."6

         Goodfriend and King (1988) make a strong case for the exercise of the LLR

function    solely by the use of monetary policy, which they define as -    - open
market operations, to change the stock of high-powered money.7 Because it need

not involve a change in high-powered money, discount window lending (DWL) to

particular banks, which they refer to as banking policy, is unnecessary. The

reason they regard banking policy as redundant is that central bank discount

window lending is similar to private provision of line-of-credit services. Both

require monitoring and supervision. The authors argue that it is not clear that

the Fed is more efficient than the private sector in such activities. According
                                       9

to Goodfriend (1989) the only reason the Fed currently has an advantage          in


providing a line of credit is that it can make fully collateralized loans

whereas commercial banks under current regulations cannot do so.           There is

nothing to prevent the Fed from succumbing to political pressure to extend

credit to insolvent banks, although under current arrangements, discount-window

lending temporarily aids only illiquid banks. Moreover, discount-window lending

can delay a declaration of insolvency by a bank that pledges its best collateral

and uses the loan to pay off uninsured depositors before it is closed thus

shifting the loss from uninsured depositors to the FDIC.          It also ex ante

reduces monitoring by depositors and enhances risk taking by the banks.8

      Coodfriend and King regard government-provided deposit insurance as

basically a substitute for the portfolio diversification of a nationwide branch

banking system.    By itself, without LLR support of high-powered money by the

monetary authorities, deposit insurance is insufficient to protect the banking

system as a whole from an aggregate shock.

      iii. The Case for Central Bank Bailouts

      Charles Coodhart (1985, 1987) advocates central bank assistance to

insolvent banks.     He argues that the distinction between illiquidity and

insolvency is a myth, since banks requiring LLR support because of "illiquidity

will in most cases already be under suspicion about . .   . solvency."   Furthermore

'[bJecause of the difficulty of valuing its assets, a Central Bank will usually

have to take a decision on last resort support to meet an immediate liquidity

problem when it knows that there is a doubt about solvency, but does not know

just how bad the latter position actually is" (Goodhart, 1985, p. 35).

      He also argues that, when depositors run from an insolvent bank in a

flight to quality, the valuable relationship between banker and borrower (based
                                       10

both on trust and agent-specific information) is severed. However this would

add to the cost of flight, making it less likely to occur. Replacing such a

connection requires costly search, a process which imposes losses (and possible

bankruptcy) on the borrowers. To protect borrowers Goodhart would have the

central bank recycle funds back to the troubled bank.       However, as Schwartz

(1988) points out, borrowers need not require this arrangement, rather, they can

protect themselves from such a likelihood by simultaneously borrowing and

holding deposits with a number of financial institutions.

      Solow (1982) also is sympathetic to bailouts. According to him, the Fed

is responsible for the stability of the whole financial system.         Any bank

failure, especially a large one, reduces confidence in the whole system.         To

prevent a loss of confidence from a major bank failure from spreading to the

rest of the banking system, the central bank should bail out insolvent banks.

However, such a policy creates a moral hazard, as banks in response engage in

greater risk taking and the public loses its incentive to monitor them.

      Kindleberger (1978) includes under the rubric of financial crises,

deflations and disinflations, the financial distress of large nonfinancial firms

and of financial industries, abrupt declines in the prices of particular

commodities or assets, and speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate regimes.

Extension of LLR responsibility to all these situations ultimately makes the

central bank responsible for preventing any major losses in wealth -   -a   far cry

from the original conception of the LLR as providing a temporary source of

liquidity to the money market.

      iv.   Free Banking: The Case against any Public LLR

      Proponents of free banking have denied the need for any government

authority to serve as lender of last resort. They argue that the only reason

for banking panics is legal restrictions on the banking system. Absent, such
                                         11


restrictions, the free market would produce a panic proof banking system.

      According to Selgin (1988, 1989) two of the most important restrictions

are the prohibition of nationwide branch banking in the US and the prohibition

everywhere of free currency issue by the commercial banking system.     Nationwide

branch banking would allow sufficient portfolio diversification to prevent

relative price shocks from causing banks to fail. Free note issue would allow

banks to supply whatever currency individuals may demand.9

         Contagious runs because of incomplete information would not occur because

secondary markets in bank notes (note brokers, note detectors)       would provide

adequate information to note holders about the condition of all banks.        Such

markets do not arise for demand deposits because of the agent-specific

information involved in the demand deposit contract -     - it   is hard to verify

whether the depositor has funds backing his check.        However, clearing house

associations can offset the information asymmetry involved in deposit banking.

         According to Corton (1984), and Gorton and Mullineaux (1987), clearing

houses in the nineteenth century by quickly organizing all member banks into one

firm, established a coinsurance scheme that made it difficult to focus on the

weakness of an individual member bank. The clearing house could also allay a

panic by issuing loan certificates which served as a close substitute for

specie. Finally a restriction of convertibility of deposits into currency could

end a panic. Dowd (1984) regards restrictions as a form of option clause.'0 In

an alternative option (used in Scotland pre-1765) banks had the legal right to

defer redemption till a later date, with interest paid to compensate for the

delay.

         For Selgin and Dowd the public LLR evolved because of a monopoly in the

issue of currency.      The Bank of England's currency monopoly within a 26-mile

radius of London until 1826 and its extension to the whole country in 1844 made
                                       12

it more difficult than otherwise for depositors to satisfy their demand for

currency in times of stress, in turn creating a need for the Bank. as sole

provider of high powered money, to serve as LLR." In the U.S., bond-collateral

restrictions on state banks before 1863 and on the national banks thereafter

were responsible for the well known problem of currency inelasticity.

       These writers do not discuss the case of a major aggregate shock that

produces a widespread demand for high-powered money. In that situation only the

monetary authority will suffice.

       In sum, the two views briefly discussed have considerably different

implications for the role of an LLR. The classical prescription is for an LL.R

to   provide temporary emergency assistance to illiquid but solvent banks in a

banking panic.     The Goodhart prescription is for bailouts of insolvent

institutions; and the free banking view argues against any role for an LLR.

With these views serving as a backdrop, I now examine evidence on banking panics

and their resolution in the past.

                              The Historical Record

                                                         for a number of countries
      In this section I present historical evidence
                                      their likely causes, and the role of an LLR
on the incidence of banking panics,

in their resolution.     I then consider alternative institutional arrangements

                                             countries at different times. Finally
that served as surrogate LLR's in diverse
                                              the more recent bailouts in the US,
I compare the historical experience with

Great Britain and Canada.

      i.    Banking Panics and their Resolution

      The record for the past 200 years for at least 17 countries shows a large
                                                 considerable number of bank runs;
number of bank failures; fewer, but a still

and a relatively small number of banking panics.         According to a chronology

                                                  between 1790 and 1930 in 14 years
compiled by Anna Schwartz (1988), in the U.S.

bank panics occurred; Great Britain was next with 8 years between 1790 and 1866
                                                           with 4 each.
in which panics occurred, followed by France and Italy
                                                              1986, Table 1) for 6
       An alternative chronology that I prepared (Rordo,
                                                               and Canada) over the
countries (the U.S. Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden

 period 1870-1933 lists 16 banking crises (defined as bank runs and/or failures),
                                                         of payments), all of which
 and 4 banking panics (runs, failures, and suspensions

 occurred in the U.S.)      It also lists, based on Kindleberger's definition of
                                                                 30 such crises and
 financial crises (as comprising manias, panics and crashes)

 based on Morgenstern's (1959) definition lists 71 stock market crises.

       The evidence of a large number of bank failures in all countries, similar
                                                                measure the normal
 to failures of nonfinancial firms, reflects in large
                                  In addition to internal factors, the      external
 operation of market forces.
                                                                      in the overall
 factors of relative price changes; banking structure; and changes

 price level were important. The relatively few instances of banking panics in
                                         14

the past two centuries attests to the fact that monetary authorities in time

developed the procedures and expertise to supply the funds needed to meet

depositors' demands for cash.    Concurrently, the public developed confidence

that the authorities would respond in appropriate fashion.

     A comparison of the performances of Great Britain and the U.S. in the past

century serves to illustrate the importance of the lender of last resort

function in preventing banking panics.

      In the first half of the nineteenth century. Great Britain experienced

banking panics when the insolvency of an important financial institution

precipitated runs on other banks and a scramble for high-powered money ensued.

In a number of instances, the reaction of the Bank of England to protect its own

gold reserves worsened the panic.     Eventually the Bank supplied funds to the

market but too late to prevent many unnecessary bank failures. The last such

panic followed the failure of the Overend Gurney Company in 1866. Thereafter,

the Bank accepted its responsibility as lender of last resort, observing

Bagehot's Rule "to lend freely but at a penalty rate." It prevented incipient

financial crises in 1878, 1.890, and 1914 from developing into full blown panics

by timely announcements and action.

      The United States in the antebellum period experienced 11 banking panics

(according to Schwartz's chronology) of which the panics of 1837, 1839 and 1857

were most notable.'2 The First and Second Banks of the United States had some

central banking powers in part of the period, some states developed early

deposit insurance schemes (see Benston 1983, Calomiris 1989), and the New York

Clearing House Association began issuing clearing house loan certificates in

1857, but none of these arrangements sufficed to prevent the panics.

      In the national banking era, the U.S. experienced three serious banking

panics -- 1873, 1893 and 1907-08.    In these episodes, although the Clearing

Houses of New York, Chicago and other central reserve cities issued clearing

house loan certificates, based on the collateral of member banks' assets, as an

emergency reserve currency and even issued small denomination hand-to-hand

currency, lender of last resort actions were ineffective.        In contrast to

successful interventions in 1884 and 1890, the issue of emergency currency was

too little and too late to prevent panic from spreading.   The panics ended upon

the suspension of convertibility of deposits into currency. During suspension,

both currency and deposits circulated freely at flexible exchange rates, thereby

relieving the pressure on bank reserves. The panics of 1893 and especially 1907

precipitated a movement to establish an agency to satisfy   the public's demand

for currency in times of distrust of deposit convertibility.         The interim

Aldrich Vreeland Act was successful in preventing a panic in 1914.

      The Federal Reserve System was created in 1914 to serve as a lender of

last resort. The U.S. did not experience banking panic until    1930 but, during

the ensuing three years, a succession of nationwide banking panics, as Friedman

and Schwartz point out, accounted for the destruction of one third of the money

 stock and the permanent closing of 40% of the nation's banks. Only     with the

 establishment of federal deposit insurance in 1934, did the threat of banking

 panics recede.

       To continue the comparison between the U.S. and Great gritain,   tables 1

 and 2 present, for each country some detailed evidence on factors commonly

 believed to be related to banking panics, as well as a chronology of banking

 panics and banking crises for severe NEER business cycle    recessions (peak to

 trough) in the period l870-l933.' The variables isolated include: deviations

 from trend of the average annual growth rate of real output; the absolute
                                         16

difference of the average annual rate of change in the price level during the

preceding trough to peak and the current peak to trough as a measure of the

effect of changes in the overall price level; deviations from trend of the

average annual rate of monetary growth; and the percentage change in the money

stock due to changes in the deposit currency ratio.'

      The tables reveal some striking similarities in the behavior of variables

often related to panics but a remarkable difference between the two countries

in the incidence of panics.        Virtually all six business cycle downturns

designated by the NBER as severe were marked in both countries by significant

declines in output, large price level reversals, and large declines in money

growth.   In addition, in both countries the deposit-currency ratio produced

declines in the money stock in the three most severe downturns: 1893-94 (U.S.)

1890-1894 (G.B.); 1907-08; and 1929-32.

      However, the difference in the incidence of panics is striking --   the   U.S.

had four, while Britain had none.      Both countries experienced frequent stock

market crashes (see Bordo, 1986, Table 6.1).      They were buffeted by the same

international financial crises. Although Britain faced threats to the banking

system in 1878, 1890 and 1914, the key difference between the two countries (see

the last two columns of table 2) was successful LLR action by the British

authorities in defusing incipient crises.

      Similar evidence over the 1870-1933 period for two other major countries:

(France and Germany) and two minor countries (Sweden and Canada), is available

in Bordo (1986) .   In   severe recessions in all four countries the quantitative

variables move similarly to those displayed here for the U.S. and Great Britain.

Yet there were no banking panics. In France appropriate actions by the Bank of

France in 1882, 1889 and 1930 prevented incipient banking crises from developing
                                         17

                 Similar behavior occurred in Germany in 1901 and 1931 and in
into panics.

Canada in 1907 and 1914.

      One other key difference was nationwide branch banking in all five

countries whereas the U.S. had unit banking. That difference likely goes   a long


way to explain the larger number of bank failures in the U.S.. However, the

incidence of incipient crises which did not become panics      in most of these

countries suggests the primary importance of LLR action.

     ii.       Alternative LLR Arrangements

      In the traditional view the LLR role is synonymous with that of a central

bank. Goodhart's explanation for the evolution of central banking in England

as well as other European countries is that the first central banks evolved from

commercial banks which had the special privilege of being the government's bank.

Because of their sound reputation, position as holder of the nation's gold

reserve, ability to obtain economies of pooling reserves through a correspondent

banking system, and ability to provide extra cash by rediscounting, such banks

evolved into bankers' banks and lenders of last resort in a liquidity      crisis.

Once such banks began to perform the role of lender of last resort, "moral

hazard" on the part of member banks (following a more risky strategy) provided

a rationale for some form of supervision or legislation.       Further, Goodhart

 argues that the conflict between the public functions of such an institution and

 satisfying the shareholders made the transition from a competitive bank to a

 central bank lengthy and painful.

       Though Goodhart (1985) Annex B demonstrates that a number of central banks

 evolved in this fashion, the experience of other countries suggests that

 alternative arrangements are possible. In the U.S. before the advent of the Fed

 a variety of institutional arrangements served on occasion to allay banking
                                       18

panics: deposit insurance schemes in a number of states which were relatively

successful before the Civil War (Benston 1983, Calomiris 1989); others at the

beginning of the twentieth century which were not (White, 1981); the issue of

clearing house loan certificates (Timberlake, 1984, Corton, 1984); restriction

of convertibility of deposits into currency by the clearing house associations

in the national banking era; various operations by the U.S. Treasury in the

period 1890 to 1907 (Timberlake, 1978); and the Aldrich Vreeland Act of 1908.

      Two countries which managed successfully for long periods without central

banks were Scotland and Canada. Scotland had a system of free banking from 1727

to 1844. The key features of this system were a) free entry into banking and

free issue of bank notes, b) bank notes that were fully convertible into full-

bodied coin, and c) unlimited liability of bank shareholders.

      Scotland's record under such a system was one of remarkable monetary

stability.   That country experienced very few bank failures and very few

financial crises.   One reason, according to White (1984), was the unlimited

liability of bank stockholders and strict bankruptcy laws that instilled a sense

of confidence in noteholders.'5 Indeed the Scottish banks would take over at par

the issue of failed banks (e.g. the Ayr bank, 1772) to increase their own

business. A second reason was the absence of restrictions on bank capital and

of other impediments to the development of extensive branching systems that

allowed banks to diversify risk and withstand shocks.'6

      Faced with a nationwide scramble for liquidity such as 1792-93, 1797 and

1830, however, Scottish banks were able to turn to the Bank of England as a

lender of last resort (Cowen and Kroszner 1989)

      Although Canada had a competitive fractional reserve banking system

throughout the nineteenth century, no central bank evolved (Bordo and Redish,
                                         19

           virtually all the elements of traditional central banking    undertaken
1987).

either by private institutions or directly by the government had emerged by the

beginning of the twentieth century.

         The chartered banks had, by 1890, with the compliance of the Government,

established an effective self policing agency, the Canadian Bankers Association.

Acting in locus parentis, it succeeded in insulating the Canadian banks from the

deleterious effects of the U.S. banking panics of 1893 and 1907, by quickly

arranging mergers between sound and failing banks, by encouraging co-operation

between strong and weaker banks in times of stringency, and by establishing      a


reserve fund to be used to compensate note holders in the event of failure.

         In addition, the nationwide branch system overcame the problem of seasonal

liquidity crises that characterized the United States after the Civil War, thus

lessening the need for a lender of last resort. However, the Bank of Montreal

 (founded in 1817) very early became the government's bank performing many

central bank functions.

         Because, Canadian banks kept most of their reserves on "call" in the New

York money market, they were able on occasion in this way to satisfy the

 public's demand for liquidity, again precluding the need for a      central bank.

 On two occasions, 1907 and 1914, however, these reserves proved inadequate to

 prevent a liquidity crisis and the Government of Canada had to step in to

 supplement the reserves.

         The Finance Act, passed in 1914 to facilitate wartime finance, provided

 the chartered banks with a liberal rediscounting facility.            By pledging

 appropriate collateral (this was broadly defined) banks could borrow      Dominion

 notes from the Treasury Board. The Finance Act clause, which was extended after

 the wartime emergency by the Amendment of 1923, provided a discount

 window/lender of last resort for the Canadian banking system.
                                        20

      In sum though Canada, Scotland and several other countries did not have

formal central banks serving as LLR, they all had access to a governmental

authority which could provide high-powered money in the event of such a crisis.

    iii.    LLR assistance and bailouts

      The classic prescription for LLR action is to lend freely but at a penalty

rate to illiquid but solvent banks. Both Thornton and Bagehot advised strongly

against bailouts --   assistance to insolvent financial institutions.       They

opposed then because they would encourage future risk taking and would not

invalidate the threat to other sound financial institutions.

      Bagehot also advocated lending at a penalty rate, to discourage all but

those truly in need from applying, and to limit the expansion in liquidity to

just that necessary to end the panic.

      European countries from 1870 to 1970 in general observed the classical

strictures. In the Baring Crisis of 1890, the Bank of England successfully

prevented panic. It arranged (with the Bank of France and the leading Clearing

Banks) to advance the necessary sums to meet the Barings' immediate maturing

liability with guarantee of any loss sustained by the Bank in the process

(Schwartz, 1986, p. 19).    The German Reichsbank in 1901 prevented panic by

purchasing prime bills on the open market and expanding its excess note    issue

but it did not intervene to prevent the failure of the Leipziger and other banks

(Goodhart 1985, p. 96). The Bank of France also followed classic precepts     in


crises in 1882 and 1889.

      The Austrian National Bank, however, ignored the classical advice during

the Credit Anstalt crisis of 1931. After the Austrian National Bank provided

liberal assistance to the Credit Anstalt at low interest rates (Schubert, 1987)

a run on the Credit Anstalt and other Viennese banks in May 1931 followed upon

disclosure of the Credit Anstalt's insolvency and a government financial cescue
                                        21

package. The run degenerated into a speculative attack on the fixed price of

gold of the Austrian Schilling.

         The U.S. record over the same period is less favorable. In particular,

the Fed has never lent at a penalty rate.

         By contrast to events before 1970, when LLR action if unsuccessful erred

on the side of deficiency, in the past two decades it has erred on the side of

excess.     In the U.S. the monetary authorities (FDIC and the Fed), on three

notable occasions, have provided liberal assistance to major insolvent banks:

Franklin National in 1974, First Pennsylvania in 1980, and Continental Illinois

in 1984. In each case the authorities guaranteed both insured and uninsured

deposits. Moreover they advanced loans at subsidized rates (Garcia and Plautz,

1988).     Apparently the Federal Reserve has switched to a policy of bailout

reflecting a concern over the potential effects on the financial system and on

the reputation of the authorities of allowing a major bank to fail.

         The Bank of England followed similar policies in the 1974 Fringe Bank

rescue and the 1984 Johnson Matthey affair.        In 1985, the Bank of Canada

arranged for the purchase by the major chartered banks of the assets of two

small insolvent Alberta banks and compensation in full of all depositors.

         By contrast to the Anglo-Saxon experience, the German Bundesbank allowed

the Herstatt bank to be liquidated in 1974 but provided LLR assistance to the

market.

         Thus, although the classical doctrine has been long understood and

successfully applied, the recent experience of a number of major countries

suggests its basic message is no longer adhered to.

                  V. Conclusion: Some Lessons from History

     We can draw a number of conclusions from the historical record.

      First, banking panics are rare events. They occurred more often in the

U.S. than in other countries. They usually occurred during serious recessions

associated with declines in the money supply and sharp price level reversals.

The likelihood of their occurrence is greatly diminished in diversified

nationwide branch banking system.

      Second, panics have been prevented on numerous occasions by successful LL.R

actions. When they were not, either the requisite institutions did not exist

or, if they did, the authorities did not understand the proper actions to take.

Most countries developed an effective LLR mechanism by the last one third of the

nineteenth century. The US, was a principal exception.

      Third, some public authority must provide the lender of last resort. The

incidence of periodic major international financial crises in 1837, 1857, 1873,

1890-93, 1907, 1914, 1930-33 suggests that in such episodes aggregate shocks can

set in train a series of events leading to a nationwide scramble for high'

powered money. Such a demand can only he satisfied by the ultimate provider of

high-powered money.

      Fourth, such an authority does not have to be a central bank.       This is

evident from the experience of Canada and other countries including the Aldrich

Vreeland Act in 1914 in the US.

      Fifth, the advent of FDIC in 1934 solved the problem of banking panics    in

                                                                               and
the U.S., but absence of government deposit insurance before the 1960's

1970's in other countries suggests that it is not required to prevent banking

panics since they were panic free.
                                      23

      Sixth, and finally, assistance to insolvent banks (bailouts) were the

exception rather than the rule until the 1970's.17 The monetary authorities in

earlier times erred on the side of deficiency rather than excess. Coodhart's

bailout view is certainly not a description of past practice.       The recent

experience with bailouts flies in the face of the classical prescription.    The

prescription for excessive risk taking fostered by liberal assistance to

insolvent banks, combined with deposit insurance which is not priced according

to risk, creates the conditions for an even greater bailout in the future.

                                     FOOTNOTES

      *For helpful comments on an earlier draft I would like to thank George
Benston, Allan Meltzer and Anna Schwartz.   Paulino Texeira provided valuable
research assistance.

      'In theory private deposit insurance could also be used. In practice, to
succeed in the U.S. such arrangements would require the private authority to
have the power which the FDIC currently has to monitor, supervise and declare
insolvent its members. Also the capacity of the private insurance industry is
too limited to underwrite the stock of government insured deposits. (Benston et
al 1986, ch. 3). Alternatives to deposit insurance include requiring banks to
hold safe assets (treasury bills), charging fees for service and one hundred
percent reserves.

      2Bank of England notes served as currency and reserves for the London
banks. Country banks issued bank notes but kept correspondent balances in the
London banks. From 1797 to 1821 Bank of England notes were inconvertible into
gold.

        3Bagehot distinguished between actions to follow in the face of an
external drain -- a decline in the Bank's gold reserve induced by a balance of
payment deficit - - raise Bank rate; and the action to follow when threatened by
an internal drain - - lend freely.

        4Bagehot has been criticized for not clearly stating when the Central bank
should intervene (Rockoff, 1986), for not giving specific guidelines to
distinguish between sound and unsound banks (Humphrey, 1975), and for not
realizing that provision of the LLR facility to individual banks would encourage
them to take greater risks than otherwise (Hirsch, 1977).

        5According to Humphrey, the Classical position can be stated as:
(2)     "S.. The lender of last resort's responsibility is to the entire financial
        system and not to specific institutions.
(3)     The lender of last resort exists not to prevent the occurrence
        but rather to neutralize the impact of financial shocks.
(4)     The lender's duty is a two fold one consisting first, of lending
        without stint during actual panics and second, of acknowledging
        beforehand its duty to lend freely in all future panics.
(5)     The lender should be willing to advance indiscriminately to any
        and all sound borrowing on all sound assets no matter what the type.
(6)     In no case should the central bank accommodate unsound borrowers.
        The lender's duty lay in preventing panics from spreading to the
        sound institutions, and not in rescuing unsound ones.
(7)     All accommodations would occur at a penalty rate, i.e., the central bank
        should rely on price rather than non price mechanisms to ration use of its
        last resort lending facility.
(8)     The overriding objective of the lender of last resort was to prevent panic
        induced declines in the money stock. .
        (Humphrey, 1975 p.9)
                                       25

      6Meltzer (1986) succinctly restates Bagehot's four principles.
"1.   The central bank is the only lender of last resort in a monetary system
      such as ours.
 2.   To prevent illiquid banks from closing, the central bank should lend on
      any collateral that is marketable in the ordinary course of business when
      there is a panic
 3.   Central bank loans, or advances, should be made in large amounts, on
      demand, at a rate of interest above the market rate.
 4.   The above three principles of central bank behavior should be stated in
      advance and followed in a crisis" (Meltzer, 1986. p. 83)"

      7Friedxnan (1960) earlier argued against the use of the discount window as
an unnecessary form of discretion which "involves special government assistance
to a particular group of financial institutions" (p. 38). Also see Hirsch (1977)
and Goodhart (1988) for the case that Bagehot's rule was really designed for a
closely knit/cartelized banking system such as the London clearing banks.

      8Cagan (1988) in his comment on Goodfriend and King makes the case for
retention of discount window lending in the case of 'a flight to quality'. In
that case OWL can be used to provide support to particular sectors of the economy
which have temporarily had banking services curtailed.

      9According to the law of reflux, free banks issuing notes on the basis of
real bills can never overissue because the loans backing the notes would be self-
liquidating. See White (1984)

      10However a restriction of convertibility itself could exacerbate a panic
because the public, in anticipating it, demands currency sooner.

      "Selgin (1988) argues that the Bank Charter Act of 1844 exacerbated the
problem of panics because it imposed tight constraints on the issue of bank notes
by the Issue department.    However the Banking department surely could have
discounted commercial paper from correspondent banks without requiring further
note issue. That is one of Bagehot's main points in Lombard Street.

      '2selgin (1988) based on evidence by Rolnick and Weber (1986) argues that
the episodes designated as panics in the ante-bellum Free Banking era are not
comparable to these in the National Banking era because they did not involve
contagion effects. Evidence to the contrary however is presented by Hasan and
Dwyer (1988).

      '3For similar evidence for the remaining cyclical downturns in this period
see Bordo (1986, Table 6 lA).

       '4Holding constant the influence of the other two proximate determinants
of the money supply: the deposit reserve ratio and the stock of high powered
money.   It is calculated using the formula developed in Friedman and Schwartz
(1963), Appendix B.

      '5Sweden from 1930 to 1902 had a system of competitive note issue and
unlimited liability. According to Jonung (1985), there is evidence neither of
overissue nor of bank runs.

      '6Switzerland also had a successful experience with free banks 1826-1850
(Weber, 1988) but like Scotland she depended on the Bank of France as lender of
last resort (Goodhart, 1985).

       '7Although in the U.S. the policy of purchase and assumption carried out
by the FDIC and FSLIC before that date incorporated elements of a public subsidy.
