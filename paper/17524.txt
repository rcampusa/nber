                                                 ABSTRACT

If trade barriers are managed by inefficient institutions, trade liberalization can lead to greater-than-expected
gains. We examine Chinese textile and clothing exports before and after the elimination of externally
imposed export quotas. We find that the surge in export value and decline in export prices following
quota removal is driven by net entry, and show that this dominance is inconsistent with use of a productivity-based
allocation of quota licenses by the Chinese government. Our counterfactual implies that elimination
of misallocated quotas raised the overall productivity gain of quota removal by 28 percent.

1     Introduction

Institutions that distort the ecient allocation of resources across rms can have

a sizable eect on economic outcomes.      Hsieh and Klenow (2009), for example,

estimate that distortions in the Chinese economy reduce manufacturing produc-

tivity by 30 to 50 percent relative to an optimal distribution of capital and labor

across existing manufacturers. While research in this area often concentrates on

misallocation among existing rms, distortions can also favor incumbents at the

expense of entrants. Trade barriers such as taris and quotas can obviously distort

resource allocation along these intensive and extensive margins, and estimation

of the productivity growth associated with their removal is a traditional line of

inquiry in international trade. But gains from trade liberalization may be larger

than expected if the institutions created to manage the barriers impose their own,

additional drag on productivity.    In that case, trade liberalization induces two

gains: the rst from the elimination of the embedded institution, and the second

from the removal of the trade barrier itself.

    In this paper, we examine productivity growth among Chinese exporters fol-

lowing the removal of externally imposed quotas.       Under the global Agreement

on Textile and Clothing, previously known (and referred to in this paper) as the

Multiber Arrangement (MFA), textile and clothing exports from China and other

developing economies to the US, the EU and Canada were subject to quotas until

January 1, 2005. In China, the licenses permitting rms to export a portion of the

country's overall quota were distributed by the government. We examine whether

this allocation created an additional drag on exporter productivity.

    Our assessment of the extent to which China assigned export licenses on the

basis of rm productivity is guided by an auction-allocation model derived from

Irarrazabal et al.   (2010), who introduce per-unit taris into the heterogeneous-

rm framework of Melitz (2003) and Chaney (2008). Here, we interpret the specic

tari as a (common) quota license fee which rms must pay in order to access re-

stricted foreign markets. This fee equates the supply and demand for quota. Firms

self-select into the quota-constrained export market based on their productivity,

as only the most productive exporters remain protable net of the fee.

    In the auction-allocation model, removal of quotas gives rise to three empirically

testable reactions. First, because per-unit license fees impose a greater distortion


                                          2
on low-price goods, exports of the most productive incumbents jump relative to

those of less productive incumbents.          Second, because obtaining a costly export

license is no longer necessary, low-productivity rms may enter the export market.

Third, incumbents and entrants make opposing contributions to export prices:

price declines among incumbents who no longer must pay a license fee are oset

by the relatively high prices of low-productivity entrants.            In all three of these

reactions, the trends are dominated by incumbents.

   We use rm-level Chinese customs data to compare the growth of previously

quota-constrained Chinese textile and clothing goods to the growth of similar tex-

tile and clothing products exported quota free.             This dierence-in-dierences

comparison isolates the inuence of quota allocation from other factors aecting

Chinese textile and clothing exports more broadly. Shipments of cotton slips to

the US, for example, were subject to quotas in 2004, while exports of silk slips ,

were not.     Contrasting their growth in the years before and after quotas are re-

moved controls for shocks to supply, such as privatization, and shocks to demand,

such as changes in the preferences of consumers, that are plausibly common to

both goods.

   Substantial deviations between the auction-allocation model and the data indi-

cate that the actual quota licenses assigned by the government were misallocated
                                        1
with respect to rm productivity.           We show that both the strong export growth

and the sharp price declines associated with quota removal are driven by net entry

rather than incumbents. More importantly, several trends indicate that entrants

were   more   productive than incumbents.          First, their prices were on average 25

percent and 21 percent lower than incumbents and exiters, respectively, such that

net entrants accounted for 63 percent of the overall 18 percentage point decline

in relative prices. Second, entrants tended to emerge from the private sector and

gain market share at the expense of relatively unproductive incumbent state-owned

enterprises (SOEs). Finally, incumbents with the highest market share under quo-

tas experienced the largest decline in market share when quotas were removed.

This outcome contrasts starkly with the model's predictionthat high-productivity

   1 We recognize that quota misallocation with respect to rm productivity may reect op-
timization with respect to other objectives of the government, such as balancing employment
across regions in China.   To the extent that such objectives were relevant, our results can be
interpreted as measuring the cost of pursuing them in terms of exporter eciency.

incumbents benet disproportionately from the removal of license fees.

    In the second part of the paper we use results from our empirical analysis to

estimate the overall growth in exporter productivity associated with quota removal

as well as the contribution of eliminating misallocation.            Inferring productivity

growth from changes in rms' quality-adjusted export prices, we nd that aggregate

productivity among China's textile and clothing exporters rose 7 percent upon

quota removal. This overall gain is large given that textiles and clothing represent

15 percent of China's exports and 13 percent of its manufacturing employment.

To gauge the contribution of misallocation to this overall gain, we consider an

alternate political allocation scenario in which the government assigns export

licenses according to rms' political connections as well as their productivity.

Comparison of calibrated solutions to the auction and political allocation scenarios

implies that elimination of misallocated quotas raises the overall productivity gain

of quota removal by 28 percent.

    Our ndings relate most directly to the growing set of papers that use microdata

to estimate the eects of market distortions on existing rms (i.e., the intensive

margin). These papers generally identify misallocation by comparing an outcome

such as the rm-size or productivity distribution across countries, e.g., China versus
           3
the US. While this approach provides valuable insight, it is necessarily coarse: any

deviation between outcomes is attributed to misallocation versus other dierences

between countries such as variation in product mix, technology or entrepreneurial

ability.       Bloom and van Reenen (2007), for example, show that the distribution

of the latter may vary across counties if entrepreneurs in developing countries

are slow to adopt best practices.         Likewise, as noted in Syverson (2011), these

aggregate comparisons do not identify the particular sources of distortions. Our

contribution to these eorts is threefold. First, we analyze reallocation between

existing and potential exporters. Second, we identify misallocation using relatively

weak assumptions:         our dierence-in-dierences strategy requires only that the

distribution of technology and entrepreneurial ability be identical across similar

   2 We rely on indirect evidence of entrants' relative productivity because we do not have the
data to measure exporters' TFP directly. See Section 4 for more detail.
   3 See, for example, Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), and Alfaro et
al. (2008). Dollar and Wei (2007) investigate misallocation among Chinese rms by comparing
the returns to capital across sectors and provinces in China.

types of textile and clothing products within China, e.g., silk versus cotton slips.

Finally, our approach isolates the potential distortions caused by a specic policy,

quota allocation.

    The eect of distortions on the extensive margin (e.g., rm entry) is studied

most widely in the context of credit constraints in developing countries. Banerjee

and Duo (2004), for example, use an exogenous change in the supply of credit

to specic rms to identify constraints on obtaining credit among Indian rms.

Their results suggest the existence of talented entrepreneurs who are prevented

from establishing rms due to their inability to borrow from the formal banking

sector.   Our contribution relative to these eorts is to gather data on a specic

distortion aecting the extensive margin, and to use it to estimate its eects. We

nd that the Chinese government prevented the most productive Chinese textile

and clothing rms from entering the export market, substantially reducing ag-

gregate productivity.       To the extent that such restrictions were present in other

export markets, the economy-wide productivity loss associated with suppression

of the extensive margin (via barriers to entry) might have been quite large given

the importance of exports in China's growth.

    Finally, our results contribute to a large literature examining the costs of trade
              4
protection.       Standard analyses of these costs ignore misallocation along the exten-

sive margin. An exception is Anderson (1985), who shows that the deadweight loss

associated U.S. cheese quotas is understated if they are not assigned to the lowest-

cost countries. Our study is conceptually similar to Glaeser and Luttmer's (2003)

examination of rent controls in the New York housing market, where the standard

deadweight loss of rationing apartments is accompanied by a further loss if apart-

ments are not assigned to the agents with the highest valuations. In both cases,

the gains from removing the distortion are amplied by eliminating the embedded

institution.      Our results also provide support for the idea that externally man-

dated changes in trade policy can ignite broader reform by enabling governments

to overcome powerful domestic constituencies (Tang and Wei 2009).

    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briey presents a model

of quota allocation that is used to guide the empirical analysis. Section 3 oers a

2      Theory

This section outlines a simple model of exporting under quotas to guide our empiri-

cal analysis. It assumes that quotas are allocated to the most productive exporters

via an auction. We emphasize two results. We show that while the removal of quo-

tas can induce   less   productive rms to enter the export market, subsequent export

growth and price declines are driven overwhelmingly by the                     intensive   margin. In

demonstrating these implications, we employ calibrated numerical solutions where

analytic results cannot be obtained.



2.1      Exporting Under Quotas

We rely on a re-interpretation of Irarrazabal et al. (2010), which analyzes exporting

by rms with heterogeneous productivity in a trading system where importing

countries implement specic (i.e., per unit) as well as             ad valorem taris.     This model

is a version of the well-known monopolistic competition, love-of-variety framework
                                                                                     5
developed by Melitz (2003), which does not consider specic taris.

    We assume that in order to export a quota-bound good from origin country                       o to
destination country        d,   rms must pay a license fee (aod        > 0)   per unit exported as

well as an   ad valorem         tari (Ïod   > 1).    As in Demidova et al. (2009) and Feenstra

(2004), we interpret quota license fees as equivalent to per-unit increases in the

cost of exporting.

    Firm productivity           Ï   is drawn from distribution      G(Ï)   with density    g(Ï).   The

price of variety   Ï   in export market         d    is given by

                                                            (            )
                                                 Ï              Ïod
                                pod (Ï, aod ) =     Ïo              + aod ,                        (1)
                                                Ïâ1              Ï
    5 Given the number of papers relying on the Melitz (2003) framework, we keep our discussion
of the model in this section brief.      We refer the reader to our appendix and Irarrazabal et al.
(2010) for more details.

where   Ï>1     is the constant elasticity of substitution across varieties and                       Ïo   is the

wage in the origin country. The existence of the nal term in this expression dif-

ferentiates it from its counterpart in Melitz (2003). It also provides a key intuition

for our analysis: a positive license price exerts a disproportionately higher penalty
                                                              6
on low-price (i.e., high-productivity) rms.

    The corresponding expression for export quantity is



                            qod (Ï, aod ) = pod (Ï, aod )âÏ (Pd )Ïâ1 Yd ,                                    (2)


where   Yd   is expenditure in the destination market and                       Pd   is a price index dened

over domestic producers and origin-country exporters in the destination country. In

Melitz (2003), the ratio of output produced by two rms with productivity                               Ï > Ïâ²
is independent of      ad valorem      trade costs.               Here, this independence is broken by

the addition of a specic tari, with the result that reductions in the license fee

induce relatively greater growth among low-priced rms.

    We assume that the overall size of the origin-country export quota is determined

exogenously via bilateral negotiations between the two countries. Given this quota,

a Walrasian auctioneer determines the license price that induces rms to export

the proper quantity, in aggregate.               Intuitively, this license price will fall as the

quota rises. This setup is similar to that of Anderson (1985), who demonstrates

that the most ecient allocation of quotas implies a common license price.

    Firms pay a xed cost to enter the domestic market as well as the export market.

A productivity cuto,        Ïâod ,   determines the marginal exporter who is indierent

between paying the xed costs of exporting from                            o   to   d, fod ,   and remaining a

purely domestic rm,

                                                                                         ]â1
                                 Ïâ1            1        Ïo fod            Pd      aod

where   Pd = Pd (Ïâod ).    Here, too, the nal term dierentiates this expression from

the cuto equation in a standard Melitz (2003) model: in the presence of a quota,

the productivity cuto for exporting rises.

    As discussed in Irarrazabal et al. (2010), there is no closed-form solution for

   6 In the data, rm prices may vary due to quality as well as eciency. We discuss this issue
in detail in Section 5.4.



                                                          7
Pd     when the license price is positive.           With     Pd   xed (i.e., with country          o   too

small to aect prices in country           d),   it is easy to verify that decreasing the quota

reduces the productivity cuto for exporting and thereby induces low-productivity

rms in country        o   to enter the export market.             This entry drags down country

o's   unweighted average exporter productivity and raises its average export prices.

With respect to the margins of adjustment, the overall market share of incumbent

exporters declines but,         among     incumbent exporters, market share is reallocated

towards the (largest and) lowest-priced rms.

      More generally,      Pd   may rise or fall following quota removal depending upon

the distribution of rm productivity. If the productivity of the most productive

rms is suciently high, for example, export growth by the largest incumbents

may oset the inuence of entrants on quantity-weighted average productivity, or

prevent entry altogether. Assessing the impact of quota relaxation when                         Pd   is not

xed requires numerical solutions, which we pursue in the next subsection.



2.2        Numerical Solutions

The model summarized above can be solved numerically to determine how export

prices and quantities as well as exporter productivity evolve as quotas are removed.

We provide a brief description of these solutions here, but refer the interested reader

to the appendix for further detail.

      We consider two countries and one industry. The parameters of the model are:

Ï , L = LChn , LU EC , G(Ï) â¼ ln âµ(Âµ, Î¸), Ï = {ÏChn,Chn , ÏChn,U EC , ÏU EC,Chn , ÏU EC,U EC },
f = {fChn,Chn, fChn,U EC , fU EC,Chn , fU EC,U EC }, Ï = {ÏChn , ÏU EC }.7 We partition
this set by imposing values for some parameters and choosing the remaining pa-

rameters by matching particular statistics in the data. We assume that the two

countries have identical sizes           LU EC = LChn = 100.8             We choose an elasticity of

substitution,     Ï = 4,    that is the median among the apparel and textiles elastic-

      7 We set the domestic xed costs   fChn,Chn   and   fU EC,U EC   so that all rms are active in their
respective domestic markets. This implies that we are choosing the ratio of the export to domestic
             fChn,U EC    fU EC,Chn
xed costs (
             fChn,Chn and fU EC,U EC ) to match the fraction of textile and clothing exporters in each
market. We assume iceberg trade costs are equal to 1 within countries, (ÏChn,Chn           = ÏU EC,U EC =
1).
      8 As discussed below, we consider the quotas imposed by the U.S., Canada and the E.U. (the
UEC), whose total population (900 million) is relatively close to that of China (1.2 billion).

ities estimated in Broda et al.          (2006).     We assume a log normal productivity

distribution,   G(Ï) â¼ ln âµ(Âµ, Î¸).      We set the wage in each country equal to unity;

although this assumption appears strong, it simply implies that the iceberg and

xed trade costs that we match to the data capture variation in wages as well

as trade costs.    We jointly choose the log normal mean and standard deviation,

the two iceberg trade costs (ÏChn,U EC and           ÏU EC,Chn )   and the ratios of exporting to

domestic xed costs to match the following features of the data: the distribution

of exports among Chinese textile and clothing exporters, the share of Chinese tex-

tile and clothing producers that export and the Chinese and U.S. market shares
                                                                                            9
of U.S. and Chinese textile and clothing consumption in 2005, respectively.                      The

resulting parameters are  Âµ = 1.28, Î¸ = 0.54, ÏChn,U EC = 1.80, ÏU EC,Chn = 3.55,
fChn,U EC /fChn,Chn = 1.15 and fU EC,Chn /fU EC,U EC = 1.15.
                                                                          â
   Using these parameters, we solve for the export productivity cutos (ÏChn,U EC
      â
and ÏU EC,Chn ) and domestic price indexes (PU EC and PChn ) in each country in a

no-quota equilibrium, i.e., where the license price is set to zero. We then re-solve

the model for a positive, common license price that yields the the 2004 level of

observed quota restrictiveness, which we dene as 1 minus the ratio of exports

under quotas to exports without quotas. In the data, the median growth of Chinese

exports of quota-restricted goods relative to unrestricted goods was 155 percent
                                                                                            10
in 2005 relative to 2004, implying a quota restrictiveness of 0.61 (1-1/2.55).                   We

refer to this solution as the auction allocation of the quota licenses.

    Table 1 compares numerical solutions of the model under the auction-allocation

and no-quota scenarios. The rst two rows of the table compare the price indexes

   9 China's Annual Survey of Industry collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
reports that 44 percent of rms in the textile and clothing sectors (Chinese Industrial Classi-
cations 17 and 18) exported in 2005. The share exports accounted for by the 75th, 90th, 95th,
99th and 99.9th percentiles of these exporters are 0.26, 0.46, 0.59, 0.80, 0.93 and 1, respectively.
We were unable to obtain import penetration gures and fraction of textile exporters for Canada
and the EU, so we use the US data to determine the trade cost parameters. According to textile
and clothing production and trade data in the NBS production and Chinese customs data, re-
spectively, the U.S. market share of Chinese textile and clothing (China Industrial Classication
codes 17 and 18) consumption is 1.2 percent. According to the NBER Productivity Database,
the Chinese market share of U.S. apparel and textile consumption (NAICS codes 313, 314 and
315) is 13.1 percent. All data are from 2005 because that is the rst post-quota year.
  10 This 155 percent growth rate is relative to quota-unconstrained textile and clothing exports
as well as to export growth of both types of exports in 2004, i.e., a triple dierence that is
explained in greater detail in Section 4.3.   We assume this measure of quota restrictiveness is
independent of whether quotas are allocated eciently or ineciently in 2004.

of the two countries.         As expected,     PU EC   declines with the removal of quotas,

by 2 percent.       This price decline is a function of the reallocation of exports to

higher-productivity rms and the removal of the license fee.                   The entry of low-

productivity rms is manifest in the decline of average productivity by 5 percent

in row three, while the more-than-osetting expansion of high-productivity rms

is evident in the 24 percent increase of        weighted    average productivity in row four.
                                                                                                   11

Similar movements occur in export prices in rows ve through seven, where we nd

incumbents account for virtually all of the 29 percent decline in Chinese export

prices following quota removal.           The remaining rows of the table document the

disproportionate growth of the highest-productivity incumbents: while the largest

25 percent of rms see their market share rise 17 percent, the market share of

the top 1 percent of rms grows 82 percent. Despite the entry of new exporters,

incumbents only lose 1 percent of their market share (1 - 23.88/24.13) when the

quotas are removed.          This small loss of overall incumbent market share is an

important implication of the auction allocation; its empirical analogue serves as a

key moment in our calibration of political allocation in Section 6.




3       A Brief Summary of the MFA

China's textile and clothing industry accounts for a substantial share of its overall

economy. In 2004, it employed 12.9 million workers, or 13 percent of total manufac-

turing employment (2004 China Economic Census). China's textile and clothing

exports account for 15 percent of the country's overall exports, and 23 percent of

world-wide textile and clothing exports (which equaled $487 billion in 2005).

     The Multiber Arrangement (MFA) and its successor, the Agreement on Textile

and Clothing (ATC), grew out of restraints imposed by the U.S. on imports from

Japan during the 1950s.           Over time, it evolved into a broader institution that

regulated the exports of clothing and textile products from developing countries to

the U.S., E.U., Canada, and Turkey. (We drop Turkey from the analysis because

    11 As noted in Irarrazabal et al. (2010), the large gains associated with the removal of licensing
fees exceed those implied by traditional trade models that solely consider the removal of iceberg
transportation costs (e.g., the class of trade models discussed in Arkolakis et al.      2010).   The
size of the gain is also sensitive to the distribution from which productivity is drawn. As dis-
cussed further in footnote 30, if we follow the same procedure to solve the model using a Pareto
distribution for rm productivity, we nd a weighted-average productivity gain of 42 percent.

we are unable to locate the list of products covered by its quotas; in 2004, textile

and clothing exports to Turkey accounted for less than 0.5% of China's total textile

and clothing exports.) Bargaining over these restrictions was kept separate from

multilateral trade negotiations until the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1995,

when an agreement was struck to eliminate the quotas over four phases. At the

beginning of 1995, 1998, 2002 and 2005, the U.S., E.U. and Canada were required

to remove textile and clothing quotas representing 16, 17, 18 and the remaining 49

percent of their 1990 import volumes, respectively. The order in which goods were

placed into a particular phase varied across importers, with each country generally

choosing to place their most sensitive textile and clothing products into the nal

phase (Phase IV) to defer politically painful import competition as long as possible

(Brambilla et al. 2010). This aspect of the liberalization suggests that the quotas

were most binding at the nal removal of quotas on January 1, 2005. However, the

fact that Phase IV goods were determined in 1995 implies that their choice was
                                                                   12
not inuenced by demand or supply conditions in 2005.

    China did not become eligible for quota removal until it joined the WTO at

the end of 2001. In early 2002, its quotas on Phase I, II and III goods were relaxed

immediately. Removal of quotas on Phase IV goods  the focus of our empirical
                                                                        13
work  occurred according to schedule on January 1, 2005.

    Like other countries under the MFA and ATC, China ocially allocated quotas

on the basis of past performance, i.e., rm's ability to export their quota success-

fully in the previous year (Krishna and Tam 1998).                 As documented in Moore

(2002), however, China's actual allocation of quotas deviated from this principle,

at times substantially.      In the 1980s in particular, rent-seeking and political fa-

  12 The large increase in exports following quota removal in 2005 might be driven in part by
rms' expectations that the MFA would be succeeded by another form of quantitative restrictions:
by boosting exports, rms may have been hoping to receive a higher allocation under the new
regime. In fact, the U.S. and E.U. did reimpose safeguard quotas on a subset of products in 2005.
We have been unable to determine the products subject to safeguards in the E.U., but we nd
that our results are unchanged if we exclude products subject to safeguards in the U.S. market
in 2005.
  13 The removal of quotas coincided with China's obligation under its WTO accession agreement
to eliminate export licensing in all products by 2005. The products that were subject to state
trading and designated traders are listed in Appendix 2A2 and 2B of China's WTO accession
document (WT/ACC/CHN/49), respectively. In 2004, these products account for just 1 percent
of total textile and clothing export value to the U.S., E.U. and Canada in 7 percent of the product
codes. The results of our analysis are unchanged if we exclude these products from the analysis.




                                                11
voritism were rampant. Firms managed by individuals aliated with the People's

Liberation Army, for example, received quotas in return for their support of the

government, and these allocations were increased in 1989 following the army's back-

ing of the state during the Tiananmen crisis. Likewise, there is evidence that the

central Ministry of Commerce provided quota allocations to provincial authorities

in an eort to promote textile and clothing manufacturing geographically (Min-

istry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 2001). Our analysis is unable

to identify the precise objective function that the government sought to maximize,

but by considering the deviation in the actual quota assignment from one that

assigned quotas on the basis of rm productivity, our analysis quanties the cost

of pursuing an allocation of quotas based on alternative criteria.

    Although trading quotas in China was illegal throughout the MFA, anecdotal

evidence suggests that an active black market emerged during the 1980s.           One

consequence of the diculties associated with rms' inability to trade quotas legally

was unused quota. To prevent quota from going unused, the government stepped

up enforcement of allocations based on past performance, and tried to prevent non-

producing rms from receiving quotas (Moore 2002). These reforms are generally

believed to have reduced black-market activity, though verication of this claim is

dicult given rms' (understandable) reluctance to discuss illegal trading (Moore

2002; interviews conducted by the authors). The illegality of a secondary market

is likely to have frustrated the resale of quotas, implying that quotas may not have

found their way to agents who valued them the most. The potential sensitivity of

our results to legal or illegal subcontracting, as well as empirical exercises designed

to measure it, are discussed further in Section 7.

    Starting in 2000, the government experimented with allowing some rms to

participate in auctions of up to 30 percent of the total quota allocation of some

MFA goods. Unfortunately, we have been unable to determine the precise criteria

the government used to select rms to participate in these auctions.




4    Data

Our empirical analysis relies on data from several sources. The rst is Chinese cus-

toms data by rm, eight-digit Harmonized System (HS) category and destination



                                          12
country. For each rm-product-country observation, we observe the total nominal

value and quantity exported as well as whether rms fall into one of three own-

ership categories: state-owned enterprises (SOEs ), domestically owned private
                                                                            14
rms (domestic ) and foreign-invested private rms (foreign ).               Quantity units

are available for 99 percent of observations accounting for the same share of export

value, and vary across products, e.g., dozens of shirts or square meters of fabric.

We combine the nominal value and quantity data to construct nominal unit values,

also referred to as prices .

    We focus on China's exports of textile and clothing products to the U.S.,

Canada and the E.U., treating the latter as a single block of countries given

that quotas are set for the union as a whole.             Product-country pairs are parti-

tioned into two groups.         The rst, referred to as MFA product-country pairs,

encompass textile and clothing products bound by quotas until 2004. The remain-

ing product-country pairs, referred to as  OTC , for other textile and clothing

product-country pairs, consist of textile and clothing products exported quota-
        15
free.        Because our classication refers to product-country pairs, it is possible for

a given HS product to be both MFA and OTC depending upon its destination.

For example, a textile and clothing product subject to a quota only in the U.S.

exported to the U.S., is MFA, but if it is exported to the E.U., is OTC.16 Among the
547 products that are subject to quotas by any of the U.S., the E.U. or Canada,

157 are subject to quotas by all three destinations, while 167, 63, and 4 are subject

to quotas solely in the U.S., solely in the E.U. and solely in Canada, respectively.

  14 We classify state-owned rms as SOEs; collective-owned, other and private domestic
rms as domestic, and foreign-exclusive owned and two joint venture classications as foreign.
  15 Textile and clothing products are dened as: two-digit HS chapters 50-63; four-digit HS
chapter 6406; ve-digit HS chapters 30059, 65059 and 94049; and six-digit HS chapter 701919.
MFA products are a subset of these HS chapters and are dened according to a concordance made
available by the Embassy of China's Economic and Commercial Aairs oce which identies the
set of products subject to quotas in each destination market in 2004. Note that some products in
the OTC category were subject to quotas that were removed in 2002 under earlier phases of the
quota liberalization. Comparisons of the trends noted in the text to goods outside of textiles and
clothing, as well as textile and clothing exports to the rest of the world, appeared in an earlier
version of this paper and are available upon request.
  16 A particular rm may appear in more than one group if it exports to multiple countries or if
it exports more than HS category. We nd that 86 percent of MFA rms in 2004 export at least
one of their MFA HS categories to at least one quota-free country (e.g., Japan).     These rms
represent 77 percent of MFA export value in 2004. The comparable gure for OTC rms and
OTC export value are 40 and 65 percent, respectively.




                                               13
     We assess the extent to which quotas were allocated to the most productive

rms by examining changes in MFA exports before and after quotas were removed

on January 1, 2005 using outcomes in OTC as well as prior years as controls.

These comparisons capture broad trends aecting China's textile and clothing

exports during this period, such as improvements in productivity or privatization,

and our ability to make use of them is a unique advantage of our analysis.

     A more direct approach to identifying misallocation of quotas would be to com-

pare the estimated TFP of rms assigned quotas in 2004 to those which export

freely in 2005. In principle, this comparison could be accomplished by matching

rms' trading behavior in the customs data to information on their output and in-

puts recorded in China's annual survey of manufacturing collected by the National
                                                                                              17
Bureau of Statistics (NBS). In practice, matching these two datasets is dicult.

Another alternative would be to use the indicator for rms' export status in the

NBS production data to determine their participation in quota-constrained export

markets. Unfortunately, this indicator cannot be used to distinguish between MFA

and OTC exports because it neither records the countries to which rms export

nor the specic HS codes exported. The only industry information available in the

NBS is a code for rms' major line of business.




5      Reallocation Following Quota Removal

The model developed in Section 2 highlights three empirical implications of the

removal of auction-allocated quotas: a reallocation of export market share towards

the largest, most productive incumbents; a reduction in incumbents' export prices

due to the removal of license fees; and the entry of less-productive but higher-priced

exporters. We nd substantial dierences between the data and the predictions of

the auction-allocation model.
    17 Matching must be done using rm names rather than numerical identiers. We have suc-
ceeded in matching 9,558 (31 percent) of the 2005 MFA and OTC exporters to the NBS pro-
duction data. These exporters account for 35 percent of total MFA and OTC export value. By
ownership type, we match 9 (6), 19 (30) and 58 (77) percent of SOE, domestic and foreign rms
(value), respectively.   We suspect that very low match rate for SOEs is due to their use of a
trading division to export.   As discussed further in Section 7.2, this suspicion is strengthened
by relatively high prevalence of the phrase trading company in their names despite their being
included in the NBS, which purportedly tracks producers.




                                               14
5.1     Export Growth Following Quota Removal

Chinese export growth in 2005 is disproportionately large for textile and clothing

goods released from quotas, and generally occurs at the expense of state-owned

enterprises.

    As indicated in the top panel of Table 2, MFA product-countries registered

a 307 percent increase in export value between 2000 and 2005.              By comparison,

export growth is 205 percent for OTC and 236 percent for Chinese exports as a

whole. MFA's dierentially large growth is due primarily to the 119 percent jump

in export value that occurs in 2005, the year that quotas are removed. Its annual
                                                                      18
growth in prior years, by contrast, averages just 17 percent.

    Data in the lower panel of Table 2 indicates that the surge in MFA export

value in 2005 is accompanied by a 96 percent increase in the number of MFA

exporters. Here, too, this jump is large relative to prior years as well as the 39

percent increases in OTC exporters over the same period. This relative growth in

the number of exporters provides the rst indication of the potential importance of

the extensive margin in MFA's response to quota removal. We also nd that MFA

export growth is uneven across ownership types:                SOEs account for 54 percent

of MFA in 2004 versus 44 percent for OTC. Once quotas are removed, Table 3

shows that this gap falls markedly: in 2005, SOEs' market share is 38 percent in

MFA and 36 percent in OTC. Together, these facts highlight three trends about

MFA exports following quota removal. First, MFA export growth is relatively high

compared to previous years and to OTC, indicating that MFA quotas were binding.

Second, growth in MFA export value is accompanied by a similarly large increase

in the number of MFA exporters, which suggests a prominent role for the extensive

margin. Finally, the reallocation of market share away from publicly owned SOEs

and towards privately owned domestic and foreign rms suggests that SOEs may

have received an excessive level of quota under the MFA.

    The transfer of MFA market share between ownership types can be used to

compute a coarse, back-of-envelope estimate of the productivity gain associated

with the replacement of SOEs by privately owned rms. Using the NBS produc-

  18 U.S., E.U. and Canadian quotas on China's MFA export quantities grew an average of 2 to
3 percent per year once China was admitted to the WTO in December 2001 (Brambilla et al.
2010). The relatively high value growth displayed before 2004 in Table 2 reects a combination
of this growth in quantity as well as sizable increases in prices.



                                                15
tion data we compute the relative productivity of exporters by rm ownership type,

restricting our comparison to exporters in 2005 whose major line of business is tex-

tiles or clothing (industry codes 17 or 18). Figure 1 plots the resulting distributions

of textile and clothing exporters' TFP relative to the hypothetical average textile
                                                   19
and clothing rm by type of ownership.                  SOE exporters' distribution lies clearly

to the left of the distributions of privately owned exporters. The rst column of

Table 4 reports each ownership type's TFP relative to the hypothetical mean from

Figure 1. On average, SOEs are 18 percent less productive than the hypothetical

mean exporter, while privately owned domestic and foreign exporters are 88 and

72 percent more productive.            These estimates are consistent with broader mea-

sures of TFP dierences among state- and privately owned rms found by Brandt

and Zhu (2010) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009).                    The second column reports the

relative changes in each ownership type's market share between 2004 and 2005.

Multiplying through, we nd that the reallocation of market shares observed in

2005 implies an increase in exporters' TFP of 13.5 percent. This estimate relies on

the strong assumption that rm productivity is constant within ownership types,

which is at odds with Figure 1 and additional evidence on export prices presented

below. Below, we derive an alternate estimate of aggregate productivity growth

associated with quota removal that relaxes this assumption.



5.2       Margins of Adjustment

We nd that export growth following quota removal favors privately owned entrants

primarily at the expense of incumbent SOEs.

      Export growth can be decomposed into one intensive and two extensive mar-

gins. The intensive margin is populated by incumbents, by which we mean eight-

digit HS products exported by the same rm to the same country in both 2004

and 2005.       The extensive margin is comprised of entrants and exiters.                   Entrants

     19 We follow Brandt et al. (2009) in estimating rm   f 's TFP using a TÃ¶rnqvist index number
approach,   ln(T F Pf ) = (vaf â va) â sef (wf â w) â (1 â sef )(kf â k), where vaf , wf , and kf are in
logs and   denote rm value added, wages and xed assets (net of depreciation), s      ef = (sf + s)/2,
sf   is the share of wages in total value added, and where a bar over a variable denotes an average
across all textile and clothing exporters. TFP for each rm is relative to a hypothetical rm with
the average output and inputs. Wages are dened as reported rm wages plus employee benets
(unemployment insurance, housing subsidies, pension and medical insurance), and capital is
dened as reported capital stock at original purchase price less accumulated depreciation.



                                                   16
are rm-product-country triplets which appear in 2005 but which were not present

in 2004. Exiters exhibit the opposite pattern. Given these denitions, multiple-

product exporters may be counted in more than one margin of adjustment, e.g.,

they may exit one product-country and enter another.

   We examine reallocation in terms of quantity- rather than value-based mar-

ket share due to the large price changes documented in the next section. Under

the auction-allocation scenario presented in Section 2, export growth following

quota removal should be concentrated among the largest incumbents due to their

(presumed) greater productivity.        Instead, we nd the opposite.             Figure 2 plots

the locally weighted least squares relationship between incumbents market share

within their product-country pair in 2004 and their change in this market share be-

tween 2004 and 2005. Separate relationships are plotted for each ownership type,

by group. The negative relationships across ownership-group pairs likely reects

mean reversion. However, this decline is more pronounced in MFA than OTC, and

most severe for SOEs within MFA. This result provides further indication that
                                                         20
SOEs received excessive allocations under quotas.

   A formal decomposition of 2004 to 2005 MFA quantity market share reallo-

cation by margin of adjustment is presented in the rst panel of Table 5.                          It is

constructed by determining the quantity market share of each margin (m) within

   The left panel of Table 5 summarizes the single-dierence shift in market

share from incumbents to net entrants within MFA from 2004 to 2005 as quotas

are removed. Entrants are decomposed into new exporters, which are rms that

did not export at all in 2004, and adders, which are rms that exported one or

more other (potentially MFA) products in 2004 prior to adding an MFA product in
      21
2005.      Incumbents' market shares decline by an average of 21 percentage points

  20 We note that the strong role of the extensive margin might be explained by capacity con-
straints among incumbents as quotas are removed. While this explanation is plausible, it seems
unlikely given that the dates of quota removal were known ten years in advance, providing in-
cumbents with ample time to prepare.
  21 A given rm may contribute to both the intensive and adder extensive margins if it both



                                             17
across product-destination pairs in the year quotas are removed. This decline is

(necessarily) oset by a 21 percentage-point average gain by net entrants, for an

overall average change of zero. Of this 21 percentage-point gain, adders and new

exporters contribute 65 and 6 percent, respectively, while exiters account for -50

percent.

      The remaining columns of the left panel of Table 5 decompose the overall

single-dierence change in MFA market share for each margin by type of rm

ownership.       Each row sums to the value in the rst column of the panel.                  Two

trends stand out.         First, there is substantial     gross   reallocation of market share

within each ownership type. This gross reallocation emphasizes rm heterogeneity

within each type of ownership and is most pronounced among SOEs, where the

relatively high 32 percent market share lost by exiters is oset by a 26 percent

market share gain by adders. Second, there is a               net   21.9 percent reallocation of

market share from SOEs to privately owned domestic (13.4 percent) and foreign
                              22
(8.5 percent) entrants.            Together, these gross and net reallocations suggest that

the excessive quota enjoyed by some state-owned enterprises in 2004 came at the

expense of both other SOEs as well as privately owned rms.

      The single dierences reported in the left panel of Table 5 do not reveal the

extent to which 2004 to 2005 changes in MFA margins' market shares deviate

either from changes in OTC over the same period, or from these groups' changes

in the prior period. Such triple dierences control for factors common to Chinese

textile and clothing products over time such as the removal of entry barriers and

the broad-based decline of SOEs. Triple dierences are estimated via the following

product-country level OLS regression:




                    âÎmhct = Î±0 + Î±1 1{t=2005} + Î±2 1{hc â MFA}                                 (4)

                                   + Î±3 1{t=2005} Ã 1{hc â MFA} + emhct ,

where     1{t=2005}     and   1{hc â MFA}     are indicators for 2005 and the presence of a

continues exporting at least one MFA product between 2004 and 2005 and adds another MFA
product during that interval. For more detail, see the appendix.
     22 Price changes explain the dierence between the 21 percent decline in SOEs average quantity-
based market shares in Table 5 and their 16 percent decline in value-based market share in Table
3.

product-country pair in group MFA, respectively. The sum of all four coecients

represents the triple dierences reported in the right panel of Table 5. Complete

regression results are reported in Table 10 of the appendix.

    Triple dierences convey the same basic message as the single dierences, i.e.,

a strong reallocation of market share away from incumbent SOEs and towards

privately owned entrants.        This reallocation is inconsistent with quota removal

under the auction model developed in Section 2 as well as the relatively high
                                                                  23
apparent productivity of entrants discussed below.



5.3      Prices

MFA export prices fall substantially when quotas are removed, largely due to net

entry.

    We compute the change in groups' export prices in two steps. First, for each

product-country (hc) pair in each year (t), we calculate a weighted-average export

price (P hct ) across all rms' log export unit values,             ln(pf hct ),   using their quantity
                                      24
market shares (Î¸f hct ) as weights         ,


                                               â
                                  PÌhct =          Î¸f hct ln(pf hct ).                              (5)
                                               f

Then, for each product-country pair, we compute the change in this log price

between years,


                                         (               )
                                 âPÌhct = P hct â P hctâ1 .                                         (6)


Each bar in Figure 3 displays the mean of            âPÌhct   across all product-country pairs in

  23 In unreported results (available upon request), we nd even stronger reallocation from SOE
incumbents to privately owned entrants among product-country pairs where quotas are binding,
i.e., where ll rates exceed 90 percent. Data on U.S., E.U. and Canadian ll rates are obtained
from OTEXA, SystÃ¨me IntÃ©grÃ© de Gestion de Licenses, and Foreign Aairs and International
Trade Canada, respectively. We also nd virtually identical triple-dierence results after includ-
ing product and country xed eects, which control for trends in prices and identify changes
within these groups between 2003 to 2004 and 2004 to 2005.
  24 We use log prices to minimize the inuence of outliers and to facilitate decomposition of
observed prices into quality-adjusted prices below. Results are qualitatively similar if we drop
outliers, i.e., product-country groups with the highest and lowest 1 percent of price changes.




                                                   19
MFA and OTC for 2004 and 2005. As indicated in the gure, MFA export prices

on average fall by 0.179 log points, while OTC exports on average rise by 0.065 log

points. The MFA decline is also sharp relative to the group's average price growth

of 0.01 log points in 2004.

   Variation in normalized log export prices among MFA incumbents, entrants

and exiters is displayed visually in Figure 4, which plots incumbents' and entrants'

normalized 2005 log export prices and exiters' normalized 2004 log export prices.

In both cases the normalization involves subtracting o the across-year log mean

price for product-country     hc:

                                         1(                )
                                P hc =      P hct + P hctâ1 .                      (7)

Firms whose relative prices are below and above the rst and ninety-ninth per-

centiles of each distribution, respectively, are removed from the gure to increase

readability.

   The ordering of the price distributions, with entrants to the left and exiters

to the right, indicates that rms exiting MFA in 2004 have relatively high prices

compared to 2005 entrants.          On average, entrants' prices are 0.25 and 0.21 log

points lower than incumbents' and exiters' prices, respectively. By comparison, the

top and bottom panels of Figure 5 reveal that we do not nd a similar ordering of

entrants' and exiters' prices either contemporaneously in OTC or in MFA the year

before. A second notable feature of Figure 4 is MFA incumbents' relatively thin

left tail. This paucity of very low prices provides intuition for the loss of market

share by incumbents discussed in the previous section. Indeed, incumbents' ability

to retain as much market share as they did given their relatively high prices may

be due to market or policy asymmetries such as long-term contracts or better

marketing information that give high-priced incumbents an advantage over low-

priced entrants.

   We quantify the relative importance of each margin in MFA price changes

using a technique for productivity decomposition proposed by Griliches and Regev

(1995):

As above,  Î¸ represents quantity-based market share and f , h and c index exporters,
eight-digit HS categories and countries, respectively. I , N and X correspond to

the sets of incumbent, entering (new exporters plus adders) and exiting rms,

respectively. (We forgo breaking entrants into adders versus new exporters given

the relatively small market share of the latter in Table 5.)                     Î¸f hc is the average market
                                                                             (          )
share of rm     f in hc across               years, i.e., Î¸ f hc = Î¸ f hct + Î¸ f hctâ1 /2. Finally, pf hc =
1
2
  (ln pf hct + ln pf hctâ1 ) /2 is            the across-year average price of rm f in product-

country hc. Like Î¸ f hc , it can              be computed only for incumbents.

     The rst term in square brackets captures the intensive margin.                                                Its rst,

within component measures the price change of incumbent exporters holding

their market share xed. Its second, across component accounts for changes in

incumbents' market shares, weighting those changes by the dierence between a

rm's average across-year price and the overall average across-year price.                                             If in-

cumbents' prices fall with the quota fee, the within component is negative.                                                If

incumbents' prices are relatively high and their market shares tend to decline, the

across component is also negative and both components contribute to a reduction

in   âPÌhct .
     The second term in square brackets in equation (8) captures the entry mar-

gin; this term is negative if entrants' prices are lower than the across-year average

price. The third term in square brackets captures the exit margin. Its interpre-

tation is analogous to the entry term, as it is positive if exiters have relatively

high prices compared to the across-year average. Note that because the exit mar-

gin is   subtracted           from the previous two margins, positive values make a negative

contribution to the overall price change.

     We use regressions analogous to equation (4) to estimate single- and triple-




                                                            21
dierence price decompositions. Complete regression results are reported in Table

11 of our appendix and are summarized in the two panels of Table 6 using the same

format as with market shares above. Here, triple dierencing controls for ination

(our value data are nominal) as well as other factors such as changes in technology

and exchange rates that aect the prices of all Chinese textile and clothing export

prices equally.

   As results for single and triple dierences are quite similar, we discuss the latter.

We nd that incumbents are responsible for just over one-third (37 percent) of the

average 0.179 relative log point decline in MFA export prices in 2005. The within

and across components of this adjustment reveal that most of this drop is due

to loss of market share by relatively high-priced incumbents (-0.042) versus price

declines (-0.025), but that both are sizable.    The extensive margin accounts for

the remaining 63 percent of the overall price decline, with entrants' relatively low

prices and exiters' relatively high prices contributing 39 and 24 percent on average,

respectively.

   More so than with market share changes, price changes are the result of both

gross and net reallocations within and across ownership types. Price declines and

loss of market share by incumbent SOEs account for one-fourth over the overall

drop in prices (-0.052/-0.179). Net entry by SOEs not favored by quota allocation

in 2004 contributes another fourth (-0.51/-0.179), with entry and exit contributing

roughly equal amounts.    Finally, entry by low-priced privately owned rms con-

tributes another third (-0.062/-0.179). To the extent that low prices reect high

productivity, these trends are inconsistent with allocation of quotas to the most

productive rms under the MFA.



5.4    Quality, Quality-Adjusted Prices and Productivity

Long-standing research on quotas discusses rms' incentives to increase product

quality when quotas are imposed and decrease it when they are removed (Aw and

Roberts 1986, Feenstra 1988 and Boorstein and Feenstra 1991).           This incentive

comes from the relatively high penalty quotas exert on low-price  here interpreted

as low-quality  goods.    From a quality perspective, the relative price declines

documented above may reect quality downgrading by incumbents and the entry

and exit of low- and high-quality textile and clothing varieties, respectively.


                                          22
    We estimate export quality (Î»f hct ) by embedding preference for it in the CES
                                  (Â´                              )Ï/(Ïâ1)
                                                       (Ïâ1)/Ï
utility function used above: U =            (Î»(Ï)q(Ï))         dÏ          . With these
                                      Ïââ¦
preferences, demand for a particular rm's export in destination country                 c is given
by:


                                                        âÏ
                                       qf hct = Î»Ïâ1           Ïâ1
                                                 f hct pf hct Pct Yct .                        (9)


Taking logs and using the elasticity of substitution                Ï=4   from Section 2.2, we use

the residual from the following OLS regression to infer quality:



                             ln qf hct + 4 ln pf hct = Î±h + Î±ct + Ïµf cht ,                    (10)


where    Î»Ìf cdt â¡ ÏµÌf cht /(Ï â 1).   The intuition behind this approach is straightforward:
                                                                                                 25
conditional on price, a variety with a higher quantity is assigned higher quality.

By imposing the same elasticity of substitution across textile and clothing products,

we avoid having to estimate demand before inferring quality. In our estimation,                Î±ct
collects both the destination price index             (Pct ) and income (Yct ).   The product xed

eect   Î±h   is included because prices and quantities are not necessarily comparable

across product categories. The quality-adjusted price is the observed log price less

estimated quality, which is already in logs.

      Table 7 decomposes MFA quality changes by margin of adjustment and owner-

ship type using the same format as previous decompositions. The single-dierence

results in the left panel indicates an average increase in overall MFA quality across

hc    pairs of 0.044 log points.         Consistent with the quota literature, however, the

triple-dierence results in the right panel indicate an average decline in relative

MFA quality of -0.109 log points.               SOE and privately owned domestic rms are

  25 See Hummels and Klenow (2005), Khandelwal (2010), Hallak and Schott (2011) and Feenstra
and Romalis (2011). We infer quality from the demand side and do not specify a model that
accounts for rm quality choice (e.g., Kugler and Verhoogen (forthcoming) and Johnson (2010)).
Here, quality is dened very broadly: it is anything that raises consumer demand for a product
other than price. This method for inferring quality downgrading within products, also used by
Broda and Weinstein (2010), diers from the across-product approach adopted by Harrigan and
Barrows (2009) and developed by Aw and Roberts (1986) and Boorstein and Feenstra (1991).
In their approach, quality downgrading is dened as a shift in consumption from high- to low-
priced HS categories over time, as identied by a relative decrease in a quantity-weighted versus
value-weighted average price index. We follow our approach to identify quality changes because
across-product evidence of quality downgrading does not account for quality changes within HS
categories or within rms, which our data can address directly.



                                                     23
the major source of this decline: they account for half of the overall drop (-0.052/-

0.109) and their contribution is statistically signicant. While the results in the

remaining cells of the table are consistent with low-quality entrants replacing high-

quality exiters, they are not statistically signicant except for the combined net

entry of privately owned domestic rms, which accounts for another third of the

overall decline (-0.032/-0.109).

    Subtracting the decomposition in Table 7 from the decomposition in Table

6 yields the decomposition of quality-adjusted prices reported in Table 8.               The

triple dierences in the right panel of the table reveal that MFA prices continue to

exhibit a statistically signicant relative price decline of -0.070 log points even after

adjusting for quality. Likewise, net entry by low-price rms of each ownership type

continues to account for a substantial and (jointly) statistically signicant portion

(-0.055/-0.070) of this overall decline. In fact, the extensive margin's contribution

to the decline in quality-adjusted price changes (79 percent) is even higher than

its contribution to observed price changes (63 percent; Table 6).

    As indicated in the pricing rule from Section 2.2 (equation 1), changes in in-

verted quality-adjusted prices provide information about changes in rm produc-

tivity. Assuming the Chinese government awarded quotas without charging a fee

from recipients (i.e.,   aChina,U S = 0),    the quality-adjusted price changes reported

in Table 6 indicate that quota removal coincides with an average 0.070 log point

increase in productivity across      hc   pairs.    While this productivity growth is con-

sistent with the auction-allocation scenario in Section 2.2, entrants' contribution

to it starkly violates the implication that new exporters be of lower productivity

than incumbents. More than half of the total gain in productivity is due to entry

(0.039/0.070), with SOEs and privately owned domestic rms contributing most

of it. This estimated 0.070 log point gain in productivity is large relative to other
                               27
estimates in the literature.        Brandt and Zhu (2010), for example, estimate aver-

age annual TFP growth of 4 percent for non-agricultural industries over 1998 to

2007.

    The growth in productivity revealed by changes in quality adjusted prices rep-

resents the total gain from quota removal.            In the next section we make use of

  26 Since the price changes are in logs, multiplying through by -1 yields productivity.
  27 We nd an increase in aggregate productivity of 0.069 log points if we weight hc pairs by
export value.

6      Decomposing Productivity Gains

The empirical analysis in Section 5 demonstrates that the Chinese government

did not allocate export quotas according to rm eciency.             To determine the

drag on exporter productivity induced by this misallocation, we need to compare

the actual allocation mechanism used by the government to the (counterfactual)

auction-allocation mechanism. We approximate the government's process for allo-

cating quota licenses via a simple political-allocation scenario designed to match

fundamental features of the data. We then compare the weighted-average produc-

tivity of exporters under this scenario to the weighted-average productivities found

for both the auction-allocation and no-quotas models in Section 2.2.

    The political-allocation scenario is constructed to match three key outcomes

in the data following the removal of quotas in 2005: the growth in MFA export

volumes, the growth in the number of MFA exporters, and the decline in incumbent

market share. We t the rst two of these trends exactly and use the third to pin

down the extent of the government's misallocation under political allocation.

    We assume that the aggregate quota imposed on China is the same under

auction and political allocation, and therefore use the same quota restrictiveness

(0.61) employed in Section 2.2. We choose the number of exporters that receive

quotas under political allocation,   N P A,   to match the 65 percent relative growth in

MFA exporters observed in 2005 (Table 2),


                                N NQ â N P A
                                             = 1.65,                               (11)
                                   NPA

where   N NQ   is the number of exporters found in the no-quota scenario in Section

2.2.

    In Section 5 we found that the decline in incumbent market share between

2004 and 2005 is key evidence in favor of misallocation. As a result, we need the

political allocation scenario to assign quotas to enough low-productivity rms so

that their dropping out of the export market once quotas are removed matches the



                                              25
data. Toward that end, we assume that export shares are allocated on the basis

of a second random rm draw,             Îº,   that has rank correlation        Ï   with the productiv-
                                                                                                      28
ity draw,    Ï,   they recieved in the auction-allocation model in Section 2.2.                            We

interpret this second source of rm heterogeneity as a measure of rms' ability to

obtain quota from the government, perhaps due to political connections. As with

productivity, we assume that rms are endowed with their political connection

and ignore any deadweight loss associated with potentially unproductive bribery

or lobbying to obtain their political connection (Bhagwati 1982). For a given                          Ï, we
sort rms according to         Îº   and assign the 2004 export shares observed in the data
                  PA                                             29
to the top   N         of these rms, from high to low.

     Exporters' weighted-average productivity under political allocation is governed

by   Ï.   Indeed, the magnitude of            Ï   is an indication of misallocation: the further

its distance from 1, the less the resulting allocation is based on                    Ï.   We choose        Ï
so that the change in incumbents' market share between the political-allocation

and no-quota scenarios matches the observed 16.7 percent relative decline in MFA

incumbents' market share in 2005 (Table 5, right panel).

     This match occurs at        Ï = 0.67, implying a political-allocation weighted-average
productivity of 3.26. This productivity is lower than the weighted-average produc-

tivities of 3.43 and 4.21 found for the auction-allocation and no-quota models,

respectively (Table 1), for two reasons.               First, some low productivity rms that

do not get quotas under auction allocation recieve them under political allocation

because they have a high           Îº   (i.e., high political connections). Second, the export

market shares of some high-productivity rms under political allocation are lower

than they would be under auction allocation because they have a low                         Îº.
     Our results indicate that 18 percent ((3.43-3.26)/(4.21-3.26)) of the gain from

removing quotas is due to the removal of misallocation (e.g., replacement of po-

litical allocation with auction allocation), while 82 percent is due to the direct
                                                                                                 30
removal of the quota (movement from auction allocation to no quota).                                   If we

  28 Îº = ÏÏ +
              â
               (1 â Ï2 )Ïµ: Ïµ    is a standard normal and     Ï   is the correlation between Ï and Îº.
  29 Because there are more rms in the model than the data, we group the               N P A rms in the
model evenly into bins so that the number of bins in the model equals the number of rms in
the data. The group of rms with the highest         Îº receive the highest market share,   the group with
the next highest   Îº   receives the second highest market share, and so forth. The empirical market
share assigned to each bin in the model is divided evenly across its constituent rms.
  30 Similar results are obtained using a Pareto distribution for rm productivity, in which case



                                                     26
apply this decomposition to the productivity calculation in Table 8, it implies that

the removal of the actual licensing institution increased exporters' productivity by

1.3 percentage points (0.07*0.18). Put dierently, we nd that removing misallo-

cation increases exporter productivity an additional 28 percent ((4.21-3.26)/3.26

vs (4.21-3.43)/3.43) versus auction allocation.

    This eect of misallocation can be placed in context by noting that Hsieh and

Klenow (2009) calculate TFP gains of 23 to 30 percent from removing               all   domestic

distortions from Chinese manufacturing in 2005. Our analysis indicates removal of

China's textile and clothing quota licensing regime by itself would increase TFP

among exporters by 5.2 percent (3.43/3.26). Given the myriad other distortions

that likely exist in Chinese manufacturing, our estimate seems plausible.




7     Subcontracting

7.1     Subcontracting by Producing Firms

Our estimates are sensitive to unobserved subcontracting. More precisely, if the

quota-holding rm and the ultimate producer of the export are dierent, and if

customs documents list the name of the former rather than the latter, then our

estimates of extensive-margin activity following quota removal will be biased up-

wards if subcontractors ocially replace quota holders on trade documents starting

in 2005.   Furthermore, assignment of subcontracts on the basis of eciency (for

example, via a black-market auction) would complicate our ability to identify a

reallocation of exports towards more ecient rms when the MFA ended.

    In principle, subcontracting's inuence on our results should be minimal given

its illegality.   Unfortunately, as noted in Section 3, we have been unable to de-

termine via interviews or secondary sources the extent to which it might have

occurred. Nevertheless, ve trends in the data suggest that subcontracting exerts

a limited eect on our results.

we nd a shape parameter of 4.5,     ÏChn,U S = 1.7, ÏU S,Chn = 3.05, fChn,U S /fChn,Chn = 1.75,
fU S,Chn /fU S,U S = 1.05   and rank correlationÏ = 0.70. Given these parameters, weighted-
average productivity under political allocation, auction allocation and no quotas is 2.36, 2.54,
and 3.61, implying that 14 percent of the gain from removing quotas is due to the elimination of
misallocation.




                                               27
    First, if quota holders were subcontracting to ecient non-quota holders, one

might expect these subcontractors to be dominated by a relatively small number

of large (i.e., ecient) producers, and that these producers would dominate entry

once quotas are removed. Instead, as noted in footnote 21 in Section 5.2, we nd

that   new   MFA entrants in 2005 are relatively numerous and relatively small.

    Second, if subcontracting were the only way a rm with a quota could fulll

it, the rms relying on subcontractors in 2004 would exit or shrink substantially

once quotas were removed. In fact, we nd that few incumbents' exports actually

decline from 2004 to 2005, and that MFA exit rates are relatively low compared
                                                                      31
with OTC exit rates across all ownership types (Table 5).

    Third, we nd that 86 percent of the quota-holding MFA exporters in 2004

are also active in similar products destined for other markets. Given that these

rms are present in these other markets, they likely have the ability to produce

for MFA as well. (Subcontracting exports of textile and apparel goods to other

markets makes little sense given that they were not constrained by quotas). It is

therefore not obvious why a quota-holder would subcontract production of MFA
                                                                                                 32
but produce its own output of similar products for exports to other destinations.

    Fourth, we nd little evidence in the NBS production data that textile and

clothing producers' exports exceeded their production, as might be expected if they

were on-exporting subcontractors' output. In both 2004 and 2005, the production-

to-export ratio is greater than one for 95 percent of rms that report textile and

apparel as their main line of business. One caveat here is that information revealed

by the production-to-exports ratio depends on the relative importance of the export

market; rms selling large quantities domestically might nevertheless export a

relatively small amount of subcontracted production.

    Finally, we nd a relatively strong contribution by the extensive margin in

processing versus ordinary exports, where the former refers to exports that

are assembled in an export processing zone with a disproportionate share of raw

materials that are imported at reduced or often zero tari rates. Subcontracting

  31 While it is true that SOEs' market shares decline substantially, this reallocation is driven by
faster growth among privately owned rms than SOEs, i.e., almost all incumbents experienced
growth in export quantity between 2004 and 2005.
  32 As discussed in Section 3, virtually all MFA products had full trading rights so all rms could
directly export an MFA product to the rest of the world if they so chose.




                                                28
of processed exports is more dicult, especially for subcontractors that lie outside

the processing zone, given that the rules governing this class of exports must be
                                  33
obeyed by the subcontractor.           Table 9 compares the relative contribution of the

extensive margin in MFA versus OTC exports for processed versus all exports. We

nd that MFA incumbents lose           more   relative market share in processing exports

(-21.7 percent) than in all exports (-16.7 percent), and a similar reallocation away

from SOEs.



7.2     Subcontracting by Intermediaries

Unobserved subcontracting by intermediaries (i.e., non-producing trading rms)

presents a dierent challenge to identication than subcontracting by producers:

while the latter had no reason to continue once the quota institution ended, there

is no reason for the former to disappear. Furthermore, even if the number of in-

termediaries remained constant between 2004 and 2005, the number of producing

rms with which they contracted  and, therefore, their inuence on the true ad-

justment of China's extensive and intensive margins  would be unknown because

we do not observe the set of producers from which an intermediary sources.

   One might expect trading rms to be replaced by producers in 2005 if quota-

rich trading rms were an important conduit for quota-poor producers' goods. In

fact, we nd relatively strong entry by trading rms, dened as in Ahn et al.

(2011) as rms with the words importer, exporter or trader in their title,

in MFA versus OTC between 2004 and 2005. One reason for this growth that is

consistent with our conclusions above but which contributes to an          under-estimation
of the inuence of the extensive margin, is that intermediaries helped a new set of

low-productivity entrants overcome the xed costs of exporting once quotas were

removed (Ahn et al.      2011).   One caveat associated with this conclusion is that

our classication of rms as trading companies is imperfect, and, in particular,

might result in rms that have both production and trading arms being classied

as traders. A large fraction of the textile and clothing apparel SOEs that export,

for example, are classied as traders, which is at odds with the evidence presented

above that virtually all SOEs in the NBS production data have higher production

  33 We identify processed exports via a ag in the customs data. Processed exports account for
19 and 20 percent of MFA exports in 2004 and 2005, respectively.



                                               29
output than exports.    Indeed, according to our classication, trading companies

account for 48 and 46 percent of OTC and MFA exports in 2004, which is quite

large relative to the 24 percent share of intermediaries in China's overall exports.

We suspect that state-owned manufacturers may export through trading arms

of their production facilities under a name that contains the phrases importer,

exporter or trader. This may be why we are only able to match 9 percent of

state-owned textile and clothing exporters in the customs and production data by

name even though the production data contains a census of SOEs.

    Given our concern of classifying these state-owned clothing and apparel ex-

porters as intermediaries, we investigate the eects of treating all SOEs as pro-

ducers.   We nd that as a result of this reclassication, the export share of the

remaining rms classied as traders falls to 13 and 11 percent, respectively. This

result suggests that although intermediaries help facilitate trade in this industry,

their role is relatively small, perhaps because the U.S., E.U. and Canada are rela-

tively large markets which makes direct exports protable.




8    Conclusion

We evaluate the productivity gains associated with a specic trade liberalization,

the removal of quotas on Chinese textile and clothing exports to the U.S., E.U. and

Canada in 2005. We nd that quota removal coincides with substantial reallocation

of export activity from incumbents to entrants, and show that this reallocation is

inconsistent with an   ex ante   assignment of quotas by the Chinese government on

the basis of rm productivity. As a result, we nd that the standard productivity

growth expected from the removal of this trade barrier is magnied by the con-

comitant elimination of the institutions that grew up around it. Our counterfactual

analysis suggests that productivity growth from quota removal is 27 percent higher

than it would be if quotas had been allocated according to rm eciency.

    Our analysis provides intuition for why empirical ndings of the productivity

gains from trade (e.g., Feyrer 2009 and Pavcnik 2002) are often large compared to

the relatively modest gains predicted by many trade models (Arkolakis et al. 2010).

While theoretical models typically presume an ecient allocation of resources,

conditional on trade barriers, institutions that evolve to manage them are subject



                                          30
to corruption or capture, imposing additional distortions. Because reforming these

institutions can be politically dicult, externally mandated reforms that dismantle

them can deliver outsized gains.

A       Appendix (Numerical Solutions)

In this appendix, we provide further detail on Irarrazabal et. al (2010) and our

procedures for solving the model numerically.

    There is one industry and two countries, although this is easily generalized to

multiple countries and multiple industries. A representative consumer maximizes

a CES utility function

                                          (Ë                                )Ï/(Ïâ1)
                                                            (Ïâ1)/Ï
                                   U=                q(Ï)              dÏ                                   (A.12)
                                              Ïââ¦

Firms face three types of costs. The rst two are the standard:                             ad valorem       taris

(Ïod ) and xed costs of production (fod ). In order to export a quota-bound good

from origin country           o   to destination country            d,   rms must also pay a license fee

(aod   > 0)   per unit exported.              This quota license fees is equivalent to per-unit

increases in the cost of exporting.

    Firm productivity is drawn from the distribution                           G(Ï)    with density   g(Ï).   The

price of variety     Ï   in export market            d   is given by

                                                                   (            )
                                                   Ï                   Ïod
                                  pod (Ï, aod ) =     Ïo                   + aod ,                          (A.13)
                                                  Ïâ1                   Ï

where   Ï>1     is the constant elasticity of substitution across varieties and                         Ïo   is the

wage in the origin country. The corresponding export quantity is given by

                                      (                  )âÏ (                )âÏ
                                           Ï                      Ïod
                    qod (Ï, aod ) =           Ïo                      + aod         (Pd )Ïâ1 Yd ,           (A.14)
                                          Ïâ1                      Ï
where   Pd    and   Yd   are the price index and expenditure in the destination market,

respectively. The license price that equates the aggregate demand for exports with

the size of the quota is determined (endogenously) by a Walrasian auctioneer.

    This model assumes that the total mass of potential entrants in each country

   Since there is no closed form solution to the price index when                           aod > 0, we must
solve the model numerically. Our solution modies the algorithm described in Irar-

razabal et al (2010) to account for an endogenous license price. The parameters are:

Ï , L = LChn , LU EC , G(Ï) â¼ ln âµ(Âµ, Î¸), Ï = {ÏChn,Chn , ÏChn,U EC , ÏU EC,Chn , ÏU EC,U EC },
f = {fChn,Chn, fChn,U EC , fU EC,Chn , fU EC,U EC }, Ï = {ÏChn , ÏU EC }. Below we ex-
plain how the parameters are chosen. Given the parameters, we can numerically

solve for the endogenous variables of the model:                     Ïâ = {ÏâChn,Chn , ÏâChn,U EC , ÏâU EC,Chn , ÏâU EC,U EC },
P = {PChn , PU EC }, Y = {YChn , YU EC },Ï and aChn,U EC                       (we assume that China does

not impose quotas on U.S. goods).

   We solve two versions of the model. The rst version does not impose quotas

on China's exports to the U.S. (the no quota equilibrium).                                In this scenario,

aChn,U EC = 0.     In the ecient allocation equilibrium, the license price is non-

negative and depends on the restrictiveness of the quotas that we calculate from

the data.

   We solve the model with one million rms drawn from the productivity distri-

bution.The Matlab code used to generate these results, available in our electronic

appendix, is a modied version of the code used in Irarrazabal et al. (2010), gra-

ciously provided by Andreas Moxnes. Superscripts denoting the iteration round:


  1. Choose a starting value for the license price           a0od .   (In the no quota equilib-

     rium, we set    a0od = 0.).
  2. Choose a starting value for the price indexes,            P 0.
  3. Simultaneously solve for the dividend per share in equation (A.15) and the

     cutos   Ïâ   in equation (A.17). This involves solving ve unknowns with ve

     equations. First choose a candidate            Ï and then compute the cutos in (A.17).
                                  â
     Given the candidate      Ï       , compute   Ï and re-compute the cutos, iterating until
                                                                                 0â
     convergence is achieved. This              process determines the cutos Ï     given the

     candidate     P0   in step 2.

  4. Compute the price indexes in (A.18).

  5. Iterate over steps 3 and 4.            The equilibrium values of       {Ïâ , P } are found
     when    â¥P r â P râ1 â¥ is minimized. The values of                Y and Ï are determined
     once   {Ïâ , P }are known. In the no quota equilibrium,               stop here and com-

     pute aggregate exports from China to the US. In the ecient allocation

     equilibrium, continue to step 6.

  6. Compare aggregate exports from China to the U.S. with exports under no

     quota equilibrium multiplied by the quota restrictiveness. Iterate on steps

     1-5 until this dierence is minimized.


We impose values for some parameters and choose values for the remaining pa-

rameters by gridding over them and comparing their solutions to the data.                    We

assume that the two countries have identical sizes           LU EC = LChn = 100.      We choose

an elasticity of substitution,         Ï = 4,   that is the median among the apparel and

textiles elasticities estimated in Broda et al.           (2006).      We assume a log normal

productivity distribution,   G(Ï) â¼ ln âµ(Âµ, Î¸). We assume iceberg trade costs are
equal to 1 within    countries, (ÏChn,Chn = ÏU S,U S = 1). We assume domestic xed

costs of production are low enough to allow all rms to produce and set them to

fChn,Chn = fU EC,U EC = 2x10â6 .          We set the wage in each country equal to unity;

although this assumption appears strong, it simply implies that that the iceberg

and xed trade costs that we match to the data capture variation in wages as well

as trade costs. Although this assumption appears strong, it simply implies that


                                                  43
the iceberg and xed trade costs that we match to the data capture variation in

wages as well as trade costs.

    We jointly choose the remaining parameters  the log normal mean and stan-

dard deviation, the two iceberg trade costs (ÏChn,U EC and          ÏU EC,Chn ) and the ratios
of exporting to domestic xed costs (fChn,U EC and            fU EC,Chn )    to match the fol-

lowing features of the data: the 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentiles of

the distribution of exports among Chinese textile and clothing exporters, the share

of Chinese textile and clothing producers that export and the Chinese and U.S.

market shares of U.S. and Chinese textile and clothing consumption in 2005, re-

spectively. China's NBS production data reports that 44 percent of rms in the

textile and clothing sectors (Chinese Industrial Classications 17 and 18) exported

in 2005. The share exports accounted for by the {75th,90th,95th,99th,99.9th} per-

centiles of these exporters is {0.26,0.46,0.59,0.80,0.93}. According to textile and

clothing production and trade data in the Annual Survey and Chinese customs

data, respectively, the U.S. market share of Chinese textile and clothing (China

Industrial Classication codes 17 and 18) consumption is 1.2 percent. According to

the NBER Productivity Database, the Chinese market share of U.S. apparel and

textile consumption (NAICS codes 313, 314 and 315) is 13.1 percent. All data are

from 2005 because that is the rst post-quota year. The resulting parameters are

Âµ = 1.29, Î¸ = 0.58, ÏChn,U EC = 1.80, ÏU EC,Chn = 3.55, fChn,U EC /fChn,Chn = 1.15
and fU EC,Chn /fU EC,U EC = 1.15. The model matches the moments we target well:

The share exports accounted for by the {75th,90th,95th,99th,99.9th} percentiles

is {0.32,0.52,0.65,0.84,1}; 44 percent of the simulated Chinese rms export and

they have a 13.5 percent market share in the U.S.; and 8 percent of the simulated

U.S. rms export and have a 1.2 percent market share in China. The sum of the

squared deviations between model and data in percentage terms is 0.43.

    Finally, we need one more parameter, the quota restrictiveness, to solve the

ecient allocation simulation.        According to the data, the median growth of

Chinese exports of quota-restricted goods relative to unrestricted goods was 155

percent in 2005 relative to 2004. This implies a quota restrictiveness of 0.61 (1-
         34
1/2.55).

  34 This 155 percent growth rate is relative to quota-unconstrained textile and clothing exports
as well as to export growth of both types of exports in 2004, i.e., a triple dierence that is
explained in greater detail in Section 4.3.   We assume this measure of quota restrictiveness is
