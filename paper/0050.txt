I
        Since 1941, six Executive Orders have been issued forbidding

Federal government contractors from discriminating against minority

workers.' The latest and strongest Order, 11246, issued in 1965,

enjoins firms to take affirmative action in recruiting and promoting

minority workers. Contractor firms are required to abide by the Order

in all operations including those unrelated to the performance of

the contract. In principle, all prospective contractors are required

to demonstrate compliance with the law before a contract is let. The

potential penalties are severe: failure to comply with the law may

result in revocation of current coiitracts and suspension of the right

to bid on future contracts.

        Despite these provisions, doubts have been raised about the

effectiveness of the Orders. In part, these doubts are based on the

small size of the enforcement staff relative to the population of

potential violators.2 The division of responsibility between the

Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) and the staffs of the

various Federal departments weakens the enforcement effort. The Order

is imprecise as to the definition of "discrimination" and "affirmative

action." To heighten doubts, before 1971 no firm had its contract

revoked for noncompliance.

       Defenders of the Orders cite cases in which contract award

dates have been postponed until firms have taken steps toward compliance

with the law. Competition among contractors has led firms to adopt

affirmative action programs to improve their chances of winning contracts.

        In this paper, we investigate these competing claims using data

from 40,445 establishments sampled in 1966 and 1970. For this period,
                                 2



we find that the employment of black males relative to white

increased 3.3 percent more in firms with government contracts than In

firms without contracts. This comparison controls for the effect of

employment expansion, variation in the size of firms, and geographical

variation in the supply of labor. Using similar controls, we find

little evidence to support the view that the Orders have improved the

relative occupational distribution of black workers. We find strong

evidence that among segregated firms, contractors are more likely to

integrate than noncontractors.

        In the first section of this paper, we distinguish what can

be measured from what cannot. We develop a framework to measure and

interpret program effects. In the second section we discuss the

design of our sample and present results of an analysis of the random—

ness of this sample. In the third and concluding section, we present

the estimates and discuss their plausibility.

p                         I.   A Framework of Analysis



    a. What Is and Is Not Measured

            In this study, we attempt to measure the effect of Executive

    Order 11246 on the employment and occupational distribution of black

    males relative to white males in Federal contractor firms compared to

    identical relative measures for blacks innoncontractor firms. Before discussing

    specific indices, it is clarifying to consider a problem that plagues

    this, and other studies that seek to measure the effect of a program

    on its target population.3 Since we have a (two point) time series,

    a natural method for assessing the effectiveness of a program is to

    measure the change in a suitable index for target firms relative to

    the change in the index for the remaining firms. The basic problem

    is the absence of a control group in the presence of a program with

    economy—wide impact. Although a program may directly affect one

    group of firms, it also indirectly affects the remaining group of

    firms as well. Accordingly, comparisons of changes in the relative

    status of blacks in target and nontarget firms cannot be measured

    relative to what might have been in the absence of the program since

    that state is not observed. Thus, we cannot measure the contribution

    of the Executive Order to improvements in the aggregate relative

    status of blacks. Nonetheless, we can measure whether or not the

    contract compliance program has had any differential impact on the

    two types of firms.

            Consider an index of black male relative (to white male) status

    measured at time t, S. This index will be defined more precisely
                                            4



below, but for the purposes of the present discussion, it can be viewed        .
as an acceptable index of relative black male welfare. The proportionate

change in this index through time



                =   St
 (1)




affords a measure of trend in black economic status. The actual

behavior of St is to be distinguished from the hypothetical behavior

       that would have occurred in the absence of the program. Proportionate

movements in the hypothetical index

measure trends in relative black economic welfare in the absence of the
                                                                               S
program.

           Index I can be fruitfully decomposed into three components.

Denoting the relative status of blacks in contractor firms at time t by

       one measure of the change in relative black status in contractor

firms compared to the hypothetical change in the absence of a contract is



(3)        I =               —

            g
                     t—l


Assuming small changes, we may            write


(4)        in (1 + Ig) =                   in S —   A
                                 tg                     in S.

                                                                               .
                                                      5



I   Using obvious notation, a similar index for blacks in noncontractor
    firms may be written



    (5)     ln(i +                    1ng =       A       in S —   A   in S
                     Ing)

    If fraction G of black employment is in contractor firms, the observed

    total change in the relative position of blacks may be written as



    (6)     A in St =           A   in   sh   + G(A in S —     A       in S) + (l—G)(AlnS—AlnS)

                       =            in S1' + GI + (l—G)I
                                        t     g         ng


    Equivalently,



    (7)
            AlnStAlnS+G(AlnS_Ain5).

    Note that I      and I are meaningful only if black status would be the
               ng           g
    same in both contractor and noncontractor firms in the absence of a

    compliance program.

            The first component of equation (6) is the change that would

    occur in the absence of the program. We cannot measure this component,

    nor can we measure I or I                 .   We can measure the components of
                       G     ng
    equation (7). The first component of this equation is the change in

    relative black status in noncontractor firms. The second component

    measures the difference in the change in black status between

    contractor and noncontractor firms weighted by the proportion of

    black employment in contractor firms.
                                       6




        If contracts were randomly assigned to firms, a simple calcula-    .
 tion of mean changes in contractor and noncontractor firms would allow

us to estimate the two components of total change in equation (7).

Since random selection is unlikely, an alternative approach which is

pursued in this paper is to utilize regression techniques to standardize

for nonrandom changes in the indices for the two types of firms.

        We postulate the following relationship for firm k:



(8)       ln Stk      BXtk + ydk + Ctk



where dk is a dummy variable with a value of unity for firms holding a

government contract in the second period of the data, Xtk is a vector

of control variables, and         is a disturbance with the classical

properties. Estimates of "y", weighted by G, yield an estimate of the

second component of equation (7).

        The available data put substantial restrictions on the way in

which the quantity S may be measured. Since we do not have wage data,

we must use more approximate measures of black relative economic status.

First, consider the index of occupational position for black workers

whose logarithm is defined by



(9)     ln °b =    E(B./B)   ln P..,




where B./B is the fraction of all black workers in the jth occupation

and in P. is the logarithm of the mean salary of all workers in the

jth occupation. °b is nothing more than the (geometric) mean salary
                                             7



I   that   would be received by black workers if they were paid the average

    wage a white worker within the occupation is paid. °b therefore

    reflects only variation in the occupational distribution of black

    workers and is nothing more than a method for summarizing the information

    available on that distribution. If we define O as the occupational

    distribution index for white workers, one possible measure of the

    quantity S is the ratio Ob/O. The disadvantage in using this measure

    is that it does not reflect the relative number of black workers in an

    establishment. An alternative measure of S is (B/W)(Ob/O), which

    corrects for this deficiency. (B/W)(Ob/Ow) is the ratio of the total

    compensation of black workers to the total compensation of white workers

    that would be received if black and white workers were paid the mean

    salary that is paid to all workers in each occupation. Defining

    S =                   it follows that in S may be decomposed according to
           (B/W)(Ob/Ow)


              in S =
    (10)
                          in(0b/0)    + ln(B/W)


                     =    [(B./B)    in P. — E(W./W) in P.,] + in (B/W)


                     =               — (W./W)J in P. + in B/W,



    so that for      in S we have



    (ii)         in S =     E[B./B    —   W./W] in P. + (ln B —   in   W).




              Thus, we decompose the relative wage share into components of

    interest in their own right, and perform a separate regression analysis
                                       8




for    each component. We estimate a separate coefficient for the dummy
                                                                            .
"presence of government contract" for each occupation, and for the

relative employment equation. Assuming J occupations, and letting y.

be the coefficient of the dummy for occupation j, and letting 1E be

the coefficient of the dummy in the relative employment equation,


           J
(12)            y. ln      ÷
          j=l

measures the estimated average difference In the ratio of the payroll

of blacks to the payroll of whites between firms with a government

contract and those without, holding other factors constant.

          If        is positive and statistically significant, government

contracts induce greater relative employment of black males. [f y. is

positive and significant, the presence of a government contract alters

the occupational distribution of black workers relative to white workers

towards greater relative concentration of blacks in occupation j in

contractor firms. The measured occupational shift may arise for

several reasons: internal promotion within existing labor forces,

lateral occupational moves between contractor and noncontractor sectors,

and nonlatera]. moves between sectors.

          If internal promotion is the only factor at work the expression


                     J
                =         y.lnP.
                    j=l


measures the differential shift in contractor firms, as compared to

noncontractor firms, in the difference between the geometric mean of the
                                     9




black male wage distribution and the geometric mean of the white male

wage distribution. Thus         is a measure of differential promotion rates

of blacks relative to whites between contractor and noncontractor firms.

        Reshuffling of workers between contractor and noncontractor

sectors obscures this measure. A lateral occupational move of a

black from the noncontractor sector to the contractor sector does not

contribute to the improvement of the black workforce that existed before

the contract was let. Accordingly, on this score we cannot strictly inter-

pret I as a relative measure of advancement of black workers. Nonethe-

less, since ma competitive labor market sectoral transfers occur only if

wages are raised in contractor firms, a statistically significant

gives indirect evidence of a rise in black wages relative to white

wages in occupation j   for   contractor firms.

        Nonlateral reshuffling between contractor and noncontractor

firms has the same unmeasured wage effect. In addition, there is a

promotion (or retardation) effect if the transfer of blacks relative to

the transfer of whites to contractor firms alters pre—transfer

differences between black and white occupational distributions within

contractor firms. If the regression equations are properly specified,

this source of movement in the index I measures the effect of

occupational advancement (or retardation) through transfer.

        Of these three sources, only lateral shuffling creates ambiguity

in interpretation. Since we cannot measure the magnitude of the changes

due to each source, we cannot measure the importance of this

component in contributing to the measured total movement of the index.

However, if it is small, the index I weighted by the proportion of
                                           10



 post   program black employment in government contractor firms measures
                                                                                   .
the direct contribution of the contract compliance program to relative

black occupational advancement.



b. Specification of the Regression Relationships

          The literature on the employment dynamics of the firm suggests that

fixity in factors causes firms to gradually adjust current levels and
                                                                        composi-

tion of employment to long—run target levels. We incorporate this idea into

the re2ression eouations and make the further assumption of
                                                              separability
between the dynamic system generating firm racial occupational

differentials and the equation generating relative employment.

          To simplify the notation, we supress subscripts for individual

firms. Let O be a J x 1. vector where the jth row is the difference

in the proportions of the black and white forces in occupationj for

year t, i.e.,


                     B.           W.
                 —      tj         tj
           tj        Bt


A firm's adjustment system may be written as



(13)         —               =         —
                 °t—l            A(0

where A is a J x J matrix of partial adjustment coefficients and
                                                                   0
is the long—run level of occupational differentials.

          This relationship is exact if firm cost functions for movement

to equilibrium, and for persistence in disequilibrium are quadratic and
                                            11


I
    if the target level, O, does not depend on the costs of adjustment.
    Otherwise, the adjustment function may be viewed as an approximation

    to the true process of adjustment. Allowing A to be a general matrix,

    we explicitly incorporate the notion of interrelated adjustment

    processes introduced into the literature by Nadiri and Rosen.4

            The jth component of O is given by



    (14) O =              +   y.d



    where, as before, d is one If a firm         has   a government contract and is

    zero otherwise. A common set of K variables, 'tX", is assumed to

    determine all occupational differentials. With this specification, we

    may rewrite equation (13) as



    (15)    Ut —          =   A   X —   A i'd — A 0t—l +
                   °t—l


    where c is a Jxl vector of disturbances, X is a matrix with J identical

    columns of the Kxl X vector, and is a JxK matrix whose rows are the

       vectors for each of the J relationships, j=1,. .         . ,j.   "i" is a vector

    whose jth element is the coefficient of the dummy variable for the jth

    long—run relationship. "As" and ltArt are the short—run coefficients.

            Since Ut is a column vector of differences in proportions, the

    sum of the elements of Ut must be zero (i.e., if I is a Jxl vector of

    unit elements, i'U =      U   for all t). This arithmetic relationship

    induces an exact linear dependency among the °tl regressors. By

    omitting one row of Ut—i' we can avoid exact multicollinearity among
                                         12



 the    regressors. Less obviously, we can delete any one of the J
                                                                           .
 equations and estimate both short—run coefficients (A and A) and

 long—run coefficients ( and     F').5


           The equation for relative employment is specified in the same

 fashion. Only one lagged dependent variable is involved, and

 complications from proportionate dependent variables are avoided. The

regression specification becomes



                             =
 (16)
           () t — ()                 + A      —
                                                  A() t—l + u
                       t—l


The same control variables are used as those in equation (15). "ut" is

a disturbance with the classical properties. "d" is a dummy variable

indicating presence of a government contract.

           To control for variations in local labor market conditions,

regional measures of firm location are included in the X vector. In

addition,, firm size variables are introduced to control the effect of

variation in technology and the efficiency of management. Measures

of firm growth and decline are used to separate the expansionary

effect of government contracts, from the compositional effect which is

the focus of this study.

          In our data, there are many firms with no black workers. This

forces us to confine our estimation of equations (15) and (16) to firms

with at least one black worker in both sample years, and is an important

limitation of our proposed decomposition.

          However, we can utilize the remaining data to investigate the

effect of government contract compliance programs on firm integration.
                                                                           I
                                        13


p   Since the complete absence of blacks is easily detected, it is likely

    that among a group of firms initially segregated in 1966, more government

    contractor firms will be integrated in 1970 than noncontractor firms.

    By estimating equations which determine the probability of integration

    in 1970, we test this hypothesis.

                                 The Data



        Since 1966, all firms with one hundred employees or more, and

all firms with a government contract, are required to file a report on

the status of their employment by-race and sex for each of the nine

broad Census occupational categories. These reports are collected by

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and placed on magnetic

tapes (the EEO—l tapes). From these annual samples, it Is possible to

utilize firm identification numbers and geographical codes to match

establishments in successive years. This paper utilizes a matched

sample of 40,445 such establishments which filed reports in 1966 and

1970.

        The basic dilemma in matching EEO—l reports for two different

years for a given economic unit is that as we take greater care to

ensure that the two economic units we match are similar in the two

years, we are less likely to complete a successful match. There is

thus a basic trade—off between accuracy of the match and the size of

the sample. On the one hand, we are interested in careful matching

so that the characteristics of firms that are difficult to control in

a single cross—section can be controlled by examining the changes from

one period to another for firms that maintain the same values of the

uncontrolled characteristics. On the other hand, some characteristics

of virtually all firms change between one period and another, and we do

not want to reduce the size of the matched sample because of minor

changes that are probably of little relevance to the analysis.

                                                                          .

I
           The most basic characteristics on which it is hypothetically

    possible to match EEO—l reports are the employer identification

    number (El), assigned by the Social Security Administration, and zip

    coded address. As it turned out, the 1966 data did not, in fact,

    contain zip codes, although the 1970 data did. It was thus not possible

    to use a matching device based on this characteristic.

            The procedure we adopted was based on the existence of the

    appropriate data, although it can be argued on some grounds that it

    was a good procedure on its own. Our first step was to aggregate the

    reports for 1966 and 1970 by E.I. number and county. This resulted in

    the 117,579 reports filed in 1966 being reduced to 98,655 aggregated

    units, and the 126,686 reports filed in 1970 being reduced to 96,244

    aggregated units (hereafter, "aggregates"). Of these two sets of

    aggregaged units we were able to find 40,445 aggregated units that

    were common to both years.

            The matched sample of aggregated units was thus about forty

    percent of all units in the two years. In some ways, however, this is

    an underestimate of the extent of success of the matching process

    because the successfully matched units tended to be significantly

    larger than the unmatched units in the two years. Thus, in 1966 the

    98,655 aggregated units represented 25.6 million employees and in 1970

    the 96,244 aggregated units represented 28.5 million employees. The

    40,445 matched units represented approximately 18.6 million employees,

    however, which is 65 percent of all employees covered. Thus, when the

    standard of comparison is the extent of employment in the matched units

    the success of the matching system is somewhat more impressive.

           Still,   it is of substantial importance to know the reasons for
                                                                              .
 the failure to match more of the aggregated units than the number

 indicated. First, if there is some systematic factor at work, knowledge

 concerning it might be helpful in designing a method to secure a more

complete match in future work. Second, it is important to understand

the consequences of any systematic factor at work so as to be able to

analyze its effects on the sample's bias.

          The ideal method for examining the causes of mismatching would

be to take a random sample of the units that were not matched in each

year and determine the cause for a mismatch in each case. From these

data it would be possible to estimate the fraction of mismatched cases

due to the variety of factors that may cause a mismatch.6      In practice

this ideal procedure was unavailable because of constraints of both

time and resources. Given the importance of the problem, however, it

seemed essential to obtain at least some idea of the causes of non—

response, and so we pursued the problem in the following crude manner.

We first chose a single county to examine in more detail using the

criterion that it be inexpensive to query the unmatched firms in the

county. Mercer County in New Jersey was chosen for this purpose

because of its representative nature regarding industry and minority

groups.

          There were approximately 180 aggregate units in Mercer County

subject to analysis in 1966 and 1970. Of these, 103, or 57 percent of

the aggregate units were mismatched, which is significantly higher than

the 40 percent matched nationwide. Tables 1 and 2 list the largest of

the unmatched units in 1960 and 1970 respectively, along with their

total employment.

p            We   contacted some of the larger firms on each list to see if

    we could determine why they had not been matched. As it turned out,

    the causes could be grouped under three categories: (a) natural

    causes, (b) errors, and (c) identification problems.

             The three major natural factors causing an inability to match

    were:. closing or opening of a new establishment, a decline or increase

    in size between the two years so that the obligation to file an EEO—1

    form changed, and mergers. For example, Princeton Inn with 166

    employees in 1966 closed its doors between 1966 and 1970, so that it

    did not appear in the data for 1970; Yellow Cab Co. with 125 employees

    in 1966 declined in size to fewer than 100 employees in 1970 so that

    it no longer had an obligation to file in 1970. Likewise, Gino's of

    New Jersey with 119 employees in 1970 had grown to over 100 employees

    between 1966 and 1970 so that it had an obligation to file in 1970 but

    not in 1966. Finally, First Trenton Bank with 422 employees in 1966

    merged with another bank between 1966 and 1970 so that it no longer

    existed as a separate entity. Clearly, each of these cases represents

    a situation where the normal growth, decline, and consolidation of firms

    results in some firms appearing in one year but not in another. Aside

    from changes in reporting requirements, not much could have been done

    to match records for firms affected by these factors.

             Errors in reporting also accounted for some of the failure to

    match firms. In some cases errors were due to the firms themselves,

    in other cases the errors were a result of changes in reporting systems

    from one year to another, and in still other cases it is not possible

I   to   determine the source of the error. For example, Mercer Hospital
                                   20



has apparently reported every year except 1970 when its EEO—l form
                                                                   was
                                                                          .
never filed due to a new computerized data processing system that was

installed that year and did not function correctly. The most disturbing

unmatched item in Tables 1 and 2 is surely New Jersey Bell Telephone

Co. —Trenton, with 4,617 employees in 1966. This unmatched item is

apparently due to a limitation in the matching program that resulted

from the fact that the Bell System reported on a statewide basis in

1966, but on a county basis in 1970. It was thus not possible to match

the same units in the two years. Only those reporting units using a

consistent system from year to year would be susceptible of a match

using the scheme outlined above. Finally, Dow Jones Co. and New Jersey

Department of Health, Trenton, apparently reported in both years with

the same name and El number, although their 1970 reports did not appear
                                                                          S
on our data tapes. We can only conclude that these reports were either

lost or miscoded at some point.

        A final cause of mismatching was the problem of identifying

firms with a unique El number. The Social Security Administration,

which is responsible for administering the El numbering system, has

assigned 10,000 to 12,000 more El numbers than there are firms. Thus,

a single firm may have more than one El number and may report using

different El numbers in different years. It is for precisely this

reason that American Biltrite Rubber and National Sponge Cushion appear

in both Tables 1 and 2, even though we report them as being unmatched.

Each of these companies has more than one El number and each reported

under different El numbers in the two years 1966 and 1970. Since the

El number is one of the criteria for matching, this made it impossible

to match these particular firms.
                                       21


I           Such a limited sampling is not adequate, of course, for making

    detailed estimates of the proportion of our unmatched firms that are

    accounted for by natural causes as against the proportion that are

    accounted for by errors and identification problems. From our limited

    experience, however, we would guess that perhaps 30 to 60 percent of

    the unmatched aggregate units are due to errors or improper identifica-

    tion, while the remainder are due to the natural changes in establish-

    ments over any four—year period.

            In order to explore more systematically the results of the

    matching process we computed the multiple regression listed in Table 3.

    The purpose of this regression is to provide a systematic summary of

    the differences in the industrial, regional and other characteristics

    of aggregates as between those that were and were not matched. We

    pooled all of the 96,244 aggregates for 1966 and 1970 and created a

    dummy dependent variable that took on the value unity if the aggregate

    fell in the matched sample of firms and zero if it did not. The

    independent variables are sets of industrial, regional, and other

    dummy variables. The industrial variables are the set of nine listed

    in Table 3 plus a deleted variable for agriculture, fisheries, and

    forestry. The regression coefficients are thus interpreted as the

    difference between the industry listed in the table and the deleted

    industry in the probability that an aggregate from that industry was

    matched, holding the other characteristics in the table constant. For

    example, Table 3 indicates that holding other things constant, an

    aggregate in durable manufacturing was .403 more likely to be matched

    than an aggregate in agriculture. Likewise, an aggregate in durable

 manufacturing was .062 (= .403 — .341) more likely of being matched       .
 than an aggregate in nondurable manufacturing.7   There are also ten

 regional variables, with the fifth deleted. The precise lists of states

 in each region are presented in the key following Table 3 and is based

 on the first digit of the zip codes for the aggregates. As before, a

 regression coefficient is interpreted as the estimated difference

between the region examined and the deleted region in the probability

 that an aggregate was matched, holding other things constant. The

remaining variables are dummy variables for whether the firm was inside

an SMSA, for whether it had a government contract, and for its size

class.

         As can be seen from Table 3, the most important determinant of

whether an aggregate was matched seems to be its size. Firms with

fewer than 100 employees were .21 less likely to be matched than firms

with 100 to 500 employees. Likewise, firms with over 500 employees

were .17 more likely to be matched than firms with 100 to 500 employees.

This result is probably not very surprising given that employer size is

an important determinant of whether a firm must report in any year.

It suggests that the natural growth and decline of the smaller firms

may be an important determinant of the extent of success of the matching

process, a result previously discussed. Firms inside SMSA's are also

more likely to be matched than firms outside SMSA's, but the size of

this effect is not very large. Perhaps more important, firms with

government contracts are .065 more likely of being matched than firms

without them. It would be interesting to know the extent to which this

difference reflects the fact that government contractors have more

p
    stringent   reporting requirements and the extent to which it reflects

    greater care by government contractors in meeting given reporting

    requirements. The regional differences do not tend to be very large,

    and their direction may be surprising to some readers. For one thing,

    there is no obvious tendency for the matching to be less successful in

    Southern than in Northern states. Although in simple tabulations there

    is substantially less matching in the South than the North, this

    apparently results from the failure to hold constant industry, size of

    firm, etc. Second, the midwestern states tend to be those where the

    matching was poorest, although the differences involved are not dramatic.

    Finally, as we have already noted there are some fairly large differences

    in the extent of match by industry. Both agriculture and public

    administration were industry groups where the matching was especially

    poor, but the finance, insurance, and real estate industry group was

    also notably less successful than other industry groups. The most

    successful matching was in durable and nondurable manufacturing.

    Given the few sizable differentials we have noted, however, the remainder

    of the industry groups do not differ very much in the success of the

    match.

             It is clear from these results that the aggregates in our

    matched sample are not a random sample of the aggregates we created

    from the 1966 and 1970 data. If they were, there would be no significant

    differences between the matched and unmatched samples of firms associated

    with region, industry, etc. That is, region, industry, and the other

    variables in Table 3 would not have a significant effect on the probability

    of a match. In fact, these variables have a statistically significant
                                    26



 effect.   At the same time, it would be
                                           easy to exaggerate both the size
                                                                              .
 of the effect that these variables have on the probability of
                                                                  matching
 and their importance in
                           demonstrating bias. As we have seen, most
 of the effects of the variables in Table 3 on the probability of
                                                                  a
 match can be explained by the variable effect of the reporting

 requirements on whether a firm filed a report in both 1966 and 1970.

Thus, the natural consequence of firms
                                           growing and declining about the
100 employee reporting requirement is to induce substantial
                                                               variability
in the extent to which some
                              employers file reports in both years, and
thus in the probability of a match. On the other hand, the differences

in probability of matching by region and industry that we found, and

which would be much more difficult
                                     to explain by reference to the

reporting requirements, are relatively small. In the absence of any

further evidence, therefore, it seems very likely that the most

important systematic determinant of the non—random character of the

matching is the basic reporting requirements. If this is the case,

inferences drawn from our matched sample may not be too different from

inferences that would have been drawn from the whole population of

EEO—l reports.

                     III. Empirical Results



a. Estimates of the Components of the Relative Wage Bill

        In this section, we report results from estimating equations

(15) and (16). Before presenting the estimates, it is useful to extend

the discussion in Section II to consider potential sources of bias

that may affect our estimates.

        One source is due to improper measurement of the government

contract variables. Since the time the first draft of this paper was

written, further study has shown that many firms listed as noncontractors

in fact were contractors.8 Establishments associated with finns

doing government contract work in other establishments frequently did

not report themselves as contractors. Yet, as noted in the introduction,

all plants of a government contractor firm are liable to the provisions

of Executive Order 11246. Since geographically disparate units of the

same firm are treated as separate data points in our analysis, this

source of bias is severe if central managements impose uniform policies

in all plants.

        However, it is unlikely that uniform policies are applied to

all establishments. Indeed, it is this presumption which led us to

treat separate geographical units as distinct data points. Nonetheless,

if government contractors advance blacks at a greater rate than

noncontractors, estimates of the government contract effort are biased

downwards, and degrees of freedom are overstated to the extent that

uniform policies apply to some firms. Given the size of the sample

and the number of separate f inns, the potential problem with degrees

of freedom is unlikely to be important.
                                    28



         Similarly,   potential contractors and recent contractors not
                                                                          .
 listed as contractors in 1970 are expected to be like measured govern-

ment contractors in all but name. Our inability to identify such firms

 leads to a downward bias if these firms have taken affirmative action.

        There are a host of other biases about which we have much less

 to say. Since reports are filed by the firm, contractor firms are

more likely to exaggerate their compliance effort in order to avoid

embarrassing investigations. If this is the case, an upward bias is

imparted to our estimates of contract effects. However, it is by no

means obvious that this effect applies only to contractor firms. Since

noncontractor firms with employment less than one hundred are not

required to report, it Is likely that the sample of noncontractors

includes a biased selection of firms which have taken steps toward

affirmative action, or at least are willing to say they have.

        Another potential source of bias comes from restricting our

sample to establishments with at least one black worker. This restric-

tion is dictated by our choice of the decomposition of the relative

wage bill. If contractor firms Initially without black workers contri-

bute to decisive gains in the aggregate relative occupational distri-

bution through faster promotion rates, our estimate of the effect of

the compliance progress understates the true effect of the program on

the mean difference in occupational distributions of blacks and whites

between contractor and noncontractor firms. Unfortunately, it is not

possible to determine the importance of this effect. Moreover, it is

equally possible to imagine that the unmeasured firms are more sluggish

in their affirmative action programs than are measured firms.

        Our estimates of equations (15) and (16) are reported in

Table 4. The first column reports the relative employment equation.

The second column is the (log earnings) weighted sum of the detailed

occupational results recorded in columns 3—il. Long—run values,

estimated from the scheme of Appendix A, are presented below the

standard errors for the estimated coefficients. A convenient summary

of these results is reported in Table 5.

        In this table we record both long—run and short—run coefficients

for the dummy variables indicating presence of a government contract.

Line 1 contains the estimated difference between the percentage change

in the employment of black male workers and the percentage change in the

employment of white male workers as between firms with and without a

government contract, holding other factors constant. According to

this estimate, black male employment increased by 3.3 percent more

relative to white male employment in firms with government contracts

than in firms without them, and this difference is statistically

significant. The long—run estimate is 12.9 percent. Lines 2 through 10

contain the percentage point differences between firms with and without

government contracts in the change in the percentage of black workers

minus the percentage of white workers in each of the nine occupational

categories available in the EEO—l reporting system data. By definition

these nine percentage point changes must sum to zero, since an increase

in the percentage of black (or white) workers in one occupation implies

a decrease in the percentage of black (or white) workers in some other

occupation. In effect, the estimated coefficients In lines 2—10 of

column 2 of Table 5 tell us how the incremental employment of black

I   workers over white workers in firms with government contracts reflected
    in line 1 was distributed by occupation. As can be seen from the table,

    the largest positive difference between those firms with and without

    government contracts fell in the operative category. To offset this

    positive difference, the change in the relative percentage of black

    workers in the service worker category was smaller among government

    contractors. The other positive coefficients in the table are for

    technicians, clerical workers, salesmen, and laborers, although the

    former are marginally insignificant statistically and the latter are

    essentially zero. The other negative coefficients in the table are

    for the managerial, professional, and craft occupations, although only

    the former two are statistically significant. Except for a reversal

    of sign in the case of craftsmen, the long—run effects preserve the

    same pattern as the short—run effects, but are algebraically larger.

            In sum, the basic results of Table 5 indicate that the presence

    of a government contract in a firm was associated with a statistically

     significant and larger increase in the employment of black workers

     relative to white workers than was the case in the firms without

     government contracts. The increase in the relative employment of black

    workers increased their representation compared to white workers

     primarily in the operative occupation, and decreased their relative

     representation primarily in the service and professional occupations.

           Table 6 summarizes the estimated overall quantitative impact of the

     pressure of governmental efforts to increase the portion of black male

     workers relative to white male workers. According to these results,

     in the short run the governmental effort increased the employment of

    black   workers relative to white workers by 1.7 percent while in the

    long run the increase is 6.4 percent. In contractor firms, the occupa-

    tional position of black workers relative to white workers increased

    by .1 percent while it is expected to decrease by .2 percent in the

    long run. Thus, the governmental effort increased the wage share by

    1.8 percent over the 1966 to 1970 period, while this increase is

    expected to rise to 6.4 percent in the long run.

              It is possible to briefly summarize the effects of the other

    variables we examined on the employment and occupational position of

    black male workers relative to white male workers. The sets of

    variables we examined were a set of regional dummy variables, a variable

    equal to unity if the firm was located inside a Standard Metropolitan

    Statistical Area, a set of variables representing the size in total

    employment (in 1970) of the firm, a set of variables representing the

    change in total male employment in each of the nine occupational

    categories, and the 1966 (lagged) relative position of black workers

    in the firm. We first describe the estimated effects of these variables

    on the employment of black male workers relative to white male workers

    and then the estimated effects of these variables on the relative

    occupational position of black workers. As we have observed previously,

    the sum of these two effects is the estimated effect of the variable

    on the relative share of black wages.

              Region appears to be the most important factor associated with

    relative employment increases for black workers. In particular, the

    relative employment of black workers increased by 20 percent more in

    the North Central region of the U.S. than in the South, and by about
                                  38




 18 and 26 percent more than in the Northeast
                                              or West. Second, there is
                                                                           .
 no indication that black relative employment changes were significantly

 related to size of firm. Third, the rate of growth of employment of

 the firm was negatively related to changes in the relative employment

 of black workers, although the size of this effect was very small.

 Finally, the growth over 1966 to 1970 in the relative employment of

black workers was smaller in firms where the 1966 ratio of black to

white employment was highest.

        Just as region of location was an important determinant of the

change in the relative employment of black workers, it was also an

important determinant of the change in the relative occupational

position of black workers. In particular, the relative occupational

position of black workers increased by 1.4 percent less in the North

Central region than in the South, and by 2.2 and 1.9 percent less than

in the Northeast or West. This suggests that the relative employment

increases of black workers in the North Central region were a result

of the migration of black workers from the South. If these migrants

were from the lower paying occupational categories in the South, then

their migration would by definition increase the relative occupational

distribution of black workers in the South and decrease their average

relative position in the North Central region so long as the in—migrants

were in lower paying occupations than the workers already in the North

Central region. Second, the relative occupational position of black

workers increased significantly less in firms inside of SMSA's than

in firms outside SMSA's. Third, there was little relationship between

firm size and changes in the relative occupational position of black
                                       39


I
    workers.    Fourth, the change in the relative occupational position of

    black workers was greater the greater the growth of employment in the

    middle level occupations, i.e., sales, clerical, craft, and operative

    workers. On the other hand, the growth in the relative occupational

    position of black workers was smaller the greater was the growth In

    employment of workers in the highest or lowest paying occupations,

    I.e., professionals, managers, or laborers. Finally, the increase in

    the relative occupational position of black workers was smaller the

    greater the relative occupational position of black workers in the

    firm in 1966.



    b. Integration Effects

               The analysis to this point has been performed for only those

    firms that contained at least one black and one white employee in

    both 1966 and 1970.      Since black workers make up only one—eighth

    of the population, many firms would not be expected to be "integrated"

    in this sense.      In fact, of the 40,445 firms in the sample,

    only 24,535 contained at least one black and one white male worker.

    It is of some interest, therefore, to know what effect the overall

    government effort to increase the relative position of black workers

    has had on these firms.      In order to examine this question we

    have estimated linear probability functions using data for those

    firms that had no black male worker in 1966 and in which the dependent

    variable equals unity if the firm contained at least one male black

    worker in 1970, and Is zero otherwise. Table 7 reports the results of

S   this   analysis for total establishment integration as well as detailed
Table   7.   Estimated regression equations determining the probability that a firm with no black workers in 1966
             employed at least one black worker in 1970. Dependent variable is one if a firm integrated in the
             given occupation reported in the column, zero otherwise.

occupational integration. Since the linear probability model is known
                                                                             S
to suffer from important statistical limitations, we computed estimates

of these equations using the logit model on a subsample of firms.    These

results, reported in Appendix C, demonstrate that If the true integration

probability process Is governed by a logistic disturbance, the linear

probability model provides a reliable guide to the true effects of a

government program.

        Table 8 lists the estimated effect of the presence of a government

contract on the probability that a firm that was not integrated in 1966

was integrated in 1970. Integration may be defined for the firm as a

whole, and this result is reported in line 1 of the table, or for

each of the separate occupations, and these results are reported in

lines 2—10. As can be seen from the table, the probability was .09

larger that a firm that was not integrated in 1966 would be integrated

in 1970 if the firm had a government contract. The results for the

separate occupations are similar, and in all cases statistically

significant. These results imply that the presence of the overall

government effort significantly increased the extent of Integration In

American industry. Even if the increase in the employment of black

workers is relatively small In each firm so affected, there is a

substantial number of firms Involved so that this effect may not appear

so small when taken in the aggregate.

                               Summary
                                                                            .
        We have used detailed records from the Equal Employment Oppor-

 tunity tapes for a matched sample of firms in 1966 and 1970 to estimate

 the extent to which the change in the position of black male workers

relative to white male workers was greater among firms with contracts

with the Federal government than among firms without such contracts.

Since all of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance efforts to

improve the relative position of black workers operate on firms with

Federal contracts, and since the EEOC's efforts are presumably more

successful with such firms, we concentrate on this issue because it

presumably gives us some indication of the overall impact of government

efforts on changes in the relative position of black workers.

        First, we find that the relative employment of black male workers

increased by 3.3 percent more over the period 1966 to 1970 in firms with

government contracts than in firms without government contracts, and

that this difference is statistically significant. The long—run effect

is estimated to be 12.9 percent. Second, we find that in the short run

the relative occupational position of black male workers increased by

.2 percent more in firms with government contracts than in firms without

contracts, but that this difference is not statistically significant.

In the long run, a .4 percent decrease is expected.

        The most important factor affecting the change in the relative

position of black male workers in these data appears to be the migration

of black workers to the North Central region of the U.S. The employment

of black workers relative to white workers increased by approximately
                                    45



I   20 percent more in the North Central region than in any other region of

    the country. This migration also resulted in a smaller rate of increase

    in the relative occupational position of black male workers in the North

    Central region than in any other region, and undoubtedly resulted

    because the migration of workers was from the lowest paying occupational

    categories. This presumably increased the growth in the relative

    occupational position of black male workers outside the North Central

    region and decreased this growth inside that region.

            Finally, we have investigated the factors that affected the

    probability that a firm with no black male worker in 1966 would have

    hired at least one such worker by 1970. We find that the probability

    that a firm that was not "integrated" in this sense in 1966 was

    integrated in 1970 was nearly .1 percent higher in 1970 among firms

    with government contracts than in firms without them.

                                APPENDIX   A



        Using the notation of Section La, In the text,



        i(O —               =   ='1         X + 1' A r   d —   ' A °t—l   + '


where I is a Jxl vector with unit elements. Thus, for
                                                                general X, d,

        I' A r =       0
and
        i'A     =      0.



This Implies that knowledge of the coefficients of any J — 1 equations

automatically gives the coefficients of the omitted equation. Note

further that since


        ' t—l      =   0


we may replace the regressors       with O, a J—lxl vector. For
convenience suppose the final element of the
                                                 vector, (Or_i ),Is removed.
The choice of the element to be removed Is inessential.         Letting

    Since i'O = 0, it is clear that

    where is is a Jxl unity vector. This implies that we may use precisely

    the same reasoning as in the previous paragraph to write

where O, O, and                  are the original vectors with the final

element removed.

            In general, the matrix in brackets is nonsingular, and estimable.

Accordingly, we can estimate                      and rA. Using equations (A—3), we

estimate $ and r. Note, however, that A is not estimable without

further information. Note further that while the variance—covariance

matrix of the original system is singular, in the reduced system this

complication is avoided. Thus we have shown that knowledge of any J—l

short—run equations is sufficient to determine both short—run and

long—run coefficients for the control variables and the government

contract variable. Stability of the reduced system of equations

implies stability of the original system. Since the characteristic

roots of the adjustment matrix presented in Table 4 are all less than

one in modulus, the complete system is stable.

                                 APPENDIX B




             The previous appendix shows that estimates of A, the adjustment

    matrix, are not needed to estimate long—run coeeficients. Nonetheless,

    if estimates are available, they provide an additional check on:the

    model. Implausibly low rates of adjustment, or implausible orderings

    or rates of adjustment will cast doubt on our estimates. Specificity

    of training, and length of the training period should cause slower

    rates of adjustment in the more skilled occupations.

             Without further information, it is impossible to estimate A.

    One restriction, overly strong, that will provide identification is the

I   assumption of symmetry for A. A weaker restriction, consistent with
    symmetry, is the assumption that



    (A—5)    Ai =    0,


    where i is a Jxl vector of ones, with J being the number of occupations.

    Since we know that the dependent variable in the J equations must be

    zero,




    (A—6)    i'A =   0.



    It Is easy to verify that If A Is symmetric, and the last equation

    applies, then the previous equation applies as well. It is also easy

    to verify that restriction (A—5) allows estimation of A from [A—Ci'].

          The empirical results are presented in Table A—i.
                                                                 Reading
                                                                             .
 down the rows for a given column gives the coefficient on the lagged

difference in proportion for the dependent variable designated in the row.

 Casual inspection of the table shows that the matrix is remarkably

 "close" to symmetry despite the fact that symmetry is not an implication

of assumption (A—5). Letting A.. be the element of A in the ith row

and jth column, one index of the departure of the matrix from full

symmetry is




                      (Xi. —

                i#j

where N is the number of distinct off diagonal elements in the A matrix

if A is symmetric. The value of the index is .0342 which indicates a

small average deviation from symmetry.

         Reading down the diagonal, the own adjustment coefficient tends

to increase as the skill level decreases,
                                            suggesting that adjustments

to final equilibrium are slower for more highly skilled occupations.

This result is consistent with prior notions on the adjustment rates

of fixed factors. Nonetheless, the implied rates of adjustment seem

slow, especially when a four year time period separates the dependent

variable and its lagged value. First order serial correlation in the

disturbances of equations (15) will tend to depress the estimated rates

of adjustment. Moreover, serial correlation will tend to impart

symmetry in the estimated A matrix. Since we have only two points in

time, we cannot test for serial correlation in a distributed lag model.

Nonetheless, we conjecture that a lag model is appropriate, although

serial correlation may be present as well. It would be an unlikely

coincidence to find that the ordering of own adjustment coefficients

is so closely in accord with theory if serial correlation were the

only factor leading to significant coefficients on the lagged variables.

         In   the text, we present empirical results on the effect of

contractor status on the racial integration of firms. The analysis is

performed using the linear probability model which is known to suffer

from important defects.9

         Accordingly, it is of interest to compare results from this

conceptually defective but computationally effective method with results

from a more attractive statistical model. The logistic model is known

to possess a likelihood function which possesses sufficient statistics,

Thus, it is possible to compute efficient and consistent estimates of the

probability of integration.

         Since the logistic technique is computationally more expensive,

we randomly selected a 10 percent sample of the firms used to compute

the results from the linear probability model. Those results are

reported in Table A—2. The rows in this table correspond to the columns

of Table 7 in the text.

         For our purposes, the most appropriate comparison is between

the coefficient on the variable "government contract" in the linear

probability model, presented on line 4 within each group, and the

implied probability from the logistic model, presented on line 3. Both

results are computed from the identical subsample of 1420 firms. The

estimates from the two models are quite close, indicating that the

results reported in the text may be taken as good approximations to a

more theoretically desirable econometric model.

        1. The material in the introduction draws heavily from

Chapter 4 of R. P. Nathan's excellent Jobs and Civil Rights, prepared

for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Clearinghouse Publication

No. 16, April, 1969.

        2.   It has been estimated that in March 1967 there were 228

fuiltime professional contract compliance personnel in all government

agencies except the OFCC to investigate 225,000 contractor facilities.

CR. Nathan, op. cit., p. 113.)

        3. Readers familiar with the work of H. G. Lewis reported in

Unionism and Relative Wages, Chicago, 1963, will recognize the similarity

in Lewis' methodology and our own.

National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1974.

        5. Adiscussionof this point is giveninAppendix A. Witha fairly

mild assumption, It is possible to estimate A as well. This provides a

further check on the model. These results are reported in Appendix B.

        6. This would also be a desirable project to undertake for

the entire universe of firms, since it has been estimated that perhaps

only three—fourths of the firms obligated to submit an EEO—l form

actually do so. A periodic audit of a random sample of firms whose

EEO—l forms have not been tabulated would produce estimates of the

causes for non—response in the overall universe of obligated firms and

might have the additional benefit of producing a higher response rate

in the longer run.

         7.   We are thus treating the results in Table 3 as a linear
                                                                            .
probability function. There are well known statistical problems that

arise from using this procedure. As is also well known, the same

computational results may be interpreted as a linear discriminant

function. Under this interpretation a simple transformation of the

coefficients in Table 3 would make them the weights in a function

that would allow us to predict which of two populations an item had

come from, the matched or unmatched groups. In some ways the linear

discriminant function would be a better way to interpret the computations

in Table 3 for the problem we are examining here.

        8. This information appears in a letter dated December 5, 1973,

from George Travers, Associate Director for Plans, Policies and

Programs, Employment Standards Administration, Office of Federal

Contract Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor, to Orley Ashenfelter.

Travers estimates that in 1971, 28 percent of government contractors

were listed as noncontractors. Since similar data procedures were

employed in 1966 and 1970, as in 1971, it is likely that this estimate

applies to our data as well.
