How is Tax Policy Conducted over the Business Cycle?

                                             ABSTRACT

It is well known by now that government spending has typically been procyclical in developing economies
but acyclical or countercyclical in industrial countries. Little, if any, is known, however, about the
cyclical behavior of tax rates (as opposed to tax revenues, which are endogenous to the business cycle
and hence cannot shed light on the cyclicality of tax policy). We build a novel dataset on tax rates
for 62 countries for the period 1960-2013 that comprises corporate income, personal income, and value-
added tax rates. We find that, by and large, tax policy is acyclical in industrial countries but mostly
procyclical in developing countries. Further, tax policy in countries with better institutions and/or more
integrated with world capital markets tends to be less procyclical/more countercyclical.

1        Introduction

There is by now a strong consensus in the literature that scal policy, or more precisely gov-
ernment spending, has been typically procyclical in developing countries and countercyclical
or acyclical in industrial economies.1        Figure 1  from Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin (2013)
 illustrates this phenomenon by plotting the correlation between the cyclical components
of government spending and output for 94 countries during the period 1960-2009.                Yellow
(or light) bars depict developing countries while black bars indicate industrial economies.
The visual impression is striking: while a majority of black bars lie to the left of the gure
(indicating a negative correlation and hence countercyclical government spending in indus-
trial countries), the majority of yellow bars lie to the right (indicating a positive correlation
and hence procyclical government spending in developing countries).             In fact, the average
correlation is -0.17 for industrial countries and 0.35 for developing countries.
        Several hypothesis have been put forth in the literature to explain the procyclical behavior
of government spending in developing countries, ranging from limited access to international
credit markets (Riascos and Vegh, 2003, Cuadra, Sanchez, and Sapriza, 2010) to political
distortions and institutional weaknesses that tend to encourage excessive public spending
during boom periods (Tornell and Lane, 1999, Talvi and Vegh, 2005).                While, as argued
by Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin (2013), some emerging economies have switched from being
procyclical to countercyclical over the last decade (i.e., have graduated), scal procyclicality
remains a pervasive phenomenon in the developing world, which tends to reinforce  rather
than mitigate  the underlying business cycle volatility.
        The other pillar of scal policy is, of course, taxation. An obvious, yet critical, observation
on the taxation side is that in this case policymakers control (i) the statutory tax rate and (ii)
to a large extent, the tax base (i.e., the coverage and/or threshold of each tax rate). The tax
rate and the tax base ultimately determine the so-called e¤ective (or average marginal) tax
rate. In other words, policymakers do not control tax revenues, which vary endogenously with
output uctuations and changes in the tax base due to non-policy factors, such as changes in
agents willingness to evade taxes, ability to bribe, structural breaks and/or changes in agents
behavior over the business cycle, changes in income distribution, and bracket-creeping due

to ination. Since we are interested in understanding how tax policy is conducted over the
business cycle, we want to focus on policy variables under the control of policymakers (i.e.,
policy instruments), and not on tax revenues or any tax revenue-based measure such as the
tax burden (ratio of revenues to GDP), which will reect policy outcomes that are heavily
inuenced by endogenous changes in macroeconomic variables and non-policy factors.2                         In
other words, to identify changes in tax policy, it is critical to distinguish between changes
in policy instruments that indeed reect the policymakers intent and endogenous changes
in tax revenues that may simply reect the business cycle or other non-policy factors.                     As
an obvious example, it is perfectly possible to see tax revenues fall during a recession even if
policymakers have increased tax rates as long as the reduction in the size of the tax base (due
to lower income or consumption) dominates the e¤ect of higher tax rates. Any assessment
of tax policy based on tax revenues would thus erroneously conclude that tax policy has been
countercyclical when the reality is exactly the opposite.
       In this context  and in contrast to the analysis of the spending side, where changes in
government consumption (or its cyclical component) capture, in principle, the appropriate
policy instrument  the analysis of tax policy proves to be much more challenging due to the
presence of multiple taxes (e.g., value-added, personal income, and corporate, among others)
and the above-mentioned endogeneity problems associated with the main observable variable
(tax revenues). The personal income tax, for example, typically involves multiple tax rates
and income brackets. As a result, researchers have often resorted to computing the so-called
average marginal personal income tax rate, which captures the income-weighted average of
individual-level marginal tax rates and is calculated based on the tax structure (tax rates and
thresholds) and income distribution. In a similar vein, the value-added tax has typically a
single standard rate applicable to most goods but also a single or multiple reduced tax rate(s),
including in some cases exempted goods, which typically apply to particular goods such as
some food categories and child and elderly care.
       Unfortunately  and leaving aside a few studies focusing on individual countries such
as Barro (1990), Huang and Lin (1993), Strazicich (1997), Barro and Redlick (2011), and
Romer and Romer (2010) for the United States, Maihos and Sosa (2000) for Uruguay, and
   2
    Even cyclically-adjusted revenues have severe limitations in this regard due to the inherent di¢culty of
truly controlling for the business cycle, as discussed in detail in Riera-Crichton, Vegh, and Vuletin (2012) in
the context of estimation of tax multipliers.


                                                      3
Strawczynski (2013) for Israel  there is no systematic international evidence regarding the
cyclicality of tax policy.3 The main reason is, of course, the absence of readily-available cross-
country data on e¤ective tax rates. To get around this limitation, the literature has relied on
the use of (i) the ination tax (Talvi and Vegh, 2005; Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh, 2004)
or (ii) tax revenues, either in absolute terms or as a proportion of GDP (Gavin and Perotti,
1997; Braun, 2001; Sorensen, Wu, and Yosha, 2001; and Sturzenegger and Werneck, 2006).
Both approaches, however, have severe limitations.
    The problem with the rst approach is that there is simply no consensus on whether the
ination tax should be thought of as just another tax. While there is, of course, a theoretical
basis for doing so that dates back to Phelps (1973) and has been greatly re ned ever since
(see, for example, Chari and Kehoe (1999)), there is little, if any, empirical support (Roubini
and Sachs, 1989; Poterba and Rotemberg, 1990; Edwards and Tabellini, 1991; and Roubini,
1991). Indeed, Delhy Nolivos and Vuletin (2014) show that the ination tax can be thought
of as just another tax only when central bank independence is low in which case the scal
authority e¤ectively controls monetary policy and uses ination according to revenue needs.
When central bank independence is high, however, ination is set by the central bank and
is essentially divorced from scal considerations. For whatever is worth, Figure 2 suggests
and Table 1, columns 1 and 2 con rm that the ination tax comoves positively with the
business cycle in most industrial countries while it is, on average, acyclical in developing
countries. Hence, if anything, one would conclude that tax policy in developing countries is
not procylical which, as will become clear below, would be the incorrect conclusion to draw.
    On the other hand, the use of tax revenues is fundamentally awed because, as mentioned
above, tax revenues constitute a policy outcome (as opposed to a policy instrument) that
endogenously responds to the business cycle and is also inuenced by non-policy factors.
Indeed, tax revenues almost always increase during booms and fall in recessions as the size
of the tax base (be it income or consumption) moves positively with the business cycle.
Therefore, if tax revenues are positively related to the business cycle, there is little that
we can infer regarding the cyclicality of tax policy since positively-related tax revenues are
   3
     An important clari cation on terminology. We will say that tax policy is procyclical (countercyclical) when
tax rates are negatively (positively) correlated with GDP suggesting that tax policy is amplifying (smoothing)
the underlying business cycle. An acyclical tax policy captures the case of zero correlation (i.e., no systematic
relation between tax policy and the business cycle).



                                                       4
consistent with higher, unchanged, and even lower tax rates during good times. It is only
when tax revenues are negatively related to the business cycle that one may infer that tax
policy is procyclical.4 Since, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, columns 3 and 4, tax revenues
tend to be positively related to the business cycle, there is little that we can infer regarding
the cyclicality of tax policy.
    To correct for the fact that tax revenues are higher (lower) in good (bad) times, some
authors have used tax revenues as a ratio of GDP, referring to it as an average tax rate. While
appealing at     rst, this normalization simply compounds the above-mentioned endogeneity
problems.     Speci cally, uctuations in output not only a¤ect the numerator of this ratio
(i.e., tax revenues) indirectly trough the size of the tax base, but also directly through the
denominator (i.e., output).       As a result, it is unclear what we can infer about tax policy
by examining the correlation between (the cyclical components of) this ratio and GDP. To
show the practical relevance of this point, Figure 4 and Table 1, columns 5 and 6, show the
correlation between the cyclical components of government revenue to GDP ratio and real
GDP. On this basis, one would (erroneously) conclude that tax policy is acyclical in industrial
economies and countercyclical in developing countries.            As we will show in this paper, tax
policy is actually procyclical in most developing countries.
    In sum, there is simply no good substitute for having data on tax policy instruments
(i.e., statutory tax rates, coverage, and thresholds) when it comes to evaluating the cyclical
properties of tax policy. This is precisely the purpose of this paper. To our knowledge, this
is the rst paper to show systematic international evidence regarding the cyclicality of tax
policy based on the use of policy instruments as opposed to tax revenues (or tax-revenue-
based measures). To this end, we built a novel annual dataset that comprises value-added,
corporate, and personal income tax rates for 62 countries, 20 industrial and 42 developing,
for the period 1960-2013. While governments also resort to other taxes (e.g., social security,
trade, wealth, and nancial transactions taxes), we should note that value-added, corporate,
and personal income taxes represent around 65 percent of total tax revenues in developing
countries and almost 80 percent in industrial countries. Given the extensive country and time
coverage, we collected mainly standard value-added and highest marginal personal income tax
  4
    Notice that, since tax revenues move positively with the business cycle, negatively-related tax revenues
must imply lower tax rates during the booms (assuming all else equal of course).



                                                     5
rates.    Corporate and highest marginal personal income tax rates were obtained primarily
from the World Development Indicators (World Bank), World Tax Database (University of
Michigan, Ross School of Business), and international tax advisory        rms.   On the other
hand, standard value-added tax rates were obtained from various primary sources, including
countries revenue agencies and national libraries, books, newspapers, tax law experts, as well
as research and policy papers. We should note that for 55 out of the 62 countries included in
the sample, we were able to gather the complete time series of the value-added tax rate (i.e.,
since its introduction). We believe that this signi cant e¤ort in collecting value-added tax
rates is crucial for any study analyzing tax policy in the developing world as well as Europe,
where indirect/value-added taxation is the main tax revenue instrument.
   As already emphasized, using tax policy instruments in the form of tax rates (as opposed
to tax policy outcomes) to analyze tax policy is, in our view, a clear improvement on the
existing literature. Having said that, our approach is not problem-free either. In particular,
one might have concerns related to the fact that, due to data limitations, (i) the standard
value-added tax rate may not be a good proxy for the overall value-added tax policy (which
also comprises the reduced value-added tax rate(s)); (ii) changes in the coverage of di¤erent
goods may a¤ect the tax base of the VAT, which would constitute a genuine change in tax
policy that we would miss by focusing only on changes in tax rates; and (iii) the highest
marginal personal income tax rate may no be a good proxy for the personal income tax policy
(ideally measured using the average marginal personal income tax rate). To address these
valid concerns, we also use, for a subset of countries, reduced value-added tax rates, e¤ective
value-added tax rates (i.e., average VAT taxes that take into account goods coverage) and
average marginal personal income tax rate data. We nd that the results summarized below
remain valid because there is a high correlation between the standard VAT rate and either
the reduced VAT rate or the e¤ective VAT rate and between the highest marginal personal
income tax rate and the average marginal income tax rate. In sum, while not perfect, our
main idea of using tax rates to capture overall changes in tax policy seems to deliver the right
answer.
   Using this novel tax rate data, we compute the degree of cyclicality of each tax and of
a tax index. From an identi cation point of view, we also control for potential endogeneity

problems by using instrumental variables.5
       We can summarize our main empirical ndings as follows:

   1. Tax policy is more volatile in developing countries than in industrial economies in the
         sense that developing countries change their tax rates by larger amounts than industrial
         economies. In particular, the volatility of tax policy in developing economies is about
         35 to 100 percent higher than in industrial countries.           This pattern matches the one
         observed on the spending side (Gavin and Perotti, 1997; Singh, 2006). Annual average
         variation in real government spending is about 60 percent higher in developing countries
         than in industrial economies.

   2. Tax policy is acyclical in industrial countries and mostly procyclical in developing
         economies. This empirical regularity is robust to a wide set of statistical and economet-
         ric methods (including instrumental variables) and to concerns related to our possibly
         missing changes in tax policy that do not involve changes in tax rates.

   3. Countries with more (less) procyclical spending policy typically have more (less) pro-
         cyclical tax policy. In other words, tax and spending policies are typically conducted in
         a symmetric way over the business cycle.

   4. Much like the procyclicality on the spending side (see, for example, Frankel, Vegh, and
         Vuletin, 2013), tax policy is less procyclical/more countercyclical the better is institu-
         tional quality (e.g., less corruption and more bureaucratic quality) and the higher is
          nancial integration.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the tax rate data used in the study and
documents several empirical regularities, particularly regarding the frequency and average
magnitude of tax changes and the volatility of tax policy. Using a smaller set of countries,
Section 3 computes some alternative tax rates that will be used in the subsequent empirical
analysis.      Section 4 presents our main         ndings about the cyclicality of tax policy using
alternative statistical and econometric methods, addressing endogeneity concerns, and using
   5
    See Rigobon (2004) and Jaimovich and Panizza (2007) who challenge the idea that scal policy is proclical
in developing countries based on endogeneity problems. Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008), however, argue that even after
addressing endogeneity concerns, there is causality running from the business cycle to government spending.

alternative tax rate measures. Section 5 explores the relationship between cyclicality of tax
and spending policies. Section 6 con rms that, as in the case of government spending, better
institutions induce less procyclical/more countercyclical tax policies and limited access to
international capital markets hinder governments ability to pursue countercyclical policies.
Section 7 closes the paper with some nal remarks.


2     Tax data

2.1    Database

Part of this papers contribution is the creation of a novel tax rate database that combines
existing  but dispersed  data on corporate and personal income tax rates with newly-
collected data on value-added taxes. Our main database comprises annual data on corporate,
highest marginal personal income, and standard value-added tax rates for 62 countries  20
industrial and 42 developing  for the period 1960-2013.6;7;8
    Compared to corporate and personal income taxation, value-added taxation is fairly mod-
ern. The rst value-added tax dates back to France in 1948. Beginning in the late 1960s, the
value-added tax spread rapidly (Figure 5). The widespread adoption observed since the early
1990s is mainly explained by developing countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and transition
economies.9     While unbalanced, the tax rate data coverage is quite broad and comprises a
long time span. In fact, corporate, highest marginal personal income, and value-added tax
rates coverage (as percentage of largest possible coverage) is 80, 70, and 94 percent, respec-
tively. For a smaller sample of 9 and 7 countries we also have (for at least 20 years) reduced
   6
     See Appendix 1 for the de nition of the various variables and data sources, Appendix 2 for the list of
countries in our sample, and Appendix 3 for the period coverage for each tax in each country. We excluded
from our analysis major oil-producer countries such as Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Ecuador, Gabon,
Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and
Yemen. For this group of countries, oil revenues typically represent more than 60 percent of scal revenues.
These revenues are raised in di¤erent ways; directly via state-owned enterprises and indirectly trough various
taxes and royalties.
   7
     Corporate tax rates generally are the same for di¤ering types and levels of pro ts. When this is not the
case, we use the highest marginal tax rate.

value-added and average marginal personal income tax rates, respectively.10;11


2.2    Long-run trends

Long-run tax rate trends di¤er across taxes.              About two thirds of personal and corporate
income tax rates changes are negative, both in industrial and developing countries (Table 2,
columns 1 to 4).      The opposite trend occurs with value-added tax rates; about 75 percent
of such changes are positive (Table 2, columns 5 and 6). These changes reect a downward
trend of personal and corporate income tax rates and a slow but persistent upward trend of
value-added tax rates. The highest personal income tax rates fell from about 50 percent in
the early 1980s to 30 percent in the late 2000s. Similarly, corporate tax rates decreased from
about 40 percent in the early 1980s to 25 percent in the late 2000s.                  On the other hand,
standard value-added tax rates increased moderately from 15 percent in the early 1980s to
about 17 percent in the late 2000s.


2.3    Short-run patterns

In spite of the above-mentioned di¤erences in the long-run trends across tax rates, changes are
somewhat synchronized in the short-run. We should rst notice, though, that about half of
increases or decreases in the rate of one tax tend to occur in the absence of changes in other
tax rates.    For example, out of all reductions in the personal income tax rate, 48 percent
are associated with no change in the corporate or value-added tax rates. Having said that,
reductions (increases) in the rate of one tax tend to be more associated about two times
with reductions (increases) in the other taxes than with increases (decreases). Following the
previous example of reductions in personal income tax rate, 37 percent are associated with
reductions in corporate and/or value-added tax rates, and only 15 percent are associated with
increases in corporate and/or value-added tax rates.
  10
     The data on reduced value-added tax rates covers Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.

2.4      Frequency of changes

A key di¤erence between government spending  and for that matter most macroeconomic
variables  and tax rates is that the latter rarely vary every year.12                       While changes in
government spending take place continuously throughout the budget cycle, changes in tax
rates do not occur every year presumably because they typically require explicit approval
from congress/parliament. Indeed, the frequency of tax rate changes in our sample is 0.20,
0.18, and 0.12 for personal, corporate, and value-added taxes, respectively. Put di¤erently,
tax rates change, on average, about every 5 years for corporate and personal income taxes
and every 8 years for value-added taxes.
       Table 3, panel A also shows that, with the exception of the personal income tax rates,
which vary more frequently in industrial countries, the frequency of tax rate changes is quite
similar across industrial and developing countries.


2.5      Average magnitude of changes

Both industrial and developing countries exhibit similar average variation in tax rates (Table
3, panel B) of between 1.7 and 3 percent. The annual average change in tax rates, however,
varies signi cantly across countries and taxes. For example, Norways annual average change
in personal income tax rate is about 7 percent. This is the result of frequent changes in
this tax rate, which has uctuated from values close to 70 percent during the 1970s to about
25 percent during the 1980s, and back up again to the 40 percent range in the early 2000s.
At the other side of the spectrum, Korea has never changed its value-added tax rate (of 10
percent) since its introduction in 1978.13


2.6      Tax policy volatility

The similarity across groups of countries regarding the average magnitude of tax rate changes
described in the previous subsection hides important di¤erences on the intensity/magnitude
of tax rate changes. When focusing only on tax rate changes di¤erent from zero (i.e., when
tax policy is active), developing economies show larger magnitude of tax rate changes than
  12
     In this sense, changes in tax rates are reminiscent of the time pro le observed in price changes for individual
goods; see, for instance, Bils and Klenow (2004).

     See Appendix 4, Table 4A, columns 1-3 for the corresponding country statistics.

industrial countries across the board (Table 3, panel C). The percentage change in tax rates
in developing countries is about 100, 50, and 35 percent higher for the personal, corporate,
and value-added taxes, respectively, than that of industrial economies. In other words, tax
policy is more volatile in developing countries than in industrial economies.
   For example, since its introduction in January 1, 1986 Portugal has changed its value-
added tax rate by relatively small amounts: from 16 to 17 percent (February 1, 1988), from
17 to 16 percent (March 24, 1992), from 16 to 17 percent (January 1, 1995), from 17 to 19
percent (June 5, 2002), from 19 to 21 percent (July 1, 2005), from 21 to 20 percent (July 1,
2008), from 20 to 21 percent (July 1, 2010), and from 21 to 23 percent (January 1, 2011). In
other words, Portugals average absolute percentage change was 8.6 percent. On the other
hand, since its introduction on January 1, 1980, Mexico changed its value-added tax rate
four times: from 10 to 15 percent (December 31, 1982), from 15 to 10 percent (November 21,
1991), from 10 to 15 percent (March 27, 1995), and from 15 to 16 percent (January 1, 2010).
In other words, Mexicos average absolute percentage change was 35 percent, about 4 times
that of Portugal.
   This regularity regarding tax policy volatility is consistent with the one observed on the
government consumption side; developing countries show more volatile spending policy than
industrial economies (Gavin and Perotti, 1997; Singh, 2006). Indeed, in our sample annual av-
erage variation in real government spending is about 60 percent higher in developing countries
than in industrial economies.


2.7   Frequency of change versus volatility of tax policy

The three panels in Figure 6 plot for every country in the sample the frequency of changes of
each of our three tax rates against tax policy volatility (measured as the percentage absolute
change in tax rates without including zero changes). The gures strongly support a negative
relationship between the frequency of tax rate changes and tax policy volatility. Countries
where changes in tax rates are relatively infrequent (i.e., low frequency of change) typically
show high tax policy volatility (i.e., high intensity/magnitude of tax rate changes). In other
words, frequency and magnitude of changes seems to act as substitutes: in countries where
tax rates change regularly (infrequently), taxes vary by small (large) magnitudes.

2.8        Tax revenue structure

In this subsection, we briey characterize the tax revenue structure  both in terms of size
and composition  of countries around the world. The tax burden, de ned as government
revenue expressed as percentage of GDP, varies signi cantly across countries, ranging from
42.1 percent for Norway to 7.3 percent for the Democratic Republic of Congo.14 The average
tax burden in industrial countries is 25.5 percent of GDP, compared to 18.8 percent for
developing countries (Table 4, panel A).
         The relative importance of income  both corporate and personal  and value-added taxes
varies signi cantly across countries and groups of countries. Generally speaking, industrial
countries rely heavily on direct taxation, particularly on personal income taxation. In contrast,
developing economies rely more on indirect taxation, particularly the value-added tax (Table
4, panel B).15


3         Alternative measures of tax rates

As discussed in the Introduction, moving away from the use of tax revenues as a way of
inferring changes in tax policy and towards the use of tax policy instruments (such as statutory
tax rates, coverage, thresholds, etc.) is, in our view, a clear improvement in methodology.
Having said that, one might still have concerns about our reliance on the standard value-
added tax rate (hence ignoring reduced value-added tax rates and/or exempted goods, as
well as possible changes in the goods covered by the di¤erent rates) and the highest marginal
personal income tax (and hence ignoring lower income tax rates and possible changes in the
average marginal income tax rate brought about by changes in coverage).16
         To address these concerns, we will also use in our analysis below (i) average marginal
personal income tax rate, (ii) reduced value-added tax rates, and (iii) e¤ective value-added
    14
      See Appendix 4, Table 3A, column 1 for the corresponding country statistics.
    15
      See Appendix 4, Table 3A, columns 2-6 for individual country statistics.
   16
      While the average marginal personal income tax rate is the typical measure used by most studies  particu-
larly those focused on the United States  we should note that such measure is not free of conceptual problems
either. As discussed in detail by Barro and Redlick (2011), changes in the average marginal personal income
tax rate, such as the one observed from 1971 to 1978 in the United States, may reect the shift of households
into higher brackets due to high ination in the context of an unindexed tax system (and not because of explicit
policy changes). This concern seems to be particularly relevant in the case of the developing world as well as
industrial countries with a long history of moderate/high and persistent levels of ination, such as Greece,
Italy, Portugal, and Spain.


                                                      12
tax rates (i.e., average VAT rates that take into account goods coverage). While, due to data
availability, we can only carry our this analysis for a subset of countries, our results strongly
suggest that our main results are robust to the concerns raised above. In essence, our results
will remain valid because there is a high correlation between (i) standard value-added tax
rates and reduced or e¤ective value-added tax rates and (ii) the highest personal income tax
rate and the average marginal income tax rate.


3.1    Personal income tax rate

In the case of the personal income tax rate, Table 5 shows the correlation between highest
and average marginal personal income tax rates for seven economies for which we have data
on average marginal personal income tax rates for at least 20 years. The correlation is always
statistically positive and ranges between 0.44 and 0.99.                A visual inspection of Figure 7,
which shows both personal income tax rate measures for the United States, indeed indicates
a striking similar pro le between highest and average marginal personal income tax rates.


3.2    Reduced value-added tax rate

We obtain similar ndings when turning to the value-added tax. Table 6 shows the correlation
between the standard and average reduced value-added tax rates for 9 economies for which we
have data on reduced value-added tax rates for at least 20 years.17 With only two exceptions,
the correlation is larger than 0.5 and statistically signi cant at the one percent level. As an
illustration of this high correlation, Figures 8 and 9 show both standard and average reduced
value-added tax rates for Germany and Greece, respectively. Moreover, in the case of Greece
(which has two reduced value-added tax rates) both the lowest and highest reduced rates
show a similar pro le.18


3.3    E¤ective value-added tax rate

To complement our evidence regarding the correlation between the standard and average re-
duced value-added tax rates, we also calculate the e¤ective value-added tax rate by weighing
  17
     In most cases, countries have one, or at most two, reduced VAT rates. However, for some countries and
during certain periods of time, there have been up to 5 reduced VAT rates.
  18
     We should also note that reduced tax rates typically apply to particular goods, such as some food categories
and child and elderly care.


                                                       13
each value-added statutory tax rate with its corresponding share of transactions (as a percent-
age of taxable base).19 Formally  and following Mathis (2004)  we compute the e¤ective
value-added tax rate as

                                                                   X     j
                         e¤ective value-added tax rateit =              wit  V ATitj ;
                                                                    j


where wj denotes the share of transactions associated with tax rate j as a percentage of
                        j
taxable base (i.e., j wit = 1) and V ATj is the value-added tax rate j.20 The computation
of wj is not trivial as it requires mapping the coverage for statutory tax rates to national
account data (see Mathis (2004) for details). The closer the standard rate and the e¤ective
average value-added tax rates are, the smaller the impact of the non-standard rates (e.g.,
reduced, zero, and parking rates) as well as changes in the tax base.21 In the extreme case
of Denmark, where there is a single statutory rate, both the standard and the e¤ective tax
rates are identical. Unfortunately, the required wj s are only available for the nine industrial
countries listed in Table 6 and Denmark for the years 1996, 1998, and 2000.22
    While the raw data is not shown for brevity (see Tables A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 in Mathis
(2004) for details) two basic empirical regularities are worth noting. First, for the 10 countries
included in this sub-section, the share of transactions associated with the standard value-added
tax rate is on average 70 percent (of total tax base). The share of transactions covered by
reduced tax rates is about 26 percent, while super-reduced, parking, and zero value-added
rates cover the remaining 4 percent of transactions. As we would expect, these averages show
some cross country variation, ranging from a standard rate tax base of 50 percent in Spain to
100 percent in Denmark.
  19
     Unfortunately, e¤ective tax rates are not readily available even for EU countries, where most measures
refer to tax burdens, the so-called implicit tax rates (calculated as aggregate tax revenues as a percentage of
the potential tax base); see European Commission (2011, 2012, and 2013).
  20
     In particular, we distinguish between standard, reduced, super-reduced, parking, and zero value-added
rates and bases. Super-reduced tax rates refer to tax rates lower than 5 percent.
  21
     As discussed above for the case of the average marginal personal income tax, we should note that the
e¤ective value-added tax rate may, in principle, reect non-policy changes. In this case, such non-policy changes
would reect changes in wj due to the rebalancing of consumption among taxed goods rather than legislative
changes. For example, some recent reports by the European Commission (e.g., European Commission, 2011)
argue that this might have been the case in the aftermath of the global nancial crisis because of a shift in
consumption patterns towards basic goods, which are normally subject to lower VAT rates.
  22
     We work with the nine countries speci ed in Table 6 plus Denmark. Denmark was not included in the
analysis underlying Table 6 because it does not have reduced rates.



                                                       14
    Second, these shares of transactions associated with di¤erent statutory tax rates do not
vary much over time in any given country. Between 1996 and 2000, most changes are about 1
or 2 percentage points. While the data used are not fully comparable, similar ndings obtain
if one uses also the 2011 shares from Borselli, Chiri, and Romagnano (2012). In other words,
while there is some within country variation in the shares of transactions associated with
di¤erent tax rates, they are not quantitatively important.
    Figure 10 shows standard and e¤ective value-added tax rates for the 30 data points for
which we have data (10 countries and 3 years). This gure aims at replicating, in a pooled
data framework, Figure 7 comparing the highest and the average marginal personal income
tax rates in the United States.         Two observations are worth making.             First, the degree
of association is positive and very high with an R2 of 0.85, indicating that the variability
of the standard value-added tax rate explains about 85 percent of e¤ective value-added tax
rate. Second, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coe¢cient that relates these two
alternative measures (i.e., 1.1) is, statistically speaking, di¤erent from 1. This would imply
that a one percentage-point increase in the standard rate would be associated, on average,
with a one percentage-point increase in the e¤ective rate.23 These ndings are not surprising
given the high relative importance of the standard tax rate (in terms of its relevance in the
tax base) as well as the relative constancy of the goods covered by each statutory tax rate
over time.


3.4    Tax index

In our analysis below, it will prove convenient to study the behavior of a tax index, which
combines the personal income, corporate, and value-added tax rates. While there is really no
substitute for the study of the behavior of individual tax rates over the business cycle, such
an index will provide us with a single indicator that may be suggestive of the overall cyclical
behavior of tax policy in any given country.
    To construct this index, we simply take a weighted average of each tax rate, given by


             tax indexit = wiP IT  P ITit + wiCIT  CITit + wiV AT  V ATit ;                     (1)
  23
     Similar results obtain if we use instead country xed e¤ects (even though these results should be taken
with a grain of salt given that we have only 3 data points per country).



                                                    15
where P IT , CIT , and V AT are the percentage changes of the personal income, corpo-
rate income, and value-added tax rates, respectively. The weights wiP IT , wiCIT , and wiV AT
capture the average importance of each tax in each country as a proportion of total tax
revenues.     The use of a countrys average avoids short-term uctuations in shares due to
non-policy changes.24


4     Cyclicality of tax policy

This section presents our main ndings on the cyclicality of tax policy. To this end, we use
several statistical and econometric methods including computing the behavior of tax rates
across di¤erent stances of the business cycle, cross-country correlation plots, and panel data
regressions. While using the cyclical component of the scal variable is the typical approach
when focusing on government consumption (which is a continuous variable), the choice of
this strategy is less obvious when focusing on a scal variable, such as tax rates, which changes
less frequently (as discussed in Subsection 2.4). For this reason we use the percentage change
in tax rates.25


4.1    Preliminary analysis

We start by performing a preliminary analysis of the cyclicality of tax policy using some
simple statistics and cross-country correlation plots. Table 7 shows the average percentage
tax rate change evaluated at di¤erent points in the business cycle for industrial and developing
countries.    While industrial countries reduce personal income tax rates both in good and
bad times, developing economies sharply decrease them in good times. This suggests that
personal income tax policy is acyclical in industrial countries and procyclical in developing
ones. Corporate income tax rates also fall both in good and bad times in industrial countries,
but increase in bad times in developing economies, which suggests that corporate income tax
policy is acyclical in industrial countries and procyclical in developing ones. Value-added tax
  24
     Needless to say, taking xed weights may hide genuine tax policy changes that may result in a change in
the relative importance of each tax rate. For this reason, we will use the tax index only as suggestive and
not as a substitute for the analysis of individual tax rates and the corresponding robustness tests carried out
below.
  25
     Similar results obtain if, instead of using tax rates changes, we detrend the original series using the
Hodrick-Prescott lter with a smoothing parameter of 6.5 (Ravn and Uhlig, 2002) or the Baxter-King lter.



                                                      16
rates decrease in good times in industrial countries and increase in bad times in developing
economies. Therefore, both industrial and developing countries appear to be procyclical. The
tax index, as de ned in equation (1), decreases both in good and bad times in industrial
countries. On the other hand, the tax index falls in good times and increases in bad times
in developing economies. Tax policy thus appears to be acyclical in industrial countries and
procyclical in developing countries.
   We now analyze tax behavior at the country level.           For this purpose we show country
correlations between the percentage changes of each tax rate and real GDP. Figure 11 shows
the correlations for the personal income tax rate.        While about twice as many industrial
countries exhibit a negative correlation (14 relative to 6, with many of the negative correlations
being very small in absolute value), the ratio for developing countries is close to 3 (28 relative to
10). It is also interesting to point out that countries such as Spain and Portugal are among the
most procyclical industrial economies. Figure 12 reports analogous results for the case of the
corporate income tax. While the distribution of industrial countries is about even (9 negative
and 11 positive correlations), 26 developing countries exhibit negative correlations (and many
quite large in absolute value) compared to just 15 with a positive correlation. In contrast,
Figure 13 for the case of the value-added tax rate looks quite similar across industrial and
developing countries with negative correlations about twice as many as positive correlations
(12 and 6, respectively, for industrial countries and 22 and 11 for developing countries).
   Finally, Figure 14 shows country correlations between the percentage changes of the tax
index, as de ned in equation (1), and real GDP. In some cases, a countrys tax policy
cyclicality reects similar behavior of di¤erent types of tax rates over the business cycle. For
example, personal and corporate income as well as value-added tax rates are procyclical in
Ghana and Bulgaria.         Conversely, all taxes are countercyclical in Norway and Germany.
When the cyclicality of tax rates varies across types of taxes, the overall behavior of the tax
index naturally reects that of the key taxes. For example, the tax index of Mexico shows
a procyclical tax policy.     While the value-added tax is strongly procyclical, corporate and
personal income taxes are quite acyclical.      Given that value-added tax revenues constitute
about 40 percent of total tax revenues, the cyclicality of the tax index reects that of the
value-added tax rate. In a similar vein, on the whole, New Zealand exhibits a countercyclical
tax policy. While personal and corporate income are countercyclical, the value-added tax is

                                                 17
procyclical. In this case, the countercyclicality of the tax system captured by the tax index
reects the fact that direct taxation represents 75 percent of revenues.
   As an overall summary of tax policy, Figure 14 shows the correlation between the tax
index and real GDP and shows that the eight most procyclical countries (i.e., those with
the largest negative correlations in absolute values) are all developing countries. In fact the
average correlation for developing countries is -0.16 compared to -0.08 for industrial countries.
Perhaps not surprisingly (given their dismal recent performance, which is reminiscent of older
crisis in Latin America), the three most procyclical industrial countries are Spain, Portugal,
and Greece.     If these were excluded from the industrial group, the correlation would be
essentially zero.   This clearly suggests some heterogeneity even within industrial countries,
which may be due to more fundamental factors, an issue that we explore in Section 6 below.


4.2   Regression analysis

We now exploit the panel nature of our dataset. Table 8 shows panel country xed-e¤ects
regressions. Tax policy is mostly acyclical for industrial countries. With the exception of the
value-added tax (column 5), acyclicality is found for both personal (column 1) and corporate
(column 3) income taxes as well as for the tax index (column 7). In sharp contrast, tax policy
is procyclical in developing countries across the board (columns 2, 4, 6, and 8). In sum, our
analysis strongly supports the idea that tax policy is, broadly speaking, acyclical in industrial
countries and procyclical in developing countries. Of course, correlations do not imply any
particular direction of causation and it could well be that real GDP is responding to changes
in tax policy rather than the other way around. The next section addresses such endogeneity
concerns.


4.3   Addressing endogeneity

The panel data regression analysis of the previous subsections characterized the degree of
pro/counter cyclicality of tax policy  both at the individual tax level and aggregate tax
index  by exploiting the comovements between the percentage changes in tax rates and real
GDP. This implicitly assumes that there is no reverse causality; that is, causality runs from
output uctuations to tax policy changes and not the other way around. While this has been



                                               18
the traditional approach in the scal procyclicality literature, more recent studies (Rigobon,
2004; Jaimovich and Panizza, 2007; Ilzetzki and Vegh, 2008) have shown that ignoring the
problem of endogeneity can potentially lead to a misleading picture. In other words, the
alleged procyclicality of tax policy identi ed in subsections 4.1 and 4.2 could just reect the
e¤ect of tax multipliers: when tax rates increase (decrease) output decreases (increases).
    This subsection addresses endogeneity concerns by using instrumental variables. We use
three instruments that have already been used in the literature. First, we use an instrument
suggested by Jaimovich and Panizza (2007):

                                             Xi X
                            ShockJPit =                   RGDP GRj;t ;                                   (2)
                                            GDPi  j ij;t1


where RGDP GRj measures real GDP growth rate in country j, ij is the fraction of exports
from country i to country j, and Xi =GDPi measures countrys is average exports expressed
as share of GDP.26 The index ShockJPi is thus a weighted real GDP growth of trading
partners and is meant to capture an external shock.
    Second, we use another external shock: changes in price of exports. This terms of trade
based variable has been commonly suggested as a driver of business cycles (Mendoza, 1994;
Ilzetzki and Vegh, 2008). The e¤ective change of prices of exports is measured as follows:

                                                       Xi
                                     ShockP Xit =          P XGRit ;                                      (3)
                                                      GDPi

where P XGRi measures price of exports growth rate in country i. The variable ShockP Xi
thus attempts to capture the e¤ective change of prices of exports.27                    Lastly, we use an
instrument proposed by Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008) who suggest using the change of real returns
on U.S. Treasury bills to capture global liquidity conditions.28
  26
     As rightly remarked by Jaimovich and Panizza (2007, page 13) a time-invariant measure of exports over
GDP is used because a time-variant measure would be a¤ected by real exchange rate uctuations, and, therefore,
by domestic factors. This is not the case for the fraction of exports going to a speci c country...because the
variation of the exchange rate that is due to domestic factors has an equal e¤ect on both numerator and
denominator.
  27
     When using ShockJPi (see equation (2)), Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008, page 20) argue that while it is unlikely
that current government spending of smaller economies has an e¤ect on the growth rates of their trading
partners, which include mainly larger economies, this could be true in the case of larger economies in the
sample and hence suggest that results for high-income/industrial countries should be taken with a grain of
salt. Similar concerns may apply to ShockP Xi .
  28
     Since global liquidity conditions may also have direct e¤ects on governments scal decisions, we include



                                                     19
    In this subsection we also take into account concerns regarding the structure of errors in the
regression analysis. We allow errors to exhibit arbitrary heteroskedasticity and arbitrary intra-
country correlation (i.e., clustered by country). The relaxation of the non-autocorrelation
assumption is important for a study using the percentage changes of both dependent variables
and regressors.
    Table 9 shows instrumental variables panel regressions.29 Before analyzing the regression
results, two issues are worth noting. First, for both groups of countries we can reject that
instruments are weak (i.e., instruments are good predictors of the business cycle) at standard
5 percent con dence. Second, in all cases the over-identi cation tests cannot reject the null
hypothesis that instruments are valid (i.e., uncorrelated with the error term) and correctly
excluded from the estimation equation. These                 ndings strongly support the validity and
strength of our instrumental variable estimates.
    Our instrumental variable regressions (Table 9) generally support the ndings from the
previous section (i.e., Table 8). As expected, instrumental variable estimates are less e¢cient
(i.e., standard errors are a little bit larger). Two di¤erences are worth noting. First, while
developing countries pursue procyclical value-added tax policy, industrial countries procycli-
cality vanishes once endogeneity concerns are addressed (Table 9, columns 5). The latter
occurs because (i) there is a shift in the coe¢cient distribution function to the right (from
-0.27 in Table 8 to 0.11 in Table 9) and (ii) there is a widening in the coe¢cient distribution
function (from an absolute t-statistic value of 2.4 in Table 8 to 1.4 in Table 9). The latter
feature is typical of IV regressions; estimates are less e¢cient. The rst change supports the
presumption regarding the relevance of reverse causality. That is to say, an increase (decrease)
in value-added tax rates decreases (increases) output in industrial countries and not the other
way around. The second di¤erence with our ndings in the previous section is that developing
countries procyclicality in personal income taxation vanishes once endogeneity concerns are
addressed (Table 9, columns 2).
    To sum up, after addressing endogeneity concerns, we nd that tax policy is acyclical in
industrial countries. Such acyclicality is present not only at an aggregate level (i.e., tax index)
our measure of U.S. interest rates as an instrument for output as well as a determinant of the behavior of tax
policy. Since this instrument might be endogenous in the case of the United States, we exclude this country
from the instrumental variables analysis.
   29
      In order to make appropiate comparisons, we only use observations for which we have data for all tax rates.



                                                       20
but also for personal and corporate income tax rates as well as value-added taxation. On the
other hand, procyclicality dominates the behavior of tax policy in developing countries both
at the aggregate and individual tax level, with the exception of personal income taxation.


4.4      Evidence from alternative tax rate data

Section 3 discussed the extent to which standard value-added taxes provide a good proxy for
overall value-added tax policy and whether the highest marginal personal income tax rate
captures the most important variations in the personal income tax policy (which is ideally
captured by the average marginal personal income tax rate). Speci cally  and using a smaller
group of industrial countries  we found that (i) the highest marginal personal income tax
rate is a good approximation for the average marginal income tax rate, and (ii) the standard
value-added tax rate seems to typically move in the same direction as either the reduced
value-added tax rates or the e¤ective value-added tax rate. This subsection tests the cyclical
properties of these alternative measures (marginal personal income tax rates, reduced value-
added rate, and e¤ective value-added rate) relative to the ones used in this study (highest
personal income tax rates and standard value-added rate).
       Table 10 shows the results. Columns 1 and 2 report panel regressions (as in subsection
4.2) and columns 3 and 4 instrumental variable panel regressions (as in subsection 4.3). Panel
A focuses on the personal income tax, and panels B and C focus on the value-added tax.30
When making each comparison, we restrict the number of observations so as to compare the
same data points. Panel A, column 2 shows that average marginal personal income tax rates
are acyclical. The same nding is obtained when focusing on the highest personal income tax
rate (panel A, column 1). These results coincide with those of personal income tax rates of
subsection 4.2 for industrial countries (Table 8, column 1). Panel A, column 4 shows that
average marginal personal income tax rates are acyclical when using instrumental variables.31
The same nding is obtained when focusing on the highest personal income tax rate (panel A,
column 3). These results coincide with those of subsection 4.3 for industrial countries (Table
  30
      The sample for these regressions corresponds to the six countries listed in Table 5 (all except the United
States, for the reasons discussed in Subsection 4.3) for the case of the personal income tax and the nine countries
listed in Table 6 (plus Denmark in the case of the e¤ective value-added tax) for the value-added tax case.
   31
      As in subsection 4.3, United States is excluded from the analysis because the U.S. interest rate instrument
might be endogenous in the case of the United States. For this reason, the sample size is reduced from 7 (Table
5) to 6 countries (Table 10, panel A).

9, column 1).
    We now turn to value-added tax policy. Panel B, column 2 shows that average reduced tax
rates are procyclical. The same nding is obtained when focusing on the standard value-added
tax rate (panel B, column 1). These results coincide with those of value-added tax rates of
subsection 4.2 for industrial countries (Table 8, column 5). Panel B, column 4 shows that
average reduce tax rates are acyclical when using instrumental variables. The same nding
is obtained when focusing on the standard value-added tax rate (panel A, column 3). These
results coincide with those of subsection 4.3 for industrial countries (Table 9, column 5). All
these results, together with those of subsection 3 support the use of standard value-added
and highest personal income tax rates as a proxy for value-added and personal income tax
policies, respectively.
    Finally, we turn to the e¤ective value-added tax rate. Unfortunately, our sample is very
small in this case so our results really need to be taken with a big grain of salt. Speci cally, we
have only 20 observations (2 observations per country) and, furthermore, these observations
are changes in non-contiguous years (given that we have observations only for the years 1996,
1998, and 2000, as explained in Subsection 3.3). For what is worth then, Panel C, Columns
1 and 2 show that both the standard and the e¤ective tax rate are procyclical (although
the latter is only signi cant at the 25 percent level) in standard OLS regressions.         When
instrumental variables are used, however, they both become insigni cant.            These results
coincide with those presented in Table 9, column 5 for industrial countries.


5    Cyclicality of spending and tax policies

Up to now, we have focused our analysis on the cyclicality of tax policy. We have found
fairly strong evidence to the e¤ect that, in line with the behavior of government spending,
industrial countries follow acyclical policies while developing countries are mostly procyclical.
We now focus on the relationship between the cyclicality of tax policy and that of spending.
In particular, we would like to know whether there exists a link between the cyclicality of
spending and tax policies over the business cycle.
    Figure 15 shows the country relationship between the cyclicality of tax (y-axis) and gov-




                                                22
ernment spending policies (x-axis).32 While far from perfect, Figure 15 indeed supports the
idea that countries with more procyclical spending policy (i.e., more positive values of Corr(G,
RGDP)) typically have more procyclical tax policy (i.e., more negative values of Corr(tax in-
dex, RGDP)) and viceversa. In other words, tax and spending policies are typically conducted
in a symmetric way over the business cycle.33


6         Determinants of tax policy cyclicality

While the existing literature on the cyclicality of government spending typically distinguishes
between industrial and developing countries, our ndings suggest that deeper factors may
be at the heart of the matter than just the distinction between these two groups of countries.
While, on average, industrial countries show an acyclical behavior and developing countries
a procyclical one, tax policy cyclicality varies quite a bit within these two groups of coun-
tries. For example, Figure 14 shows that while New Zealand, Canada, and Norway show the
expected pattern of countercyclical tax policy for industrial countries, Spain, Portugal, and
Greece show correlations similar to those of Uruguay and Mexico, thus behaving more like a
developing country.
         This is perhaps not surprising given structural (or highly inertial) di¤erences in terms of
underling theories regarding the determination of scal cyclicality, such as the importance
of institutional quality and the degree of nancial integration. For this reason, we analyze
the role of institutional quality and nancial integration. We measure institutional quality
using a comprehensive measure calculated as the average of four normalized variables from the
International Country Risk Guide (investment pro le, corruption, law and order, bureaucratic
quality).34 The institutional quality index ranges between 0 (lowest institutional quality) and
    32
      We use the tax index as a proxy for tax policy.
    33
      Of course, the speci c implications of cyclical changes in government spending and tax policy need not be
the same, an important issue to note but that falls outside the scope of this paper. While both may a¤ect
GDP via standard spending and tax multipliers, cyclical changes in, say, value-added taxes may a¤ect the
choice between private consumption and investment. A cyclical change in government spending, on the other
hand, would not have in principle such substitution e¤ects.
   34
      Investment pro le is an assessment of factors a¤ecting investment risk that are not covered by other po-
litical, economic and nancial risk components. The risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents:
contract viability/expropriation, pro ts repatriation, and payment delays. Corruption is an indicator of cor-
ruption within the political system. Law and order is an indicator of the strength and impartiality of the
legal system and the popular observance of the law. Bureaucratic quality is an indicator of the strength and
expertise to govern without drastic changes in policy or interruptions in government services.



                                                      23
1 (highest institutional quality). We measure de jure nancial integration using the Chinn-Ito
 nancial openness index (Chinn and Ito, 2006) and de facto nancial integration using total
foreign assets and liabilities over GDP (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007).35
      Table 11 shows instrumental variable panel regressions only for data points for which we
have both institutional quality and           nancial integration data.        Column 1 shows that, on
average, tax policy is acyclical. Table 11, columns 2, 3, and 4 add, one-at-a-time, interaction
terms with institutional quality, de jure nancial integration, and de facto nancial integra-
tion, respectively.36;37 Column 2 then shows that when institutional quality is the lowest (i.e.,
value of institutional quality = 0), tax policy is procyclical. It also shows that as institutional
quality increases, tax policy becomes less procyclical/more countercyclical.
      In the same vein, columns 3 and 4 show that when                 nancial integration is the lowest
(which, by construction, means that the indicator takes a value of 0), tax policy is procyclical.
Further, when either de jure or de facto           nancial integration increases, tax policy becomes
less procyclical/more countercyclical.38
      Overall, the evidence just presented coincides with Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletins (2013)
 ndings on the spending side. The authors also nd that (i) better institutions induce less pro-
cyclical/more countercyclical spending policies and (ii) limited access to international capital
markets hinder the policymakers ability to pursue countercyclical policies. Putting all the
evidence together, we thus conclude that, not surprisingly, scal policy (both on the spend-
ing and taxation side) is subject to the same key determinants and hence we should expect
countries that pursue procyclical policies on the spending side to also engage in procyclical
policies on the tax side. This is, of course, consistent with the evidence presented in Figure
15.
  35
     We should note that, in our formulation, both the Chinn-Ito index and the de facto nancial integration
index have zero as the minimum value.
  36
     Naturally, we also include the institutional quality and nancial integration variables alone as individual
regressors whenever they are used in the interaction terms. Such coe¢cients are not reported for the sake of
brevity.
  37
     In order to deal with potential endogeneity problems, we include institutional quality and nancial inte-
gration lagged one year.
  38
     When all three interaction terms are included together, the signi cance disappears due to high multi-
collinearity.

7    Conclusions

There is by now a strong consensus in the literature that government spending has been
typically procyclical in developing countries and countercyclical or acyclical in industrial
economies.   The evidence on the taxation side is, however, almost non-existent due to the
lack of data on tax rates. To analyze the cyclical properties of tax rate policy, we have built a
novel dataset on tax rates for 62 countries for the period 1960-2013 that comprises corporate
income, personal income, and value-added tax rates.
    We nd that, by and large, tax policy is acyclical in industrial countries but procyclical in
developing countries. Moreover, much like the procyclicality on the spending side (see Frankel,
Vegh, and Vuletin, 2013), we also nd that tax policy is less procyclical/more countercyclical
the better is institutional quality (e.g., less corruption and more bureaucratic quality) and
the more nancially integrated is the economy. It is also the case that countries with more
procyclical spending policy typically have more procyclical tax policy and vice-versa. In other
words, tax and spending policies are typically conducted in a symmetric way over the business
cycle.

Appendix 1. Definition of variables and sources

1.1 Macroeconomic data
Gross Domestic Product
    World Economic Outlook (WEO) and International Financial Statistics (IFS), both from the IMF, were the main data
    sources. Series NGDP (gross domestic product, current prices) from WEO and 99B from IFS. Data period covers
    1960-2013.
Government expenditure
    WEO was the main data source, series GCENL (central government, total expenditure and net lending). For Brazil,
    data from Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA). Data period covers 1960-2009.
Government total revenue
    WEO was the main data source, series GCRG (central government, total revenue and grants). Data period covers 1960-
    2009.
GDP deflator
    WEO and IFS were the main data sources. Series NGDP_D (gross domestic product deflator) from WEO and 99BIP
    from IFS. Data period covers 1960-2013.
Consumer price index
    WEO and IFS were the main data sources. Series PCPI (consumer price index) from WEO and 64 from IFS. Data
    period covers 1960-2013.
Government tax structure data
    Government Finance Statistics (GFS) from the IMF was the main data source. For Australia, data from Australian
    Government Budget Office.
    The variables are defined as follows: tax revenue (Central government, taxes; series cB_BA_11 and aB_BA_11); tax
    revenue on income, profits and corporations (Central government, taxes on income, profits and corporations; series
    cB_BA_111 and aB_BA_111); personal income tax revenue (Central government, taxes on individuals; series
    cB_BA_1111 and aB_BA_1111); corporate income tax revenue (Central government, taxes on corporations; series
    cB_BA_1112 and aB_BA_1112); goods and services tax revenue (Central government, taxes on goods and services;
    series cB_BA_114 and aB_BA_114); and value added tax revenue (Central government, value added tax; series
    cB_BA_11411 and aB_BA_11411). Data period covers 1990-2009.
Exports of goods and services (as percent of GDP)
    WEO and World Development Indicators (WDI) from the World Bank were the main data sources, series BX and
    NGDPD (WEO) and NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS (WDI). Data period covers 1960-2013.
Global real interest rate
    Global real interest rate was calculated by deflating the returns on U.S. Treasuries by the CPI inflation rate of the
    previous year. As Ilzetzki and Vegh (2008), we use an adaptive-expectations measure of real interest rates. These
    variables were obtained from IFS. Data period covers 1960-2013.
Real external shock (ShockJP)
    In the construction of real external shock, export weights data were obtained from Robert Feenstra and Robert Lipsey,
    NBER-United Nations Trade Data, 1962-2000 (http://cid.econ.ucdavis.edu/) for the period 1962-1985 and from
    Direction of Trade Statistics database (DOTS-IMF) for the period 1986-2013. Data period covers 1962-2013.
Real external shock (ShockPX)
    In the construction of index of price of exports, WEO and IFS were the main data sources for price of exports. Series
    TXG_D (price deflator for exports of goods) from WEO and 74 from IFS. Data period covers 1962-2013.
Institutional quality
    International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) was the source of data. Institutional quality is a normalized index that ranges
    between 0 (lowest institutional quality) and 1 (highest institutional quality). The index was calculated by the authors as
    the average of four components: investment profile, corruption, law and order, bureaucracy quality. Data period covers
    1984-2008.
Capital account openness
    Capital account openness using the Chinn-Ito index (KAOPEN) de jure measure of f restrictions on cross-border
    financial transaction.
Foreign assets and liabilities

   Notes: Percentage tax rate changes are reported as difference with respect to the overall (i.e., not distinguishing across stances of the business cycle) mean. Therefore,
   positive (negative) values indicate tax rate changes above (below) the mean. Good (bad) times are defined as those years for which the real GDP cycles are in the first
   higher (lower) quartile for each country. Normal times are defined as those years for which the real GDP cycles are in the second and third quartile for each country.

correlation (i.e., clustered by country). t-statistics are in square brackets. Constant term and global interest rate are not reported.
The over-identification test is Hansen's J statistic; the null hypothesis is that the instruments are exogenous (i.e., uncorrelated
with the error term). The weak-identification test is the F-statistic of the excluded instruments test.

The excluded instruments are ShockPX and ShockJP. Errors are allowed to present arbitrary heteroskedasticity and arbitrary intra-country correlation
(i.e., clustered by country). t-statistics are in square brackets. Constant term, institutional quality, de jure and de facto financial integration, and global
interest rate are not reported. The over-identification test is Hansen's J statistic; the null hypothesis is that the instruments are exogenous (i.e.,
uncorrelated with the error term). The weak-identification test is the F-statistic of the Anderson-Rubin Wald test.
