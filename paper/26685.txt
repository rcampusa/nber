                                          ABSTRACT

We investigate the relationship between college openings, college attainment, and health
behaviors and outcomes later in life. Though a large prior literature attempts to isolate the causal
effect of education on health via instrumental variables (IV), most studies use instruments that
affect schooling behavior in childhood or adolescence, i.e. before the college enrollment decision.
Our paper examines whether an increase in 2- and 4-year institutions per capita ("college
accessibility") in a state contributes to higher college attainment and better health later in life.
Using 1980-2015 Census and American Community Survey data, we find consistent evidence
that accessibility of public 2-year institutions positively affects schooling attainment and
subsequent employment and earnings levels, particularly among whites and Hispanics. With
restricted-use 1984-2000 National Health Interview Survey data, we again find that public 2-year
accessibility increases schooling and benefits a host of health behaviors and outcomes in
adulthood: it deters smoking, raises exercise levels, and improves self-reported health. However,
most long-term health conditions are unaffected, which may be partially due to the age of our
sample.

Introduction
A large literature examines whether years of formal schooling have a causal effect on health
(see Grossman, 2015 and Galama, Lleras-Muney, and van Kippersluis, 2018, for recent
reviews). The fundamental issue is that though education and health measures are positively
correlated in the data, this need not reflect a causal relationship from education to health.
Recent papers on this topic try to overcome this problem by exploiting variation in schooling that
is otherwise unrelated to health; a majority of these use variation in schooling stemming from
policies that affect individuals when they are in childhood or adolescence (e.g. compulsory
schooling laws or primary/secondary school-building programs), with mixed results.

Less is known about how policies that affect higher education decisions contribute to
subsequent health outcomes. This is particularly poignant given that the positive education-
health gradient is strongest for post-secondary years of schooling in the case of many health
behaviors (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). Recently, some scholars have called attention to
the need for evidence of how schooling factors other than compulsory schooling reforms affect
later health outcomes, since these reforms affect a particular type of student at one margin of
schooling (Galama, Lleras-Muney, and van Kippersluis, 2018). This paper seeks to fill this gap
by examining how college openings when individuals are young enough to take advantage of
them affect health behaviors and outcomes later in adulthood.

The question of how college access affects college attainment and subsequent outcomes
(including health) is timely from a policy perspective. In the United States, the college wage gap
is as high as it has been in 100 years (Goldin and Katz, 2008). At the same time, the
percentage of individuals obtaining a college degree has flattened, and the gap in college
attainment by family income has grown over time (Page and Scott-Clayton, 2016). These
trends, plus the rapidly rising pecuniary cost of college over the past few decades, has renewed
policymakers' interest in dramatically raising subsidies for higher education, particularly at the 2-
year (community) college level and for disadvantaged groups. 1 While recent evidence suggests
2-year tuition subsidies and other programs designed to increase degree completion among 2-
year students can raise attainment (Carrell and Sacerdote, 2017; Carruthers and Fox, 2016;
Denning, 2017; Evans et al., 2018), there is still a lack of evidence on the private and social
benefits of doing so. In particular, how does the additional college attainment induced by
increased college "access" affect not only individuals' labor market but also health outcomes
later in life?

We tackle this question by exploiting the differential build-up of 2 and 4-year institutions per
capita across states over the period of 1960-1996, with the lion's share of 2-year college
building occurring in the 1960's and early 1970's. Figure 1 shows that there is substantial
variation in the number of public 2-year colleges per 18-22 year-old across states and over time,
both during and after the build-up period. This is consistent with Kane and Rouse (1999), who

1 New York, Tennessee, and Oregon have recently made public 2-year college tuition-free for many
families. See http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/11/pf/college/tennessee-free-community-college/index.html
(last accessed February 11, 2019).

show that public 2-year college attendance increased dramatically over this same time period
from roughly 20% of first-time college attenders to nearly 50%.

Our identification strategy is closely related to that of Currie and Moretti (2003; hereafter, "CM"),
who exploit differences in the number of colleges at age 17 between cohorts of women
observed in the same county and year to examine how schooling affects birth outcomes. By
contrast, we examine outcomes for all adults after typical college-going years including
individual and family earnings, employment, and health outcomes. A difficulty in both CM and
our paper is that we do not observe individuals' locations at the time they make college
decisions (or even at age 17). Rather, CM only observe county of current residence and
assume that was where individuals lived at the time they made their college choices. In this
paper, we examine differences in the number of colleges by state (rather than county) and
assign individuals to their state of birth rather than state of residence. Though state of birth also
measures "state at age of college decision(s)" with error, it is not subject to bias related to
endogenous migration on the part of the respondent.

Using data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Census and the 2001-15 American Community
Survey (1% PUMS), we find that an increase in public 2-year colleges per 1,000 18-22 year-olds
in the state of 0.02 (one standard deviation of this variable in the data) when an individual is 17
years old raises years of formal schooling in adulthood by a little more than 0.05 years. This
change occurs through a reduction in individuals finishing their schooling as high-school
dropouts but especially high-school diploma earners only and an increase in some college
attendance as well as 4-year college graduation. On the other hand, public and private 4-year
institutions per capita have little effect on completed schooling. The effects of 2-year college
access are concentrated among whites and Hispanics (as opposed to blacks and members of
other races). For these groups, we estimate a financial return to a year of schooling of roughly
14%, which is similar to recent findings in the returns-to-schooling literature (Oreopoulos and
Petronijevic, 2013).

Coupling these results with restricted-use 1984-2000 National Health Interview Survey data, we
again find that public 2-year accessibility positively affects schooling and a host of health
behaviors and outcomes in adulthood: it deters smoking, raises exercise levels, and improves
self-reported health. Some other behaviors and outcomes, including binge drinking, obesity, flu
shot receipt, and major health activity limitations, are unaffected. Some of these null effects are
consistent with other findings in the literature (e.g., obesity, see Galama, Lleras-Muney, and van
Kippersluis, 2018) and others are not likely to manifest themselves in a non-elderly sample
(e.g., major activity limitations), and some we would not expect to be influenced by schooling at
all (e.g., asthma and allergies). We discuss these results in the context of theories regarding
education and health, the related literature, and multiple hypothesis testing later in the paper.


Background
Theoretical considerations
                                                                                                     3



College attainment may affect the trajectory of employment and earnings, health-related
behaviors, and health outcomes later in life. Although the primary aim of this paper is to study
the effects of college attainment on health, we also examine how college availability impacts
earnings and employment, with special attention to their life-cycle trajectories. Human capital
theory suggests and previous studies confirm that the earnings return to education is most
evident after the completion of college and through prime-working ages, after a worker gains
experience and before they transition towards retirement (Bhuller, Mogstad, and Salvanes,
2017).

Greater investments in "knowledge" or "skill" capital may affect decisions regarding health
capital. Grossman (1972, 2000) hypothesized that these two forms of human capital are
complementary. For example, knowledge or skill capital may increase individuals' ability to
process information, raising their efficiency in producing health. At the same time, if one expects
to have more consumption and leisure enjoyment in life, investing in health and longevity may
be more attractive (Becker, 2007; Cowan, 2011). There are also likely to be direct income and
substitution effects associated with higher earnings that contribute to differences in the
purchase of health-related products and services (such as drugs and alcohol, healthy foods,
gym memberships, and health care) as well as time spent in health-enhancing activities (such
as exercise). Various patterns of such purchases by income level can have ambiguous total
effects on health behaviors and outcomes.

College attendance also has the potential to change individuals' attitudes, preferences, and
choices that affect health. For example, because attending college typically changes the
composition of a student's peer group, there are likely to be important peer effects impacting
health-related behaviors, either by accelerating the adoption of health-promoting behaviors, or
by encouraging unhealthy behaviors through social norms or historical cultural practices
(Kremer and Levy, 2008; Carrell, Hoekstra, and West, 2011). The net impact of such peer
effects on health-related behaviors depends in part on the differences between a student's
childhood and college environment, which may differ based on a student's gender, race, and
ethnicity.

The theories of health and human capital share the feature that capital accumulates over an
extended period through investment and return. For this reason, even if health behaviors (such
as diet, exercise, or substance use) are affected by college attendance at younger ages, these
changes in health-related behaviors may not translate into changes in health outcomes until
later in life. We discuss the implications of this vis a vis the age of our sample later in the paper.

Of course, the positive correlation between (college) education and health need not reflect
causal effects from more schooling to better health. Other research has found evidence of an
effect of early-life health on educational attainment (e.g., Case, Fertig, and Paxson, 2005).
Unobserved factors, including cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, risk and time preferences,
and individual values can influence both health and education decisions (Fuchs, 1982;
Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006). Our study aims to isolate the causal effect of college
                                                                                                              4


schooling on health, though we largely leave the identification of specific mechanisms behind
any such effect to other research.

Empirical Literature

The most recent studies using U.S. data that have examined the effects of college education
specifically on adult health have typically used variation in schooling induced by differences in
draft risk surrounding the Vietnam War. 2 They find that the increase in college education due to
draft avoidance led to a reduction in mortality (Buckles et al., 2013), smoking (Buckles et al.,
2013; De Walque, 2007; Grimard and Parent, 2007), and obesity (Buckles et al., 2013;
MacInnis, 2006). 3 Collectively, these papers provide considerable evidence that college
education has a positive, causal effect on health in this context, but they are limited in terms of
external validity because their sample is confined to men who were at risk of military induction in
the 1960's. 4 By focusing on colleges per capita, we exploit a policy-relevant variable that affects
a large swath of young people over several decades and thus may have different effects than
does Vietnam War draft avoidance.

The paper most closely related to ours is Currie and Moretti (2003) in that we use the same data
on U.S. college openings (provided by the authors) and a similar identification strategy. Papers
using the related variables of individual proximity to colleges or primary/secondary school
openings as instruments for education are abundant in the financial returns-to-schooling
literature. 5 However, we do not know of any studies that use U.S. college openings to examine
the effect of education on adult health, nor do we know of any paper that has tried to replicate
CM's results using their data on college access in a different context.

CM examine how 2- and 4-year colleges per capita within counties affect the education levels
and other characteristics of new white mothers (as measured in Vital Statistics Natality files for
1970-1999) as well as birth outcomes of their newborns. The authors face the same issue with
their natality data as we have in our BRFSS data: only current location (county in their case,
state in ours) is measured rather than location at a younger (pre-college) age. They use
alternative datasets (Census and NLSY) in which it is possible to obtain location of residence at
age 17 for some individuals to verify that their first-stage results are not driven by higher-
educated mothers sorting into states with more institutions per capita.


2 In a recent study, Kamhofer, Schmitz, and Westphal (2018) use college expansions in Germany to
identify the effects of college education on later health outcomes. They find positive average physical
health effects but zero mental health effects, along with positive average effects on cognitive ability and
wages, of college schooling.
3
  Buckles et al. (2013) also find that exercise increases and heavy drinking decreases (in some
specifications) when years in college increases.
4 Recent work has also argued that draft risk has a direct effect on health through stress, which

challenges the validity of the instrument (see Cawley, de Walque, and Grossman, 2017).
5 Some examples of papers using college proximity as an instrument include Card (1995), Cameron and

Taber (2004), and Heckman, Humphries, and Veramendi (2016). Duflo (2001) uses primary school
openings in Indonesia as an instrument to estimate the financial returns to schooling (see also Akresh et
al., 2018).
                                                                                                          5


In our paper, we use the same data on colleges per capita for 1960-95 as CM, but we
aggregate the information to the state level. This is because we have access to state of birth,
but not county of birth, in the public Census and restricted NHIS data. 6 Assigning college
accessibility measures based on state of birth means that we do not have to be concerned that
our results are driven by individuals who selectively move into states with greater accessibility
prior to college enrollment, or that individuals who already have more education relocate to
states with greater accessibility (a concern if such accessibility is correlated with better labor-
market prospects for college graduates, for example).

CM focus on a very particular segment of the population--new white mothers (though all white
mothers are considered in robustness checks). We have no a priori reason to believe that
colleges per capita would not affect educational and subsequent health outcomes across
gender, race, and age. Thus, our primary study sample includes all adults, and we also examine
how our results vary by demographics.


Data
Figures 1 and 2 show how the number of public 2- and 4-year colleges per capita, respectively,
changed in each state over our sample period. 2-year colleges per capita experienced more (in
some cases sudden) growth in most states than did 4-year colleges, especially during the
1960's and early 70's (though the baseline level of 4-year schools per capita is higher overall).
Figures 3 and 4 show, respectively, how overall increases in public 2- and 4-year colleges per
capita from 1960 to 1995 vary by state. As is noticeable from the figures, the correlation
between growth in public 2-year access and 4-year access at the state level is small.

Figure 5 shows the result of regressing state-level first differences in years of schooling attained
between the 1960 and 1996 cohorts on the same differences in 2-year colleges per capita.
State observations are weighted by their population of 18-22 year-olds in 1960, and larger
circles represent more heavily weighted states in the figure. There is a clear positive correlation
between these two variables in the figure. It should of course be noted that overall growth in
these measures is not what we use to identify effects on schooling and other outcomes in our
econometric analysis; rather, it is cohort-by-cohort variation across states and over time that
identifies our effects. This is described in the next section.

We first employ the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Census surveys and the 2001-15 American
Community Survey (1% PUMS). We include all individuals who are age 22 and above and were
17 years old between 1960 and 1996 (since these are the years for which we have data on their
college accessibility variables). This leaves us with over 18 million observations. For



6 Data on location at age 17 in the Census data is available for those who are 22 at the time of the survey,

since there is a question about a respondent's residence 5 years prior to the interview. However, this is
not a suitable sample for our analysis, since we want to measure health effects of education throughout
adulthood.
                                                                                                            6


computational ease, and because we are focused on state-level policies, we aggregate our data
into state by cohort by year of observation cells.

Summary statistics are contained in Table 1. Schooling responses in the Census are assigned
to highly disaggregated categories; we create several dummy variables indicating different
schooling levels as well as a measure of years of schooling (which we treat as continuous in the
analysis). As seen in the table, there is roughly 0.04 (0.03) public 2-year (4-year) institutions per
1,000 18-22 year-olds in a state, on average (compared to 0.06 private 4-year institutions per
capita). 7 The methods for counting the number of institutions and estimating the population of
18-22 year-olds are discussed in detail in the Data Appendix of Currie and Moretti (2003).

Our National Health Interview Survey sample is from 1984-2000 and contains the restricted-
access variable state of birth (for which assignment to colleges per capita at age 17 is
necessary, as described earlier). We restrict the age and cohorts of the sample in the same we
do for the Census/ACS data. We examine a host of health-related behaviors, symptoms, and
conditions as dependent variables in our analysis. Summary statistics on all variables are
included in Table 2. We note that sample sizes differ for each variable, sometimes greatly,
because the years in which a question was asked varies.


Methodology
We follow Currie and Moretti (2003) in implementing our estimating equations. In particular, our
first-stage equation relating educational outcomes to our measures of college access takes the
following form:

(1)  = 0 + 1 2 + 2 4 + 3 4 +  +  +  +   +  .

In this equation,  represents the average education level of cohort c born in state s
observed in year t. 4 (2 ) is the number of public 4-year (2-year) institutions per capita
that each cohort would have faced at age 17 in their state of birth. 4 is defined similarly for
4-year private institutions. We call these our "college access" measures.  represents state of
birth dummies,  cohort dummies, and  year dummies.  contains additional control
variables, including dummies for gender, race, and ethnicity categories as well as age 17
controls for the state per-capita income, k-12 per pupil spending, and unemployment rate. 8


7 Currie and Moretti (2003) combine public and private 2-year institutions in their analysis. This may be
because private 2-year institutions are relatively scarce over our sample window (the per-capita average
is 5-10 times smaller than any other category). We do not include private 2-year institutions in our
analysis. However, if we combine them with 2-year public institutions, our results change little. If we allow
2-year private institutions per capita to enter as a separate independent variable in our analysis,
coefficients on 2-year public institutions are practically unchanged, but the coefficients on 2-year private
institutions are generally negatively associated with schooling outcomes. Because these institutions are
scarce, however, we are cautious about the interpretation of these effects. These results are available
upon request.
8
  Sources for these data are as follows:
                                                                                                       7



When we use NHIS data rather than Census data, Equation (1) (and Equations (2) and (3) to
follow) is modified to be at the individual level rather than the state-cohort-year level (due to its
significantly smaller sample size). Because we examine current health measures as dependent
variables in NHIS, we also include state-specific control variables in the year of observation
including the unemployment rate, the cigarette tax amount, and the beer tax amount in that
analysis.

Our models are identified by differences in education between different cohorts from the same
state observed in the same year. In particular, any difference in outcomes when college access
is the same across cohorts is proxy for the difference across cohorts who face different college
access had their access been the same. This is the standard difference-in-differences
assumption, though we note that in our context it is more accurate to say that since every new
cohort is "treated" to some extent (due to fluctuations in the number of institutions, 18-22 year-
olds, or both), we identify exposure-response relationships across cohorts.

We also examine the reduced-form impact of our college access measures on several
additional outcomes in both Census and NHIS:

(2)  = 0 + 1 4 + 2 2 + 3 4 +  +  +  +   +  .

This allows us to examine the effect of our access measures on health and labor-market
outcomes directly. Finally, we use our access measures as instruments for education to
estimate the effect of education on our outcome variables of interest:

(3)  = 0 + 1  +  +  +  +   +  .

Equations (1) and (2) are estimated via OLS, and Equation (3) is estimated via 2-stage least
squares. In all equations, standard errors are clustered at the state level to account for intra-
state correlation in errors both in a cross section and over time (Bertrand et al., 2004).

Results
1. Schooling outcomes

Table 3 contains first-stage results related to the effects of 2 and 4-year institutions per capita
on educational attainment using our full Census sample. The first column indicates that the
number of 2-year colleges per capita at age 17 reduces the probability that an individual has
less than a high-school diploma. The effect of an increase of one 2-year institution per 1,000 18-
22 year-olds in the state is -0.197. This means that an increase of 2-year institutions per 1,000
18-22 year-olds equal to one standard deviation (0.02) lowers the chances of being a high-
school dropout by about 0.4 percentage points. For a similar change in 2-year access, the
reduction in the probability of only having a high-school diploma is about twice as large. This is
accompanied by an increase in the probability of obtaining some college (0.4 percentage points)
and graduating from college (0.8 percentage points). Overall, years of schooling increase by
about 0.05 years.

Table 3 also shows that neither 4-year public nor 4-year private institutions per capita have a
significant effect on completed school years. We note that other researchers have found smaller
enrollment elasticities with respect to 4-year policy variables (e.g. tuition) than with respect to 2-
year ones (examples include Kane, 1995; Cameron and Heckman, 2001). This may be due to
the fact that because public 2-year institutions tend to be the cheapest and least exclusive form
of U.S. higher education, they attract many "marginal" college goers who are especially
sensitive with respect to factors that affect the cost of college. On the other hand, Currie and
Moretti (2003) find that both 4 and 2-year colleges per capita in one's county of residence affect
maternal schooling outcomes.

2. Identification checks

Perhaps the greatest concern regarding the validity of our identification strategy is whether an
increase in colleges per capita in a particular state should be viewed as a college supply shock
(rather than the product of rising demand). In other words, it may be that unobserved factors
correlated with both cohort schooling levels and cohort college availability are in fact driving our
results. One way to scrutinize our approach is to examine the effect of college access at
different ages simultaneously: if the number of institutions is causing college attainment and not
vice versa, then effects should be concentrated at typical college-going ages. Unfortunately, a
high degree of serial correlation in number of colleges per capita over time makes it difficult to
separately identify effects of college access at different ages.

To deal with this issue, we run our models using cohort differences in our dependent and
independent variables rather than levels. To do this, we aggregate the data to the state-cohort
level and take 3-cohort differences in years of schooling (the dependent variable) as well as
each of our independent variables. The difference in schooling years is then regressed on each
of the independent variable differences along with state and cohort fixed effects (in case such
effects are not totally time-invariant). In addition to the 3-cohort difference in public 2-year
                                                                                                              9


colleges at age 17, we include 3-cohort differences at ages 7, 12, 22, and 27 (5 and 10 years
before and after age 17). 9

Results of this exercise are shown in Figure 6, which includes point estimates and 95%
confidence intervals for each 3-cohort difference in public 2-year access at each age. The only
coefficient that is positive and statistically different from zero at the 5% level is the one at age
17. On the other hand, it is again difficult to statistically distinguish effects at age 17 from effects
at other ages (note the especially large confidence intervals for later ages). We view the results
from this exercise as providing modest support for our identification strategy.

Another way to indirectly assess the exogeneity of public 2-year colleges per capita is to
examine its correlation with other state-level factors that potentially affect the educational
attainment of cohorts. If 2-year college access were associated with observable factors affecting
educational attainment, it could indicate a correlation with unobservable drivers as well (Altonji,
Elder, and Taber, 2005; Oster, 2019). This is shown in Table 4. Each column represents results
from regressing a different dependent variable on colleges per capita and other controls. As
seen in the table, public college access is uncorrelated with age 17 measures of state k-12
spending, income per capita, the unemployment rate, and both public and private 4-year
colleges per capita. Rather, the only factor significantly associated (at the 10% level) with 2-year
colleges per capita is the number of 18-22 year-olds in one's birth state, and this effect is small
economically. 10 This analysis again does not raise concerns with treating 2-year public colleges
per capita as exogenous (see Pei, Pischke, and Schwandt, 2019).

3. Labor-market outcomes

We see from the final three columns of Table 3 that although 2-year college access is positively
related to individual income, family income, and the probability of current employment, none of
these effects are significant at conventional levels. However, this masks significant
heterogeneity by race and ethnicity. Table 5 shows results from regressions run on three
separate groups: non-Hispanic whites (hereafter referred to simply as "whites"), non-Hispanic
non-whites (who are predominantly black), and Hispanics. 11 Both whites and Hispanics
experience substantially larger effects of 2-year colleges per capita on schooling and adult
income measures than do non-Hispanic blacks and members of other races. An increase of
0.02 2-year institutions per capita raises white individual income by about 1% and Hispanic
income by about 3.5%. 12

We are unsure of the reason(s) why 2-year college access fails to affect the educational
outcomes of black individuals, though this finding is consistent with Currie and Moretti (2003).

9 In this analysis, we only include public 2-year institutions in the regressions, though results with the
other institutions types in the regressions are similar (available upon request).
10 The coefficient indicates that a one standard deviation increase in public 2-year colleges per 1,000 18-

22 year-olds is associated with a decrease of about 22 individuals.
11 Roughly two-thirds of Hispanics report their race as white.
12 We also tried estimating our regression model for males and females separately, but we found very

similar effects across gender. These results are available upon request.
                                                                                                 10


We believe this is an important question to examine in the future, especially because recent
interventions to promote college attainment suggest that treatment effects are no different for
white and non-white students or perhaps even larger for the latter group (Carrell and Sacerdote,
2017; Denning, 2017; Evans et al., 2018).

Table 6 examines how 2-year college access affects the schooling and labor-market outcomes
of whites and Hispanics across the age distribution. For this exercise, we split the sample into
the following categories (age 30 and under, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, and 61 and above). 13 As seen
in the table, the effect of 2-year college access on schooling is roughly similar across age.
However, income and employment effects vary largely over the age distribution in a way that we
would expect: effects are hump-shaped over the age range. In particular, we see strong effects
on individual and family income as well as employment for adults in their prime working years:
31-50 and to a lesser extent 51-60. Effects for younger individuals (who are new to their careers
and may not yet have overtaken peers with less education but more experience) and older
individuals (who are likely to retire) are smaller and generally insignificant.

Table 7 complements Table 6 by using Equation (3) to estimate the effect of schooling on log
individual income using our measure of public 2-year college availability as an instrument for
attainment (since public and private 4-year availability are not consistently correlated with
attainment, they are not used as instruments). Again, this analysis is performed on our white
and Hispanic subsample. We see that the IV result indicate an additional year of schooling
leads to an increase in annual earnings of 13.7%. To put this results in context, our financial
returns-to-schooling estimate is in the range of IV estimates found in the literature (Card, 2001;
Oreopoulos and Petronijevic, 2013).

4. Health outcomes

In dividing our NHIS sample into the three racial/ethnic groups used in our ACS analysis, we
find that 2-year college access is again predictive of later educational attainment for non-
Hispanic whites (Table 8, column 1). 2-year colleges per capita does not increase the
educational attainment of non-Hispanic non-whites (see Appendix Table 1), which is again
consistent with our ACS results. In the case of Hispanics, however, we now find no evidence of
a positive effect of 2-year access on years of schooling, which contradicts our Census results
(see Appendix Table 2). This finding is puzzling, but may be explained in part by the difference
in sample time frames: in fact, when we run our Census analysis on Hispanics using only years
up to and including 2000, the positive effect of 2-year access on years of schooling diminishes
and becomes insignificant at conventional levels. 14 As a results of these first-stage findings, we
focus our main analysis on the health outcomes of non-Hispanic whites (Appendix Tables 1 and
2 show that for black and Hispanics, 2-year institutions per capita has no statistically significant
effects on health outcomes that are found to be statistically associated with 2-year access for
whites).


13   The oldest cohort in our data was 72 as of the last survey used (2015).
14   This appears to be a result of the effects being larger for younger Hispanic cohorts.
                                                                                                  11


The other columns in Table 8 show how college access affects three behaviors that are strongly
associated with health outcomes: whether an individual engaged in binge drinking at least once
in the past month, whether she is a current smoker, and the number of times she performed
moderate or strenuous exercise in the past week. Binge drinking is found to be unrelated to 2-
year college access, but the latter two behaviors are. The coefficients imply that a one standard
deviation increase in 2-year colleges per capita lowers the probability of current smoking by 1.4
percentage points and raises exercise frequency by 0.22 occasions (a 5% increase relative to
the mean).

Table 9 is similar to Table 8 but shows results from models in which health conditions or
outcomes are the dependent variables. The first of these is self-reported health (a binary
variable indicating excellent or very good health, the top two of five possibilities), and we again
find an effect of 2-year college access on this variable for whites. The coefficient indicates that a
one standard deviation increase raises the probability of excellent/very good health by about 0.7
percentage points. There are negative but imprecisely estimated effects of 2-year access on
obesity, the occurrence of 7 or more bed days in the past year, having at least one hospital stay,
and the presence of activity limitation. However, it is associated with the occurrence of 4 or
more visits to a healthcare professional in the previous year. Given that doctor visits and
hospital stays are determined in part by out-of-pocket costs in addition to health problems, these
effects are perhaps more surprising given that more educated individuals are generally more
likely to be insured and have more generous coverage over this time period (Assaf et al., 2009).

Table 10 continues this analysis by showing the effects of colleges per capita on nine different
categories of chronic conditions. In at least the first three cases (asthma/allergies, learning
disability, or birth condition), we would not expect to find any effect of education via college
access on these outcomes. This is because they are either present at birth or typically develop
in childhood. Indeed, we find no effect of 2-year college access on these kinds of conditions.
The next two outcomes, the past occurrence of a cardiac event (heart attack, stroke, etc.) and
the past occurrence of cancer are in part determined by lifestyle decisions that could be affected
by schooling. However, they are still relatively rare in such a young sample (mean age of 36
across the entire dataset with the oldest cohort being 57 in 2000). We again find no effect of
college access on these outcomes.

The last four conditions, in addition to affecting one's present health, are also pre-cursors to
more serious health conditions and mortality: the presence of a cardiovascular condition (e.g.,
diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease), respiration condition (e.g., emphysema, chronic
bronchitis), "other" condition (e.g., arthritis), and "major" depression. Only one of these
conditions is found to be affected by public 2-year access (cardiovascular condition). This could
be due to schooling's effect on smoking and exercise shown in Table 7. We do not find any
effect on "major" depression, but a lack of data on other measures of mental health (save self-
reported overall health) preclude us from being able to look at schooling and mental health more
generally.
                                                                                                 12


Of the 13 behaviors and conditions we might reasonably expect to be correlated with schooling
via 2-year college access, 5 are found to be statistically significant at the 5% level or better. If
we adjust the p-values associated with each null hypothesis of zero effect for multiple
hypothesis testing using the Holm-Sidak method, only one (4 or more healthcare visits) survives
at the 5% level. However, we note two important caveats: first, an effect of schooling on some of
these conditions, including activity limitation, the occurrence of a cardiac event, or bed days,
might only show up at later ages. Given the age distribution of individuals in our sample, we
must leave the exploration of this possibility to future research. Second, the finding that
schooling affects smoking (when it causes individuals to change schooling "tracks") but not
obesity is consistent with the literature (see Galama, Lleras-Muney, and van Kippersluis, 2018).

We also examine the effects of 2-year college access on health outcomes by gender (Table 11)
and age (Table 12). In each case, we examine only those behaviors and conditions that are
found to be significantly affected by 2-year access in the whole sample (there are only two
cases total in which the coefficient is statistically insignificant for the entire sample but is
significant for one of the separate groups in Tables 11 and 12). As seen in Table 11, the effect
of 2-year colleges per capita on years of schooling is roughly twice as large for men as it is for
women. Nevertheless, 2-year access has a larger effect on the health outcomes of women in
three out of five cases (doctor visits, smoking, and cardiovascular condition). In every case,
however, the signs of the coefficients are the same across gender.

Turning attention to the results by age in Table 12, where we divide the sample into individuals
35 and younger and those over age 35, we see a substantially stronger effect of 2-year access
on schooling for the younger group. Though the effect for those over 35 remains positive, it is
not significant at the 10% level. This is in contrast to our ACS results, where we find similar
effects by age category (our ACS sample, however, contains 2001-2015, which our NHIS
sample does not). Given the much larger effect on education, it is natural to expect the health
effects of 2-year college access to also be concentrated among younger individuals. This,
however, is countered by the possibility that there is more "scope" for affecting the health of
older individuals, since health conditions are sometimes only manifest at later ages. In actuality,
we find larger effects (in terms of point estimates) on the younger group in all cases but one: the
presence of a cardiovascular health condition. This is not surprising given the relatively lower
risk of such conditions among young people (Kannel and McGee, 1979).


Conclusion
Making use of changes in the accessibility of 2 and 4-year colleges over time and across states
with Census and ACS data, we find that public 2-year colleges per capita at the time an
individual was 17 years old has a significant effect on their schooling and, for some groups,
adult earnings and employment. Our estimates imply substantial market returns to higher
education, which is consistent with many papers in the returns-to-schooling literature.
Furthermore, using NHIS data, we find that public 2-year access improves the health behaviors
and outcomes later in adulthood--it reduces the likelihood of smoking, increases exercise
frequency, and is associated with better self-reported health.
                                                                                                        13



Our paper has implications for the current debate surrounding how to improve higher education
enrollment and completion in the U.S. In particular, we find that public 2-year college
accessibility is a key driver that induces individuals who would not have otherwise attended
college to enroll. In our data, educational and post-educational outcomes improve overall when
more 2-year colleges are available despite some individuals possibly substituting 2-year
schooling for 4-year schooling, which some studies suggest is detrimental to final schooling
levels and other outcomes (Reynolds, 2012; Zimmerman, 2014; Goodman, Hurwitz, and Smith,
2015). 15

Given that there are many more 2-year colleges now than at the beginning of our sample period
(1960), a key question for future research is to determine whether increasing access to 2-year
institutions in other ways has similar effects to what we measure in this paper. One possibility is
to make community colleges tuition-free, as has been proposed by former president Barack
Obama and enacted in New York, Tennessee, and Oregon for many families. 16 Recent work
has suggested that 2-year tuition reductions can have significant impacts on college attainment
(Denning, 2017). Other possibilities include efforts to make the financial aid process easier for
prospective college goers, which has been shown to have large net benefits (Bettinger et al.,
2012; Marx and Turner, 2017). Whether individuals who are affected by such policies
experience different labor-market or health outcomes later in life is a question for future
research.




15 This is consistent with Jepsen, Troske, and Coomes (2014) and Belfield and Bailey (2017), who find

substantial monetary returns to 2-year schooling specifically for those who otherwise would not have
attended.
