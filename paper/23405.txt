Disability insurance take-up has expanded substantially in the past twenty years in the United
States while shrinking in Canada. We empirically assess these trends by measuring the strength of
the ‘push’ from weak labor markets versus the ‘pull’ of more generous benefits. Using an
instrumental variables strategy comparing benefit changes across country, age, and year, we find
that both benefits and regional wages matter. Simulations suggest that the upswing in disability
insurance take-up in the United States would be reversed, dropping the caseload by one third, if
benefits and wages had followed the growth path observed in Canada.

1. Introduction
The emerging debate about the economic and social withdrawal of prime-age workers

encompasses several possible contributing factors, ranging from trade, to technology, to

income support policy.1 Public disability insurance is often raised in this context in the

United States, in light of the sharp upward trend in the use of disability insurance since

the early 1990s. In Figure 1 we graph the incidence of disability insurance benefits in the

United States and Canada using administrative sources, separately for men and women

over ages 30-59 from 1970 to 2015. Since 1990 in the United States, the disability

insurance take-up rate for men has increased by two thirds, while for women it has more

than tripled. In Canada, disability insurance uptake rose through 1995, and then fell back

slightly for men, while leveling out for women. Coile, Milligan and Wise (2016)

document declining disability insurance take-up rates in most European countries.

Through the 1990s and 2000s, Sweden, the UK, Italy and Germany are characterized by

the same inverted U-shaped pattern in disability insurance participation among older men

as in Canada. It is the United States that is the clear outlier on disability insurance among

OECD countries.



The contrasts across Canada and the United States are striking, and reveal an opportunity

to explore the causes of the observed disability insurance trends. In particular, two

leading explanations in the US literature can be assessed by comparing the US to Canada.

First, the decline of mid-skill employment opportunities might ‘push’ workers onto

and Autor (2011) and Autor and Dorn (2013). Recent public debate can be found in Summers (2016) which
discusses the book “Men without Work” (Eberstadt 2016).

disability insurance. While Canada has not been immune to labor market pressures on

lower-skilled workers, the resource boom of the 2000s had a beneficial impact on these

workers in some regions of Canada. The resulting earnings gap between some Canadian

and American regions could explain some of the differences in trends. Second, benefit

generosity might ‘pull’ workers into disability insurance receipt. In the United States,

benefit generosity has increased over the last twenty years, while declining in Canada.

Again, this basic explanation could contribute to the differences in disability insurance

uptake in Canada and the US.



Previous evidence strongly suggests that both the stringency with which fitness to work is

assessed and also the generosity of benefits has some influence on labor force

withdrawal.2 In the US, Autor and Duggan (2003) found reduced screening stringency,

declining demand for less-skilled labor, and increases in replacement rates from disability

insurance increased the likelihood of high school dropouts to exit the labor force. Duggan

and Imberman (2009) showed that eligibility changes, economic conditions and increased

replacement rates were important factors in the growth of SSDI growth among men,

while increased coverage because of higher employment was important among women.

Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2013) have found benefit receipt by those on the margin of

disability benefit entry substantially reduces employment. Maestas, Mullen and Strand

(2015) show that disability insurance claims tend to rise in times of high unemployment

(although many applications for disability insurance induced by the Great Recession were

denied). In Canada, the evidence is more mixed. Gruber (2000) examines benefit

  For older workers, European evidence finds that older workers may use disability insurance as a pathway
to early retirement. See Coile, Milligan and Wise (2016) for a discussion of older workers.

generosity in Quebec relative to the rest of Canada prior to 1987 and finds a large

increase in labor market non-participation in response to higher benefits. Campolieti

(2004), however, examines an earlier increase in Quebec’s benefit generosity (in 1973)

and finds no such relationship. Campolieti and Riddell (2012) examine earnings

exemptions and found these have an effect on the likelihood of disabled beneficiaries to

work, but do not affect flows on or off disability rolls.



Our paper aims to assess the role of both the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors on disability

insurance take-up in the United States and Canada. We use large-scale microdata surveys

of incomes and labor market activity over the period 1996 to 2016 and a quasi-

experimental research design that exploits both policy differences and international wage

trends. Our contribution to the literature examining the impacts of disability insurance

programs begins with our ability to separately identify the effects of benefit levels and

earnings opportunities on disability insurance take-up rates. Moreover, our use of Canada

as a control group strengthens our quasi-experimental approach to identifying these

‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors.



We find that both push and pull factors matter significantly in explaining the take-up of

disability insurance benefits. The differing trends in regional labor markets and benefit

generosity can explain almost all of the upswing in disability insurance participation in

the United States—if wages and benefits had followed Canadian patterns, disability

insurance uptake would be about 32 percent lower than currently observed.




                                              4
We begin with a description of the disability insurance programs in Canada and the

United States. Following that, we explore the trends in earnings, disability insurance

benefits, and disability insurance uptake across subgroups in the two countries. We then

proceed to describe our empirical strategy and present our main empirical results. Finally,

we simulate paths for disability insurance uptake using counterfactual paths for earnings

and benefits based on the actual observed trends in the neighboring country.



2. Disability Insurance Programs and Earnings

Disability insurance arose as part of the social insurance structure of industrialized

countries through the 20th century, driven by a desire to provide income support to those

no longer able to work because of poor health. Typically, these plans are contributory

with benefits geared to some function of lifetime earnings. The Canadian and American

public disability insurance plans conform to this international pattern in general, but there

are subtle differences in how the programs are implemented. We set out key details of the

Canadian and American public disability plans in this section, with an emphasis on plan

details after 1996. Further details can be found in Baker and Milligan (2012) Milligan

and Schirle (2016), Milligan (2012), Coile (2016) and Campolieti and Riddell (2012).




A. Canada / Quebec Pension Plan Disability Insurance

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) was introduced in 1966, with both a retirement and also

a long-term disability insurance component (referred to as CPP-D). Workers began

making contributions in 1967 and disability benefits began in 1970. Quebec administers

its own disability insurance program as part of the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP-D), which
                                              5
operates in the province of Quebec in parallel to the CPP. Since the late 1980s, the two

disability insurance programs have been nearly identical in terms of their benefit

formulas, with some small differences in eligibility criteria.



The disability benefit has two components. The first component offers a flat-rate benefit

that is indexed to the consumer price index. In 2016, the flat rate portion offered

CAD$471 per month. The second component offers 75 percent of what would be an

individual’s retirement benefit, allowing for a truncated contribution period to the time of

disability claim. Retirement benefits are calculated as 25 percent of average covered

earnings. In 2016, this second component reached a maximum of CAD$819 per month.

The CPP-D and QPP-D programs also offer a child benefit, adding CAD$238 and

CAD$76 per month, respectively, for those with dependent children (under age 18 or

students age 18-25).



To determine average earnings (the second component of the disability benefit), one

begins by establishing the relevant contribution period, which is the time since the

individual turned 18 or 1966 (whichever is later). To update nominal earnings in the

contribution period, earnings are multiplied by the ratio of a five-year average of the

earnings cap to each year’s earnings cap. This earnings cap, known as the year’s

maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE), was CAD$54,900 in 2016 and is indexed

annually to a measure of average wages. Until 1997, a three-year average of the earnings

cap was used to update earnings. This was adjusted to a four-year average in 1998 and

then the five-year average in 1999. Individuals may drop years from the contribution

                                              6
period associated with care of their young children. Some low-earnings years are then

dropped for individuals with at least 10 years in their contribution period. Until 2011,

15% of months were dropped. This increased to 16% for 2012-13 and 17% for 2014-15.

The remaining contribution period is used to obtain the average indexed monthly

earnings (AIME).



An individual’s benefit from CPP-D and QPP-D can be summarized as



                 (1) Disability Benefit = Flat rate + 0.1875 * AIME + child benefits



For the CPP-D, eligibility for the benefit requires that an individual has a disability that is

both “severe and prolonged”.3 Severe implies the disability regularly stops the individual

from doing any type of substantially gainful work. Since 1995, the medical adjudication

process does not account for socio-economic factors in assessing disability. The QPP-D

also has a medical adjudication process, but appears to allow greater flexibility in the

process. This 1995 change coincides with a sharp change in the timepath of CPP-D

uptake as seen in Figure 1.



Eligibility also depends on labor force attachment. Until 1996, individuals had to

contribute to CPP in two of the previous three or five of the previous ten years to qualify.

In 1997, eligibility was restricted to those with contributions in four of the last six years.

In 2005, this requirement was loosened a bit, allowing those with 25 years of

                                                      7
contributions to CPP and contributions in three of the last six years to be eligible. In

Quebec (since 1993), individuals are eligible if they made contributions in two of the

previous three or five of the previous ten years.



In Canada, there are few other public programs that offer long-term disability insurance

so broadly. At the federal level, the Employment Insurance program offers up to 15

weeks of unemployment insurance benefits (with up to 55% earnings replacement) to

individuals who cannot work because of sickness or injury. For disabled individuals who

continue to work with relatively low income, some financial assistance is offered through

the Working Income Tax Benefit Disability Supplement (a refundable tax credit).

Otherwise, disability programs vary across provinces. Individuals with work-related

injuries may qualify for benefits under provincial workers’ compensation programs.

Income-tested disability benefits are also offered through income support programs

(social assistance or welfare) that typically do not depend on work histories.




B. Social Security Disability Insurance

Social Security provisions for disability insurance (SSDI) were introduced in 1950, with

major reforms enacted in the 1970s and 1980s. The main disability benefit formula has

not changed substantially since and primarily depends on an individual’s average covered

earnings.



To determine average earnings, covered nominal earnings in the individual’s earnings

history (up to the annual maximum taxable earnings, or AMTE, which was US$118,500
                                              8
in 2016) are multiplied by the ratio of average wages two years prior the claim (or age 60,

whichever is earlier) to past average wages.4 More recent wages are not adjusted.

Individuals can drop out up to 20% (maximum 5 years) of low earnings years from their

history. The remaining period (at least two years) is used to obtain their average indexed

monthly earnings (AIME).



This average then enters a progressive non-linear benefits formula, summarized as



(2)                       Disability Benefit = 0.9*min(AIME, BEND1)

                                     + 0.32*max(min(AIME-BEND1, BEND2-BEND1),0)

                                     + 0.15*max(AIME-BEND2,0)



BEND1 and BEND2 are “bend points” in the benefit formula. In 2016, the first bend

point was set at US$856 per month and the second was set at US$5,157. These bend

points are indexed to average wages. This reliance of the formula on average wages is

particularly noteworthy since income growth among the highest earners has increased

average wages while median wages have stagnated.



Eligibility for the SSDI benefit requires that a person’s disability prevents him or her

from doing work done before, and is unable to adjust to other work because of the

medical condition. Furthermore, the disability is expected to last for at least one year or

result in death. Consideration is given to socioeconomic factors, including age, education,

Statistical Supplement, Table 2.A8, found at

                                                   9
past work experience, and transferable skills in determining ability to adjust to other

work.



Eligibility also depends on previous labor force attachment. Requirements depend on the

age at the time of making a claim, but generally need to have worked in 5 of the previous

10 years.



The availability of other disability benefit programs varies by state, but is broadly similar

to programs in Canada. Some short-term disability insurance is offered through

unemployment insurance programs, covering non-work related illness or injury. For

example, California offers up to 52 weeks of disability benefits with up to 55% of

earnings replacement.5 For work-related injuries, individuals may seek benefits under

state-level workers’ compensation programs. For disabled individuals lacking strong

work histories, individuals may qualify for Supplemental Security Income (a federal

program).




C. Canada-U.S. Benefit Differences

One of the key differences between CPP-D and SSDI is the adjudication of claims. In

Canada, since 1995, eligibility is primarily based on a medical assessment. While a

disability must prevent one from working to be eligible for CPP-D, little consideration is

otherwise given to socioeconomic factors after 1995. The downturn in CPP-D benefit

                                              10
receipt after 1995 is in part attributed to the 1995 reform in the medical adjudication

process—in particular the more stringent screening led to a decrease in hard-to-diagnose

conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders (Campolieti 2002; 2006). In contrast, the

United States loosened the stringency of its screening in 1984 (see Coile 2016) which is

one of the forces underlying the surge in SSDI take-up in the United States (Autor and

Duggan 2006).



Another key difference between the CPP-D, QPP-D, and SSDI lies in their benefit

formulas. While the CPP-D and QPP-D formula is a simple linear function of earnings,

the SSDI formula is progressively non-linear as the replacement rate increases at each

bend point. Furthermore, SSDI covers a much higher level of earnings than does CPP-D

and QPP-D. Over the period we study since 1996, however, the general structure of the

benefit formulas has not changed substantially in either country.



In the CPP-D, QPP-D, and SSDI formulas, key parameters are automatically adjusted,

and are indexed to a measure of average wages. It is important to consider, then, that real

average wages have trended quite differently in each country. Because average wages

affect the benefit formula mechanically, the differential trends in average wages have a

mechanical impact on benefit formulas. These trends are discussed in later sections.



3. Data

We use several data source in this study. First, to describe trends in disability insurance

take-up, we rely primarily on administrative data and population estimates. The Social
                                             11
Security Administration (SSA, 2015) provides the historical estimates of the number of

disability insurance recipients, by sex and age in the United States. We use population

estimates from the Census Bureau to form the denominator of our take-up rates.6

Administrators of the Canada Pension Plan published estimates of the number of

disability insurance recipients, by age and sex, in statistical bulletins until 2011 (HRSDC,

2011). We obtained more recent tabulations directly from Employment and Social

Development Canada, responsible for the administration of CPP and use population

estimates provided by Statistics Canada.7



For the bulk of our analysis, we use pooled cross sections of the U.S. Current Population

Survey’s (CPS) March Supplements (1996-2016) and Canada’s Survey of Labour and

Income Dynamics (SLID) public-use files (1996-2011) and Canadian Income Survey

(CIS) public-use files (2012-2014). Each of the surveys provides basic demographic

information (age, education, region of residence) and detailed income information. Our

main sample includes individuals aged 25-59. We also make use of the Canadian Labour

Force Survey (1996-2016) for our analysis of labor supply, since it gives us more detail

on labor market attachment.



We start our analysis in 1996 for several reasons. First, it places our analysis after the

1995 reforms to CPP-D stringency in Canada.8 Second, the data we use for Canada is

recovered following the 1990-91 recession. Moreover, OCA (2016) estimates of disability termination rates
indicate the majority of CPP-D benefits terminate within the first and second year of benefit receipt.

available starting in 1996. Third, 1996 is early enough to capture most of the upswing in

SSDI for both men and women in the United States.



From the CPS and SLID/CIS surveys, we can observe the receipt of benefits from Social

Security (for the US) and Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (for Canada). One important

shortcoming of our data sources is that they do not always distinguish between disability

benefits, retirement benefits, and survivor benefits. Our age selection criterion has an

upper limit at age 59, which rules out retirement benefits as a possibility in either Canada

or the United States. However, survivor benefits could be payable to those with a

deceased spouse, even if the survivor is under age 60. We address how survivor benefits

may affect our analysis by performing robustness checks. In particular, our US data from

2001 forward reports SSDI receipt separately, so we can assess the importance of using

the more general SS variable. For men, about 82 percent of Social Security benefits in the

age range in our data represent disability insurance; for women it is about 69 percent. The

lower proportion for women reflects the higher incidence of survivor benefits for women

than for men.



The CPS and SLID/CIS allow us to account for several characteristics of individuals in

our analysis. We account for demographic characteristics using available variables on

marital/common law status, gender, and education categories.9 We form age groups with

five-year age clusters, ranging from 25-29 to 55-59. We also make use of regional

variation in our data. For Canada, we use the five regions delineated by Statistics

Canada.10 For the United States, we use the nine census divisions.11 In the rest of this

paper we refer to all of these fourteen areas as ‘regions’.



4. Trends in Earnings, Benefits, and DI Takeup

In this section, we examine the trends in earnings and in disability insurance benefits in

order to provide context to the disability insurance uptake decision and to motivate our

empirical strategy. For earnings, we show the differences through time across education

level and geography, while for benefits we focus on the difference in the benefit

generosity across age groups. The lower is earnings growth, the more we expect weak

earnings prospect to push individuals into DI receipt. The higher is benefit growth, the

more we expect individuals to be pulled into DI receipt.



We begin with growth in median earnings across education groups in Figure 2, using

both sexes and ages 25-59 separately for Canada and the US. We include only those

observations with positive earnings. For Canada in panel A, the dashed line represents

movements in the 3-5-year average YMPE that is used in the adjustment of earnings

histories (indexed here in the graph to 1996=100). We see that the real value of the

YMPE was falling slightly through most of the 2000s, only recovering to its 1996 levels

by 2013. This trend in YMPE largely reflects a period of low wage inflation, relative to

price inflation, in the early 2000s. The flat rate portion of the disability benefit is held

 The US Census divisions are: New England, Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic, East South Central, East

constant in real terms since it moves with the consumer price index, and the earnings-

related portion of the benefit moves with average wages. A lack of movement in the real

value of the YMPE will translate into a lack of movement in the real value of disability

benefits. Earnings using our measure grew more quickly than the YMPE for most of the

time period, with the higher-educated groups showing the lowest gains.12



In Panel B of Figure 2 we show the same data for the United States. The dashed line

represents movements in the first bend point of the benefit formula. Both bend points in

the formula move with the same measure of average wages, also used to update earnings

histories. In the United States, we see that average wages rose substantially, by more than

20% over the 1995-2015 period. This increase in the bend point means that the real value

of disability benefits, by virtue of the benefit formula, also increased. For earnings, we

see a separation between the Social Security bend point and median earnings across

education groups starting in about 2000. After 2000—and especially after 2007—the

median earnings started to fall in each education category, with the biggest decrease in

the lower education categories.



The regional dimension of earnings growth uncovers vast differences. Again, we put the

two sexes together and use the age 25-59 sample of individuals with positive earnings. In

Figure 3, we draw a separate line for each of the five Canadian regions (dashed lines) and

the nine US census divisions (solid lines). The growth is fairly uniform until 2002 when

12
   The YMPE is based on the year-over-year (using June numbers) growth in the industrial aggregate
average wage. This industrial aggregate covers workers of all ages, does not include the self-employed, and
is an average. So, the measure is not exactly aligned with what we measure in Figure 2 using the
SLID/CIS. This may explain why the YMPE trails the median earnings in each category for men and
women.
                                                    15
some regions begin strong growth and others fall off. We have highlighted in thick lines

the Canadian Prairie region and the US East North Central division of the Midwest region

in order to contrast the extreme regions.13 By 2014, the Canadian Prairie region had seen

earnings growth of 42 percent over 1996 levels, while the East North Central division

saw only 10 percent growth over 1996 levels by 2016, and had still not surpassed the

earnings level seen in 2002. Within Canada, the Atlantic region saw nearly as high

growth as the Prairies, while the other regions more resembled the US. The best

performers in the US were concentrated in the West.



We now turn to the time patterns of disability benefits. In Canada, the main change in the

formula over time was a small decline, then recovery in the YMPE. In the United States,

the average income indexing of the SS bend points is the largest source of benefit

variation. These differences have a different impact for younger workers and older

workers because of the way that low-earnings years are dropped—older workers may

drop more years and therefore receive a higher benefit. We simulate benefits for a

fictitious Canadian and American worker, using the same common earnings history.14 We

apply each year’s formula parameters to this common earnings history, adjusted only for

inflation. This delivers a simulated benefit that embodies only changes in the legislated

benefit rules over time and country, rather than changes in earnings.




13 The Prairie region includes Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The East North Central division
of the Midwest regions includes the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.

   For the common earnings history, we take the earnings history for the 1950 male birth year cohort in the
United States. We then update it for inflation to cover all relevant birth cohorts in Canada and the United
States.
                                                    16
We graph the benefits for this common earnings history in Figure 4, separately for

Canada and the US. There are separate lines for 1996, 2006, and 2016 shown across age

groups; both panels have the same y-axis to ensure ready comparisons across the two

countries. We use 2016 US dollars for both countries. For Canada in Panel A, benefits

deteriorate between 1996 and 2006, before rebounding in 2016. The gain for a 59-year

old in 2016 over 2006 is $659 in annual benefits, or 5.9 percent. These changes are

driven by the changes in the YMPE across time. In the US in Panel B of Figure 4, there is

a strong increase in benefits between 1996 and 2006, and a more modest increase to

2016. Again, this is formula-driven through the generous indexation of the bend points.

The total gain from 1996 to 2016 for a 59-year old is $3,553, which is 18.1 percent over

the 1996 level.



To close the analysis of trends, we turn back to the DI take-up rate. In Figure 1 (discussed

in the introduction) we showed men and women had very different paths for the uptake of

DI benefits across Canada and the United States, with Canadian uptake remaining

relatively flat while uptake grew substantially in the United States. Here, we break down

the take-up rate by education group, using the sample of age 25-59 and both sexes. Figure

5 shows the take-up rate for Canada, with the level in 1996 set to 100. There was some

increase in the take-up rate of around 30 percent between 1996 and 2001 for all education

groups, but since then the rates have diverged. The take-up rate for the middle education

group has stayed roughly constant, while for the top- and lower-education groups the

take-up rate has dropped. The bottom panel of Figure 5 reveals a starkly different pattern

in the United States. For the middle-education group, take-up increased by 64 percent in

                                            17
2016 compared to 1996, with a more modest 30 percent increase for the high-education

group, and a decrease for the lowest-education group.



Overall, this descriptive analysis has exposed strongly different trends in earnings by

region and education group, and substantial changes in the benefits delivered by the US

SSDI formula, but much less policy variation in Canada. There has also been a large

increase in DI uptake in the US, driven by middle-educated Americans. We take this

information as context for the formation of our empirical strategy in the next section

where we exploit differences across these groups.



5. Empirical strategy

Our empirical strategy is quasi-experimental, exploiting variation in policy and

international (Canada-US) earnings trends. At the core of our strategy is a differencing

framework, within which we use instrumental variables to improve our estimates. We lay

out our methods in this section, starting with the estimating equation of interest, then our

measurement of disability insurance benefits, moving on to the regional earnings measure

and then summarizing our identification strategy.




   A. Estimating Equation

We think of individuals comparing the utility associated with taking up disability

insurance against the utility associated with not taking up disability insurance (which we

term DI*). The individual’s decision will depend primarily on the replacement rate

offered by the disability insurance program, which is comprised of two parts—the
                                             18
disability benefit offered (lnDB) and their potential earnings in the local labor market

(lnEarn). The individual’s decision to take up disability insurance can be described by the

equation

                        (3) 𝐷𝐼𝑖𝑡∗ = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑙𝑛𝐷𝐵𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑙𝑛𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 .

We estimate the equation using a linear probability model.

                (4) 𝐷𝐼𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑙𝑛𝐷𝐵𝑔𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑙𝑛𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 Γ + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

Where 𝐷𝐼𝑖𝑡 = 1 when we observe receipt of CPP/QPP-D or SSDI disability benefits and

zero otherwise. As described in more detail below, we do not observe all individuals’

potential disability benefits or earnings. Rather, we calculate the benefits that individuals

in the same gender-age-education-region cell would qualify for at time t. Similarly, the

earnings variable will represent average earnings for individuals in the same gender-age-

education-region cell at time t. In the vector 𝑋𝑖𝑡 we include dummy indicators for marital

status, gender, education, region, age, and year. Also in 𝑋𝑖𝑡 is the log mortality rate, as an

objectively measurable control for health differences across gender, age, and country.




   B. Disability Insurance Benefits

The disability insurance benefits for which one is eligible depends on one’s earnings

history, the benefit formula in a given year, and current age. The earnings history matters

because benefits are calculated explicitly accounting for the pattern of earnings over

one’s lifetime. The benefit formula matters because it translates the earnings history into

a benefit. The age matters because younger people have a smaller number of potential

years in work, requiring them to keep more lower-earning years in their earning history,


                                              19
and thus receive a smaller benefit through the application of the formula, given the

earnings history.



Calculating the benefit as a function of one’s own earnings history introduces potential

endogeneity to the benefit calculation. Those who may have a latent disability may have

a weaker earnings history, leading to a smaller potential benefit and also a higher

likelihood of receiving benefits. To overcome this potential endogeneity problem, we

calculate a simulated benefit using a common earnings history for all people—

specifically, the average earnings for the cohort born in 1950. This simulated benefit

varies only by three exogenous factors—the system (Canada or the US), the year, and the

age. We use this simulated benefit as an instrument to predict the calculated individual

benefit.



In our empirical implementation, we control directly for each of these three factors

(system, year, and age) along with the two-way interactions of each of these three factors.

In this way, identification is driven by exogenous variation in the legislation.




   C. Regional Earnings

The second key variable we wish to relate to disability insurance take-up is the potential

earnings on offer to workers. We measure potential earnings as the average earnings

within cells defined by age group, education, gender, region, and year. Potential earnings,

however, reflect supply conditions such as human capital, experience, and other

attributes, which may not be observable. If these supply-side attributes are correlated with
                                             20
factors that also influence disability insurance take-up, we need a way to isolate variation

in earnings from these other endogenous factors. For this reason, we implement an

instrumental variables strategy, which depends on national earnings trends and fixed local

characteristics. This ‘Bartik-style’ instrument strategy is commonly used in this

circumstance.15 The Bartik instrument is constructed as

                      (5) 𝐵𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑘𝑔𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 = ∑3𝑘=1 𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑘𝑔𝑒𝑎(−𝑟)𝑡 ∗ 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑘𝑔𝑒𝑟95

Where Earn represents average earnings among individuals in industry k (primary,

manufacturing or other), in all regions of Canada and the United States other than region

r. The variable Share represents industry k’s share of the 1995 workforce in each region

in each of the k sectors. The regional earnings and industry shares are used to construct

the composite earnings measure Bartik, a weighted average of the sector level earnings

with each region’s initial sector shares used as weights. In our implementation, we repeat

this Bartik composite earnings calculation separately for cells defined by gender, age, and

education level; in each case using the national sector trends and initial regional sector

shares. This instrumental variable strategy isolates the trends in earnings from regionally-

varying unobserved factors.




     D. Identification

Our instruments are based on variation across region, year, education, age, and gender.

We include in our estimating equation the main factors underlying the variation for each

of our two instrumental variable strategies. For the simulated disability benefit, we have


15
  Bartik (1991) developed this method of isolating changes in local labor demand and has been used in a
wide range of studies including Autor and Duggan (2003), Bertrand et al. (2015), and Maestas, Mullen and
Powell (2013) with further references therein.
                                                   21
the main effects for year, age, and country. For the Bartik instrument, we have the main

effects for age, gender, education, and year. By including these main effects we can

separate the impact of benefits and earnings from the factors used as inputs for the

calculation of the instruments.



In order to fortify our empirical strategy, we go beyond this specification by also

including the second-order interactions between the main factors for each of our

instruments. In this way, our strategy is best thought of as a triple-differencing approach.

Specifically, for the disability insurance benefits we include the full set of interactions

between age and year, year and country, and age and country. For the regional earnings,

we include the full set of interactions between gender and education, education and year,

and gender and year. Earlier, Figure 4 showed the extent of our policy variation across

years for a given age and country. It is this variation that allows us to implement our

triple-difference strategy.



6. Measurement and Descriptive Statistics

As described in earlier sections, we use pooled cross sections of the CPS March

Supplements (1996-2016), SLID (1996-2011) and CIS (2012-2014) in our analysis. We

also use the LFS (1996-2016) for our final labor supply analysis. Our primary dependent

variable is an indicator for the receipt of benefits from Social Security (for the U.S.) and

Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (for Canada). Our US data from 2001 forward reports SSDI

receipt separately, so we also try specifications for the US using an SSDI receipt

indicators.

                                              22
Beyond the disability insurance variables, we also create several indicator variables for

receipt of other government benefits. For the US, this comes from the CPS; for Canada

this information comes from the SLID/CIS. We create indicators for receipt of

unemployment insurance (called Employment Insurance in Canada), welfare benefits,

workers’ compensation, and a final indicator for receipt of any government benefits.



We also use the CPS in the United States and the Labour Force Survey in Canada to form

indicator variables for attachment to the labor market. These variables are based on a

question of current labor force status, and respondents fall into three mutually exclusive

and exhaustive categories: employed, unemployed, out of the labor force. We further

subdivided the employed indicator into two categories for whether the respondent is

currently employed and at work or employed and on leave.



Our main independent variables of interest are the potential disability insurance benefits

and potential earnings. We form the disability insurance variable by attaching to each

observation an earnings history based on the average earnings of someone of the same

gender, region, education, and year of birth cohort.16 Using this earnings history, we use a

benefit calculator that incorporates the rules as they exist in each year. For potential

earnings, we take the average earnings by age group, year, gender, region, and education

group.


16
  For Canada, we use the Survey of Consumer Finances income files to extend backward to 1973,
interpolating for missing years. For years before 1973, we project backward using the consumer price
index. For the United States, we use the Current Population Survey back to 1966 and project backward
from there using the consumer price index.
                                                   23
We control for the demographic characteristics of each individual using available data.

These controls include a dummy for marital/common law status, for gender, and a set of

four dummy variables for education.17 We form age group dummies by five-year age

clusters, ranging from 25-29 to 55-59.



The final data we bring to the regression are mortality rates. We draw these data from the

Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org). These data are available separately for

Canada and the US, by age and gender, for each year.18



We present descriptive statistics on our sample in Table 1 for several samples and a

selection of our variables. Our full sample, pooling together the CPS and the SLID,

comes to 2.4 million observations. There are slightly more women than men, and

observations from Canada make up one quarter of our sample.



In our full sample, 3.6 percent are receiving disability insurance benefits. The rate of

receipt is slightly higher for women, and one third higher in the United States than in

Canada. There is a strong education gradient, with 7.2 percent of those with less than

high school receiving disability insurance, compared to 1.4 percent of those with a

college or university degree. Our regional earnings variable aims to measure the potential

earnings available to a worker in a given region, year, education, gender and age


17
   The three education categories are less than high school, high school graduate + some post-high school,
college/university degree or more.
18
   We do not have mortality data for 2015-16 for the US or from 2013-2016 for Canada. For these years, we
simply extended the most recently-observed age-sex mortality rate.
                                                   24
category. Average earnings is higher for males over females, the US over Canada, and

follows the expected positive education gradient.



The projected benefits variable reports the result delivered by our benefit calculators

given an earnings history depending on year of birth, education, gender, and region. The

average benefits are higher for males and for those with more education, reflecting higher

lifetime earnings paths for these groups. Benefits in the United States are 74 percent

larger than those in Canada, reflecting benefit formula differences across the countries.

This is a substantial and important difference. In the next row is the replacement rate,

calculated by dividing the projected benefits by the regional earnings. In the whole

sample, the replacement rate is 0.343. It is higher for women than for men, and for less-

educated workers compared to higher-educated workers.



7. Results and simulations

A. Regression results

Our regression results are presented in four tables, showing how our result varies in

different specifications and samples. Following that, we present the results of some

simulations, which help to explore the magnitudes of our estimates.



The first results are in Table 2. Each column of the table has the results of a separate

regression, with coefficients and standard errors appearing in each row. The dependent

variable in the first two columns in this table is a dummy for receiving Social Security or

Canada/Quebec Pension Plan benefits. Our first regression in column (1) has an ordinary
                                             25
least squares (OLS) regression that includes our two main variables of interest along with

a full set of controls—including the 2nd order interactions as described above. The

resulting coefficients for both the log of regional earnings and the log of disability

insurance benefits are small and statistically insignificant. The other control variables

show sensible results, with lower rates of disability insurance uptake for those who are

married and more highly educated. There is also a significant positive relationship

between the mortality rate and benefit uptake.



The second column shows the results of implementing our instrumental variables

strategy. Here, we instrument for regional earnings using the Bartik-style composite

earnings variable, and for disability insurance benefits using the simulations based on a

common earnings history. The results for both the regional earnings and disability

insurance benefits now show the expected signs and are strongly significant. The higher

are potential regional earnings, the lower is the receipt of benefits, with a 10 percent

increase in earnings predicted to lead to a 0.70 percentage point drop in take-up. The

positive 0.050 coefficient for disability insurance benefits suggests that a 10 percent

increase in the value of disability insurance benefits would lead to a half point increase in

the take-up rate.



The last two columns of Table 2 show the results of the first stage regressions in our

instrumental variables implementation. Our Bartik-style composite earnings measure,

which exploits national variation in earnings across industrial sectors, is a strong

predictor of our regional earnings measure with a coefficient of 0.644. For our simulated

                                             26
benefit derived from a common earnings history, we obtain a coefficient of 1.056,

suggesting a strong relationship between the simulated instrument and the actual benefits

for someone in that region, gender, education, age, and year category.



We display the first stage relationships in Figure 6 by collapsing the data to the region-

year level. The top panel shows the relationship between the Bartik composite earnings

and observed regional earnings. There is a clear and strong relationship evident. The

bottom panel depicts the simulated benefits and actual disability insurance benefits.

Again, there is a clear and strong relationship. In this graph, the cluster at the bottom left

are the data points for Canada, where benefit generosity is markedly lower.



The next set of results in Table 3 shows how our estimates vary across Canada and the

United States separately. We also show results combing both the regional earnings and

benefits variables into a replacement rate. The first column of Table 3 replicates our main

result from column (2) of Table 2. In the replacement rate specification, the coefficient of

0.160 implies that a ten-point increase in the replacement rate would increase disability

insurance take-up by 1.60 percentage points. With an average replacement rate of 0.343

and average take-up rate of 0.036, the implied elasticity is 1.52. It is useful to seek some

context from other estimates in the literature to understand our result better. In a survey

of the literature by Bound and Burkhauser (1999), the estimated elasticities of

applications and awards for SSDI ranged from 0.2 to 1.2. So, our estimate is outside that

range. Our estimate of the effects on disability benefit take-up rates may reflect

substitution between programs (suggested by Autor and Duggan 2003), as SSDI may be

                                              27
more generous than unemployment insurance benefits or social assistance programs. We

take up this possibility of substitution below, and also look at the ultimate impact on

labor supply. In addition, our simulations will also offer a further way to gauge the

plausibility of the magnitude of our estimates.



The next two columns of Table 3 show separately our results from our Canadian and US

samples. In these specifications, we leave out our 2nd order interactions because we are

looking at each side of our Canada-US differencing strategy separately. The coefficient

for Canada for benefits is insignificant, while for the United States the estimates are

similar in magnitude to the main specification. This does not mean that the Canadian

disability insurance program has no impact; it may be that there is not enough variation in

Canada alone across age groups and years to identify an impact.



The last column shows the results using a different dependent variable: the receipt of

SSDI rather than the more general Social Security benefit receipt we use in the other

specifications. Here, the coefficients are quite similar to those in column (3), suggesting

that the inclusion of survivor benefits as part of SS and CPP benefits in the construction

of our dependent variable does not materially affect our results.



The next table explores the results in subsamples defined by gender and education. Again

we present the results for the two main variables separately in the top half of Table 4, and

then combined into a replacement rate in the bottom half of the table. The response by

men overall seems stronger than for women as indicated by the replacement rate

                                             28
coefficients of 0.180 and 0.082. However, the coefficient for regional earnings (the

‘push’ factor) is much stronger for males while the coefficient for disability insurance

benefits (the ‘pull’ factor) is stronger for females.



Looking across education groups in Table 4, the response as indicated in the replacement

rate specification appears to be monotonically decreasing in education. For the lowest

education group, both regional earnings and benefits matter, while for those with a high

school diploma or some post-high school education are much more sensitive to the

potential disability insurance benefits than regional earnings. The point estimates for

those with a degree are very small. Since DI benefits replace a much larger proportion of

earnings for lower and middle earners than for high earners, this gradient with education

is consistent with expectations.



Finally, we turn to the broader impact beyond disability insurance receipt. We do this by

looking at other government income support programs and labor supply. We have shown

so far that there is a strong effect of the disability benefit replacement rate on DI take-up

in Canada and the United States. However, it is also interesting to consider where the

new DI recipients come from. For example, previous research has emphasized a

substitution from other government programs like unemployment insurance onto DI

(Autor and Duggan 2003). We do this with two sets of results, all presented in Table 5. In

the top panel, we examine several additional measures of public benefit receipt, ranging

from unemployment insurance to welfare receipt to workers’ compensation. In the

bottom panel of Table 5 we turn to direct labor supply measures. Here, rather than

                                              29
looking for inter-program substitution, we take the approach here instead of looking for

the ultimate response on labor supply to observe where new DI recipients are ultimately

coming from.



The income source results in Panel A of Table 5 use the full sample as before, employing

the CPS for the United States and the SLID/CIS for Canada. We present the replacement

rate specifications since this condenses the result into one key estimated parameter,

which can be compared across dependent variables. The first column reproduces our

main result from Table 2 with a coefficient estimate of 0.160. In the second column we

use an indicator for receipt of unemployment insurance income (US) or employment

insurance income (Canada).19 The estimated coefficient on UI/EI is 0.045, but it is not

statistically significant.



Next is an indicator for receipt of income from a welfare program. In Canada, these

provincial programs are typically referred to as Social Assistance. In the US, the CPS

reports receipt of public assistance of welfare income.20 The coefficient here is also not

statistically different from zero. The fourth column shows the results for Workers’

Compensation, which is also statistically insignificant. In the final column is an indicator

for the receipt of any government benefit. This includes any of the benefits in columns

(1) to (4), and also any other benefits. The coefficient here is a significant 0.275. This

coefficient is higher than the estimate for just SS/CQPP receipt in column (1), which is

19 These programs are very different across the two countries. The Canadian program features repeat claims
for seasonal employment along with parental leave benefits. This breadth of benefit coverage leads to an
average of 13.5 percent of Canadians receiving EI in our sample. The program in the United States varies
by state, but the average benefit recipiency rate is much lower at 4.3 percent
20 This CPS variable (PAW-YN) includes TANF and AFDC, as well as other welfare programs.

                                                   30
not consistent with shifting across programs. However, the standard error in column (5) is

fairly large and the 95 percent confidence interval here encompasses the 0.160 estimate

from column (1).



Panel B in the lower half of Table 5 looks at the labor supply results. The data here for

the US remains the CPS, but for Canada we switch to the Labour Force Survey (LFS).

We do this because the LFS has current labor supply variables comparable to the CPS,

while the SLID/CIS focus on annual measures. Across the table we present five

categories of labor supply. The first is whether the respondent is employed; the next two

break this down into those who are employed and at work and those who are employed

but absent (for reasons such as illness or disability, family responsibilities, vacation, or a

labor dispute). The final two columns show results using unemployed and not in the labor

force. The first, fourth, and fifth categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.



The results for employment are presented in the first column of Table 5. The point

estimate of 0.004 is very small and also statistically insignificant. The next two columns

break down employment into those at work and those absent from work. Here we see a

shift implied by the point estimates from being employed at work to being employed and

absent from work. However, only the 2nd of these effects is statistically significant. The

final two columns look at unemployment and being out of the labor force. Again, the

point estimates here reveal a substantial shift from unemployment into being out of the

labor force. The magnitude here is plausible, but this shift is not strongly statistically

significant.

                                              31
B. Simulations

In order to gauge the magnitude of our results, we present some counterfactual

simulations based on our main specification in Table 2, column (2). To form the

counterfactual, we take the initial 1996 values for benefits and regional earnings and

impose the growth rates for these variables coming from a different region or country.

This allows us to illustrate the impact of the push and pull factors on disability insurance

uptake according to our estimates.



The simulations appear in Figure 7. In the top panel, we take the baseline SSDI uptake in

the CPS for the United States. We then impose a counterfactual path for earnings in all

regions, using the earnings growth rate from Canada. This short-dashed line is about even

with the baseline until 2005, reflecting similar earnings growth in Canada and the United

States in the late 1990s and early 2000s as seen earlier in Figure 3. In the later years,

higher earnings growth in Canada pulls the predicted SSDI participation rate under the

baseline as the higher earnings moves more people off SSDI. We then additionally

impose that benefits follow the growth rate for Canadian benefits, instead of the actual

path that had benefits growing substantially in the United States. We graph this with the

long dash, and the effect is apparent—the time path for SSDI uptake is now slightly

downward at some contrast to the upward trajectory in the baseline. Much of this happens

between 1996 and 2006, as the benefit growth in the United States was concentrated in

this period as seen earlier in Figure 4. By 2014, the gap between the baseline and the

wage and benefits simulation reaches 1.1 percentage points.
                                              32
We refine this analysis by moving from countries to regions in the bottom panel of Figure

7. Here, we impose the wage growth and benefit growth of the East North Central Census

Division of the Midwest Census region of the United States onto the Prairie region of

Canada.21 As seen in Figure 3, this US region had very weak earnings growth of 10

percent over this period, while this Canadian region had very high earnings growth of

over 40 percent. The baseline is graphed with a solid line and shows a decline of over 1.5

percentage points between 1996 and 2014. When Midwest earnings growth is applied to

the Canadian Prairies in the short-dashed line, there is little difference before 2005, when

the sharp divergence in earnings drives the DI participation rate higher. Moving from the

short-dashed line to the long-dashed line, we apply the benefit growth rate of the US

Midwest to the Canadian Prairies. Again, this gap is large in particular between 1996 and

2006. Overall, the gap by 2014 is 2.7 percentage points.



These simulations provide two strong conclusions. First, the magnitude of our estimated

coefficients for regional earnings and benefit generosity is sufficient to reverse the

observed trend differences between Canada and the United States in disability insurance

uptake. Second, both the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors are important, although it is the pull of

benefits more in the first decade of our analysis while the push of weak labor markets is

more important in the more recent decade.




21For the rest of this section we refer just to ‘Midwest’ to ease the discussion. But for this analysis we
use just the East North Central Census Division. The results look very similar if the whole Midwest
Census Region is used.
                                                   33
7. Conclusions

In this paper, we explore the pull of benefit generosity and the push of regional labor

market conditions on the take-up of disability insurance benefits in Canada and the

United States. While disability insurance uptake has grown remarkably over the last

twenty years in the United States, it has shrunk in Canada. Using an instrumental

variables strategy exploiting policy variation and international earnings growth trends, we

find that both push and pull factors matter and can substantially explain the trend

differences in disability insurance take-up rates in Canada and the US. If the US had

experienced Canadian earnings growth and benefit generosity changes between 1996 and

2016, SSDI take-up would fall by about one third from today’s levels. While disability

insurance is only one factor in the greater puzzle of labor force withdrawal by middle-

skill middle-age workers, our results here suggest it may play some role.

 Notes: We report coefficients and standard errors from instrumental variable regressions
 with the indicated dependent variable. The regressions in each column, and in the top
 and bottom panel, are distinct. Regressions include same control variables as indicated
 Table 2, but the one-country samples do not include the Canada interactions or the age
 group by year interactions. Robust standard errors are clustered by region. Stars indicate
 significance at the 1 percent (3 stars), 5 percent (2 stars), and 10 percent (1 star) levels of
 confidence. Data source is the Current Population Survey for the US, and Survey of
 Labour and Income Dynamics for Canada.
