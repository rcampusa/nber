                                           ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the economic returns to parental health. To account for potential
endogeneity between parental health and child outcomes, we leverage longitudinal microdata
from Indonesia to estimate individual fixed effects models. Our results show that the economic
returns to parental health are high. We show that maternal health not only significantly affects her
children’s health, but is also intrinsically linked to her spouse’s labor market status and earnings.
Paternal health appears to be more linked to child schooling outcomes, especially for girls. When
both parents are in poor health, the negative effects on their children are compounded.
Additionally, the consequences of poor parental health are enduring. Longer-run effects of poor
parental health manifest in a lower likelihood of high school completion, fewer years of
schooling, and poorer adult health.

I.     Introduction

       Scholars and policymakers increasingly recognize that health is important not only for its

own sake, but also for its impacts on human capital development and economic well-being. Less

recognized is how an individual’s health may affect his or her family. Because the primary

income earner has traditionally been the father—especially in developing country settings—

some have surmised that paternal health may be the main determinant of familial well-being.

Indeed, previous literature has shown that health shocks to the household head could have dire

consequences for the family (Gertler and Gruber 2002). However, because mothers tend to be the

primary caregiver in the family, maternal health arguably plays a role that is at least equally

important. Mothers tend to allocate more household resources to investment in their children’s

human capital outcomes relative to fathers (Thomas 1990). In addition, the in-utero environment,

which is strongly linked to maternal health, has been shown to be crucial in later life outcomes of

the child (Almond and Currie 2011). Overall, evidence of widespread cross-generation

transmission of health from mothers to children is mounting, although the mechanisms for

transmission are not entirely clear (Bhalotra and Rawlings 2011).

       This paper attempts to provide a more comprehensive picture of how maternal and

paternal health affect household well-being. The main challenge of identifying the impact of

parental health is the issue of endogeneity, i.e., parents who invest less in their own health may

also invest less in their children’s health and human capital outcomes. Unobserved factors, such

as high discount rates or genetic factors, could influence both parental health and children’s

outcomes. We address this issue by utilizing individual fixed effects models in our main analysis

and detailed longitudinal microdata from Indonesia.




                                                 2
       Our analysis shows both paternal and maternal health are significant influences on

household welfare. First, we show that—consistent with studies from other settings—own health

matters. Regardless of gender, each parent’s health is significantly linked to his or her own labor

market activity and earnings. Next, we examine how parental health matters for other members

of the family. We show that maternal health not only affects her children’s health, but is also

intrinsically linked to her spouse’s labor market status and earnings. Paternal health appears to be

more linked to child schooling outcomes, especially for girls. However, child schooling

outcomes are substantially and negatively affected when both parents suffer health shocks,

suggesting that the role of maternal health cannot be discounted either. Health shocks to the

father negatively affect aggregate household consumption, particularly for food and education

expenditures. Because the dataset we use follows individuals over time, even after they have left

their nuclear households, we can also explore the longer-term effects of parental health. These

results suggest that the long-run effects of poor parental health may be far-reaching, resulting in

lower educational attainment and poorer adult health for their children.

       To our knowledge, this paper is the first to demonstrate both the short- and longer-run

consequences of both maternal and paternal health on important health and human capital

outcomes. Our results show that the economic returns to parental health are high. Consistent with

previous literature, an individual’s health matters significantly for his or her capital outcomes,

such as earnings and labor force participation. Moreover, the spillover effects on the rest of the

household are substantial. Both parents’ health plays an important role in a child’s human capital

production. From a public health perspective, the findings of this paper suggest that

policymakers should consider these complex and substantial spillover effects when designing

health interventions.



                                                  3
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section II briefly surveys the related literature.

Section III describes the data and identification strategy. Section IV reports and discusses the

findings. Sections V offers alternative health measures as robustness checks. Section VI presents

our conclusions.

II.    Related literature

       In developing countries where insurance and access to credit are limited, unexpected

health shocks can be financially devastating. A broad extant literature examines the extent to

which households can manage these risks ex-ante and consumption smooth ex-post. Gertler and

Gruber (2002) focus on understanding households’ ability to insure their consumption against

illness (rather than general income shocks) in a developing country context. Using data from the

Indonesian Resource Mobilization Study (IRMS), the authors found that labor supply, earnings,

and consumption are significantly and negatively associated with illness and hence reject the

hypothesis of full insurance. Subsequent papers demonstrate similar conclusions using data from

other countries ranging from Ethiopia (Asfaw and von Braun 2004; Dercon and Krishnan 2000)

to Vietnam (Wagstaff 2007) to the Western Balkans (Bredenkamp et al. 2010).

       These papers, which also reject the notion of consumption smoothing, have in turn

inspired another branch of literature that delves into the subsequent impact of such shocks on the

household. Within this literature, several papers describe the impact of parental death. Gertler et

al. (2004) analyze three repeated cross-sections of household data from Indonesia and find that a

parent’s recent death has a large negative effect on their child’s school enrollment, irrespective

of the gender of the child or the parent who dies. Case and Ardington (2006) and Chen et al.

(2009) also show that maternal death has a large negative impact on child education using data

from sub-Saharan Africa and Taiwan, respectively.



                                                 4
       A related vein of literature examines the impact of the prenatal environment on child

outcomes. Drawing from the “fetal origins hypothesis” (Barker 1995)—which posits that fetal

malnutrition could lead to poor adult health outcomes—this literature investigates the long-run

significance of the in-utero environment. Almond (2006) shows that children who were exposed

in utero to the influenza pandemic of 1918 grew up to attain fewer years of schooling. Natural

experiments utilizing in-utero exposure to famines also show that poor nutrition in utero is

associated with worse adult health and human capital outcomes (Almond et al. 2007; Chen and

Zhou 2007; Neelsen and Stratmann 2011).

       Fewer papers focus on the impact of morbidity, in part due to the endogenous nature of

illness. In other words, whether any observed correlations between parental health and child

outcomes are causal, or due to some other unobserved factors that affect both variables, is

unclear. In the context of morbidity, poor parental health could have multipronged impacts.

There may be direct out-of-pocket medical expenditures to treat the ill, in addition to indirect

costs due to potential lost wages from fewer days at work and/or lower productivity. Other

members of the household may have to take time off from work or school to care for the sick,

potentially compounding the income loss. There could be psychological costs from having a sick

parent; the quantity and quality of time spent by the ill parent with the children could be

compromised as well. Household resources may be diverted from other expenditures (such as

schooling) to medical expenses in response to the negative income shock (Frankenberg et al.

2003; Jacoby and Skoufias 1997).

       Our paper further explores the impact of both parents’ health on the family. To combat

potential endogeneity bias, we utilize individual fixed effects to exploit changes in parents’

health status over survey waves. To our knowledge, there are only two other papers that utilize a


                                                 5
similar empirical strategy. First, Bratti and Mendola (2014) employ panel data from Bosnia and

Herzegovina to investigate the effect of parental morbidity on child school enrollment. That

paper shows that a young adult (age 15–24) with an ill mother but healthy father is significantly

less likely to be enrolled in school. Second, Alam (2015) use longitudinal data from Tanzania to

find that—in contrast to Bratti and Mendola (2014)—only father’s illness reduces children’s

education by decreasing their attendance. In this paper, we build upon the existing literature to

examine the impact on parental health on their own as well as each other’s health and labor

market activity, in addition to their children’s health and educational attainment. Furthermore,

because the IFLS (Indonesian Family Life Survey) follows families over time (even children

after they are grown and split from their original family), we can examine short-term outcomes,

such as school enrollment and child health, and longer-term outcomes, such as educational

attainment. The results demonstrate that interventions that improve the health of a single

generation could potentially produce multigenerational effects.

III.   Data description and identification strategy

III.A. IFLS (Indonesian Family Life Survey)

       For this study, we use data from the IFLS, a nationally representative longitudinal survey

covering rural and urban areas. This dataset gives a nationwide sample of households spreading

across 13 of 26 provinces and represents about 80 percent of the country’s population. The IFLS

contains a wealth of socioeconomic and demographic information about each household and

detailed individual-level information on health status, education, and labor market behavior. The

first wave of the survey was conducted in 1993 (IFLS1), with three more waves conducted in

1997 (IFLS2), 2000 (IFLS3), and 2007 (IFLS4) (Frankenberg et al. 1993, 1997; Strauss et al.

2000, 2007). Importantly, the survey not only re-interviews original households sampled in the

previous wave, but also all households split off from the original households. This allows us to
                                                 6
identify the health status of parents, contemporaneous or short-run effects on their children

within the same wave, and longer-term effects (such as children’s income and schooling) even

after they become adults and split off into separate households. Further, tracking rates across

waves are very high, alleviating attenuation bias due to nonrandom attrition: 94 percent of IFLS1

households participated in IFLS2, 95.3 percent in the IFLS3, and 81.7 percent in the IFLS4 14

years later.

           In 2014, Indonesia began rolling out an ambitious universal health care program, aiming

to cover all citizens by 2019. 1 Before 2014, social safety nets and formal health insurance were

limited and high out-of-pocket health expenditures were common, hence providing an archetypal

setting to study the impact of morbidity on the household in a lower-middle-income country

(Rokx et al. 2009).

           We measure health throughout the paper in two ways. First, we use self-reported health

status. Respondents above age 15 were asked to self-assess their health in response to the

question, “Generally, how is your health?” and choose among the following four categories: very

healthy, somewhat healthy, somewhat unhealthy, and unhealthy. Parents were asked to choose

among the same categories regarding their children’s health if the children were under the age of

15. Our definition of child health is the parents’ assessment of their children’s health as reported

in the IFLS. We define an individual to be in poor health if he or she chooses somewhat

unhealthy or unhealthy. The IFLS also asked questions regarding physical functioning abilities to

perform activities of daily living (ADLs); among the ADL options, we chose to employ the

metric of a respondent finding it difficult or impossible to walk 5 km as our second marker of

poor health. 2

         Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the key variables we use. In the entire sample,

self-reported poor health is observed in around 13 percent of respondents. Twenty-six percent of

the sample report that they have difficulty walking 5 km. Note that while we have basic

demographic data for around 177,000 individuals over the four survey waves, the number of

observations available for the different regression models varies greatly depending on the

specification. For example, we have 51,479 matched observations where values of spousal health

are present and close to 80,000 observations where the mother’s health can be matched with the

individual. For many regressions, we further restrict by age (e.g., if the dependent variable is

child health). Within these restricted samples, more observations may be dropped due to lack of

other information of dependent variables or other key control variables. Tables 1–8 and

Appendix Tables 1–5 report the number of observations used in each model.

III.B. Econometric specifications

         The primary challenge of identifying the impact of health on human capital outcomes is

the issue of endogeneity—how to rule out spurious correlation from causality. For example,

health of children and their parents may correlate due to unobserved factors that lead parents to

engage in health-damaging behaviors (such as smoking), which may result in poor health, which



2
  We also experimented with measuring health using the RAND ADL index. This index comprises the ability of the
respondent to do five intermediate activities of daily living, including walking 5 km; bowing, squatting, or kneeling;
carrying a heavy load for 20 meters; sweeping house/floor/yard; and drawing a pail of water from a well. The ADL
index is then normalized to 100 using the following formula: [Max Score − Sum(Score)]/(Max Score − Min Score)
× 100. In the case of the IFLS, responses can take a value of 1if the respondent can achieve the task easily, 3 if he or
she can do it with difficulty, and 5 if he or she cannot do it at all. Hence the max score is 25 (if the respondent
cannot do any of the activities) and the minimum score is 5 (if the respondent can do all five tasks easily). When
translated into the ADL index, a score of 100 would imply the individual can complete all tasks easily, and a score
of 0 would mean the individual cannot carry out any of the tasks. Results are qualitatively similar and are available
upon request.

may further result in the parent investing less in their children’s health and human capital.

Because the IFLS follows individuals and families over time, we can employ individual fixed

effects, which relies on variation in the health status of an individual child’s parent, to identify

the impact of parental health.

           More formally, we use the following regression models to examine the effects of parental

health. When we examine the impact of own health, the regression model is simply:

(1) 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑴𝑴′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽1 + 𝑭𝑭′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽2 + 𝑯𝑯′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽3 + 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the outcome of interest of either the father or mother in year t. In these regressions,

the outcomes include the parent’s own labor force participation, hours worked, and earnings, and

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 measures whether the parent was in self-reported poor health in year t.

           When we examine the impact of parental health on other members of the family, the

regression model becomes:

(2) 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆_𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑴𝑴′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽1 + 𝑭𝑭′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽2 + 𝑯𝑯′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽3 + 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the outcome of interest of either the father or mother in year t. In these regressions,

the outcomes include the parent’s labor force participation, hours worked, earnings, and whether

the parent was in poor health. 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆_𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 captures whether the spouse was in self-

reported poor health in year t.

           When we investigate the cross-generational effects of parental health, the regression

model is represented as follow:

(3) 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑀𝑀𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒_𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒_𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑴𝑴′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽1 + 𝑭𝑭′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽2 +

𝑯𝑯′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽3 + 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where the outcomes of interest include child schooling, cognitive scores, and health measures.

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents the mother and father’s self-reported health in year t.


                                                                    9
         In all three models, we also include vectors of maternal (M′itθ1), paternal (F′itθ1), and

household (H′itθ1) characteristics. 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 represents survey year fixed effects, which help absorb any

overall changes in such outcomes over time; for example, overall child health may have

improved in Indonesia between 1993 and 2007 due to nationwide improvement in health care, or

the 1997 Indonesian economic crisis could have led to disruptions in household income across

the country. 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 represents individual fixed effects. Hence, any time-invariant factors, such as

child genetic endowments or parental attitudes to health, are accounted for in our fixed effects

estimation. 3 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents the idiosyncratic error term.

         To examine longer-run effects, we enter lagged parental health in Equation 3. Since own

health and human capital outcomes may have persistent effects extending to subsequent waves

(independent of parental health), we also control for the lagged outcome. However, since the

lagged outcomes may also be endogenous to the fixed effects in the error term, using fixed

effects models without accounting for such dynamic effects may also lead to biased and

inconsistent estimates. We hence use the Arellano-Bond estimator to allow for the potential

lagged effects of own health and schooling, while taking into account individual fixed effects

(Arellano and Bond 1990, Blundell and Bond 1998). 4

IV.      Results

         Our analysis aims to investigate how much a person’s health matters for him- or herself,

and for his or her family. To answer this question, we begin by investigating the impact of own

health. Next, we examine the impact of spousal health. We then explore how parental health

affects their children’s health and schooling and delve into how paternal and maternal health

  Because our fixed effects model exploits changes in health status, it precludes examining the impact of long-term
chronic illnesses.

  We use the user-written Stata routine xtabond2 by Roodman (2003) to perform these estimations.

differ in their impact. Finally, we examine the long-run effects of parents’ health on their

children’s educational attainment.

IV.A. Effects of own health

       We start the analysis by investigating the impacts of own health. In Table 2 and all

following tables, the odd-numbered columns report the results from OLS (ordinary least squares)

regressions and the even-numbered columns report the results from fixed effects (FE) models.

Table 2, column 1 shows that self-reported health status strongly correlates with whether the

respondent worked last week. Reporting poor health is associated with an almost 9 percent

reduction in the probability of working last week (Panel A, column 1). The estimate is smaller at

6.3 percent, but still highly significant when using fixed effects (Panel A, column 2), suggesting

that unobserved factors that cannot be captured led to a higher likelihood of both poor health and

of not working. In other words, the omitted variable biased the estimate downward (or increased

the absolute magnitude of the effect). In our preferred FE specification, poor health is associated

with an 8.7 percent reduction in the likelihood of being at work last week for men (Panel B,

column 2). Given that the mean rate of reporting working last week is 76 percent among men in

this cohort, this roughly translates into an 11 percent reduction. For women, poor health leads to

a 4.5 percent cohort, or 10 percent realized, reduction in the likelihood of working last week

(Panel C, column 2).

       Poor health is also associated with fewer hours of work for those who reported working

last week. In our preferred FE model, poor health is associated with working around four fewer

hours in a week, and the effect is statistically significant at 1 percent. The effects for men and

women are similar: working hours drop by four hours for men and five hours for women (Table

2, column 4).



                                                 11
        Indeed, the reductions in labor force participation and hours worked translate into lower

earnings. Men’s wages primarily drive this effect (columns 5 and 6). For women, the coefficient

on poor health is negative but not statistically discernible from zero. This may, however, be

driven by selection, as fewer women participate in the formal labor market. 5

        These results demonstrate that health matters for labor force participation on both

intensive and extensive margins, which in turn affects earnings. These findings are consistent

with the existing economic literature that health indeed is causally linked to labor market

outcomes in both developed and developing countries (Coile 2004; Gertler and Gruber 2002;

Thirumurthy et al. 2008).

IV.B. Effects of spousal health

        We next examine the spillover impact of spousal health on own health and labor force

status. Phrased differently, how does one’s health affect the human capital outcomes of one’s

spouse? Table 3 reports the results. The dependent variables are the same as in Table 2, while the

main independent variable is whether the spouse self-reports being in poor health. Overall,

spousal health appears not to have a discernible impact on the probability of working last week

(Panel A, columns 1 and 2). However, when we examine by gender, poor spousal health

negatively impacts men’s labor force participation by around 1.6 percent (Panel B, column 2).

Hours worked last week are also reduced by 1.3 hours (Panel B, column 4). Interestingly, for

women, the effect goes in the opposite direction: they are more likely to have worked last week

if their spouse is sick—although the estimate is not statistically significant. These women are

presumably drawn into the workforce to make up for lost spousal earnings, i.e., the so-called



5
 Reverse causality may be of concern here, i.e., being out of work leads to lower income and poorer health.
However, when we examine whether lagged values of work status affect future health, we find that that is not the
case. These results are available upon request.

                                                        12
“added worker” effect. Overall, earnings are negatively affected as well (columns 5 and 6). Our

results on spousal health and labor market responses are mostly in line with the existing

literature. Using data from the Netherlands, García-Gómez et al. (2013) find that a negative

health shock reduces men’s labor force participation by 1.5 percent, but similarly to our findings

do not find strong evidence of the “added worker” effect. Charles (1999) and Coile (2004) use

data from the Health and Retirement Survey for the US and document similar findings.

       Health between spouses correlates very strongly, both cross-sectionally and when

employing fixed effects (columns 7 and 8). Hence, not only time use (taking time off to care for

the sick spouse) may affect labor productivity, but the spouse’s health may also have a direct

impact on own health. Several studies note the concordance of spousal health, although the

precise reasons are not clear (Wilson 2002; Clark and Etilé 2005). A few potential explanations

for the phenomenon have been put forth. The first is assortative matching—i.e., people with

similar health statuses match with each other in the marriage market. Clark and Etilé (2005)

argue that assortative matching is the key reason for concordance in health in their study. The

second possible explanation is that couples may undergo similar lifestyle changes that affect

their health in similar ways. For example, couples may quit smoking or begin to exercise more at

the same time. Finally, couples may experience the same health shocks (for example, couples

may catch the same illnesses), so that health between spouses moves together.

       To better understand the relationship of health between spouses, we utilize the 2007 IFLS

wave, in which respondents were asked whether they were in an accident that limits or hinders

their daily activities. We first show that being in an accident significantly increases the

likelihood that the respondent reports being in poor health or having difficulty walking 5 km.

Then we instrument spousal health by being in an accident to examine the impact of the spouse’s


                                                 13
poor health on own health. We restrict the sample to those who were not in an accident together,

i.e., we exclude respondents who were in the same accident (such as a car accident) as their

spouse. In other words, these couples did not experience the same health shock. For the

instrumental variable strategy to be valid, we need to satisfy both the requirement of a strong

first stage and the exclusion restriction. As Table 4, Panel A demonstrates, our instrument—

being in an accident that hinders or limits activity—has considerable explanatory power, with F-

statistics generally well above 10. Given the nature of accidents, we argue that this type of health

shock can be viewed as exogenous. By excluding couples who were both in accidents in the

same year, we further argue that the accident affects own health by worsening the spouse’s

health, hence satisfying the exclusion restriction. Doyle (2005) and Mohanan (2013) employ a

similar strategy of using accidents to instrument for health shocks. The OLS results echo the

strong interspousal health correlations observed in Table 3, Panel C. However, our reduced form

(Panel B) and IV estimates (Panels D and E) in Table 4 are not statistically significant, which

precludes our ability to make any claims about whether spousal health is causally linked to own

health. The lack of clear results suggests that spousal health may be linked for other reasons,

such as correlated health shocks or concordant changes in health behaviors.

IV.C. Effects of parental health on the schooling and health of young children

       We next focus on how parental health matters for their children’s human capital

outcomes. During our sample period in Indonesia, elementary schooling and three years of

secondary schooling were compulsory. We hence divide our sample into children between ages 6

and 15, to represent the compulsory period, and youth between ages 16 and 25. Among the

sample of children, poor parental health is strongly correlated with the child not being enrolled in

school (Table 5, column 1). However, when we include child fixed effects, the negative effect is


                                                14
no longer statistically significant, suggesting that omitted variable biases or selection may be

responsible for the OLS results. In our fixed effects models, poor paternal health appears to

negatively affect girls’ school enrollment by 4 percent, but not that of boys (column 2, Panels B

and C). This could potentially be a consequence of son preference: when household income falls

due to the household head being ill, daughters are typically pulled out of school before sons.

(Björkman-Nyqvist 2013).

       While school attendance is not much affected, parental health appears to be closely linked

to child health. Interestingly, while the health of both parents is closely correlated with child

health when we look at the OLS model (column 3), the coefficient on paternal health is no longer

statistically significant when we use individual fixed effects, whereas the maternal health

coefficient remains similar and highly significant (column 4). Poor maternal health increases the

likelihood of poor child health by 5–6 percent. Both parents in poor health also increases the

probability of poor child health by 9 percent when we use fixed effects (column 4). The

difference between the OLS and FE models suggest that unobserved characteristics indeed

influence both parental health and child health. However, maternal health matters more for child

health in the short run.

       We look at two other human capital metrics: height for age (z-score) and cognitive score.

OLS results show strong correlations between paternal health and height for age, and the

relationship largely still holds when looking at fixed effects (column 5). For this metric, paternal

health appears to matter more—overall, poor paternal health reduces height for age by 0.09

standard deviations. Because an important determinant of height is nutrition, a negative health

shock to the father may reduce household income and in turn lower food consumption and

nutrition levels. We will return to this hypothesis shortly.


                                                 15
       Parental health also strongly correlates with their children’s cognitive scores (column 7).

Beginning in the second wave of IFLS, respondents between the ages of 7 and 24 were

administered cognitive tests to assess their general cognitive level and skills in mathematics.

Having a parent in poor health is associated with around a 6 percent lower cognitive score for

both girls and boys. However, both the magnitude and statistical significance of the estimates fall

when using fixed effects (column 8), suggesting again that uncaptured factors lead to poor health

in parents and lower cognitive scores in their children. That said, the coefficient on maternal

health remains negative and statistically significant for girls (Panel C, column 8).


IV.D. Effects of parental health on the schooling and health of youth

       We then move on to examine the impact of parental health on youth between the ages of

16 and 25. For older children who are beyond the age of compulsory schooling, the impact on

school enrollment appears to occur when both parents are in poor health (Table 6, column 2).

The youth’s own health is strongly linked to maternal health and having both parents in poor

health compounds the effect (column 4). Parental health does not significantly affect height for

age in this cohort (column 6). One of the largest observed effects of our analyses involves girls’

cognitive scores, which are substantially more affected by parental (especially paternal) health. A

negative health shock to the father leads to a 14 percent decrease in the daughter’s cognitive

score, and when both parents experience a negative health shock, the effect increases to 26

percent. These results compare to just a 1.3 percent decrease (ill father) and 0.3 percent decrease

(both parents) for boys. This startling disparity suggests that parental health profoundly affects

the quality and the quantity of girls’ education (column 8).

       Looking at the short-run effects of parental health, the most salient result is the effect of

maternal health on overall child health, which persists from early childhood to young adulthood.

                                                 16
For the younger cohort, a child was much more likely to be in poor health if the mother was in

poor health (5.8 percent) as opposed to the father (2.5 percent; Table 5, column 4). This finding

is true for the older cohort, as a youth was much more likely to be in poor health if the mother

was in poor health (3.8 percent) as opposed to the father (0.9 percent; Table 6, column 4).

Paternal health matters significantly as well, resulting in lower height-for-age among daughters.

Another striking result is that girls’ cognitive scores, which we interpret as reflective of the

quality of their education, seem to be more affected by parental health. Paternal health appears to

matter for children’s height (nutrition) and schooling for girls when they are young. For youth,

the impact of parental health is significant only when both parents are in poor health, but that

effect is large.

        Our schooling results contrast with those of Bratti and Mendola (2014), who find that

poor maternal health is a more important causal determinant of school enrollment than paternal

health when examining youth between ages 15 and 24, but are consistent with Alam (2015), who

demonstrate that paternal health shocks decrease children’s school attendance. In a related vein,

Case and Ardington (2006) use longitudinal data from South Africa and Kenya to show that

maternal orphans are less likely to be enrolled in school and complete fewer years of school

compared with paternal orphans. However, using the IFLS, Gertler et al. (2004) find that the

death of both parents matters for child schooling outcomes. They find that maternal death is

more significantly linked to child health measures, which is consistent with our results from table

5 that maternal health is more important for short run child health. Our results on maternal health

are also in line with Coneus and Spiess (2012), whose findings using data from the German

Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) suggest that parental health tends to be transmitted to the child

via the mother.



                                                  17
IV.E. Potential mechanisms

       What are the channels through which parents’ health influences their children’s health

and schooling? One possibility is that parents and children share similar genetic endowments.

Another is that because parents and children live in the same environment, they experience the

same household shocks or undergo behavior changes concurrently. Child fixed effects help

ameliorate the first issue, because demeaning “subtracts” any time-invariant factors such as

genetic endowments. The fact that we find stronger associations between maternal health and

child health than paternal health suggests that the channel is through maternal care rather than

correlated household health shocks.

       Another potential channel is that medical expenditures divert funds from other household

resources, such as consumption or education expenditures. We explore this hypothesis further in

an ad hoc analysis of how parental health affects various household expenditures, including

expenditures on food, nonfood (including medical expenditures), education, and vice goods such

as cigarettes and alcohol (Table 7). Since the unit of variation is now at the household level, we

employ household fixed effects in the FE models, and standard errors are clustered at the

household level.

       We find that food expenditures are not significantly affected when only one of the parents

is in poor health. However, expenditures on food fall by 11 percent when both parents are in

poor health (Column 2). At the same time, nonfood expenditures, which include medical

expenditures, increase 12–14 percent if either parent is sick. Education expenditures per

household member fall almost 16 percent when the father is sick, but not the mother (Column 6).

Interestingly, when the father is sick, spending on vice goods (cigarettes, alcohol, and betel nuts)

goes down by 25 percent, but goes up when the mother experiences a health shock, suggesting



                                                 18
that when maternal bargaining power is reduced (which it presumably is when she is in poor

health), spending may be diverted to non-child related goods (Column 8). Overall, parental

health shocks, and especially health shocks to the father, may indeed negatively impact

household food and education expenditures, which could lead to the observed effects on child

schooling and health.

IV.F. Longer term effects of parental health

         Finally, we assess the longer-term impacts of parental health. To do this, we examine the

relationship between lagged parental health and human capital outcomes. Because the first wave

of the IFLS was in 1993 and the most recent wave in 2007, the maximum number of years

between the waves is 14, meaning that a 13-year-old child in 1993 would be 27 in 2007. We

provide suggestive evidence of the longer-term impacts of parental health. Having both parents

in poor health in the previous survey wave leads to a 2.3 percentage point reduction in the

likelihood of being in school. Educational attainment is similarly negatively affected by parental

health. Children with both parents in poor health in the previous wave achieve 0.19 fewer years

of schooling (column 4). For high school completion, paternal health matters independently, and

the impact is magnified when both parents are in poor health (column 6). Finally, the effects of

parental health can be far reaching: lagged maternal and paternal health – independently and

jointly – affect own health even after controlling for lagged own health (column 8). Having

either parent in poor health during the last wave increases the likelihood of poor health by

approximately 3 percentage points. Having both parents in poor health doubles the likelihood of

poor health by an increase of 6 percentage points. 6

 Results restricting the sample to those who are 18 or above and below 50 at the time of their last appearance in the
panel show similar results.

                                                         19
V.     Using alternative health measures as a robustness check

       As a robustness check, we use alternative health measures instead of self-reported

health—specifically, the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Using self-reported

health status can be problematic because of its subjective nature, which may lead to

measurement error. In that case, attenuation bias affects both the OLS and the fixed effects

estimators, leading to a lower-bound estimate of the parental health shock. While ADL measures

are still self-reported, they are generally considered more reliable measures of health due to their

specific and more objective nature and have been used in several economic studies (e.g., Gertler

and Gruber 2002; Strauss et al. 1997). However, because observations with ADL indicators are

fewer, we rely on self-reported health in the main analysis. Following the literature, we chose the

ability to walk 5 km as the main ADL metric. Appendix Tables 1–5 report these findings.

Consistent with our main results, we find that poor parental health is strongly linked to poor

child health. As before, paternal health is more significantly linked to schooling outcomes,

whereas maternal health is more linked to child health.

VI.    Conclusion

       In this paper, we explore how parental health affects the family. Our findings suggest that

the economic returns to parental health are high, and the intrafamilial health relationship is

complex. Figure 1 recapitulates the myriad results and highlights the various pathways through

which parental health affects the household. The numbered captions below the figure describe

the result that supports the associated numbered arrow in the figure. Solid lines represent causal

pathways for which the paper provides evidence. Dotted lines represent theoretical causal

pathways that are not evidenced by these analyses and are described by the corresponding

alphabetized captions.


                                                 20
       The results of this paper further support the importance of investments in parental health

and, in particular, maternal health in developing countries where underinvestment in, and

discrimination against, mothers and daughters is systemic. The school enrollment of young

girls—but not boys—is impacted by poor paternal health, which could be a reflection of son

preference. Furthermore, a negative health shock to the father leads to a dramatic decrease in the

daughter’s cognitive score, a deficit for girls that nearly doubles when both parents experience a

health shock. As the main income earner, a father’s health largely determines the household

budget constraint and resources, which in turn affect the children’s schooling and some health

outcomes. Paternal health shocks destabilize household spending: expenditures on medicine and

medical care go up, while expenditures on food and education go down. These outcomes are

reflected in our height for age and schooling results, including a dramatic drop in education

spending per household member when the father is ill. Vice goods spending goes down when the

father is sick but goes up when the mother is sick, which is consistent with a family structure

wherein the onus is on the mother to ensure child health is a priority.

Figure 1: Causal Pathways from Parental Health to the Productivity of Children in Adulthood




   1.   Self-reported poor health decreases the probability of having worked, number of hours worked, and income
        earned in the last week (see: Section IV.A. and Table 2).
   2.   For men, poor spousal health reduces labor force participation and hours worked (see: Section IV.B and
        Table 3).
   3.   Poor paternal health reflects diminished paternal human capital and is associated with lower height-for-age
        (see: Section IV.C and Table 5).
   4.   Poor maternal health increases the likelihood of children being in poor health, in both short and long term
        (see: Section IV.C/IV.D/IV.F, and Table 5/6/8).
   5.   Lagged poor paternal health leads to poor child health, both independently and jointly with maternal health
        (see: Section IV.F and Table 8).
   6.   Negative shocks to maternal health have a negative impact on the cognitive scores of female children (see:
        Section IV.C and Table 5). Lagged poor maternal health is associated with a reduction in likelihood of
        completing high school and years of education. (see: Section IV.E and table 8).
   7.   Having a father in poor health negatively impacts girls’ school enrollment but may not significantly impact
        boys’ school enrollment (see: Section IV.C and Table 5). Cognitive scores of female youth are positively
        associated with paternal health in fixed effects (FE) models (see: Section IV.D and Table 6). Household
        expenditures on education are reduced when the father in the household is sick (Table 7). Lagged poor
        paternal health is associated with reduced educational attainment (Table 8).
   A. Health among spouses is very strongly correlated, both cross-sectionally and when employing fixed effects
      (see: Section IV.B and Table 2). However, reduced form and instrumental variable estimates fail to show a
      statistically significant impact of spousal health on individual health, precluding the ability to make a
      statement about the causal nature of this relationship (see: Section IV.B and Table 4).



                                                        22
   B. FE regressions show that women’s labor force participation increases in response to their spouse
      experiencing a negative health shock, but this result is not statistically significant (see: Section IV.B and
      Table 3).
   C. Poor maternal health reflects diminished maternal human capital but is not shown to result in a statistically
      significant decrease in height-for-age (see: Section IV.C and Table 5).

       And indeed, despite the relationship of paternal health and child capital outcomes, we

found maternal health to be the predominant factor, in terms of short run child health. As the

primary caregiver of the family, the mother’s health matters contemporaneously for child health

through young adulthood. Our results demonstrate that poor maternal health increases the

likelihood of poor child health. Further, the health of both parents matters greatly throughout

their children’s life trajectories in complementary ways. The negative effects are compounded

when both parents are in poor health. Additionally, the consequences of poor parental health are

persistent. Longer-run effects of poor parental health manifest in a lower likelihood of high

school completion, fewer years of schooling, and poorer health. Although we did not measure it

in this paper, there is growing evidence documenting the relationship between child human

capital (both health and non-health) and productivity and income of children in adulthood, so the

impacts of parental health could be even more extensive. Our paper highlights the need for more

research on understanding the interplay of intrafamilial health and the mechanisms through

which parental health matters, as the data suggests there are unobserved factors at play that have

yet to be captured. Further cost-benefit analyses of health interventions should take into account

the spillover effects of individual health on other household members.

 Notes: Every column in each panel represents a separate regression. Standard errors are clustered by person. Fixed effects are at the person level. GMM
 models are estimated using the Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel estimator (p-values of AB-GMM models testing the null hypothesis that there is no
 second order autocorrelation can all be rejected). Controls include the lagged dependent variable, gender, age, age squared, and year dummies. Underlying
 data are from the Indonesia Family Life Survey 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2007 waves.

 Notes: Every column in each panel represents a separate regression. Standard errors are clustered by person. Fixed effects are at the person level. GMM
 models are estimated using the Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel estimator (p-values of AB-GMM models testing the null hypothesis that there is no
 second order autocorrelation can all be rejected). Controls include the lagged dependent variable, gender, age, age squared, and year dummies. Underlying data
 are from the Indonesia Family Life Survey 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2007 waves.
