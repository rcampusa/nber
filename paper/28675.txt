                                         ABSTRACT

We show that the COVID-19 pandemic brought house price and rent declines in city centers, and
price and rent increases away from the center, thereby flattening the bid-rent curve in most U.S.
metropolitan areas. Across MSAs, the flattening of the bid-rent curve is larger when working
from home is more prevalent, housing markets are more regulated, and supply is less elastic.
Housing markets predict that urban rent growth will exceed suburban rent growth for the
foreseeable future.

I     Introduction

Cities have historically been a major source of growth, development, and knowledge
spillovers (Glaeser, 2011). In developing and developed countries alike, rising urban-
ization rates (United Nations, 2019) have led to increased demand for real estate in city
centers and contributed to problems of housing affordability (Favilukis, Mabille, and
Van Nieuwerburgh, 2019), especially in superstar cities (Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai, 2013).
The inelasticity of housing supply in urban centers means that a large fraction of economic
growth in the last few decades has accrued to property owners, rather than improving
the disposable income of local workers (Hornbeck and Moretti, 2018; Hsieh and Moretti,
2019).
    This long-standing pattern reversed in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic led many res-
idents to flee city centers in search of safer ground away from urban density. This urban
flight was greatly facilitated by the ability, indeed the necessity, to work from home. Of-
fice use in downtown areas was still below 25% in most large office markets at the end
of 2020, with New York City at around 10%, and San Francisco lower still, turning many
temporary suburbanites into permanent ones.1 We document that this migration had a
large impact on the demand for suburban relative to urban real estate, and differential
price impact in different locations within metropolitan areas.
    An important question is whether real estate markets will return to their pre-pandemic
state or be changed forever. There is much uncertainty circling around this question. Ex-
isting survey evidence indicates an increased willingness by employers to let employees
work from home, and increasing desire to do so from employees, but without much ev-
idence on lost productivity.2 In this paper, we argue that by comparing the changes in
    1 According to JLL, U.S. office occupancy declined by a record 84 million square feet in 2020, propelling
the vacancy rate to 17.1% at year-end. In addition, the sublease market grew by 50% in 2020, an increase of
47.6 million square feet (Jones Lang LaSalle, 2020).
   2 A survey of company leaders by Gartner found that 80% plan to allow employees to work remotely at

least part of the time after the pandemic, and 47% will allow employees to work from home full-time. A
PwC survey of 669 CEOs shows that 78% agree that remote collaboration is here to stay for the long-term.
In a recent FlexJobs survey, 96% of respondents desire some form of remote work; 65% of respondents


                                                     1
house prices--which are forward looking--versus rents in city centers and the suburbs,
we can glance an early answer to this difficult question.
   We begin by documenting how urban agglomeration trends have shifted in the wake
of the COVID-19 pandemic. The central object of interest is the bid-rent function, or the
land price gradient, which relates house prices and rents to the distance from the city
center. Prices and rents in the city center tend to be higher than in the suburbs, with
the premium reflecting the scarcity of land available for development (including due to
regulatory barriers), closer proximity to workplaces, urban amenities, and agglomeration
effects. While bid-rent functions are typically downward sloping, we document striking
changes in the slope of this relationship since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
House prices far from the city center have risen faster than house prices in the center
between December 2019 and December 2020. Likewise, rents in the suburbs rose much
faster than rents in the center over this period. The negative slope of the bid-rent function
has become less negative. In other words, the pandemic has flattened the bid-rent curve.
   Figure 1 illustrates this changing slope. Each observation is the slope of the bid-rent
function for a particular month. Rents are on the left, house prices are on the right. The
bid-rent slope values are calculated by pooling all ZIP codes for the largest 30 metropoli-
tan areas in the U.S., and obtained model estimates of the relationship between log prices
or log rents and log(1+distance) in a pooled regression with CBSA fixed effects and ZIP-
level control variables. Distance from city hall is expressed in kilometers. The elasticity
of price to distance changes from -0.127 pre-pandemic to -0.115 in December 2020. For
rents, the change in slope is much larger: from -0.04 to -0.004. The change in slope for
price means that house prices 50kms from the city center grew by 5.7 percentage points
more than house prices in the center. The slope change for rents corresponds to suburban
report wanting to be full-time remote employees post-pandemic, and 31% want a hybrid remote work
environment. Bloom (2020) finds that 42% of the U.S. workforce was working remotely as of May 2020, and
Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020) estimates that the number of remote working days will increase four-fold
in future years to 22%. Harrington and Emanuel (2020) finds positive treatment effects of working from
home, consistent with Bloom, Liang, Roberts, and Ying (2015).

This plot shows coefficients from a repeated cross-sectional regression at the ZIP Code level as in equation 1 for the top 30 MSAs. We
regress the distance from the city center (measured as the log of 1 + distance to City Hall in kms) against log rent (left) and log price
(right). We include additional controls (log of annual gross income in 2017, median age of the head of household, proportion of Black
households in 2019, and proportion of individuals who make over 150k in 2019), as well as MSA fixed effects, and run the specification
separately each month. Price and rent data are drawn from Zillow.



rents appreciating by 9.9 percentage points more than in the city center.3
                                    We also find large changes in housing quantities. Active listings, a measure of the
housing inventory, displays large increases in the urban center and large decreases in the
suburbs. A measure of housing liquidity shows that days-on-the-market increase in the
urban core and falls sharply in the suburbs. There is a strong negative cross-sectional re-
lationship between the house price change in a ZIP code on the one hand, and the change
in inventory and days-on-the-market on the other hand. Since housing supply elasticity
tends to be substantially higher in suburbs than in the urban core, part of the adjustment
to higher demand is accommodated through increases in quantity. While the observed
quantity adjustments are arguably limited over the nine months since the pandemic took
hold, we expect them to be larger in the medium run. Shifting population to areas with
higher supply elasticity will have important implications for housing affordability.
                                    Finally, we link these changes in prices and rents to migration data using high-frequency
cell-phone location data. ZIP codes close to the center of the metro area lost population
                                    3 The
         main results, which use Zillow quality-adjusted house price data, are corroborated by using an
alternative data source, Realtor, on asking prices.

while suburban ZIP codes gained people. We show that it is the places that experienced
the strongest migration that experienced the largest price and rent changes. We also link
migration to remote work using the Dingel and Neiman (2020) measure of occupational
ability to work from home. This finding suggests that workers with the capacity to leave
cities did so, reshaping housing values towards suburban areas at the cost of urban ones.
   We use a simple present-value model in the tradition of Campbell and Shiller (1989)
to study what the relative changes in urban versus suburban house prices and rents teach
us about the market's expectations on future rent growth in urban versus suburban lo-
cations. By studying differences between suburban and urban locations, we control for
common drivers of house prices such as low interest rates. Simply, the much larger de-
cline in rents than in prices in urban ZIP codes, and the equally large increase in prices
and rents in the suburbs, implies that the price-rent ratio became more steeply downward
sloping. If housing markets expect a gradual return to the pre-pandemic state, then the in-
crease in the urban-minus-suburban price-rent ratio implies higher expected rent growth
in the urban core than in the suburbs for the next several years. If urban-minus-suburban
risk premia did not change that differential rent change is 7.5% points in the average
MSA. If the risk premia instead rose by 1% point, the rent change would be 15 percent-
age points. If housing markets instead expect the pandemic to have brought permanent
changes to housing markets, then the change in price-rent ratios implies that urban rents
will expand by 0.5% points faster than suburban rents going forward, assuming that risk
premia did not change. If urban risk premia instead changed by 1% point, we estimate
urban rents will expand by 1.5% points.
   A key quantitative question is where we are in between the fully transitory and fully
permanent cases. We use unique survey data from Pulsenomics, which asked a panel of
real estate professionals in February 2021 whether they thought that the change in work-
ing from home was permanent or transitory. Thirty-six percent thought the change was
permanent, while the rest thought it was transitory. We use this probability to interpo-


                                            4
late between the transitory and permanent cases of the present-value model to arrive at
our best estimate of the expected future rent growth in urban relative to suburban areas.
Housing markets price in an urban rent revival. Urban rent growth is expected to exceed
suburban rent growth between 1.6% points and 3.4% points in 2021, before returning to
levels about 0.09%­0.5% points above pre-pandemic levels. Similarly, urban price-rent
ratios jump up during the pandemic, before mean-reverting slowly to levels about 1.4%­
2.3% points above pre-pandemic levels.
   In the last part of the paper, we study the cross-MSA variation in the change in the
slope of the bid-rent function. We find that the changes are larger in MSAs that have
a higher presence of jobs that can be done from home, and have lower housing supply
elasticity or higher physical or regulatory barriers to development. While more stringent
pandemic lock-down measures, which result in the loss of many urban amenities (e.g.,
theater and restaurant closures), are also associated with stronger rent and price gradient
changes, the strength of this association is not as robust. These findings suggest that
increased remote work capacity in the context of supply-constrained metropolitan areas,
rather than the temporary unavailability of urban amenities per se, appears to be driving
changes in real estate markets.
   To further disentangle the effect of working from home on the one hand and COVID-
19 stringency measures and urban amenities on the other hand, we turn to the ZIP-code
level. ZIP codes with higher exposure to work from home (WFH) see lower house price
and rent growth even within the same metropolitan area. We conclude that WFH seems
to be a key factor driving the empirical patterns in house prices and rents.


Related Literature   Our research builds on a large body of literature examining the role
of urban land gradients in the context of agglomeration effects. Albouy, Ehrlich, and Shin
(2018) estimates bid-rent functions across metropolitan areas in the United States. Albouy
(2016) interprets the urban land premium in the context of local productivity, rents, and



                                             5
amenity values, building on the influential spatial equilibrium approach of Rosen (1979)
and Roback (1982). Moretti (2013) argues that skilled workers have increasingly sorted
into expensive urban areas, lowering the real skilled wage premium. A key finding from
this literature is that productive spillovers and amenity values of cities account for the
steep relationship between real estate prices and distance, the importance of which has
been growing over time--particularly for skilled workers. We find strong and striking
reversals of this trend during the COVID-19 period, especially for cities with the highest
proportions of skilled workers, who can most often work remotely.
   A large and growing literature investigates the effect of COVID-19. One strand of this
research has examined the spatial implications of the pandemic on within-city changes in
consumption resulting from migration, changing commutes, and changing risk attitudes
(Althoff, Eckert, Ganapati, and Walsh, 2020; De Fraja, Matheson, and Rockey, 2020). A
number of contemporaneous contributions have begun to assess the impact of COVID-
19 on real estate markets. Delventhal, Kwon, and Parkhomenko (2021) propose a spatial
equilibrium model with many locations, in which households can choose where to lo-
cate in response to increased remote working opportunities. Davis, Ghent, and Gregory
(2021) likewise studies the effect of working from home on real estate prices. Liu and Su
(2020) examines changes in real estate valuation as a function of density--whereas this
study focuses on the urban bid-rent curve and what the conjunction of prices and rents
tell us about future rent expectations. Ling, Wang, and Zhou (2020); Garcia, Rosenthal,
and Strange (2021) study the impact of the pandemic on asset-level commercial real estate
categories. Our focus is on residential real estate and changes in rents and prices result-
ing from household migration. Brueckner, Kahn, and Lin (2021) also examines changes in
residential valuations; with a main focus on the spatial equilibrium implications of work-
ing from home across cities. Our work is complimentary in highlighting the intra-city
consequences, as well as in estimating the persistence of the work-from-home shock.
   This research has begun to use high-frequency location data from cell phone pings


                                            6
to study patterns of consumption, commuting, and migration (Miyauchi, Nakajima, and
Redding, 2021; Couture, Dingel, Green, Handbury, and Williams, 2021; Gupta, Van Nieuwer-
burgh, and Kontokosta, 2020). Coven, Gupta, and Yao (2020) shows that the pandemic
led to large-scale migration. This migration is facilitated by increased work-from-home
policies and shutdowns of city amenities--both of which raised the premium for housing
characteristics found in suburbs and outlying areas such as increased space.
     We also connect to an area of financial research that exploits risky equity claims of
various maturities examining the decomposition of stock price movements into transitory
and long run shocks (Van Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen, 2012; Van Binsbergen, Hueskes,
Koijen, and Vrugt, 2013). Gormsen and Koijen (2020) finds that stock markets priced in
the risk of a severe and persistent economic contraction in March 2020 before revising that
view later in 2020.
     The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II describes our data sources, sec-
tion III describes our results on the price and rent gradient and how it has evolved from
its pre-pandemic to its pandemic state. Section IV uses a present-value model to extract
market expectations about the future expected rent changes from the relative changes in
price and rent gradients. Section V studies cross-sectional variation in the price gradient
and rent gradient to assess the underlying mechanism and the last section offers conclud-
ing remarks.



II       Data

     We focus on the largest 30 MSAs by population, presented in Table B.I in Appendix
B. Our house price and rent data are at the ZIP code level derived from Zillow.4 We
use the Zillow House Value Index (ZHVI), which adjusts for house characteristics using
machine learning techniques, as well as the Zillow Observed Rental Index (ZORI), which
     4 The   data are publicly available from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/.

is a constant-quality rental price index capturing asking rents. Housing units include both
single-family and multi-family units for both the price and the rent data series.
   We also use data from the listing agent Realtor. We obtain ZIP code-level variables at
the monthly level for all the ZIP codes in the U.S. Specifically, we use median listing price,
median listing price per square foot, active listing counts, and median days a property is
on the market.
   We measure mobility using data from VenPath, a holistic global provider of compliant
smartphone data. We obtain information from approximately 120 million smart phone
devices containing information on geographical location for users. We combine informa-
tion from both background pings (location data provided while applications are running)
as well as foreground pings (while users are actively using an application) to determine
user residence and migration over the period February 1 to July 13, 2020.
   Additionally, we obtain the following ZIP code level variables; the proportion of house-
holds with yearly income higher than 150 thousand dollars, the proportion of Black resi-
dents, and median household income from the Census Bureau, and the count of bars and
restaurants from Safegraph. These variables serve as control variables in our analysis and
are shown in Table B.II in the Appendix.
   Finally, we draw on a rich set of MSA-level variables from prior research to investi-
gate the MSA-level factors that drive the changes in urban land gradients. We use the
Dingel and Neiman (2020) measure of the fraction of local jobs which can potentially be
performed remotely. We measure constraints on local housing development through sev-
eral measures commonly used in the literature. The Wharton regulatory index (Gyourko,
Saiz, and Summers, 2008) captures constraints on urban construction. We also measure
physical constraints on housing using the Lutz and Sand (2019) measure of land unavail-
ability, which is an extension of the Saiz (2010) measure. These physical constraints allow
us to measure the elasticity of the local housing stock. We also measure the stringency of
local lock-downs following Hale, Atav, Hallas, Kira, Phillips, Petherick, and Pott (2020).

III     Results

   We begin by showing descriptive evidence of price and rent changes across ZIP codes.
The figure in the main text are for the largest 30 metropolitan areas. The figures in the
Appendix zoom in on several MSAs, an in particular on New York City and San Francisco.



III.A    Raw Price and Rent Growth

   We first highlight the geography of changes in prices and rents for New York and San
Francisco in Figure 2. We observe strong rent decreases in the urban core (Manhattan,
centered around Grand Central Terminal) and rent increases in the suburbs, with par-
ticularly high values in the Hamptons on the far east of the map. The pattern for price
changes is similar, but less extreme. For San Francisco, we also see dramatic decreases in
rents and prices in the downtown ZIP codes, and increases in more distant regions such
as Oakland.



III.B   Bid-Rent Function

   We next examine changes in prices and rents at the ZIP-code level across a broad
sample of the 30 largest MSAs in the U.S. Figure 3 highlights the relationship between
rents (Panel A) and prices (Panel B) against distance from the city center, comparing pre-
and post-pandemic patterns. We observe flatter gradients for both prices and rents, with
larger changes in the slope of the bid-rent curve for rents than in the curve for prices.
   A flattening bid-rent function implies that rent or price changes are higher in the sub-
urbs than in the center. An alternative way of seeing this pattern is to examine the changes
in rents (Panel C) and changes in prices (Panel D), for each ZIP code, against distance to
the center of the city. We observe strongly decreasing rent values in urban cores, and
strongly rising rents in suburban ZIP codes. For house prices, urban ZIP codes do not
feature strong declines. Rather, prices rise faster in suburban areas.

This map shows year-over-year changes in prices (top four panels) and rents (bottom two panels) for the New York and San Francisco
MSAs at the ZIP code level over the period Dec 2019­Dec 2020. The bottom two rows zoom in on the city center. Darker green colors
indicate larger increases, while darker red colors indicate larger decreases.

   The change in prices and rents plotted against the pre-pandemic levels show strong
reversals of value in the most expensive ZIP Codes (Panels E and F of Figure 3). These
findings highlight that price and rent reversals have been largest in areas which previ-
ously enjoyed large urban premiums.
   Appendix Figures A1 and A2 highlight similar patterns for several large cities of New
York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Los Angeles.



III.C      Estimating the Bid-Rent Function

   Next, we formally estimate the slope of the bid-rent function using the following em-
pirical specification:


                                        z m                                                 2
          ln pijt =  jt + jt ln(1 + D (zij , z j )) +  Xij + eijt ,       eijt  i.i.d.N (0, e ).     (1)


The unit of observation is a ZIP code-month. Here pijt refers to the price or rent in ZIP
                                   z , zm ) is the distance in kilometers between the centroid
code i of MSA j at time t, and D (zij   j

of ZIP code i and the center of the MSA j, where i  j.5 We control for MSA fixed effects,
time fixed effects, and ZIP-code level control variables (Xij ). The ZIP-code controls are:
log of annual gross income in 2017, median age of the head of household, proportion of
Black households in 2019, and proportion of individuals who earn over $150k in 2019.
The controls are all measured pre-pandemic (based on the latest available data) and do
not vary over time during our estimation window.
   The coefficient of interest is jt which measures the elasticity of prices or rents to dis-
tance between the ZIP code and the center of the MSA. We refer to it as the price or rent
gradient. Historically, jt is negative, as prices and rents decrease as we move away from
the city center. Our main statistic of interest is jt+1 - jt , shown in Figure 1. Properties
away from the city center have become more valuable over the course of 2020, flattening
   5 We define the center of the MSA as City Hall, as in Albouy, Ehrlich, and Shin (2018), except for New
York City, in which we define Grand Central as the center.

The top two figures show the bid-rent function for the top 30 MSAs: the relationship between distance from the city center (the log of
1 + the distance in kilometers from City Hall) and the log of rents (Panel A) and prices (Panel B). Lighter points indicate ZIP codes,
while darker points indicate averages by 5% distance bins (binscatter). Subsequent figures show changes in rents (Panels C & E) and
prices (Panels D & F) against distance and the pre-pandemic levels of rents and prices.

                                                                                                                        12

change in price and rent gradient across the US.



III.D     Listing Prices

    As an alternative to Zillow prices and to explore homeowners' listing behavior, we
also study list prices from Realtor. Panels A and B of Figure 5 show that listing price
prices (median and median price per sq. ft.) are increasing with distance from the city cen-
ter, consistent with the evidence from transactions prices. This result confirms a greater
increases in prices in the suburbs than in the urban core.6



III.E     Quantity Adjustments

    Next we assess two measures of housing quantities, which are often interpreted as
measures of liquidity. Active listings measures the number of housing units that are cur-
rently for sale. There was a large increase in the housing inventory in the urban core be-
tween December 2019 and December 2020 and a large decline in inventory in the suburbs
(Panel C of Figure 5). Buyers depleted large fractions of the available housing inventory
in the suburbs during the pandemic, even after taking into account that a strong sellers'
market may have prompted additional suburban homeowners to put their house up for
sale over the course of 2020.
    The second measure we study is median days-on-the-market (DOM), a common met-
ric used in the housing search literature (Han and Strange, 2015) to quantify how long it
takes to sell a house. DOM rose in the urban core and fell in the suburbs (Figure 5, Panel
D). Housing liquidity improved dramatically in the suburbs and deteriorated meaning-
fully in the center.7

This map plots the change in price and rent gradients across the U.S. over the period Dec 2019­Dec 2020. For each MSA, we estimate
the price and rent gradient as in equation 1, and plot the resulting change at the MSA-level. Higher values correspond to a flatter
bid-rent curve. The size of the circle corresponds to the magnitude of the change.

III.F                      Migration

                    These large changes in real estate markets correspond to substantial revaluations of
urban premia in the context of the pandemic shock of COVID-19. In this section, we
connect these changes to the migration pattern of individuals over this time period, and
the role of remote work in facilitating these moves.
                    To measure home residence, we use mobile phone geo-location data provided by Ven-
Path. We measure individual night-time residence based on frequency of pings at night
hours.8 We observe a large migration elasticity with respect to distance to the city center.
Residents near the center of the city start to leave after March, and populations rise in the
suburbs (Figure 7, Panel A). We examine a number of other major metro areas in Figure
A7, finding a considerable suburban exodus across many superstar cities.
                    We connect these population changes to remote work in Panel B of Figure 7, using a
               8 We
        require three or more pings from 5pm­8am in a given census tract to designate a user as a possible
resident in a night, and require at least five associations of individuals with night-time pings to assign a
residence.



                                                                               16
ZIP level measure of the fraction of jobs which could potentially be done remotely by Din-
gel and Neiman (2020). We find a strong association of population flight with respect to
remote work, suggesting workers with flexibility in their work location were particularly
likely to leave their home ZIP codes during the pandemic.
   This migration away from the center of cities began in the wake of the pandemic,
boosted by several factors both temporary and permanent. Initially, there was consid-
erable concern that densely populated metropolitan areas presented additional risk for
disease transmission. Additionally, the consequent lock-downs and reductions in busi-
ness activity lowered the value of local amenities keeping individuals in urban areas.
Work-from-home policies also enabled certain workers to work remotely away from their
former location. While these policies were initially temporary, many employers have sig-
naled the possibility of future remote work policies, either towards a fully-remote work-
force or allowing remote work several days a week. These partial remote policies may
explain the permanent relocation of individuals to the outskirts of metropolitan areas, as
workers anticipate less frequent commutes.
   We also connect migration patterns to changes in rents (Panel C) and prices (Panel
D). We find a particularly strong association of migration and changes in rent, but still
meaningful shocks to prices, suggesting that the housing markets may be affected for the
long-run. While these results establish large changes in location decisions for individuals
through the pandemic, a major point of uncertainty is the persistence of these trends in
the future. We address this question in the next section by combining evidence on rents,
prices, and survey expectations to infer the persistence of the COVID-19 shock on the
urban environment from real estate markets.

IV     Beliefs About Future Rent Growth

   In this section, we investigate what housing markets tell us about future rent growth
expectations following the COVID-19 shock. To do so, we combine the observed changes
in the price and rent gradients with a present-value model to build expectations about the
relative rent growth rate in suburbs versus the urban core over the next several years.



IV.A     Observed Price-Rent Ratios

   In the subsequent analysis we use price-rent ratios. Because the Zillow data are quality-
adjusted, it is reasonable to interpret the price-rent ratio in a ZIP code as pertaining to the
same typical property that is either for rent or for sale. For our purposes, it is enough
that the change over time in the price-rent ratio is comparable across ZIP codes within an
MSA.
   We first calculate the price-rent ratio for each ZIP-month over the period of January
2014 (when the rent data starts) until December 2019. We then average over these 72
months. This average acts as a proxy for the long-run equilibrium price-rent ratio before
the pandemic. Price-rent ratios are high in the city center and decrease with distance to
the center. The "Pre-Pandemic" line in Figure A9 illustrates this pattern for the New York
MSA.
   We also compute the price-rent ratio in the fourth quarter of 2020, averaging the price-
rent ratios of October, November, and December 2020.9 The "Post-Pandemic" line in
Figure A9 shows the price-rent ratio at the end of 2020 in New York. In the suburbs, rents
and prices rose by about the same amount over the course of 2020, leaving the price-rent
ratio unchanged. In the urban core, rents fell much more than prices, resulting in a large
increase in the price-rent ratio. Thus, the price-rent ratio curve became steeper during the
pandemic. Put differently, it became cheaper to rent than to own in the core and relatively
  9 As long as the price-rent ratio in one of the months is available,   the ZIP code is included in the analysis.

more expensive to rent in the periphery.
                     Another way to see this is to plot the average 12-month rental growth rate over the
January 2014 to December 2019 period as a function of distance from the center. Panel A
of Figure 8 shows that rental growth was similar in the core and in the suburbs of New
York City pre-pandemic. This pattern changes dramatically during the pandemic, with
steeply falling rents in the core and steeply rising rents in the suburbs. Panel B shows
a strong reversal in house price growth as a function of distance before and after the
pandemic.

IV.B                            Present-Value Model

                     We briefly review the the present-value model of Campbell and Shiller (1989), a stan-
dard tool in asset pricing. Campbell, Davis, Gallin, and Martin (2009) were the first to
apply the present value model to real estate. They studied a variance decomposition

                                                                             20
of the aggregate residential house price-rent ratio in the U.S. Van Nieuwerburgh (2019)
applied the model to REITs, publicly traded vehicles owning (mostly commercial) real
estate.
   Let Pt be the price of a risky asset, in our case the house, Dt+1 its (stochastic) cash-flow,
in our case the rent, and Rt+1 the cum-dividend return:

                                                 Pt+1 + Dt+1
                                    R t +1 =                 .
                                                      Pt

We can log-linearize the definition of the cum-dividend return to obtain:


                             rt+1 = k + dt+1 +  pdt+1 - pdt ,


where all lowercase letters denote natural logarithms and pdt = pt - dt = -dpt . The
constants k and  are functions of the long-term average log price-rent ratio. Specifically,

                           exp( pd)
                    =                 ,          k = log(1 + exp( pd)) -  pd.                (2)
                         1 + exp( pd)

By iterating forward on the return equation, adding an expectation operator on each side,
and imposing a transversality condition (i.e., ruling out rational bubbles), we obtain the
present-value model of Campbell and Shiller (1989):

                                          +                      +
                            k
                   pdt =
                           1-
                              + Et          j-1 dt+ j - Et         j -1 r t + j   .          (3)
                                          j =1                   j =1


A high price-rent ratio must reflect either the market's expectation of higher future rent
growth, or lower future returns on housing (i.e., future price declines), or a combination
of the two.




                                                  21
   This equation also holds unconditionally:

                                         k   g   x
                                 pd =      +   -   ,                                     (4)
                                        1- 1- 1-

      ¯ = E[dt ] and x = E[rt ] are the unconditional expected rent growth and expected
where g
return, respectively. Equation (4) can be rewritten to deliver the well-known Gordon
Growth model (in logs) by plugging in for k:


                               log 1 + exp pd - pd = x - g
                                                         ¯.                              (5)


The left-hand side variable is approximately equal to the long-run rental yield D / P.
   Subtracting equation (4) from (3), we obtain:

                               +                                +
             pdt - pd = Et       j -1  d t + j - g
                                                 ¯      - Et      j -1   rt+ j - x   .   (6)
                               j =1                             j =1


Price-rent ratios exceed their long-run average, or equivalently rental yields are below
their long-run average, when rent growth expectations are above their long-run average
or expected returns are below the long-run expected return.


Expected Rent Growth      In what follows, we assume that expected rent growth follows
an autoregressive process. We denote expected rent growth by gt :


                                         gt  Et [dt+1 ]


and assume an AR(1) for gt :


                                                                  g
                                 g t = (1 -  g ) g +  g g t -1 +  t                      (7)




                                                22
Under this assumption, the rent growth term in equation (6) can be written as a function
of the current period's expected rent growth in excess of the long-run mean:

                               +
                                                                   1
                         Et      j -1        dt+ j - g      =
                                                                1 -  g
                                                                       ( gt - g ).               (8)
                               j =1


Expected Returns       Similarly, we define expected returns by xt


                                                xt  Et [rt+1 ]


and assume an AR(1) for xt following Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008); Binsbergen
and Koijen (2010); Koijen and van Nieuwerburgh (2011):


                                       x t = (1 -  x ) x +  x x t -1 +  x
                                                                        t                        (9)


Under this assumption, the return term in equation (6) can be written as a function of the
current period's expected return in excess of the long-run mean:

                                +
                                                                  1
                          Et      j -1       rt+ j - x     =
                                                               1 -  x
                                                                      ( x t - x ).              (10)
                                j =1


Implied Dividend Growth Expectations                     With equations (8) and (10) in hand, we can
restate equation (6)
                                pdt - pd = A( gt - g) - B( xt - x ).                            (11)

              1                  1
where A =   1- g   and B =     1- x .

   From equation (11), we can back out the current-period expectations about future rent
growth:
                                                                  1 -  g
                       gt = g + (1 -  g ) pdt - pd +                     ( xt - x ) .           (12)
                                                                  1 -  x

Current beliefs about rent growth depend on long-run expected rent growth (first term),



                                                      23
the deviation of the price-rent ratio from its long-run mean (second term), and the de-
viation of expected returns from their long-run mean (third term). Long-run expected
dividend growth g is obtained from equation (4) given pd and x.



IV.C    Case 1: Pandemic is Transitory

   We assume that ZIP codes were at their long-run averages xij , gij prior to the pan-
                                               ij
demic, in December 2019. They imply pd per equation (5). In a first set of calculations,
we assume that following the COVID-19 shock, expected rent growth and expected re-
turns (and hence the mean pd ratio) will gradually return to those pre-pandemic aver-
ages. Under these assumptions, we can ask what the observed changes in the price-rent
ratios between December 2019 and December 2020 imply about the market's expectations
about rent growth in urban relative to suburban ZIP codes over the next several years.
   If pdt is measured as of December 2020, then equation (11) measures the percentage
change in the price-rent ratio post versus pre-pandemic. Let i = u denote a ZIP code in
the urban core and let i = s denote a ZIP code in the suburbs. Then the difference-in-
difference of the price-rent ratio between post- and pre-pandemic and between suburban
and urban ZIP codes in the same MSA is given by:


                      uj                 sj                      uj              sj
   pd j =     Auj gt - guj - Asj gt - gsj                - Buj xt - x uj - Bsj xt - x sj   (13)
                                                                                           .
                 uj        uj       sj        sj
   pd j       pdt - pd          - pdt - pd


where the second line defines  pd j for an MSA j.
   We observe  pd j , but there are two unknowns on the right-hand side. Hence, there is
a fundamental identification problem which is well understood in the asset pricing liter-
ature. One either needs additional data on return expectations or on expected cash flow
growth, for example from survey data, or one needs to make an identifying assumption.
We follow the second route.


                                                    24
Assumption 1. Expected returns and expected rent growth have the same persistence
                              ij                  ij
across geographies:  x =  x and  g =  g . We also assume that ij =  j .

    This assumption implies that Aij and Bij only depend on the MSA j.10
    Under Assumption 1, we can use the present-value relationship to back out the mar-
ket's expectation in terms of expected rent growth in urban minus suburban ZIP codes:


                         uj         sj      uj         sj          1 - j g j
                                                                      j             j
                        gt    -    gt    = g - g + (1 -   g ) pd +          x .                       (14)
                                                                   1 -  j x

where
                                                            uj            sj
                                            x j  ( xt - x uj ) - ( xt - x sj )

Equation (14) gives the expected rent growth differential over the next twelve months,
measured as of December 2020, i.e., between December 2020 and December 2021. But
since expected rent growth follows an AR(1), there will be further changes in 2022, 2023,
etc. The expected discounted cumulative rent changes over all future years are given by:

                                     uj      sj
                                    gt - gt   guj - gsj       j     x j
                                            =           +  pd   +          .                          (15)
                                    1 - j g   1 - j g             1 -  j x

     x j measures to what degree the pandemic changed the risk premium on urban versus
suburban housing. Estimating time-varying risk premia is hard, even in liquid markets
with long-time series of data. It is neigh impossible for illiquid assets like homes over
short periods of time like the 12-month period we are interested in. As such, the best
we can do is define our assumptions and understand their impact. We consider two
alternative assumptions on  x j .

Assumption 2. Expected returns did not change differentially in urban and suburban
                                                                               ij
  10 This   is an approximation. The mean log price-rent ratio, pd , and hence ij depends on (i, j) because
                                                                                        ij
of heterogeneity in xij , gij . We construct the population-weighted mean of pd across all zip codes in the
                 j                                 j
MSA, call it pd , and then form  j from pd using equation (2).


                                                                 25
areas in the same MSA in the pandemic:  x j = 0.

   This assumption allows for expected returns to be different in urban and suburban
ZIP codes and for expected returns to change in the pandemic. It only precludes that this
change was different for suburban and urban areas. Expected returns can be written as
the interest rate plus a risk premium. Since the dynamics of interest rates (and mortgage
rates more generally) are common across space, this assumption is one on the dynamics
of urban-suburban risk premia.
   Expected returns in suburban areas are typically higher than in urban areas pre-pandemic.
The second assumption we make is that the annual urban risk premium increases by one
percentage point relative to the suburban risk premium:

Assumption 3.  x j = 0.01,  j.

   Alternatively, it would be possible to consider a different change or a change that
varied by MSA.


IV.D    Case 2: Pandemic is Permanent

   The opposite extreme from assuming that everything will go back to the December
2019 state is to assume that the situation as of December 2020 is the new permanent state.
   In that case, we can use equation (5) to back out what the market expects the new long-
term expected urban minus suburban rent growth to be, denoting the new post-pandemic
steady state by hatted variables:

                    uj      sj                    uj                    sj
    guj - gsj =   pd - pd        - log 1 + e pd        - log 1 + e pd        + x uj - x sj .   (16)


The first two terms can be computed directly from the observed price-rent ratios in De-
cember 2020. The last term requires a further assumption.
   We consider the same two assumptions on post-pandemic urban minus suburban ex-
pected returns (or equivalently risk premia) as in the transitory case. The first one is

                                            26
that urban minus suburban risk premia differences remain unchanged pre- versus post-
pandemic.

Assumption 4. x uj - x sj = x uj - x sj ,  j. We refer to this as  x j = 0.

   The second assumption is that urban risk premia rise relative to suburban risk premia
by a constant amount of 1% point.

Assumption 5. x uj - x sj = x uj - x sj + 0.01,  j. We refer to this as  x j = 0.01.

   The difference in comparison to the transitory case is that, now, the relative risk pre-
mium change is permanent.



IV.E    Case 3: Combining Transitory and Permanent Cases

   Let p be the probability that the changes in the urban-minus-suburban expected rent
growth and expected return are transitory, and 1 - p be the probability that the changes
are permanent. In the subsequent section we incorporate survey evidence on p.
              uj         sj
   Denote gt and gt as the urban and suburban expected rent growth combining the
transitory and permanent cases:


                               uj        sj   uj   sj                      uj        sj
                              gt - gt = p gt - gt            + (1 - p ) gt - gt                (17)


The first term comes from equation (14), while the second term uses equation (16).
                    uj              sj
   Similarly, let pdt and pdt denote the combined log price-rent ratios for the urban and
                                                               uj     sj
suburban areas, respectively. The difference pdt - pdt is the weighted average of the
transitory and permanent cases:

                         uj         sj        uj        sj                      uj        sj
                     pdt - pdt = p pdt - pdt                  + (1 - p) pdt - pdt              (18)


The first term is calculated under assumptions 2 and 3 from equation (11), while the sec-


                                                   27
ond term consists of the observed price-rent ratios in December 2020, which are consid-
ered to be the new long-run levels in the permanent case.



IV.F   Results: Implied Urban-Suburban Rent Growth Expectations

   We report results for each of the 30 largest MSAs in which rent data is available for at
least some of the suburban areas (Table I).
   We define the urban ZIP codes to be all ZIP codes less than 10 kilometers from the MSA
centroid (city hall), and the suburbs to be the ZIP codes more than 40 kilometers from the
MSA centroid. For each ZIP code, we compute the price-rent ratio in each month from
January 2014 (the start of ZORI data) until December 2019, and compute the time-series
average. Similarly, we compute the time-series mean of the average annual rental growth
rate for each ZIP code over the 2014­2019 period. We then compute population-weighted
averages among the urban and suburban ZIP codes (columns 1­4). For presentation pur-
poses, the mean price-rent ratio is reported in levels (rather than logs) and average rent
growth is multiplied by 100 (expressed in percentage points). We use equation (5) to com-
pute the expected annual returns in columns (5) and (6). These expected returns are also
multiplied by 100 (annual percentage points). Expected returns are between 5% and 14%.
Typically, though not always, expected returns are higher in the suburbs. The numbers in
columns (1­6) reflect the pre-pandemic steady state.
   Columns (7) and (8) report the price-rent ratio (in levels) for the pandemic. We report
the mean, computed over October, November, and December of 2020 (or over as many of
these three months as are available in the data).
   Column (9) reports  pd, the log change in the urban-minus-suburban price-rent ratio
during the pandemic versus before the pandemic. Most of the reported values are posi-
tive, indicating that price-rent ratios went up in urban relative to suburban areas. What
this implies depends on the model in question.

IV.F.1      Pandemic is Transitory

    In the model in which the pandemic is purely transitory, the positive  pd implies
                                                                    u - gs > 0. After
that urban rent growth is expected to exceed suburban rent growth: gt    t

the steep decline in urban rents, urban rent growth is expected to rebound to restore
the price-rent ratio to pre-pandemic level. The large increase in suburban rents will also
revert, leading to slower expected rent growth in the suburbs. Columns (10­11) report the
urban minus suburban cumulative rent differential, computed from equation (15) under
assumptions 2 and 3, respectively.
    To implement equation (15), we need values for ( g ,  x ,  j ). We set  g = 0.747. This is
the estimated 12-month persistence of annual rent growth rates in the U.S. between 1982
and 2020. It implies a half-life of expected rent shocks of approximately 2.5 years. Note
that the AR(1) assumption on expected rents means that a 1% point change in current
period expected rent translates into a (1 -  j  g )-1  3.5% point cumulative change in
rents over the current and all future periods (assuming a typical value for  j ).
    We set  x = 0.917 based on the observed persistence of aggregate annual price-dividend
ratios.11
    We compute  j from equation (2), using the population-weighted mean price-rent ratio
for all ZIP codes in the MSA pre-pandemic.
    If there is no differential change in urban versus suburban risk premia (column 10),
urban rent growth is expected to exceed suburban rent growth by 4.5% points in New
York over the next several years cumulatively. However, if the urban risk premium tem-
porarily rises by 1% point relative to the suburban risk premium, and that difference then
slowly reverts back to 0, then urban rent growth will exceed suburban rent growth by
12.6% cumulatively (column 11). The corresponding numbers for San Francisco are simi-
lar at 3.5% (column 10) and 12.3% (column 11).
  11 We compute the log price-rent ratio for the United States from January 1987 until December 2020 as the
log of the Case-Shiller Core Logic National House Price Index minus the log of the CPI Rent of Primary
Residence series. We then take the 12-month autocorrelation.


                                                    29
   Los Angeles is expected to see much larger cumulative urban-suburban rent growth
between 18.7% (column 10) and 27.3% (column 11). This is because the change in the
urban-minus-suburban price-rent ratio is much larger (12.8%). Restoring the pre-pandemic
urban-suburban price-rent multiples requires large catch-up growth in urban rents. The
same is true for Philadelphia, Sacramento, and Charlotte.
   Miami, St Louis, and Baltimore are at the other end of the spectrum with low urban-
suburban rent growth expectations (column 10). Baltimore is unusual in that it has higher
price-rent ratios, lower rent growth, and higher risk premia in the urban core than in the
suburbs before the pandemic. If the suburban risk premium falls relative to the urban
one by 1% point (column 11), urban rent growth must exceed suburban growth by 7.8%
to restore the old price-rent ratios.
   Figure A10 shows that expected rent growth is a declining function of distance from
the city center.


IV.F.2   Pandemic is Permanent

   In the model where the pandemic is permanent, the interpretation of the price-rent ra-
tio change  pd j is quite different. Columns (12) and (13) report the expected urban minus
suburban rent growth, as given by equation (16) under assumptions 3 and 4, respectively.
These columns report an annual growth rate differential (not a cumulative change), but
that change is now expected to be permanent.
   If risk premia do not change, New York's price-rent ratio in December 2020 implies
permanently lower annual rent growth of -0.23% in urban than in suburban ZIP codes.
However, if the urban-suburban risk premium rises permanently by 1% point (thereby
shrinking it from -2% pre-pandemic to -1% post-pandemic), urban rent growth is ex-
pected to exceed suburban growth by 0.77% annually. The numbers in columns (12) and
(13) differ by exactly 1% point, the assumed difference in urban-suburban risk premia
between the two columns. Column (13) can be compared to column (11), after dividing

column (11) by about 3.5 (more precisely, multiplying it by 1 -  j  g ). Both numbers then
express an annual expected rent growth under the assumption that risk premia in urban
areas go up by 1% point relative to suburban areas. For New York, the temporary model
implies 3.65% higher rent growth in urban ZIP codes while the permanent model implies
0.77% higher growth. However, in the temporary model, both the expected rent growth
and the expected return will revert to pre-pandemic levels while in the permanent model
they will not. Both models suggest that the market expects the rent in urban ZIP codes in
New York to grow more strongly than in the suburbs in the future.
    In Los Angeles, the permanent model indicates urban rent growth that will exceed
suburban growth by 2% (column 12) or 3% (column 13). We find similar rent growth
differences for Atlanta, and even stronger rent growth differences for Charlotte. Miami,
Seattle, and San Diego see the lowest urban growth differentials.


IV.F.3   Headline Result: Combining Transitory and Permanent Cases

    The Pulsenomics survey held in February of 2021 reports that 64% survey respondents
believe that working from home represents a temporary shift for the housing market,
while 36% believe the shift is permanent. The sample consists of 102 real estate experts
from banking, consulting, and academia.12
    We use this survey evidence to estimate the probability parameter that the change in
the housing market is transitory: p = 0.64. Using the experts' view on the transitory ver-
sus permanent nature of the working from home shift, we can then compute the expected
rental growth rate from equation (17).
    Figure 9 summarizes our results for the population-weighted average MSA. We show
   12 Pulsenomics surveys these experts about their house price expectations every quarter. Each survey has

additional one-off topics. The question in the 2021.Q1 survey used here is on the topic of shifting housing
preferences: "The pandemic and rise of remote work have altered housing needs and preferences, though it
is uncertain if these changes will prove to be permanent or temporary. For each of the following, would you
say that consumer preferences have shifted permanently, temporarily, or not at all? Full-time work from
home in favor of full-time work from company office." In addition to the working from home question,
which we use, there is also a question on "suburban lifestyle in favor of urban lifestyle." This question
received the following responses: 46% permanent and 54% transitory (includes 8% no change).

the evolution of the urban-minus-suburban expected rent growth differential. The red
line is for the purely transitory case ( p = 1), the blue line for the purely permanent case
( p = 0), and the orange line for the probability-weighted average ( p = 0.64). The left
panel shows the results assuming no change in urban-minus-suburban risk premia ( x =
0), while the right panel shows the case of  x = 0.01.
                                     The prediction of an increase in urban relative to suburban rents--an urban rent revival--
is robust, as all predicted lines are above zero. In the transitory cases, annual expected
rent growth increases strongly initially, about 2% points in the left panel and 4% points
in the right panel, and then slowly reverts back down to pre-pandemic levels. In case the
pandemic change is permanent, the rent growth differential jumps up post-pandemic and
remains there. The jump is 0.5% in the left and 1.5% in the right panel. For the combina-
tion of transitory and permanent cases, the trajectory of expected rent growth naturally
lies in between the two extreme cases, and suggests a small long-run increase in urban
rent growth. Table 10 reports the combination model's prediction for expected urban-
minus-suburban rent growth across MSAs. Specifically, it plots the change in expected
rent growth relative to the pre-pandemic level. The reported number is a cumulative dis-

The change in urban minus suburban rent growth are shown relative to the pre-pandemic level for the combined regime across our
sample of Top 30 MSAs. The combined case is calculated using weights as p = 0.64 for the transitory regime, and 1 - p = 0.36 for the
permanent regime, as reported by the Pulsenomics survey. We consider two cases as in Table I: (1)  x = 0, and (2)  x = 0.01.

assumptions on expected returns. There is substantial variation in predicted urban rent
growth revival, with large values for Los Angeles, Sacramento, Charlotte, Philadelphia,
and Phoenix.
    Finally, we show the evolution of the (population-weighted average) urban-minus-
suburban price-rent ratio (Figure 11). The initial increase in the transitory case is the same
in the left and in the right panel because it is dictated by the 2020.Q4 data. From that point
forward, the dynamics in the price dividend ratio are governed by the dynamics of ex-
pected rent growth and expected returns. We see a gradual decline in urban relative to
suburban price-rent ratios in the left panel as expected rent growth mean-reverts. In the
right panel, expected returns also mean-revert (at a slower pace because  x >  g ), which

leads to richer dynamics that exhibit under-shooting after year four. In the permanent
case, the price-rent ratio remains at its 2020.Q4 level permanently. For our preferred com-
bination case, we obtain urban price-rent ratios that remain about 3% points above the
pre-pandemic levels in the long-run. Owning in the city center becomes permanently
more expensive than renting.



V                                                Mechanisms

                                          This section explores potential drivers of the changing price and rent gradient, exploit-
ing variation across MSAs.



V.A                                                  MSA-Level Analysis

                                          Having established the change in price and rent gradient at the metropolitan level,
in this section we establish the main driving factors behind the changes in the bid-rent
function in the cross-section. We focus on three key variables: the fraction of the popula-



                                                                                               35
tion with occupations that can be done remotely (Dingel and Neiman, 2020), COVID-19
lockdown restrictions from Hale, Atav, Hallas, Kira, Phillips, Petherick, and Pott (2020),13
and a measure of housing inelasticity (the first principal component of the Gyourko, Saiz,
and Summers (2008) land use regulatory index and the Lutz and Sand (2019) measure of
land availability). Appendix Table A.I explores a larger list of other possible variables;
given our limited sample of MSAs we focus on a smaller set of important covariates for
the main analysis.
   We regress the change in the price gradient for each of the top-30 MSAs on several
MSA-level characteristics (Table II), as well as for the change in the rent gradient (Table
III). Column (1) shows that variation in remote work (Dingel and Neiman, 2020) across
MSAs alone explains 22.8% of variation in price gradient changes and 27.0% of variation
in rent gradient changes, and is a strong economic predictor of changes in these gradi-
ents. A 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of jobs in an MSA which can be done
remotely changes the price gradient by 2.15 percentage points and the rent gradient by
3.26 percentage points. These are substantial increases which reflect large revaluations of
suburban vs. urban real estate in areas with more remote work.
   The larger positive coefficient on WFH for rents as compared to prices is supportive
of a greater reversal in rent gradients versus price gradients across MSAs. As rents as
expected to price in short-term expectations, and prices capture future long-term expec-
tations of real estate markets, this evidence supports the transitory nature of the shock as
shown in Section IV.F reflecting evidence from Pulsenomics. At the same time, the impact
on price gradients suggests that some of the effect is expected to be permanent.
   The next columns include stringency and supply inelasticity measures. These vari-
ables are normalized to be the same range (0­1) as the WFH measure to enable compara-
bility. These two indicators are both important individually, suggesting that MSAs which
feature more strict COVID restrictions (corresponding to government-imposed restric-
 13 We associate each MSA with the preponderant state in the area to assign lockdown policies; for instance

the NYC MSA with New York State.

tions in private activity, which directly affected the ability of residents to take advantage
of local amenities) see more revaluation towards suburban properties. At the same time,
cities which are more inelastic--where urban premia reflect supply constraints--also see
urban revaluation, suggesting that affordability constraints in superstar cities may drive
interest in suburban lifestyles. However, these variables are strongly correlated, making
it difficult to draw strong conclusions from the univariate analysis.
   We combine all three variables under two sets of assumptions in columns (4) and (5).
In column (4) we include all three variables in conjunction. These three variables com-
bined explain 40% variation in price gradient changes and 31.4% variation in rent gradient
changes across MSAs. The WFH measure remains large and economically significant for
both rent and price gradient changes, showing the importance of remote work in explain-
ing the reversal of the price and rent gradients. Individuals highly value the importance
of remote work leading to increases in suburban valuation. The stringency measure itself
becomes small and insignificant for both prices and rents. Supply inelasticity remains
significant for prices--suggesting that affordability concerns in space-constrained metros
may be more important for permanent moves rather than temporary ones.
   A natural concern is that the work from home measure might be correlated with the
stringency and supply inelasticity index. In column (5), we orthogonalize the stringency
and supply inelasticity index to the WFH measure. The effect of remote work is naturally
larger in Column (5) as compared to Column (4) as the coefficient soaks up the common
variation which was earlier attributed to other measures. The orthogonalized supply
inelasticity remains significant for prices.
   In Appendix Figure A11, we decompose these effects for each MSA based on our
estimates from column (5) for rents and prices. While MSAs broadly see changes in ur-
ban valuation due to remote work policies, there is considerable variation in the cross-
section due to the frequency of remote work. Many superstar metro areas like New York,
San Francisco, Washington, and Seattle feature high amounts of remote work, and cor-

respondingly see large changes in the valuation of urban properties. By contrast, other
metro areas like Orlando, Detroit, and Pittsburgh have far less remote work. Some metros
like Charlotte, Austin, and San Antonio see a partial offset of the WFH effect due to more
elastic housing supply. In these areas, the relative ease of building means that greater real
estate demand results in higher quantities, rather than higher prices.



V.B     ZIP-Level Analysis

   In Table IV, we break down the patterns at a higher level of granularity at the ZIP-level
within our sample of MSAs. We regress rent changes from Dec 2019­Dec 2020 against a
variety of ZIP-level covariates in Panel A. Panel B repeats the estimation for price changes.
In particular, we measure the fraction of remote workers at the ZIP-code level, and find

that this variable remains strongly predictive of real estate changes, even after controlling
for MSA-fixed effects and other potentially important covariates.
   For rents, a 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of remote work in a ZIP
code is associated with a 1.8­2.9 percentage point decrease in rent growth, depending
on the specification. The number of restaurants and bars, a measure of the pre-pandemic
amenity value of a ZIP code, also predicts declines in rents, but not prices--consistent
with a temporary urban revaluation based on the diminished attractiveness of local nightlife.

  Prices and rents are from Zillow, work from home is computed at the zip level following Dingel and Neiman (2020), log of
  income, median age, percentage of black households, and share of high income households are obtained from the Census,
  and log of restaurants and bars from Safegraph.
   The WFH measure also is an important driver of ZIP-level variation in house price
growth within the MSA, with a 10 percentage point increase in remote workers decreasing
local house price growth by between 0.7­1.4 percentage points. The estimates for the
impact of remote work remain economically and statistically significant after controlling
for ZIP-level covariates. These results point to the importance of remote work options
for urban revaluation both in the short-run (for rents) as well as the long-run (for prices).
Again, the stronger effects on of WFH on rents than on prices points to a expectations of
a partial reversal of the effects of WFH on real estate values.



VI     Conclusion

   A central paradox of the internet age has been that digital tools enable greater col-
laboration at further distances, yet have led to even more concentrated economic activity
into a handful of dense urban areas. We document that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
migration flows it has prompted, has partially reversed this trend. The reversal in the pre-
mium for urban real estate is particularly strong for rents but also present in house prices.
Combining a present-value model with professional forecaster data on the permanency
of working from home, we find that housing markets paint an optimistic picture of urban
revival, indicating higher rent growth in urban versus suburban areas for the foreseeable
future. These shifts in economic activity appear to be related to practices around working
from home, suggesting that they may persist to the extent that employers allow remote
working practices.
   A key benefit to workers of this changing economic geography is being able to access
the larger and more elastic housing stock at the periphery of cities, thereby alleviating
rent burden. However, the results also point to potential problems for local government

                                           York, San Francisco, Los Angeles
The cumulative rent growth over all future years under the transitory case is predicted under two assumptions of the model: (1)
 x = 0, and (2)  x = 0.01 at the ZIP level. These are plotted against log of 1 + distance from the MSA center. The cumulative rent
changes are calculated using Equation (15), but at the ZIP level.

The figure plots the total effect of work from home, stringency measure (orthogonalized), and supply inelasticity measure (orthogo-
nalized) on the rent (price) gradient in Panel A (Panel B). The total effect is calculated using  i · xij for covariate i and MSA j, where  i
is from Table III (Table II) for rents (prices), and xij corresponds to the work from home, stringency, and supply inelasticity index.
