I. INTRODUCTION

      The growing likelihood of major health difficulties Is a principal

feature of the aging process and coping with pOor health may be the single

problem which most distinguishes the economic circumstances of older workers

from that of the young. Beyond the direct utility loss of diminished health,

the person In poor health suffers other adverse economic and social con-

sequences, Including a reduction In income as he or she is forced to reallocate

time from market work to health maintenance activities.1 A number of economists,

Grossman and Benham (1974), Johnson and Berkowitz (1974), Scheffler and Iden

(1974), Schwartz (1974), and Luft (1974, 1975), have recently attempted to

quantify the effect of health status on male labor supply and have found, not

surprisingly, that the effects are large Indeed.2

      The magnitude of the economic loss for a given severity of illness or

accident depends, of course, on the Institutional structure within which the

individual lives and works. Since the family has traditionally been an Important,

If informal health production organization and source of income insurance, the

role of the family in conditioning the relationship between health, labor

supply, and earnings will be explored in this paper.3 Obviously the inter-

action of family structure, health status, and labor supply is quite complex

and I focus below only on a few aspects of this issue, largely relating to the

ability of older families to buffer the economic losses imposed by the adult

male's poor health.

      The main labor supply questions to be considered are the effect of family

structure on the size of the male's labor force withdrawal for a given health

loss and, for married men, the corresponding sensitivity of the spouse's
                                 —2—



market activity to the male's health condition. The relative size of the

afflicted individual's (and family's) income loss will obviously depend

critically on the size of these labor supply responses. The family structure

of the male will be characterized simply by the presence or absence of a

spouse and the education level of the spouse, if present. Spouse's education

is suggested by several health studies which found it to be an important

determinant of male health.4 In the current paper I explore only the labor

supply consequences of poor health and not wage rate effects, a process complex

enough to require separate study.5

     Below I consider the health, family structure, and labor supply inter-

relationships at both a theoretical and empirical level. The paper is organized

in the following way. In Section II, a theoretical model of family time

allocation among market, home, and health activities is developed. The

concept of a family health maintenance function is formalized to generate

qualitative predictions of the effect of wages, health status, health care

efficiency, and property income on the labor supply of husband and wife.

     In Section III, data from the older male portion of the National Longitudinal

Surveys are used to estimate labor supply functions for married and single men

with special attention to differences in poor health responses. A simultaneous

model of male labor supply and other family income (chiefly transfer income

and the earnings of the wife) is then estimated to determine whether variations

in the work hours of males, largely due to health differences, induce any

substantial changes in income producing activities by other family members.

Finally, in Section IV the detailed time budget data on both males and females

from the Productive Americans Survey are used to estimate more precisely the

effect of health on total family time allocations. These data provide estimates

of the impact of poor health on home production time as well as market time

for both husband and wife.
                                      —3—



ii. A THEORETICAL MODEL

     In this section I develop a formal model of the family's health maintenance

and market time activities to provide a clearer understanding of the behavior

of the family when the male member s in poor health. Before proceeding,

it will be useful to introduce some health concepts. In the analysis below

it is important to distinguish carefully between health status (a stock concept)

and health maintenance activities (a flow concept).6 The individual and

family can only determine, for given current health status, how much time and

other resources to invest in improving health conditions, although obviously

current investments in health improvement will affect later health stocks.

Beyond health investments, two related processes affect health capital stock,

a more or less continuous decline in capacity due to aging and random, discrete

shocks such as disease and accident. The latter are also age dependent as the

probability of such shocks rises with age (after a point) while the potential

for recovery diminishes.

          Given these factors, the family can augment the older male's current

health status by allocating his own time to rest, by allocating the time of the

wife to nursing and other personal care activities, and by purchasing medical

goods and services in the market. Two separate but interdependent choices

must be made when the male's health declines; 1) the scale of the health

investment to undertake and ii) the production process to use. The scale of

health Investment will depend on the desire for a higher expected stock of health

in the future and on the cost of a given increment to future expected health
          7
stock..
                                    —4—


                                                                                    .
      I   assume below that the effect of family structure on time allocation

to work and health maintenance, however, is more likely to be shaped by

substitution between husband and wife than by differences in choice of scale

and so I concentrate on that aspect. It should be born in mind, nevertheless,

that health maintenance scale effects may influence the results. Evidence on

health status (the stock) suggests that scale effects, if they exist, will be

in the direction of larger health maintenance investments for men with highly

educated spouse. In the Appendix to this paper for example it is reported that,

controlling for other factors, the likelihood of older males to be in fair

or poor health is reduced by one percentage point (or about 4 percent since about

25 percent of the sample are in these low health categories) for every additional

year of wife's schooling.8

      The nature of the decision maker in the case of poor health also deserves

a short comment. The frequently useful fiction of a family utility function

seems inappropriate in this case since the fundamental individuality of the

family members is quite obvious in matters of health. Direct sharing of the

burden is not possible. The income and home production losses, however, can

and generally are redistributed over the other family members.9 The problem

is simplified in the current analysis since I consider primarily the production

and not the scale decision. I need only assume that the family will produce the

required level of health maintenance in such a way as to yield the maximum

production of other goods.

      This section then explores the variation in family time allocations

induced by poor health and how the allocations are influenced by substitution



                                                                                    .
                                      —5—



 possibilities within the family. To focus on the interaction of health and

 productive hours, the model assumes, first of all, that the leisure time

 of husband and wife are fixed. The husband therefore allocates his remaining

 fixed quantity of time (T) between market work (T1) and health maintenance

 activities (T2). The wife must allocate her total time (t) among market

 work Ct1), health maintenance activities for her husband such as nursing services

 (t2), and home production (t3), so




(1)
         T=T1+T

and



(2)      t=


      The level of health maintenance the husband requires in a particular time

period is assumed to be given by the husband's current health status. The

husband's maintenance requirements, therefore, are treated as a constraint

on family time allocation. The maintenance may be produced, however, by

different combinations of inputs according to a health maintenance production

function. The nature of the health maintenance function is, therefore, crucial

to the working of the model. Presumably health maintenance is a function of

rest or the male's own time inputs (T2), nursing services or the time inputs

of the wife (t2), and purchased goods and services such as medicines, doctors,

hospitals, etc. The health maintenance function developed here will ignore the
                                                                               10
purchased goods inputs and consider only the time inputs of husband and wife.

Of course, caring and nursing services can themselves be purchased in the market
                                                —6—




but   the sporadic timing of activity in the nursing function makes transactions
                                                                                                              .
costs high if the "nurse" can't be occupied with leisure and other tasks in the

household. Health maintenance services (M0) can in the present case be described

by the following function:



(3)      M0 =   M(T2,t2)


where presumably MT , M           >   0       and
                                                         T      Mt
                                                                        <   0   .   In   the analysis below
                          2                             22        22
it will also be assumed that M         0 ,                     that is,
                                                    that the marginal product
                               T2 2
of the time of husband or wife in health maintenance production does not

diminish with more of the respective spouse's time in this activity. It will also

be useful to introduce an efficiency parameter (ci) for wife's maintenance time

so that effective maintenance time (t                   =            enters the maintenance production

function, equation (3).

       Since the level of health maintenance is assumed to be given by the

current health stock, it is natural to assume that the family wants to

maximize its production of home commodities (C) subject to the constraint

on the male's health maintenance. The home commodities are produced by

combining market goods (I) with home production time, indexed by the wife's

time in that activity (t3), so

                                                                                                              .

where 10        property income and W and w represent the wage rate of husband and

wife respectively.

       For simplicity we shall eliminate T2, t3, and I by substitution using

equations (3), (4), and (5) respectively, which leaves the maximization process

subject to the health maintenance constraint only. The Lagrangean to be

maximized then is

       The necessary conditions have straightforward interpretations. Equation (7)

suggests that the husband's time should be split between work and maintenance

so as to equateutilities per unit of time input in both activities. Equations

(8) and (9) suggest comparable equalization of marginal utilities among the

three time uses available for women (work, husband health maintenance, and home

production). The linkage between optimal male and female time allocations can

be made clearer by combining equat1on (7) and (9) which yields the expression:


           M
(11)       M      w/a
             t2


Apparently   the ratio of the marginal products of the two time elements of health

maintenance should be equal to the ratio of efficiency corrected wage rates.

       The comparative statics of the time allocation decision can be more complete-

ly described by forming the differential system of the set of equations (7)

through (10) and then solving for various derivatives of time allocations with

respect to exogenous variables. The differential system and derivations of

qualitative effects reported below can be obtained from the author. The results

of the calculations of various qualitative restrictions on the corresponding

derivatives are suimnarized in Table 1. A number of the major qualitative

predictions are discussed below.

Necessary Health Maintenance Services (M0)

       If the husband's health condition should deteriorate so greater levels

of health maintenance services are required, both husband and wife will shift

additional time into health maintenance services. For the husband this

directly implies a reduction in work in this model. For the wife the

important implication for market time is ambiguous.     The source of the

ambiguity is clear. Her husband's poor health leads her to devote more time to

nursing and care services but, since her husband is simultaneously withdrawing

from the market, the family finds her time in market more valuable than before.

The extent to which market hours increase (decrease) gives some idea of the self—
                                                                                    .
insurance value of the wife's earning power to the family.    If the amount of

nursing time she can fruitfully undertake is limited, she could be expected

to increase her work time. In any case, the sum of work time plus nursing time

should increase and home production unambiguously decrease.

     The implications for the labor supply response of males without spouses

in this model is clear without the elaborate analysis. Since he has no spouse

who may substitute her time in his health maintenance production, single males

are likely to withdraw from the market more than married males. Only if single

men chose to run down their health capital at a faster rate (or improve it

more slowly) than married men would they be likely to withdraw less from the

market.

Wage Rate of the Husband (W)

     An increase in the wage rate of the husband leads to a shift from health

maintenance into market work by the husband as the value of his time rises in

the latter activity. The wife adjusts by increasing her health maintenance

time and reducing her market time. Home production of the wife also rises

since home production is restricted to be a normal good in this case and real

income has risei. This time too will be taken from market time.

Wage Rate   of the Wife (w)
     The effect of a higher wage for the wife on the husband's time allocation
is to shift the husband out of the market and into health maintenance. The wife's

health maintenance time will, therefore, be reduced. The ambiguity of off-




                                                                                    .
setting income and substitution effects of a wage change on the labor/home

production choice is comparable to the more usual labor/leisure ambiguity.          —
                                 — 11—




The Health Maintenance 'Efficiency' of the Wife (a)

      If the wife is more efficient at providing health maintenance services,

the husband will substitute more time in the market for health maintenance.

The wife, however, may not increase her time in providing health maintenance,

indeed, she may reduce it since each unit of time previously used in that

function yields more services. This effect makes predictions about changes in

market work time ambiguous as well, as apparently any increase or decrease in

maintenance time comes from market time. Home production time unambiguously

increases (reflecting again the normal good aspect of this time).

    Limitations in the data increase the ambiguity of the predictions yet

further. Wife's wage rate and health maintenance efficiency, for example, are

not directly measurable (at least for all women) and observable characteristics

such as wife's schooling quite likely confound both wage and efficiency effects.

Even if it is assumed that higher wages are likely to shift women more into

the market and that greater health maintenance efficiency is likely to lead

them into a greater nursing and health care role, the sign of the effect of

schooling on market time will depend on which of these opposing forces is

stronger.

III. THE LABOR SUPPLY OF OLDER MALES: EMPIRICAL RESULTS

     The theoretical model of the preceding section emphasizes the importance

of empirical work since even the direction of effect of a number of important

characteristics are ambiguous. In this section, data from the older male

cohort (ages 45—59) of the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) will be explored.

 The NLS is a national longitudinal survey o the labor market character-

istics of four age cohorts of about 5000 persons each?3 The survey is

representative of the U.S. population except for a substantial oversampling

of blacka(30 percent of total). The labor supply behavior of the men and, in

particular, their differential response to poor health will be estimated. The

sensitivity of other income, specifically earned income of other family members

to the work hours of the males is then estimated in a simultaneous framework.

     As a benchmark, a standard labor supply model without health variables

with annual work hours as the dependent variable was estimated using the NLS

data.14   The results are reported in Table 2, column 1. Skill variables,

schooling and occupation, have their expected positive effect on hours. A high

school graduate works on average about 220 hours more than a worker who

quit school after sixth grade, although a college graduate works less. A blue

collar occupation (craftsman, operative, etc.) has an independent negative

effect of 300 hours. Poor labor market conditions reduce work hours as one

would expect, as does aging and being black.

     The family effects on labor supply are substantial. Married men with spouse

present work almost 140 hours more than other men independent of the spouse's

education level and about 14 additional hours for each year of schooling of the




                                                                                   S

will, on average, work about 300 more hours than a single man. With each

additional dependent, work hours increase an average of 20 hours per year,

a statistically significant if not absolutely large effect.

    The question remains whether these results are biased by the absence of

health stock. In Table 2, column 2 the annual hour regressions are re—

estimated with a set of dummies HG, HF, and HP which equal one if self reported
                                                                                 15
health status is judged to be good, fair, or poor respectively, zero otherwise.

The reference health status is excellent health (HE). The health variables,

particularly the presence of poor health, strongly influence labor supply.

Poor health status, for example, implies a reduction of 1300 hours or 65 percent

of a standard work year of 2000 hours. The explanatory power of the regression

is dramatically increased from an R2 of 0.11 to an     of 0.25.

    Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the estimates of the non—health

variables in column 2 is the apparent lack of bias induced by exclusion of the

health variables. Only the schooling and age coefficients change a statistically

significant magnitude with the introduction of the health measures. Both the

positive schooling effect and the negative aging effect are substantially reduced

with the introduction of health. perhans a predictable result since both are

similarly and strongly related to good health (see ADPendix). Of oarticular

iurnortance here., the effects of the family variables on labor sutrnlv remain

enerallv unchanged, although labor supply is estimated to be somewhat less

closely related to schooling level of the spouse with the health variables

included.

    To answer the question of whether married men have a different labor supply


                                                                                      .

reaction to poor health than do single men, the total sample was separated into

married and single sub—samples and the regression model with health variables

reestimated. The coefficient estimates are reported in Table 2, columns 3 and 4.

    The differences in behavior by health status are dramatic with hours

reductions (relative to a base of excellent health) of 34, 172, and 1222 hours

for good, fair, and poor health respectively for married men and 158,391, and

1677 hours for men without spouse present. The differential work hour reduction

of single men then is 124, 219, and 455 hours annual for the three lesser

health categories. In terms of a fraction of a normal work year (2000 hours),

married men in poor health are forced to contract their annual hours in the

market by 61 percent while single men contract their work hours by 84 percent.

Single men can, then, expect to suffer a reduction beyond that of married men

of an additional 23 percent of their original earnings when poor health strikes.

In the context of the theoretical model above, this suggests that the wife's

nursing and care services are a substantial substitute for the husband's time

in the provision of health maintenance services. As a result the married man

can remain more in the market for given health levels.

    The interesting question arises whether the "quality" of the wife measured

by her level of education will also affect the degree of labor force withdrawal

of unhealthy married men.16 Theoretically the answer is ambiguous since

schooling is likely to increase the female's efficiency in health maintenance,

implying a reduction in male withdrawal from the market, and also likely to

increase her market wage,with the opposite effect on male labor supply. Regressions

identical to that reported in Table 2, column 3, were run separately for

married men whose spouses had 12 or more years of education and those whose

spouses has less than 12 years of education. The results, not fully reported
                                    —16—



here,   suggest very little difference in male labor supply reduction as
                                                                                      .
men with highly educated wives withdrew 0, 152, and 1169 hours when health

was good, fair, and poor while men with low educated wives withdrew 69, 191, and

1240 hours per year. The maximum difference is never greater than 71 hours per

year or less than two normal weeks.

A Simultaneous Model of Male Work Hours and Other Income

    In the analysis above other family income was not included even though

several researchers have found a strong effect of other family income on

male labor supply. Even though male labor supply may be conditioned by other

income sources, other income, particularly transfer income and earned income of

other family members (largely that of the spouse), may depend on the labor

supply of the male. In this subsection I attempt to provide estimates of the

effects of other income on male labor supply and male labor supply on other

income using simultaneous methods. This should allow us to determine whether

the other income of the family conditions labor supply behavior of the male

and, more importantly, whether male labor supply reductions induce increased

earnings by the spouse.

        The empirical estimates above indicate that the labor supply (and therefore

earnings) of older males drops sharply with poor health. An important social

question remains, however, of how adequately transfer income and earned income

of other family marnbers compensate for this loss. These estimates should

provide insights into this question as well as providing a useful introduction

to a more complete study of the time allocation responses of the spouse to poor

health in the husband, to be carried out in the next section.




                                                                                      .
                                      —17—



       The basic argument for a simultaneous model is that other family income is

likely to affect the labor supply decision of the man, yet transfers (particularly

welfare and unemployment compensation) and earned family income may vary with

the work hours chosen. The simultaneous model, therefore, can be represented

simply as follows:




(12)       H =   f(0I,   X1)



and



(13)       01 = g(H,
                     X2)



where H          annual work hours, 01 E other family income, and X1, X2   vectors

of exogenous variables. Several researchers have found a strong effect of other

family income on male labor supply. The analysis which follows should provide

some tentative answers as to whether that empirical phenomenon is the result

of simultaneity bias. As the theoretical model suggests, not even the direction

of the change in spouse's earnings in response to health induced work hour

reductions in the husband is known a priori. The spouse may drop out of market

work to increase her nursing and caring time or alternatively may increase her

market time to compensate for the family's income loss.

       In the simultaneous model below, total other family Income was divided

into two components, the sum of wealth income and non—work related transfer

payments and the sum of work related transfer income and earned income
                                  —18—



of other family members. The former was assumed to be exogenous to the system

and was initially treated as an explanatory variable in labor supply, although
                                                                                   17
it was later dropped because it implied positive wealth effects on labor supply.

The second sum is assumed to be endogenous in this system and will be called

below simply "other income".

     The content of the vectors of exogenous variables X1 and X2 in equations

(12) and (13) remains to be specified before the system can be estimated. The

exogenous variables in the work hours equation have been discussed at length

above; the relationship will be assumed similar to that reported in Table 2.

The exogenous variables in the other income equation presumably include factors

which influence the earning power of the wife (schooling, her health, etc.)

as well as factors likely to affect the size of transfer flows (number of depen-

dents and urban residence).

     Turning to the estimation results, one will find the reduced form estimates

of hours and other income reported in Table 3, columns 1 and 2. The estimates

of coefficients in the work hours regression are not much different than the

earlier results reported in Table 2., although the coefficient on one additional

variable, wife's health for married men, is interesting. If the wife has an

activity—limiting health problem, the husband works an average of about 100

hours less than he otherwise would, presumably because he must increase his

home production time. We will consider this issue at greater length in the

next section.

     The other income reduced form estimates in column 2 have not been discussed

above and bear closer examination. Other income is substantially higher for

men with healthy, well educated spouses. The significant quadratic form for

wife's schooling in this equation suggests that other income increases at an

increasing   rate with wife's education.. If the wife has an activity—limiting

health problem, other family income is reduced by an average of more than $500.

Other income, however, rises with various indices of poor health in the husband,

presumably due to some combination of welfare and adjustments in other family

earnings. The reasonably small sizes of the health effects on transfers and other

family earnings, under $1000 in the case of poor health in the husband, suggest

that the effect of m1e labor supply on other income is substantial but well

short of fully compensating the workers in poor health. Urban residence

corresponds to about $300 more in other income for the family.

     Two stage least square estimates of the structural equations are reported

in Table 3, columns 3 and 4. The coefficient of male hours on other family

income is significant and indicates that other income increases by about $0.75

for every one hour reduction in male hours worked. The coefficient of other

income in the hours equation,however, is insignificant and indeed positive.

Taken at face value these results suggest that male hours affect the earnings

behavior of other family members and the flow of transfer payinents,but them-

selves are not affected by the size of these other income flows. The latter

result, however, must be held with some caution since the instrument used for

other income has an     of only 0.12, suggesting that almost 90% of the varia-

tion in other income has been discarded in the estimation process. The instru-

ment may not be very useful in this case. Most of the other coefficients are

not substantially changed from the reduced form estimates.

     To throw some light on the question of whether it is other earned income

or transfer payments that primarily account for the increase in other family

income when male work hours are reduced, the simultaneous estimation was repeated

for married men only and other income limited to other earned family income.
                                   —21—



The reduced form and structural estimates of this modified model are reported

in Table 4. The reduced form equation for other earned income (column 2)

indicates that this income is fairly insensitive to the health status of the

male. Income increases by $130, $235, and $182 as health drops from excellent

to good, fair, and poor respectively.

     This implication is confirmed in the structural estimates presented in

columns 3 and 4. Family income has the same anomalous positive impact on male

work hours and male work hours have a negative impact on family income. The

estimated coefficient of hours on other family income, however, is sharply

reduced in magnitude from the preceding model. A loss of one hour worked by

the male is offset by only about $0.23 increase in the earned income of other

family members. Apparently most of the income compensation for health induced

variation in husband work hours results from transfer payments and not from

work hour adjustments of other family members.

     Dividing the sample by wife's education (SW   12, SW < 12) and reestirnating
the equations does not materially alter these conclusions (the full results are

not reported here). The insurance value of more highly educated wives is

substantially, if not statistically significantly, above that of less educated

wives. For every reduction of one hour in male work hours, other family earned

income rises by $0.49 for highly educated wives and only $0.14 for less educated

wives with respective t—values of 1.72 and 1.06. While interesting, in neither

case is the effect substantial.

     Apparently other family members do not go into the market in a strong and

systematic way when the husband falls ill. This may partially result from the

fixed costs of either entering the market if one does not currently have a job

or of increasing one's hours if one is already in the market. The model of the

preceding section, however, suggests this result might be due to the increased

home time demands of the wife while the husband is ill. The question of

intrafamily time allocation is pursued in more detail in the next section with

a data set which allows exploration of the behavior of home production hours

as well as market hours.

IV. INTRAFANILY ALLOCATION OF HOURS: HEALTH EFFECTS

     The NLS sample of the preceding section unfortunately lacks any information

on the non—market uses of time by household members. In this section I examine

data from the Productive Americans Survey to develop a more complete picture

of the time adjustments families make when husband or wife falls ill or otherwise

becomes physically incapacitated. The Productive Americans Survey is a single
                                                                                    18
 survey carried out in early 1965 with observations on 2214 families of all ages.

Although the subsample of families in the older age group under study here is

 substantially less in number than the National Longitudinal Survey, the Productive

Americans Survey has the advantage of containing measures of home productive

work hours (cooking, cleaning, household maintenance, etc.) as well as market

work hours for the husband and wife. This obviously allows more complete

 consideration of the allocation of hours within families. Although a complete

 analysis would require simultaneous estimation°,,these hours decisions, the

 statistical work below is somewhat more modest. The estimated equations can

be interpreted as reduced form estimates of the system.

      One problem with the Productive American Survey is that the health measures

 are less complete. The estimates of general health stock are absent and only

 information on the existence of a work limiting health condition is available,

 a variable that must be viewed with some caution In a labor supply study. Since

 the NLS data contain both types of information, the two are compared In Table 5.

 The cross tabulations suggest that while virtually none of the older men in

 excellent health have work limiting health and virtually all in poor health do,

 the relationship is less clear cut for the other health groups. Indeed of the



                                                                                         S

individuals who report that health limits their work in some fashion, only

25 percent are in poor health. With that bit of caution in mind let us turn

to the results.

     In Table 6, regression results for the market time, home time, and total

productive time of older males are reported. Health measures are limited in

this data to dummies reflecting the presence (or absence) of an activity—

limiting health problem for the husband and wife. In column 1, estimates of

market work effects are reported. Consistent with the results reported in the

preceding section, the husband's own poor health forces a reduction in work

hours of about 700 hours annually. His wife's health problems induce a modest

and statistically insignificant increase in his work hours of about 30 hours

annually. This is inconsistent with the significant and negative coefficient

of wife's health on market hours in the NLS sample (See Table 3, column 1) of

about 115 hours.

     The impact of health on the male's home work corresponds with expectations.

The husband's own health status has no effect on his home work hours although

poor health in his wife leads to a statistically significant increase in his

home work hours. On average the husband seems to increase his home work by

about 200 hours when his wife develops a health problem.

     The other coefficients are broadly consistent with the earlier results.

Both blacks and blue collar workers work in the market substantially less than

other males, although in the case of blacks this is partially offset by sig-

nificantly higher home production hours. In these estimates, neither schooling

of the husband nor that of the wife have substantial effects on market or home

work hours.

     Separating the sample by the schooling of the female (less than twelve

years or greater than or equal to twelve years) did not reveal any major

differences by type of household. Poor health in the male resulted in an annual

work hours withdrawal of 695 hours in low schooling households, 681 in high,

with no significant change in male home work hours. Wife's health difficulties

did induce a somewhat different time allocation by the male in these two groups.

Males with less educated wives tended to increase home work hours by 279 hours

while reducing market hours by 91 hours. Males with more educated wives

increased home hours by only 73 and increased market hours by 207. Only the

result for home time of the husbands of less educated women was statistically

significant however.

    In   Table 7 comparable regression results are reported for married
                                                                                .
women, 40—64. For married women, poor health involves a reduction in

market hours of about 361 hours annually and no significant change in home

work hours. Total work hours, both market and home, then drop by about

380 hours. The poor health of the husband leads to an increase of about

140 hours in market work and a small and insignificant decrease in home

hours. The latter is made possible, one might conjecture, by the ability

to substitute tasks within home hours ——   e.g.,   nursing for cleaning.

    The combined effect of poor health of the husband on total family work

hours is a loss of 560 market hours and unchanged home hours. The effect on

family hours of poor health of the wife is a loss of about 330 market hours

and a gain of 173 home hours. The husband works about 600 hours less in

total when he is ill, the wife about 400 hours less when she is ill. When the

spouse is ill, men increase their work hours and decrease their leisure by

about 200 hours, largely in home production, while women increase their work

hours by about 100 hours, largely in market work.

    The influence of non—health variables on female time allocations is worth

considering for its own sake.     Aging here leads to a reduction in market

work but not home work. The schooling of the husband leads to a reduction

in both market and home work for the wife, with the latter effect roughly

twice as large in magnitude, so total work hours drop substantially (about

40 hours per year of schooling of the husband). The wife's schooling on the

other hand leads to a simple shift in hours from the home into the market

of about 40 hours per school year with no change in total hours worked.

    The race coefficients are insignificant but seem to suggest black women

of children under 18 in the household leads to a large shift out of the

market (160 hours per child), an even larger shift into home production

(240 hours), and a corresponding moderate reduction in leisure (80 hours).

The presence of children under six leads to a moderate shift out of work

and leisure into home production, although the coefficients are insignificant,

largely I suspect because of the small number of women in this older sample

with children under six.

    The separation of the sample by wife's education and reestimation of the

wife time regressions reveal an interesting difference in the behavior of

the two groups. The positive market work hour effect of husband's poor health,

noted in the sample as a whole, is solely due to the response of highly

educated wives who increase their work in the market by 270 hours. The less

well educated wives did not increase their market hours at all when the

husband encounters a health difficulty. Whether this differential response

is the result of differential access to the labor market or simply to the

comparative advantage of lower educated wives in health maintenance (of the

husband) is impossible to tell from this data.

V. CONCLUSION

    The main objective of this study has been the exploration of the

interrelation of health and the allocation of time within the family.

Particular attention is paid to health effects on the joint labor supply

of husbands and wives and to the differential labor supply responses to

poor health of married and single men. The impact of health on home

production hours of the family is also considered. The results are of more

than academic interest as they give an indication of how well older indiv-

iduals and families can economically cope with poor health.

    At the theoretical level the concept of a health maintenance function is

introduced into a family time allocation model to generate predictions on the

time allocation effect of variation in market and health parameters. It is

argued that wives can substitute their time for their husband's time in his

rehabilitation process, which suggests that married men should devote more

time to market activity than single men of equally poor health as long as

both demand about the same amount of health investment in total. A number

of critical ambiguities arise in the attempt to predict the market behavior

of females when their husbands are in poor health. The wife may withdraw from

the market to care for her ill husband or alternatively enter the market to

compensate for his lost Income depending on the relative efficiency of her

time in each activity. Actually she may even increase time in both activities

at the expense of other home activities. Similar ambiguities arise in

attempting to predict the effect of wife's schooling on the time allocation

decision since it increases health maintenance efficiency as well as market

value.

    The empirical analysis of the labor supply of older men (ages 45—59) from
                                                                                  .
the National Longitudinal Survey demonstrates the importance of health

condition in the choice of annual work hours and the importance of family

structure in conditioning that response. An individual in poor health for

example works, on average, 1300 hours less per year than similarly educated

(and aged) men in excellent health. The work hours reduction in this case

for married men is however 450 hours less annually than for single men (or

more precisely men with no spouse present). Considered from a standard 2000

hour year the decline in annual hours for single men in poor health is

84 percent of a full employment year while only 61 percent for married men.

Since there is no -corresponding fall in the scale of health investment by

married men (indeed there appears to be a rise), the evidence is consistent

with the notion that married men can marshal resources other than their

own time, particularly their wives' time,to augment the health of the male.

This effect is largely independent of the wife's education level.

    A simultaneous model of male labor supply and other family income is also

estimated on the NLS data to determine the effect of other family income on

male labor supply and male labor supply on other family income. The models

suggest that other income does not have a substantial effect on labor supply

but that male labor supply has a significant effect on other family income.

Total other income is estimated to increase about $0.75 for each one hour

reduction in work hours of the older male. About two—thirds of this subsidy

comes from social welfare sources, one—third from increased earnings of other

family members. Other family Income increases substantially only in house-

holds where the wife has high levels of education.

    Finally, in Section IV time budget data from the Productive American Survey

are used to trace out more fully health effects of family time decisions.

For both husbands and wives, one's own health problems appear to lead to

substantial market time withdrawals (about 700 hours and 350 hours res-

pectively) while home work hours remain unchanged. As one might expect,

illness in one's spouse leads to quite different time allocation responses

as men increase their home production time, women their market work time.

These work time increases appear to come largely from leisure time in both

cases.

     Although the results of this paper are themselves interesting, I believe

they represent only the beginning of the investigation of the family as an

informal health service organization. Theoretically the choice of level of

health maintenance must be more completely integrated with choice of technique.

Beyond this theoretical development other aspects in the interrelation of

health, the market, and family structure remain to be explored. A particularly

crucial element that requires further study is the role of wage rate variations

and other productivity effects of poor health in this choice structure)9 A

number of other researchers have found significant racial differences in labor

supply response to poor health so this again may   be   a useful area for further
               20
exploration.

     'Some portion of this loss is no doubt insurable although the problems
of moral havard are likely to be quite large in this situation for all but the
most obvious phyisical difficulties.

    2The study by Morgan et al (1962) also remains interesting and useful.
Other economists have examined the determinants of work days due to sickness.
See Newhouse (1970), Silver (1970), and Grossman (1972). Since this measure
is limited to employed persons it is not a very useful measure for severe
health difficulties.

     3For one interesting effort to consider this problem from a largely
sociological viewpoint see Nagi and Hadley (1972).

     4Grossman (1973), for example, has found in one sample that the health of
an older male is more closely correlated with the education of the wife than
his own education.

     5The wage effects of poor health are considered in an interesting piece
by Grossman and Benham (1973).

     6Grossman (1972) stresses this distinction. The further distinction made
by Grossman between health maintenance time and sick time is ignored here.

     7mis aspect has been ably discussed by Grossman (1972).

     8An alternative explanation of this relationship is possible, namely that
healthier males can attract and marry higher quality (educated) females. Since
these results are for older males, ages 45—59, the simultaneity problem is some-
what diminished. The bulk of these individuals are likely to have developed
health problems in the twenty to thirty years since the usual marriage age. See
Benham (1974) and Welch (1974) for a discussion of this issue.

     9Relatively stable shares among family members when one suffers some economic
adversity implies the "rents" to the relationship going to the unaffected party
or parties will fall. Presumably increased marital instability might result.
         number of researchers including Auster, Leveson, and Sarachek (1969),
Grossman (1972), and Fuchs (1974) have stressed the importance of social
phenomenon —— consumption habits, personal relationships, etc. —— as determinants
of health status, in contrast to narrowly defined medical care.

       Note that this home commodity is somewhat different from that used by
Becker since home work time but not leisure are used to produce it. See
Becker (1965).

       In the derivation of qualitative predictions from the differential system
generated below, this function is assumed to be additive.

        Annual hours were chosen because of interest in measuring roughly an
 earnings effect of health. Other researchers have estimated health effects on
 labor force participation, weeks worked per year, and hours worked per week.
 Both Davis (1972) and Scheffler and Iden (1974) report that weeks worked are
more sensitive to poor health than are hours per week. Burgess and Kingston
(1974) report modestly greater duration of unemployment for workers in poor
health.

     15A classic piece by Nagi (1969) compares self reported health condition
with a doctor's opinion and finds a substantial correspondence of the two.
Deviations where systematic are not necessarily in the intuitively predictable
direction.

       As mentioned earlier Grossman (1973) found wife's schooling to be strongly
related to the health status of one sample of middle—aged man.

       A complete model would, no doubt, treat assets and asset income as an
endogenous variable.
