                  EQUITY ISSUES AND STOCK PRICE DYNAMICS


                                 ABSTRACT
      This paper presents an information-theoretic, infinite horizon model of

the equity issue decision.   The model's predictions about stock price behavior

and issue timing explain most of the stylized facts in the empirical

literature:   (a) equity issues on average are preceded by an abnormal positive

return on the stock, although there is considerable variation across firms,

(b) equity issues on average are preceded by an abnormal rise in the market,

and (c) the stock price drops significantly at the announcement of an issue.

In this model, the price drop at issue announcement is uncorrelated with the

social cost of suboptimal investment due to asymmetric information; the

welfare loss may be small even if the price drop is large.
