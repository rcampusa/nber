The Effects of HMO and Its For-Profit Expansion on the Survival of Specialized Hospital

                                          ABSTRACT

This study examines the effect of HMO and for-profit HMO share on the survival of safety net
services and profitable services in hospitals. Using data from 1990-2003 and proportional hazard
models, I find that hospitals in high HMO markets started out having lower hazard of shutting down
services in 1990-1994 than those in low HMO markets, but their hazard rates increase over time. By
2000-2003, hospitals in high HMO markets ended up with higher risk of shutting down profitable
services than those in low HMO markets. Conditional on overall HMO penetration, markets with
higher for-profit share of HMOs have higher hazard of shutting down services, and the gap in
survival between high and low for-profit HMO markets is bigger in high HMO areas. Lastly, I find
that the hazard rate of shutting down profitable services is comparable among not-for-profit,
for-profit, and government hospitals, while the hazard of shutting down safety net services is the
highest in for-profit hospitals and lowest in government hospitals.

                                          1. Introduction

       Over the past decade, the US health care system has undergone significant structural

changes, including changes in hospital ownership, increasing competition in the HMO industry,

and increasing for-profit presence in many health care sectors. Perhaps the most profound

market change is the emergence of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO). Under the

traditional fee-for-service payment system, hospitals can charge services based on cost and have

little incentive to engage in cost saving practices. HMOs had adopted strategies that allowed

them to aggressively control health care costs, including negotiating deep discounts with

providers and restricting access to providers outside of the network (Bamezai et al 1999; Draper

et al 2002). Hospitals responded to the explosion of HMO growth by reducing cost of operation

(Gaskin and Hadley 1997; Bamezai et al 1999; Morrisey 2001; Shen and Melnick 2004).

However, there is little empirical evidence on whether they achieve this cost saving at the

expense of patient welfare. For example, do hospitals become hesitant to adopt life-saving

technology because its expected profit is too low in the HMO environment? Do hospitals drop

safety net services under the financial pressure from HMO?

       While several studies have found that higher HMO presence led to a slow down of

technology diffusion in hospitals (Cutler and McClellan 1996; Cutler and Sheiner 1997; Baker

2001; Baker and Phibbs 2002), there has not been studies investigating whether higher HMO

presence increase the risk of hospitals shutting down safety net services (such as substance abuse

treatment center, emergency department). Furthermore, despite retrenchment in the overall

HMO penetration rate since 2000 (Figure 1), there is a growing for-profit presence in the HMO

market (Figure 2). Classic microeconomics framework would suggest that the profit maximizing

for-profit HMO plans would exert even greater financial pressure on its providers than not-for-


                                                1
profit HMO plans. Whether such pressure translates to hospitals dropping unprofitable services

remains to be examined. This study aims to fill these gaps in the literature. In particular, I

address the following research questions: (1) Does higher HMO penetration increase the risk of

shutting down specialized services in hospitals? (2) Conditional on overall HMO penetration,

does the risk of service shut down vary by whether hospitals are operating in predominantly for-

profit HMO markets or predominantly not-for-profit HMO markets?

       I contrast the analysis between safety net services (Gaskin 1999; Zuckerman et al 2001)

and other public health services that are relatively more profitable (Horwitz 2005). Examples of

safety net services include emergency department, HIV/AIDS services, substance abuse services;

examples of public health and profitable services include maternity care, birthing room, and

sports medicine. The two types of services allow me to contrast any possible differential exit

pattern due to their expected profitability. Using hospital and HMO data from 1990 to 2003, I

first compare service exit rates in hospitals operating in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)

with varying degrees of HMO penetration. I then compare the risk of hospital service exit in

MSAs where for-profits have gained a large share of the HMO market to MSAs where not-for-

profit plans retain a substantial share of HMO enrollment.

       Shutting down specialized services in one hospital can have rippling effects in the

community. When a hospital shuts down a specialized service, many patients will suffer

disruption of care as they scramble to identify the next available hospital. This is especially

unsettling for patients requiring multiple treatment visits such as pregnancy or substance abuse

problems. When safety net services are shut down, the largest impact would be felt by low-

income population in the area, as they are the major users of these services. It also takes a toll on

neighbor hospitals as they would have to absorb the influx of patients. Exploring how HMO




                                                  2
presence affects these exit decisions allow us to understand some of the pathways in which HMO

affects patient welfare.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. I discuss the background literature in section

2. I describe the data sources and empirical strategy in section 3. I present the results in section

4, and conclude in section 5.



                                            2. Background

       Majority of literature examining the effect of HMO on hospital behavior focused on the

financial side of the operation (see Morrisey 2001 for a review). In general, the literature found

that hospitals in high HMO penetration markets tend to have slower revenue and cost growth

than those in low HMO penetration markets. A recent study further found that hospitals in

predominantly for-profit HMO markets have experienced slower cost growth than those in

predominantly not-for-profit HMO markets (Shen and Melnick 2004). However, there is little

evidence on whether the cost saving was achieved by shifting away from unprofitable services or

by offering services that can attract healthier and wealthier patients.

       The conceptual effect of HMO on service offering is ambiguous (Morrisey 2001; Baker

and Phibbs 2002). Consider the following two competing hypotheses. If cost can be reduced

through economies of scale, then the financial pressure from HMO would drive hospitals to

specialize in particular, perhaps more profitable, services. Given the scarce resources,

specializing in new profitable services might come at the expense of shutting down existing less

profitable services. On the other hand, economy of scope might be the hospital’s dominant

strategy. If a hospital wants to attract health plans by position itself as the one-stop care center, it

would add services that are complementary to those it already provides and rely on economy of




                                                   3
scope to maintain its financial position. In this case, we would not see much difference in

service exit rates across HMO markets. A commonly held belief is that firms in high HMO

markets will tend to adopt new services later than firms in low HMO markets, either because the

downward pressure from HMO lowers the expected profitability of the new service, or because

the deterioration of overall financial positions of hospitals can no longer support investment in

new services (Baker and Phibbs 2002).

       There is less discussion about whether and how the increasing for-profit presence in

HMO markets would affect those service shut down decisions. However, microeconomics

framework usually models for-profit entities as profit maximizers while places more emphasize

on non-monetary objectives in not-for-profit entities. If the HMO market is predominantly for-

profit, one would expect the downward pressure on hospital revenue stream to be greater, and

thus even slower adoption of technology that require substantial financial investment and faster

exit rate of unprofitable services.

       The discussion of HMO’s potential effect on those service adoption and shut down

decisions should not overlook the changing landscape of HMO activities since the late 1990s.

The HMO industry enjoyed a period of rapid growth in the early 1990s, the explosion of growth

was fueled by concerns of rising health care cost during that period. However, such aggressive

strategies created a deep mistrust in consumers in the later part of the 1990s (Swartz 1999,

Robinson 2001). The negative portrayals of managed care plans in the media further created a

chasm between managed care and consumers/providers, even when a consumer might not have

felt dissatisfied with his or her own health plan (Blendon et al. 1998). Shen and Melnick (2006)

found that HMO and managed care plans in general have lost their cost containment ability of

the provider market in the 21st century. Some of that were due to HMOs relaxing their many



                                                 4
once restrictive network requirements and deep discounting (Draper et al 2002; Mays et al 2003,

2004; Marquis et al 2005). In this paper, I take into account potential differential effects of

HMO on hospital service exit rates during different phases of HMO growth.

       The empirical literature studying the effect of HMO on service offering decisions (mainly

studies of adoption decisions) is mixed. Some found higher HMO market shares to be associated

with decreased availability of technology in areas such as angioplasty (Cutler and McClellan

1996), magnetic resonance imaging (Baker and Wheeler 1998; Baker 2001), and mid-level

neonatal intensive care units (Baker and Phibbs 2002). Similarly, using state level managed care

data, Cutler and Sheiner (1997) examined a wide set of technology and services that all involved

a steep sunk cost, and found that managed care has reduced the diffusion of medical

technologies. On the other hand, Baker and Phibbs (2002) found that higher HMO market share

has not slowed down the rate of adoption of most advanced high-level NICU units. Morrisey

(2001) discussed a working paper in which the authors found that increasing HMO penetration is

associated with increasing admission in pediatric services among general acute hospitals. Baker

and Spetz (1998), examining an index of hospital technological advancement and found no HMO

effect. The literature to date all focused on the adoption decision of technology with a high fixed

cost. My study instead will focus on the other end of the spectrum—I study exit rate of services

that do not necessarily require a substantial sunk cost.

       The discussion about the survival of hospital services also cannot ignore an important

aspect of hospital industry: it is predominantly run by not-for-profit organizations. While there

is a wealth of empirical literature exploring the role of ownership in different aspects of hospital

operation (see reviews in Sloan 2000; Shen et al 2005; Eggleston et al 2006), there have been

few empirical studies that investigated the ownership effect on service offerings in hospitals. One




                                                  5
hypothesis is that for-profit hospitals might respond to change in demand quicker than others

because they have easier and quicker access to the capital market (Hirth 1999). Earlier studies,

examining technology adoption before the rise of HMO and prospective payment system, found

that there were no statistically significant differences in adoption between not-for-profit and for-

profit hospitals (Sloan 2000). A recent study, using a panel of US hospitals from 1988 to 2000,

examined 35 services in hospitals that can be categorize into different profitability categories.

The author found that for-profits are most likely to offer relatively profitable medical services;

government hospitals are most likely to offer relatively unprofitable services; and nonprofits

often fall in the middle (Horwitz 2005). The present analysis of service shut down risks will take

into account hospital ownership differences.

       In summary, although there is a wealth of literature examining how HMOs affect the

financial side of hospital operation, there is less focus on understanding its effect on service

adoption and disruption. Changing the mixture of service offered is certainly one way to improve

the financial position of the hospital. Few studies examine service adoption decisions and none

on exit behaviors. This study aims to fill the gap.



                                        3. Empirical Methods

Overview of Empirical Strategy

       The primary data sources for the analysis are the American Hospital Association (AHA)

annual surveys, Hospital cost report from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services

(CMS), and the HMO enrollment and ownership data provided by Laurence Baker and

Interstudy. The unit of analysis is hospital and I examine the risk of service shut down between




                                                  6
1990 and 2003. I use proportional hazard models to analyze the effects of HMO and for-profit

share of HMO on the hazard of hospitals shutting down safety net and profitable services.



Sample and Data Sources

        The analytical sample includes all general, acute, short-stay hospitals in metropolitan

statistical areas (MSA) between 1990 and 2003. Separate indicators of the different ownership

structure (not-for-profit, for-profit, government, whether ownership was changed) are included in

the analyses. My analysis utilizes all 14 years of information with two exceptions. Analysis of

child wellness and AIDS services are limited to 1994-2003 period because data are not available

before 1994.1 I limit the sample to hospitals in MSAs because the majority of HMO enrollment

occurred in MSAs during this period, and hospitals in rural areas behave differently from those

in urban areas. Lastly I exclude a handful of Kaiser Foundation hospitals since they serve

exclusively Kaiser health plan enrollees. This sampling frame contains about 3000 hospitals in

322 MSA markets in each year for a total of 33000 hospital-year observations.

        Hospital Data. Hospital data primarily come from the American Hospital Association

(AHA) Annual Surveys and Medicare hospital cost reports by CMS. Together, they provide

detailed information on hospitals’ financial performance, inpatient and outpatient utilization, and

other characteristics. I supplement hospital ownership data with those provided by Frank Sloan.2

Particularly important to this project are the service measures hospitals self reported to the AHA

surveys. I describe the services and limitations in AHA data in more details below.

        HMO Data. HMO is one of many types of managed care plans. Managed care plans are

in 1994 in such a way that I cannot construct a consistent time series.

  The underlying data are still from AHA, Dr. Sloan tracked down CEO and CFO of hospitals with suspicious
ownership change.


                                                       7
antithesis of fee-for-service plans and are loosely defined as health plans that engage in activities

that reduce high levels of utilization such as utilization review board and deep discounts with

providers. There are two practical reasons to focus on HMO. First, it accounts for majority of

managed care activities, especially during the 1990s. Second, this is the only form of managed

care plan whose enrollments were tracked consistently over the years and whose data are

available for sufficient number of years to carry out exit analysis. As discussed in sensitivity

analysis later, I also experiment with using a more comprehensive managed care measure that

includes both HMO and PPO (preferred provider organizations). I use the HMO only measure in

my main analysis because it is more reliable.

        Overall HMO penetration rates at the MSA level between 1990 and 2003 are provided by

Laurence Baker of Stanford University. The HMO penetration rate is measured as total HMO

enrollment as a share of MSA population. The underlying data sources are from HMO Census

conducted by the Group Health Association of America from 1990 and 1994 and by InterStudy

from 1995 to 2003. Detailed methodology of the smoothing between the two data sources can be

found in Baker (1997).

        In addition, HMO ownership information between 1994 and 2003 was obtained from

Interstudy.3 The ownership data include detailed information about enrollment levels, ownership

of each plan, and MSAs served by the plan. I use this data source to construct percent HMO

enrollment that are for-profit in each MSA between 1994 and 2003.

        Other Data. I further supplement the hospital and HMO data with other information to

capture relevant market characteristics. These include the area wage index from the PPS Impact

File, population characteristics from the Area Resource File, and a variable-radius based hospital

 1999 and 2002 ownership information were not available. I use the adjacent two years to interpolate the for-profit
HMO enrollment share for those two years.

competition measure (Herfindahl index) provided by Glenn Melnick.



Variable Construction

         Hospital Service Variables. I focus on services that are commonly viewed as safety net

services as well as services that are relatively profitable. Using Zuckerman et al (2001) as the

blueprint, safety net services include emergency department, trauma center, HIV/AIDS services,

inpatient substance abuse services, and outpatient substance abuse services.4 Profitable services

include maternity care, birthing room, child wellness service, women health center, and sports

medicine (Horwitz 2005). It should be noted that while maternity care is an important safety net

service, it is considered a revenue generating service especially since a growing share of births

were being covered by Medicaid (Zuckerman et al 2001). Therefore I categorize maternity care

under profitable service.

         Because service variables are obtained from AHA surveys, which are self-reported, one

would be concerned with data reliability. However, there is no reason to believe that reporting

errors would be correlated with HMO penetration. Another limitation of AHA data is that there

are missing values over the years, especially toward the later years. When hospitals did not

report whether they offered a service in a given year, I impute the values using information from

adjacent years (for example, if a hospital is missing 1992 value but report having a given service

in 1991 and 1993, I would impute 1992 as having such a service). If there are more than two

consecutive missing values, no imputation is done and observations are excluded from the

analysis. Depending on the service, I impute 3.5-4.7% of the data.

4
 Zuckerman et al (2001) analyze several additional safety net services such as burn unit and neonatal intensive care
unit. I do not include burn unit because there are too few hospitals offering this service that I do not have enough
sample size to analyze exit behavior. I do not include neonatal intensive care unit, because such unit requires a high
sunk cost that hospitals rarely shut it down (Baker and Phibbs 2000). For the same reason I do not estimate the risk
of shut down for cardiac and diagnostic imaging technology.


                                                          9
       Defining Service Adoption and Exit Years. In order to analyze the risk of service shut

down, I also need to track when a hospital started offering that service. With the cleaned AHA

data, I construct adoption and exit variables for each of the services. I use the adoption

definition in Baker and Phibbs (2002)—I define adoption year as the first year of the first

consecutive pair of years in which the hospital says it offers a given service. Using this

definition is more conservative than defining adoption year as the first year that a hospital says it

offers a given service, but it minimizes sporadic reporting errors. Since the data series started in

1990, if a hospital reports having a given service in both 1990 and 1991, then the adoption year

would be 1990. Consequently, all hospitals that have offered a given service before 1990 would

have an adoption year of 1990. Exit years are defined using the following logic: (1) there must

be an adoption year between 1990 and 2002; (2) exit year is the year after the last year in which

the hospital offers a given service. Because I use the more conservative adoption definition, the

earliest exit occurs in 1992.

       HMO Penetration Variables. I define overall HMO penetration as total HMO

enrollment divided by the total population in an individual MSA. MSA is the common market

definition used in antitrust analysis of health insurance geographic markets (Hymen and

Kovacic, 2004). I categorize hospitals according to whether they operated in MSAs with low

(<15% of population is enrolled in HMO), medium (15-25%), and high levels of HMO

penetration (>25%). The categorical variables allow for a more intuitive interpretation of the

hazard ratio of service shut down. The categorical variables can also capture potential non-

linearity in the effects of HMO penetration rates.

       For this analysis, I categorize HMO markets based on the average HMO penetration of a

given MSA over the entire analysis period. I take this approach instead of using the actual HMO




                                                 10
penetration rates in each year for the following reasons. One concern is that HMO plans might

selectively choose to enter a particular provider market that would give them the best market

advantages, and therefore the relationship between HMO growth and hospital service offer

decisions are endogenously related. I use the average HMO penetration rate as an exogenous

proxy for the actual and expected HMO market shares during this period. The idea is that areas

that had high average HMO penetration in earlier years also tended to have high growth in

markets in later years (Baker and Phibbs, 2002). In an alternative specification, I use the peak

year’s HMO penetration (1999) instead of the average HMO penetration rates (Shen and

Melnick 2004). It turned out that those two measures are highly correlated (correlation above

0.90) and results are similar. Using this approach also avoids the rare situation in which the

same hospital might appear in medium HMO market in one year but high HMO market in

another. One can think of the HMO categories I use based on average or peak year penetration

rate as instruments for the actual growth rates in the HMO industry. Using this definition and the

cutoff described above, 23% of the hospital sample is in low HMO markets, 39% of the hospital

sample is in medium HMO market, and the remaining 38% of the hospital sample is in high

HMO markets.

        For my second research question, I add additional information about which ownership

dominates a particular HMO market. I define percent for-profit as the number of enrollees in

for-profit HMO plans divided by total HMO enrollment in an MSA. Like the HMO penetration

measure, I also use the average for-profit share of HMO between 1994 and 2003 to construct the

three levels of for-profit HMO categories. Using the average for-profit HMO share has an

additional benefit for this analysis: it allows me to utilize all years of service data instead of just

1994 to 2003. The assumption is that MSAs with high for-profit HMO presence in later part of



                                                   11
1990s also have high for-profit presence in the early 1990s. I believe this is a reasonable

assumption because such high correlation does exist in the overall HMO penetration measure.

The cutoff points for low, medium, and high for-profit HMO markets are 0-50%, 50-90%, and

>90%, respectively. About 36%, 21%, and 43% of hospitals are in low, medium, and high for-

profit HMO markets, respectively.

       Other Hospital and Market Variables. I include the following hospital measures in the

model: hospital ownership (for-profit and government vs. not-for-profit), teaching hospital,

hospital system membership, casemix of the patient population, size of the hospital (both

inpatient discharges and outpatient visits), and competitiveness (measured by Herfindahl index).

The hospital Herfindahl index is constructed using a variable-radius approach based on patient

flow (Bamezai et al 1999). I include the following area characteristics: share of hospitals within

15-mile radius that is for-profit, share of hospitals within 15-mile radius that is owned by

government, cost of living (as proxy by wage index) of the hospital’s MSA, per capita income

and population size of MSAs.



Estimating Proportional Hazard Models

       I analyze the hazard of shutting down each service separately using proportional hazard

models. My analytical plan consists of two parts. I first establish the effect of overall HMO

penetration on the risk of hospital service shut down. I then examine the effect of for-profit

HMO level on service shut down risks separately for low, medium, and high HMO markets. As

Figure 2 shows, the distribution of for-profit share of HMOs vary considerably across the three

categories of HMO markets. The separate analysis in the second part would allow me to capture




                                                 12
potential differential provider behaviors when downward financial pressures from HMO are

different. The unit of observation is the hospital.

    The Cox (1972) proportional hazard framework is the natural choice to examine rate of exit

(Cox 1972; Shen 2002). It is nonparametric therefore I do not have to assume a priori whether

service survival rate has a positive or negative dependence on time. Contrary to the study of

technology adoption where all hospitals are at risk of adopting a technology before the first year

of study period, only those who have adopted a service in prior years are at risk of dropping that

service. Specifically, all hospitals that already offered the service by 1990 will enter the model

in 1990. If a hospital did not adopt a service until 1994, then it does not enter the hazard model

until 1994. If a hospital never offered a service, then it is not included in the model.

    Another difference from studies of technology adoption is the type of proportional hazard

model used in this analysis. Previous studies have used discrete time proportional hazard models

(Cutler and McClellan 1996; Baker and Phibbs 2002). I use the Cox proportional hazard models

instead of the discrete time proportional hazard models (proposed by Prentice and Gloeckler

1978) for the exit analysis for several reasons. First, the Cox proportional hazard model allows

for more flexible specifications of the baseline hazard (both nonparametric or parametric).

Second, discrete-time proportional hazard models can be very sensitive to starting values, and a

small change in model specifications often resulted in no convergence of the maximum

likelihood function. In the results section, I will show that for the main model, the results are

virtually identical between the two approaches. Therefore I use the Cox models so we can

compare key coefficients across all sensitivity analyses. I discuss other sensitivity specifications

in the results section.




                                                  13
            In the proportional hazard framework, I define 12 intervals during which I can observe

    service exit. Suppose a hospital adopted a given service in year t0, then intervals (t0, t2] , (t2, t3],

    (t3, t4], and so on capture hospitals that offered a given service in the beginning year of that

    interval but dropped the service by the end year of the interval. Hospitals that adopted the

    service during the study period but did not drop such a service at the end of 2003 are censored at

    2003. Note that for hospitals that adopted a given service after 1990, there will be fewer than 12

    intervals. The probability that hospital i drops service j given that service j was offered up until

    time t is described by the following hazard function, "ij (t) :

            Prob(i th hospital exits service j in year t | offered service j until t)
                                                                                         (1)
            = exp(-("1jHMOi + " 2jOWNERit + " !

                     average HMO penetration between 1990-2003;

           OWNERit=hospital ownership category (not-for-profit, for-profit, government) and

                     whether ownership was ever converted between 1990-2003;

           Xit=A vector of other hospital and market characteristics;

    The associated survival function at time t is given by:

                                            Sij (t) = exp(" $ #ij (u)du)

    The coefficient of interest is β1j, as it captures the effect of HMO penetration on the hazard of
                                !
    exit for the jth service. A positive and statistically significant β1j would indicate that higher HMO

    penetration is associated with higher hazard of service exit. The coefficients can be estimated by

    applying maximum likelihood method to the Cox partial likelihood function for the above hazard



                                                         14
    function. I allow the baseline hazard rate to vary by the four Census regions. I also adjust the

    standard error to account for clustering at the MSA level. In presenting the results, I use hazard

    ratio instead of the actual coefficient for ease of interpretation: a statistically significant hazard

    ratio above one indicates higher risk of service exit in high HMO market, for example, compared

    to the low HMO market (the reference group). Conversely, a hazard ratio below one indicates a

    lower risk of exit compared to the reference group.

            One key assumption of the proportional hazard model is that the hazard ratio is constant

    over time. In other words, the hazard ratio of service exit between high and low HMO markets is

    a fixed proportion and does not vary by time. In order to capture possible differential effects

    over time, I add interaction terms between the HMO variable and period indicators for 1995-

    1999 and 2000-2003, with 1990-1994 being the base period. The three periods roughly

    correspond to the booming, the maturing, and the backlash periods of HMO market (Shen and

    Melnick 2006).

            To analyze the second question, whether a predominantly for-profit HMO market would

    exacerbate or mitigate service shut down, I modify eq (1) as follows:

            Prob(i th hospital exits service j in year t | offered service j until t)
            = exp(-("1jHMOiFP + " 2jOWNERit + " 3j X it )) #0 j (t)

    Where
!           HMOiFP = Indicators for whether hospital i is in MSAs with low, medium, or high share

            of for-profit HMO plans.
!       Note that the variable HMOi drops out because I analyze for-profit HMO effect separately for

    low, medium, and high HMO markets. The key coefficient of interest, β1, captures the effect of

    for-profit HMO penetration on the hazard of service shut down. I also add interaction terms

    between HMOFP variable and period indicators. I discuss other sensitivity analyses

                                            4. Results

Descriptive Statistics of HMO Activities and Hospital Characteristics

    Figure 1 shows the trend of overall HMO penetration from 1990 and 2003. It started out

with just under 18 percent of the MSA population enrolled in HMOs in 1990. The enrollment

reached peak in 1999 with over 28 percent of the population enrolled in HMO. There is a slight

retrenchment of HMO enrollment in the 2000s, with the average penetration in 2003 down to 25

percent of the population. The population-weighted average HMO penetration over this period is

23.5 percent. Some MSAs have an average of nearly zero penetration rate (such as Casper

Wyoming, Albany Georgia), while others have an average penetration rate of over 50 percent

(such as San Francisco, Oakland California, and Rochester New York). The average HMO

penetration rates for low, medium, and high HMO markets are 8 percent, 19 percent, and 34

percent, respectively.

    The level and growth of for-profit HMO vary by the three types of HMO markets (Figure 2).

For-profit expansion is fastest in low HMO markets: for-profit share of the market grew from

just under 60 percent to over 80 percent between 1994 and 2003. On the contrary, in the high

HMO markets, the for-profit share of the HMO market remained constant around 50 percent of

the market share through out the period. The average for-profit market share across time

between 1994 and 2003 are 76 percent, 70 percent, and 50 percent for low, medium, and high

HMO areas, respectively.

    I summarize hospital and market characteristics by the three levels of HMO penetration in

Table 1. As the number of observation shows, each HMO market category contains




                                               16
approximately 1/3 of the hospital sample. Hospitals in low HMO markets are less likely to be

not-for-profit (54 percent) than those in high HMO markets (71 percent). Hospitals in low HMO

markets tend to be smaller than those in medium and high HMO markets—they have fewer total

inpatient discharges and fewer outpatient visits. Casemix index of patient population is

comparable across the HMO markets. In addition, low HMO market is associated with less

competitive hospital markets. A Herfindahl index of 1 indicates a monopoly market while a

nearly zero Herfindahl index indicates a competitive market. The average Herfindahl indices are

0.34 and 0.26 for low and high HMO markets, respectively. In terms of market characteristics,

hospitals in high HMO markets are located in more populated MSAs and have slightly higher

living costs (wage index is 0.94 and 1.14 for low and high HMO markets, respectively).



Unadjusted Cumulative Survival Probability of Hospital Services

   Figure 3 shows the cumulative probability of survival for each of the 10 hospital services. In

the present context, the survival curve represents the cumulative probability of continuing to

offer a given service at the end of the time interval. The survival rate is 100 percent in the

beginning of the time interval (t0) since that is the year of adoption, and the earliest exit only

occurs in t2 based on my exit definition described in section 2. There are 12 time intervals

except for HIV service and child wellness center which only have 9 intervals. A higher survival

curve means fewer hospitals drop the service. An overview of Figures 3A (safety net services)

and 3B (profitable services) reveals wide variation in survival rate. In general, safety net

services have lower survival rate than profitable services, except for emergency department. The

probability of survival is relatively high for emergency department—at the end of the 12-year

interval, the cumulative survival probability is above 0.75. On the other hand, the cumulative




                                                  17
survival rate of inpatient substance abuse service is only about 0.25 at the end. Among profitable

services, fewer hospitals drop birth related services compared to child wellness center and sports

medicine. The cumulative survival rate for both maternity care and birthing room are above 0.7

by the end of the 12-year period.

   Figure 3 also separates out the survival probability of each service by low, medium, and high

HMO markets. Among safety net services, there does not appear to be different survival rates

between high and low HMO markets except for emergency department: hospitals in high HMO

markets (dotted line) have lower survival rate than those in low and medium HMO markets.

Outpatient substance abuse service is an interesting case where hospitals in medium HMO

markets consistently have high survival rate than both low and high HMO markets. Among

profitable services, the cumulative survival rates are consistently lower for hospitals in high

HMO markets except for sports medicine, where there appears to be no difference across the

HMO markets. For maternity care and birthing room, the divergence in survival rate between

low and high HMO markets does not appear until midway through the time series. The period

interaction terms in the proportional hazard model would allow me to capture such period effect.



Effect of HMO on the Hazard of Service Exit

   Figure 3 shows two general trends: the overall survival rates are generally higher for

profitable services than safety net services; but survival rate differences between low and high

HMO markets are more pronounced in profitable services. In this section I present the results

from the proportional hazard models controlling for hospital and market characteristics.

   Table 2 presents the effect of overall HMO levels on hazard ratio of service exit. The top

panel shows the results for overall HMO effect over the entire period, with no period




                                                 18
interactions. Each column represents a separate regression for each service. I provide the

complete regression results of all included variables for each service in the appendix. I use

hazard ratio to show how levels of HMO penetration are affecting the hazard of shutting down a

given service. Take the comparison between hospitals in high and low HMO markets, for

example. The hazard ratio is the ratio of the hazard rate between high and HMO markets, where

the hazard rate is the probability that if service j has not been dropped in year t, it will be dropped

in year t+1. The reference group (low HMO markets) has a hazard ratio of 1 by default. A

higher hazard ratio indicates that hospitals in high HMO markets have a higher risk of dropping

the service relative to the reference group.

   Top panel of Table 2 shows that with the assumption of a constant hazard ratio over time, I

only observe two services where the risk of shutting down is higher in high HMO markets

compared to low HMO markets. In particular, the hazard of hospitals in high HMO markets

shutting down trauma center (child wellness center) is 1.48 (1.74) times higher than the hazard of

hospitals in low HMO markets dropping such a service. On the other hand, I observe lower

hazard of service exit for birth related services in medium and high HMO markets as compared

to low HMO markets. For both birthing room and maternity care services, the hazard ratios

associated with medium and high HMOs are all below 1, and statistically significant at the 0.10

level for medium HMO markets.

   I also want to highlight the hazard ratio results of a few hospital characteristics (appendix).

For-profit hospitals consistently have higher hazard rate of shutting down safety net services than

not-for-profit hospitals (all hazard ratios are above 1). The hazard ratio of for-profit ownership

ranges from 1.05 (emergency department) to 1.47 (HIV/AIDS services) and are statistically

significant except for emergency services. On the other hand, the hazard of service exit is




                                                  19
comparable between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals for profitable services (the hazard

ratio ranges from 0.97 to 1.05). The only exception is child wellness center, where for-profit

hospitals have 1.83 times higher hazard of shutting down this service as compared to not-for-

profit hospitals. Government ownership is generally associated with lower hazard of shutting

down unprofitable services. In particular, the hazard ratio of shutting down emergency

department is 0.62 when comparing government to not-for-profit hospitals. The hazard rates of

shutting down profitable services are comparable between government and not-for-profit

hospitals. Teaching hospitals have lower hazard rate of shutting down services, regardless of

whether the service belongs to safety net or profitable category. The only exception is inpatient

substance abuse where teaching hospitals are 1.27 times more likely than non-teaching hospitals

to shut down this service. Larger hospitals are also less likely to shut down any services—the

hazard ratio of size variables (outpatient and inpatient visits) are below one for all services.

Lastly, higher hospital Herfindahl index (i.e., less competitive market) is associated with lower

hazard rate of shutting down any of the services I examined. This likely reflects the fact that

many of the hospitals in those monopolistic markets are the only hospital provider in that market.

   The top panel of Table 2 indicates little difference in hazard rates of shutting down services

between hospitals in low and high HMO markets. In the bottom panel, I estimate the same

equation but allowing for differential HMO effects by periods (1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-

2003). In 1990-1994, the hazard ratios of medium and high HMO markets across services are all

below one relative to the low HMO markets, indicating that hospitals in low HMO markets have

the highest exit rates during this period. In 1995-1999, hospitals in medium HMO markets still

have much lower risk of shutting down services regardless of their profitability than hospitals in

low HMO markets. However, the hazard ratios between high and low HMO markets are closer to




                                                  20
one in this period than in the previous period, except for birthing room and sports medicine

where the hazard ratios remain to be statistically significantly below one. By 2000-2003, the

hazard rates of shutting down safety net services are quite comparable between high and low

HMO markets, except for trauma center: hospitals in high (medium) HMO markets are 2.5 (1.62)

times more likely to shut down trauma centers than those in low HMO markets. In the same

period, hospitals in medium HMO markets all have higher risk of shutting down safety net

services than those in low HMO markets. Among profitable services, all hazard ratios are above

one for medium and high HMO markets in 2000-2003, except for maternity care. In particular,

the risks of hospitals in high HMO markets shutting down birthing room, women’s health center

and child wellness center are 1.57, 1.54 and 2.21 times higher, respectively, than those in low

HMO markets.

   To help visualize the HMO effects in Table 2, I graph the predicted survival probability of all

hospital services in Figure 4. Specifically, the survival curves in Figure 4 represent the predicted

survival probability of each service holding all characteristics (except for HMO) at their average

value. Therefore the gap between the survival curves in low and high HMO markets can be

solely attributed to the differences in HMO penetration. The kinks at t5 and t10 reflect the

interaction period effects. For clarity, I omit the survival curves of medium HMO markets.

Figure 4A shows that trauma center has much lower survival rates in high HMO markets than in

low HMO markets. Figure 4B shows that except for maternity care, all other profitable services

experience a lower survival rate in high HMO markets especially in 2000s.



Effect of For-Profit Share of HMO on the Hazard of Service Exit

   My next set of analyses investigates the effect of for-profit HMO on the hazard of service




                                                 21
shut down. As described in section 3, I analyze low, medium, and high HMO markets

separately. Table 3 shows the effect of for-profit HMO on service exit rate assuming no change

in hazard ratios over time. For sake of brevity, I omit medium HMO markets results in this table

but can provide the numbers upon request. The top panel shows that for low HMO markets,

there is no statistically significant difference in service exit hazard between hospitals in low and

high for-profit HMO markets, regardless service profitability. The bottom panel presents the

hazard ratio for high HMO markets. Among safety net services, only inpatient substance abuse

service receives a statistically significant hazard ratio: hospitals in markets with high share of

for-profit HMO plans are 1.85 times more likely to shut down inpatient substance abuse service

than those in markets with low share of for-profit plans. Note that the magnitude of hazard ratio

of outpatient substance abuse service is also relatively high (1.65) but the smaller sample size

prevents me from obtaining a more precise standard error estimate. Among profitable services,

high FP HMO market is associated with higher risk of shutting down birthing room and sports

medicine (hazard ratios are 1.8 and 2.06, respectively).

   Table 4 shows the hazard ratio of for-profit HMO effect by three periods. Again I only focus

on low and high HMO markets. In low HMO markets, the hazard rates of service exit in markets

with medium and high for-profit HMO in general tend to be lower than those in markets with

low for-profit share of HMO during 1990-1994. The hazard of shutting down substance abuse

and HIV/AIDS services increases over time. By 2000-2003, the hazard of shutting down

inpatient substance abuse and HIV/AIDS services are 2 times higher in markets with high for-

profit HMO share compared to those in markets with low for-profit HMO market share. Among

profitable services, hazard ratio also increases by 2000-2003, but none of the results are

statistically significant. The magnitude of the hazard ratio for birthing room and sports medicine




                                                  22
is not small (1.86 and 1.40 for high for-profit HMO markets, respectively), but the smaller

sample size prevents me from obtaining more precise estimates.

   In high HMO markets, I observe more pronounced period differential of the for-profit HMO

effect on service shut down. Among safety net services, hospitals in high for-profit HMO

markets in general have higher hazard of shutting down services than those in low for-profit

HMO markets, especially toward the later period. For example, the risks of shutting down

substance abuse service (both inpatient and outpatient) between hospitals in high and low for-

profit HMO markets are comparable in 1990-1994. By 2000-2003, hospitals in high for-profit

HMO markets are more than 2 times likely to shut down these services than those in low for-

profit HMO markets. Likewise for trauma center where the corresponding hazard ratio increases

from 0.56 in 1990-1994 to 3.42 in 200-2003. Among profitable care, the hazard ratio of shutting

down services are all below one for high for-profit HMO markets for 1990-1994. For maternity

care and child wellness center, the hazard ratios remain close to one by 2000-2003, but for the

other profitable services, the hazard ratios increase substantially. The hazard of shutting down

birthing room, women’s health center, and sports medicine are 3.05, 2.09, and 4.06, respectively,

times higher in markets with high for-profit share of HMO than in markets with low for-profit

share of HMO.

   Figure 5 presents the predicted survival rate of safety net services. Similar to Figure 4, these

are predicted cumulative survival probability assuming all other characteristics take on the

average value. Figure 5A and 5B show the predicted survival curves for low HMO markets and

high HMO markets, respectively. In both markets, substance abuse care services have much

lower survival rates in markets with high for-profit share of HMO, but the survival gap is bigger

in high HMO markets. Trauma center in markets with high for-profit share of HMO also suffers




                                                23
a lower survival rate in the later period. Figure 6 shows the same information for profitable

services. Figure 6A shows that in low HMO areas, there is little difference between high and

low for-profit HMO markets. Figure 6B shows that in high HMO areas, except for maternity

care, all other profitable services have much lower survival rate in markets with high for-profit

share of HMO than markets with low for-profit share.



Sensitivity Analyses

   As an alternative proxy for actual HMO growth, I also experiment with using peak year

HMO penetration instead of the average HMO penetration over this period to classify hospitals

into different HMO and for-profit HMO markets. The magnitude of the hazard ratios is very

similar whether I use peak year or average HMO penetration rates (results available upon

request). This result is not surprising given that the correlation between these two measures is

over 0.90.

   I am also concerned with whether the decision to offer and shut down a service depends on

the availability of such a service in the hospital market in prior years. The hospital competition

measure is not service-specific, and a hospital would be less likely to shut down a service if

historically it is the only provider of that service in that particular market. In another sensitivity

analysis, I include number of hospitals offering a given service within 15-mile radius in the

baseline (i.e., 1990 for all services except for HIV/AIDS service and child wellness center whose

baseline is 1994). It turned out that the hazard ratio of the baseline service variable is very close

to one across all services, and therefore the effects of HMO and for-profit HMO stay the same

(results available upon request).

   I use Cox proportional hazard model instead of Prentice-Gloeckler proportional hazard




                                                  24
model to allow for more flexible specification of the baseline hazard and sensitivity analyses. In

Table 5, I compare the results between the two approaches. As the comparison shows, the

coefficients and their significance are extremely similar.

    The hazard of service shut down might be different between hospitals that were in continuous

operation and those that were short-lived. I conduct a sensitivity analysis where I restrict the

sample to only hospitals that are in operation continuously between 1991 and 2003.5 I lose about

a quarter of the hospitals when restricting the sample this way. However, I only lose 10-20% of

the observations (depending on the service) because not all excluded hospitals offer a given

service. I found the hazard ratios are magnified in some cases and similar in others, but the

qualitative results remain the same (Table 6). For example, when using the whole sample, the

hazard ratios for maternity care in 1990-1994 period are 0.52 and 0.59 for medium and high

HMO markets. In the restricted sample, the corresponding hazard ratios are 0.24 and 0.38. The

hazard ratios for women’s health center are 1.59 and 1.52 in 2000-2003 for medium and high

HMO markets in the whole sample, and the corresponding hazard ratios are 1.78 and 1.62 in the

restricted sample.

    In the next set of analyses, I investigate whether the results are driven by differences between

early and late adopters of the services. If the timing of adoption varies systematically across the

three levels of HMO penetration, it would also likely affect the duration of the service. In this

case, the results of the HMO effects on service shut down would be confounded with the timing

of service adoption. While prior studies showed that higher HMO penetration is associated with

slower rate of technology adoption (Cutler and Sheiner 1997), it is not clear whether the same

would apply to safety net or public health services. In this sensitivity analysis, I include an


5
 In my main model, if a hospital closed or dropped out of the AHA survey, it would be censored in the proportional
hazard model.


                                                        25
  “early adopter” indicator that takes on the value of one if hospitals have already adopted a given

  service by the first year of observation. As Table 7 shows, the hazard ratios on medium and high

  HMO markets remain very similar to the original specification and all the conclusions remain the

  same. Not surprisingly, early adopter has a lower hazard rate of shutting down any given

  service—this is analogous to the regression toward the mean phenomenon.

     Another potential source of bias in the coefficient estimates might come from unobserved

  heterogeneity across MSA markets. If HMO plans selectively enter markets that have high

  propensity to shut down unprofitable services for reasons not captured in the model, my results

  would overstate the effect of high HMO on service shut down. One way to test this hypothesis is

  by modeling the unobserved heterogeneity as a multiplicative additional source of error in the

  shut down equation (Baker and Phibbs 2001; Cleves et al 2004). In other words, the hazard

  function in eq (1) above is modified as follows for hospital i offering service j in market m:

          "ijm (t) = exp(x ij # j ) "0 j (t)$ m

  where αm varies by MSA. One can think of this approach as a random-effects Cox proportional
! hazard model. For computational convenience, α is assumed to be gamma distributed with
                                                m


  mean of one and variance of θ. The estimate of θ allows me to test the existence of unobserved

  heterogeneity: if θ is zero, the random-effect Cox model reverts to the standard Cox model. I

  show the value of θ and the log-likelihood test for unobserved heterogeneity at the bottom of

  Table 2. In most cases, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no unobserved

  heterogeneity across markets. In two services where there is evidence of unobserved

  heterogeneity (maternity care and birthing room), the coefficients on our key variables are very

  similar to Table 2 and all our conclusions remain the same (coefficient results available upon

  request).



                                                   26
    Lastly, I consider the implication of using only HMO penetration measure when there are

other types of managed care that also compete for provider business. In this set of analyses, I use

a noisy overall managed care penetration to classify MSAs instead of using the more reliable

HMO penetration. This managed care penetration measure includes enrollment from HMO and

PPO (preferred provider organization), the second dominant form of health plans. As discussed

in Section 3, there is little reliable data on PPO penetration. I have 1992, 1995, and 2003 PPO

penetration from two different sources (see Shen and Melnick 2004 for more details). I construct

the average overall managed care penetration over this period in the following steps. First, I

obtain the average PPO penetration across the three available years for each MSA. Second, I add

this average PPO penetration to the average HMO penetration I used earlier to obtain the average

overall managed care penetration.6 The mean average managed care penetration rate is 54

percent. I divide hospitals into low, medium, and high managed care markets where the cutoff

points of managed care penetration rates are 0-40%, 40-60%, and >60%. Percent of hospitals

that fall into each managed care category is 25 percent, 48 percent, and 28 percent.

    Table 8 shows that for safety net services, the results are remarkably similar to the main

model: hospitals in low managed care markets started out having the highest hazard of shutting

down safety net services in 1990-1994, but the hazard rates increased over time in medium and

high managed care markets. Like the main analysis, by 2000-2003, trauma center stood out as

having the highest hazard ratio (close to 2) in medium and high managed care markets compared

to low managed care markets. Among profitable services, results are also similar except for

child wellness center: the hazard ratio in 2000-2003 is much lower for the comparison between

high and low managed care markets. The similar results between using HMO and using overall

6
 I consider this managed care measure noisier than the HMO measure because I only have 3 years of PPO data to
summarize the PPO market and the data are less reliable than HMO data (personal communication with Interstudy
representative).


                                                      27
managed care penetration to classify markets are not too surprising, since markets with higher

HMO activities also tend to have higher penetration of PPO. Among hospitals that were

classified in low HMO markets, only 4 hospitals got classified into high managed care markets

when we add PPO and HMO information together; among hospitals that were classified as in

high HMO markets, only 3 were classified into low managed care markets.



                                            5. Discussions

   This paper begins with the research question, does higher HMO penetration lead to higher

risks of shutting down specialized services in hospitals? I started out with two competing

hypotheses. If economies of scale is the key to reduce hospital cost, then we might see safety

services being shut down to make room for more profitable services when facing financial

pressure from HMO plans. If economies of scope is the key to attract demand from health plans,

then we might see hospitals adding new services to complement its existing ones and observe no

difference in exit rates across HMO markets. The empirical results, however, do not fit neatly

into either hypothesis, as I find the risk of shut down shifts over time. Specifically, hospitals in

medium and high HMO markets started out having lower hazard of shutting down services in

1990-1994 (especially in the area of profitable services) than those in low HMO markets, but

their hazard rates increased over time. By 2000-2003, hospitals in medium and high HMO

markets ended up with higher risk of shutting down profitable services than those in low HMO

markets and comparable hazard rates of shutting down safety net services except for trauma

center.

   One possible explanation is that economy of scope was at work during the early 1990s, when

hospitals in higher HMO markets would try to attract the booming HMO industry by keeping a



                                                 28
diverse set of services, while hospitals in low HMO markets have less incentive to do so.

Resource allocation is another possible explanation. During the early 1990s, hospitals in low

HMO markets had higher propensity to adopt expensive cardiac and imaging technology, and

might have to shut down safety net and public health services to make resources available to

adopt those technologies. As HMO expanded in the second half of 1990s and the financial

pressure from HMO grew stronger, hospitals in high HMO markets responded to such financial

pressure by shutting down selective services, as well as being slow adopters of expensive

technology. This explanation is consistent with what’s being observed in the health care

technology adoption literature. Prior studies generally found that higher HMO penetration is

associated with slower technology adoption rates in the 1990s due to the increasing financial

pressure from HMO. It is worth noting that when comparing high and low HMO markets, I

observe higher probability of shut down among profitable services than among safety net

services in the 2000-2003 period. Perhaps community pressure keeps safety net services from

being shut down in high HMO markets.

   The managed care backlash in the 2000s is supposed to alleviate the financial pressure from

HMOs on providers (Shen and Melnick 2006). However, I find the survival gap between low

and high HMO markets to be larger in this period than in the 1990s. This is likely due to the fact

that the magnitude of retrenchment is not uniform across the three types of markets. The average

HMO growth rate between 1999-2003 is -20% for low HMO markets but only -8% and -11% for

medium and high HMO markets. The increasing gap in financial pressure from HMO between

the high and low markets might contribute to the increasing hazard of service shut down in high

HMO markets after 2000.

   My second research question explores whether the risks of shutting down services vary by



                                                29
whether hospitals operate in HMO markets that are predominantly for-profit. I do not find the

hazard of shutting down services to differ by levels of for-profit HMO share in low HMO

markets except for HIV/AIDS and inpatient substance abuse services. I find higher for-profit

share of HMO to be associated with higher hazard of service exit for half of the services

examined in high HMO markets, and the hazard ratios are the highest in 2000-2003. This is

consistent with the microeconomics framework which suggests that a predominantly for-profit

HMO markets is likely to exert greater financial pressure than a HMO market that is

predominantly not-for-profit. A prior study found that hospitals in high for-profit HMO markets

have slower cost growth than those in low for-profit HMO markets, and the difference is

especially evident in high HMO markets (Shen and Melnick 2004). Taking together, this would

suggest that some of the cost growth reduction might be achieved by shutting down services, and

that hospitals in predominantly for-profit HMO markets experience greater HMO financial

pressure than those in predominantly not-for-profit HMO markets. Like results to the first

research question, the higher hazard ratios of exit in for-profit HMO markets do not occur only

in safety net services, but also in profitable services.

    Although not the focus of this paper, I want to highlight the role of hospital ownership in

affecting service shut down. I find that the hazard rate of shutting down profitable services is

comparable among not-for-profit, for-profit, and government hospitals, while the hazard of

shutting down safety net services is the highest in for-profit hospitals and lowest in government

hospitals. This finding is consistent with the common theoretical framework that frequently

posits that not-for-profit firms have an objective function different from that of profit

maximization and that government hospitals often serve as last resort hospitals (Sloan 2000).

An important area I did not explore is the potential spillover effect of hospital for-profit



                                                   30
ownership. As Kessler and McClellan (2002) pointed out, spillover effects might be much more

important than the direct ownership effect, since for-profit hospitals account for less than 20

percent of the market share. Exploring this spillover effect on service shut down should be an

interesting and important future work.

   These results are robust under different sensitivity analyses, and the overall conclusion

remains the same when I use a noisier overall managed care penetration measure in place of the

more accurately measured HMO penetration rates. However, readers should keep in mind

several limitations in the empirical methods. First, the service measures are self-reported by

hospitals and the attrition rate of AHA survey has deteriorated over the years. While such a

noisy dependent variable is a cause of concern, as long as the reporting errors and attrition rates

do not vary systematically across the HMO markets, my estimates should not be biased. Second,

although HMOs continue to be the biggest type of managed care plans, its dominance has

diminished over the years as more PPO and plans of other arrangements entered the market.

Even though results remain robust when I use a noisy managed care measure that includes HMO

and PPO, that measure still does not capture all types of managed care plans. Third, to the extent

that service adoption and shut-down decisions are endogenously related to HMO growth, I

mitigate this concern by using average HMO penetration over the period to classify MSAs

instead of using the actual HMO penetration for each year. In addition, the coefficients on the

key variables are very stable even when I assume there exists unobserved heterogeneity across

markets. However, some omitted variable bias might still remain under this approach.

   With these caveats in mind, these results suggest that most safety net services are not in

worse danger of being shut down in high HMO markets. This is certainly comforting news for

low-income population, as they are the major users of these services. But we should not ignore



                                                 31
the fact that although the hazard of shutting down safety services are not different across the

HMO markets in the current environment, the overall survival rate of these services, with

emergency department being the exception, are substantially lower than that of more profitable

services. The high exit rates of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS services are problematic given

the nature of the treatment: disrupting substance abuse care, for example, could have much worse

consequence on the affected patient population than shutting down sports medicine. For services

where I observe a substantially higher rate of exit among hospitals in high HMO markets in the

current environment (such as trauma center, women’s health center, and child wellness center),

future work should consider the patient welfare consequences and policy implications of exodus

of these services.

   The results also highlight the role of ownership in service provision. Through a combination

of conversions by not-for-profit health plans to for-profit status, acquisitions of not-for-profit’s

by for-profit companies and internal growth, the share of total HMO enrollment in for-profit

health plans is now over 60% in many parts of the US. Results from this paper suggest that

hospitals in those markets have higher risk of shutting down safety net and public health

services. Moreover, for-profit hospitals have higher propensity to shut down unprofitable

services. The potential disruption of care is an important aspect state regulators should take into

consideration when evaluating ownership conversions in health care markets.
