The Effect of Immigration on Native Self-Employment
Robert W. Fairlie and Bruce D. Meyer
NBER Working Paper No. 7561
February 2000
JEL No. J23, J61

                                          ABSTRACT

       A rapidly growing literature examines the impact of immigrants on the labor market
outcomes of native-born Americans. However, the impact of immigration on natives in self-
employment has not been examined, despite the over-representation of immigrants in that sector.
We first present a new general equilibrium model of self-employment and wage/salary work. For
a range of plausible parameter values, the model predicts small negative effects of immigration on
native self-employment rates and earnings. Using 1980 and 1990 Census microdata, we then
examine the relationship between changes in immigration and native self-employment rates and
earnings across 132 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. We find evidence
supporting the hypothesis that self-employed immigrants displace self-employed natives. The effects
are much larger than those predicted by simulations of the theoretical model. Immigrants, however,
do not have a negative effect on native self-employment earnings. Our findings are similar if we
weight immigration rates by the propensity of immigrant groups to be self-employed or if we try
alternative estimation techniques and specifications.

Notes: From 132 metropolitan area sample of those aged 16-64. The self-employment rate is the
fraction of the employed that is self-employed. The self-employment ratio is the fraction of the
noninstitutional, not in school population that is self-employed. Census sample weights are used
in 1990.

Notes: From 132 metropolitan area sample of native-born nonblacks aged 16-64. All specifications use GLS
and are for the self-employment rate. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. The scaled derivative
approximates the change in the number of self-employed natives when the number of self-employed
immigrants increases by one. The weighted immigrant share weights immigrant groups by their self-
employment rate. All specifications include 1980 to 1990 changes in log average income of natives, native
unemployment rate, and log native population.

Notes: All specifications use GLS and the self-employment rate definition. From 132 metropolitan area
sample of native-born nonblacks aged 16-64. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. The scaled
derivative approximates the change in native log self-employment earnings when the immigrant share
increases by the change from 1980 to 1990 for our sample of 132 MAs (=0.0364). The weighted immigrant
share weights immigrant groups by their self-employment rate. All specifications include 1980 to 1990
changes in native unemployment rate and log native population.
