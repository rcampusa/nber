                                          ABSTRACT

We study how cross-country macroeconomic spillovers caused by sovereign default affect
equilibrium bailouts. Because of portfolio diversification, the default of one country causes a
macroeconomic contraction also in other countries. This generates a self-interest for these other
countries to bailout the defaulting country. A novel insight of the paper is that bailouts could be
efficient not only ex-post (after the debt has been issued) but also ex-ante (before the issuance of
the debt). Although anticipated bailouts create the typical moral hazard problem leading countries
to issue more debt, this may correct for the under issuance of public debt that would result from
the lack of cross-country policy coordination.

1     Introduction
During the last 30 years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the international
integration of financial markets. This allowed governments to ‘export’ their public
debt, that is, to borrow from foreign countries. Figure 1 plots the share of public
debt for the US and the largest EU countries from 1997 to 2010 and shows that the
share has increased substantially during this period.

    During the same period, countries have also ‘imported’ foreign public debt as
domestic residents increased their holdings of securities issued in other countries.
Figure 2 plots the ownership of foreign debt instruments, including government debt,
for several countries since 1980. As can be seen from the figure, the ownership of
foreign debt has increased significantly, especially since the mid 1990s.
    The two figures illustrate an important trend in global financial markets: the
cross-country diversification of financial portfolios. This is a general trend that is not
limited to debt instruments but it extends to portfolio investments and FDI. In this
paper, however, we focus on debt instruments and, especially, sovereign debt, because
of their role in providing liquidity.
    Although international diversification may improve investment efficiency and al-
lows for greater risk-sharing, it also increases macroeconomic interdependence across
countries. This implies that the macroeconomic impact of a crisis in one country,
including crises associated with sovereign default, spills to other countries. In this
paper we show that the macroeconomic spillover of sovereign default is central for un-
derstanding why non-defaulting countries are willing to bailout defaulting countries.

We further show that, although the anticipation of bailouts leads countries to issue
more debt (the typical moral hazard problem), still this could be welfare improving.
In other words, bailouts could be efficient not only ex-post—that is, after the debt
has been issued—but also ex-ante.
    We show this result in a two-country model in which public debt can be held to
insure production risks and higher supply of public debt improves production effi-
ciency. However, in a world in which financial markets are internationally integrated,
part of the debt issued by one country is acquired and held by foreign residents. This
implies that the benefits of issuing debt are shared with other countries. Since the
benefits are shared, there is less incentive for each individual country to issue debt. In
equilibrium, then, the supply of public debt is inefficiently low. This is a consequence
of the lack of policy coordination across countries. Anticipated bailouts counterbal-
ance this inefficiency: since the ‘expected’ repayment cost is lower when a country
anticipates a future bailout, each country issues more debt, partially correcting for
the inefficiency caused by the lack of cross-country policy coordination.
    The macroeconomic spillovers of sovereign default is crucial for this result: in
absence of spillovers, there is no incentive to bailout defaulting countries and, of
course, there is no anticipation of bailouts.
    The focus on macroeconomic spillovers differentiates our paper from the large
body of literature on sovereign default. Most of the contributions in this literature
are based on the ‘small open economy’ paradigm. In a small open economy, sovereign
default does not generate any ‘macroeconomic’ cost for the lending countries. The

only cost for the lending countries is the capital loss associated with lower repayment.
But as the European debt crisis has shown, the possibility that the default of some
countries could have sparked a financial and macroeconomic crisis in other countries
was a serious concern. This concern was motivated by the international portfolio
composition of lending countries, banks in particular: since banks in core countries
hold the debt of periphery countries, default could endanger the financial and macroe-
conomic stability also of the core countries. Although we do not model the banking
sector explicitly, our theoretical framework formalizes this idea and studies how the
macroeconomic spillovers shape the incentives to bailout defaulting countries.
    In addition to highlighting the centrality of cross-country spillovers for bailouts, we
also show that portfolio diversification plays a central role in the decision to default.
If a larger share of sovereign debt is held by foreigners, the incentive to default
for the debtor country increases since it redistributes wealth from foreign residents
to domestic residents. In our paper, however, we highlight a different mechanism
through which financial diversification affects the incentive to default. We show that
international diversification increases the incentive of a country to default because
the ‘domestic macroeconomic cost’ is smaller.
    Why is the macroeconomic cost of default smaller when the country is financially
diversified? The central mechanism is the disruption of financial markets induced by
default. When a government defaults on its debt, the holders of government debt
incur capital losses. To the extent that financial wealth held by private agents is im-
portant for economic decisions, this has a negative effect on economic activity. When
financial markets are integrated (and portfolios diversified), domestic residents hold
a smaller share of wealth in domestic assets and a larger share in foreign assets. This
implies that when the domestic government defaults, the wealth losses of domestic
residents are smaller, causing a smaller macroeconomic contraction. Then, being the
macroeconomic cost smaller, the government’s incentive to default is higher. Using
cross-country data where the propensity to default is captured by interest rate spreads
on sovereign debt, we find that the portfolio diversification of a country is correlated
with these spreads.
    The mechanism described above points out that it is not only the quantity of
domestic debt held by foreigners that matters for the choice of a country to default
but also the debt issued by foreign countries and held by domestic agents. Of course,
the quantity of foreign debt held by domestic agents depends on the external supply
of foreign debt. This introduces a channel through which the supply of foreign debt
affects the incentive of a country to default: as foreign countries supply more debt,
agents in the domestic country will buy more of the foreign debt and become more
diversified. Higher diversification then implies that the macroeconomic cost of default
in the domestic country is lower, which in turn increases the government incentive to
default even if the quantity of domestic debt held by foreigners remains unchanged.
This shows that the default of one country could be triggered by the debt issued by
other countries (higher international liquidity).
    The role played by external factors for the choice of a country to default is another

dimension in which our paper differs from most of the literature on sovereign default.
The majority of studies focus on the internal factors that lead a country to default.
For example, a sequence of negative productivity or fiscal shocks leads the country
to borrow more and, if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate, it becomes
optimal or necessary for the country to default. In our study we show that some of the
factors that cause a country to default may not originate domestically. In particular,
the debt issued by other countries (higher international liquidity) may also be an
important factor.


2       Literature review
This paper builds on a large literature on public debt with incomplete markets. The
main role of government debt in our paper is to partially complete the assets market
when agents are subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic risk. The mechanism is similar
to that studied in Aiyagari and McGrattan (1998), Azzimonti, de Francisco, and
Quadrini (2014), Azzimonti and Yared (2018), Bhandari, Evans, Golosov and Sargent
(2017), and Floden (2001), although there is no sovereign default in these studies.1
    Because of the possibility of default, our paper is also related to a growing lit-
erature on external sovereign default that builds on Eaton and Gersovitz (1981).
Examples include Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), Aguiar and Amador (2016), Arel-
lano (2008), Cuadra, Sanchez, and Sapriza (2010), Pouzo and Presno (2014) and
Yue (2010)). Aguiar and Amador (2014) and Tomz and Wright (2013) provide ear-
lier reviews of this literature, whereas the handbook chapters by Aguiar et al (2016)
and D’Erasmo, Mendoza, and Zhang (2016) provide a more recent discussion of the
literature on sovereign default and sustainable public debt.
    Our paper also relates to the political economy literature that emphasizes the
redistributive effects of sovereign default. Alesina and Tabellini (1990), Aghion and
Bolton (1990), Drazen (1998), D’Erasmo and Mendoza (2016, 2017), Dovis, Golosov,
and Shourideh (2016) emphasize the importance of domestic heterogeneity and focus
on the redistributive consequences of default. Amador (2003), Aguiar, Amador, Farhi,
and Gopinath (2013), Hatchondo, Martinez, and Sapriza (2009), and Mendoza and
Yue (2012), instead, focus on the international redistribution of sovereign default.
    Our paper is also related to the literature that endogenizes the cost of default
by assuming that public debt provides liquidity (see Guembel and Sussman (2009),
    1
     Our paper differs from Azzimonti, de Francisco, and Quadrini (2014) in two additional di-
mensions. First, the stock of public debt affects the labor market and hence the aggregate level
of production. In Azzimonti, de Francisco, and Quadrini (2014), instead, aggregate production is
fixed, which implies that public debt does not have any macroeconomic effects neither domestically
or abroad. As already discussed, the macroeconomic consequences of sovereign default and the re-
sulting international spillovers are central to the analysis of the paper presented here. Second, we
also allow for aggregate uncertainty, whereas Azzimonti, de Francisco, and Quadrini (2014) consid-
ers only idiosyncratic uncertainty. As we will see, aggregate shocks play an important role in the
decision to default.


                                                 4
Broner, Martin, and Ventura (2010), Broner and Ventura (2011), Gennaioli, Martin,
and Rossi (2013), Brutti (2011), and Di Casola and Sichlimiris (2014)). Some recent
papers study the interaction between sovereign debt and domestic financial institu-
tions (e.g. Boccola (2016), Farhi and Tirole (2017), Perez (2015), and Sosa-Padilla
(2018)). As in our paper, the cost of default is endogenous as it disrupts production
and causes a recession. The analysis of these studies, however, is based on small
open economies and, therefore, there are not international macroeconomic spillovers.
Our study, instead, highlights the importance of macroeconomic spillovers associated
with sovereign default using a model with ‘large’ economies. International macroeco-
nomic spillovers, which are negligible in small open economy models, are central for
understanding the optimality of bailouts.
    Arellano and Bai (2013) also consider an environment in which sovereign de-
fault affects other countries. The mechanism is based on the interest rate channel.2
Our channel of transmission, instead, relies on the macroeconomic consequences of
sovereign default (where recessions are exported to other countries through the de-
struction of foreign portfolios holdings). Our study is also related to contributions
that analyze debt restructuring through bargaining, such as Yue (2010) and Bai and
Zhang (2009).3
    There is also a connection to the literature that studies the effects of central
government bailouts on sub-national units (see Chari and Kehoe (2007), Cooper et
al. (2008), and Dovis and Kirpalani (2017)). A novel insight from our paper is
that bailouts could improve welfare not only ex-post but also ex-ante, since they
counterbalance the inefficiencies induced by the lack of cross-country coordination
of policies. Our work is also related to the literature studying efficiency of bailouts.
Differently from Farhi and Tirole (2012) who find that bailouts generate excessive
financial fragility and are hence welfare reducing, we find that bailouts can improve
welfare from an ex-ante perspective. Bianchi (2016) also finds that bailouts may be
efficient ex-ante, but the bailout studied in this paper is from the domestic government
to the domestic private sector. Instead, we study cross-country bailouts. Dovis
(2018), Fink and Scholl (2016), and Roch and Uhlig (2018) analyze the optimality
of sovereign bailouts provided by international financial institutions (modeled as risk
neutral investors), while we discuss renegotiation among two large economies, both
of which may have incentives to default.


3         The model
We start presenting our theory with a very stylized model that allows us to provide
the key results analytically. The model will then be extended in Section 6.
   The economy has two large countries: the ‘home’ country denoted with superscript
H and the ‘foreign’ country denoted with superscript F . The main difference between
    2

the two countries is in the degree of commitment to repay debt obligations. We assume
that the foreign country always repays in the second period (safe) whereas the home
country may choose to default on part or all of its debt (risky). This assumption will
be relaxed in Section 7 where both countries could default.
    In each country there are two types of agents: a measure 1 of workers and a
measure 1 of entrepreneurs. Workers in country i ∈ {H, F } value consumption and
leisure with the quasilinear utility

                     ln(ci1 ) + βϕ(ci2 , `i2 ),               ϕ(c, `) = c − `ν

where ci1 and ci2 denote consumption in period 1 and 2, respectively, `i2 is the supply
of labor in period 2, and ν > 1. Production takes place only in the second period
and, therefore, wages are paid only in period 2.
    Workers are excluded from financial markets (hand-to-mouth). Their consump-
tions in the two periods are

                                    ci1 = e + T1i ,
                                    ci2 = e + w2i `i2 + T2i ,

where e is an endowment received in both periods, T1i and T2i are the government
transfers received in period 1 and 2 respectively, and w2i is the wage rate earned in
period 2.
   Notice that endowments are the same in the two countries, which explains why
they are not indexed by the country superscript i. The stark assumption that workers
cannot borrow simplifies the exposition but it is not essential. Our results would hold
in an environment in which workers have access to credit but they are subject to
a borrowing limit. Workers maximize their lifetime utility subject to the budget
constraints. The solution provides the supply of labor `i2 .
   The lifetime utility of entrepreneurs takes the form

                                            di1 + βdi2 .

where di1 and di2 denote their consumption in periods 1 and 2, respectively. En-
trepreneurs receive an endowment a in period 1 (common in both countries) and
produce in the second period with labor using the linear technology

                                            y2i = z2i l2i ,

where l2i is the input of labor, z2i ∈ {zL , zH } is an aggregate productivity shock which
is country specific, with zL < zH . An important assumption is that the draw of
aggregate productivity z2i takes place at the beginning of period 2 before entrepreneurs
choose the input of labor.
    A special feature of this model is that the cost of labor depends not only on the
wage bill but also on the financial wealth of entrepreneurs. To use a compact notation

                                                  6
we denote the labor cost with the function $(w, l, m), where w is the wage rate, l is
the input of labor, and m is the financial wealth of the entrepreneur. The function
$(.) is strictly increasing in w and l—capturing the direct cost of labor—and strictly
decreasing in the entrepreneur’s wealth m. The extension in Section 6 provides a
micro-foundation for this function which derives from the risk of hiring more labor.
As we will see, the idea is as follows: Since entrepreneurs face higher risk when their
wealth is low, in order to produce they require a higher premium over the marginal
product of labor. For the moment, however, we capture this idea in reduced form by
assuming that m has a negative impact on the cost of labor.
   Given the value of their financial assets mi2 , entrepreneurs choose l2i in order to
maximize second period profits,

                                    π2i = z2i l2i − $(w2i , l2i , mi2 ).

    There is no market for contingent claims and the only assets that entrepreneurs
can trade are one-period government bonds. Under a financially integrated economy,
entrepreneurs can buy bonds from home and foreign countries. We denote by bji   1 the
bonds issued in period 1 by country j and purchased by an entrepreneur residing
in country i ∈ {H, F } (i.e. the first superscript indicates the nationality of the
government that issued the debt and the second superscript indicates the nationality
of the holder of the debt). The equilibrium price for the bond is 1/R1j .
    The budget constraints for entrepreneurs in the first and second periods are,
                                                   bF1 i   bHi

                                     di1 = a −           −     ,

                                     di2    = π2i + mi2 ,

where a is the endowment received only in period 1. We can think of a as the wealth
of entrepreneurs accumulated up to period 1. Wealth held in period 2 is

                                           mi2 ≡ δ2 bHi   Fi
                                                     1 + b1 .                                   (1)

    Here, δ2 ≤ 1 denotes the proportion of the debt issued by the home country that
is repaid in period 2. We allow for partial default which is a common feature of the
data.4 The post-default value of home issued bonds is then δ2 bHi 1 . Because the foreign
country always repays its debt obligations, the value of foreign issued bonds is bF1 i .
    The cross-country asymmetry in debt repayment implies that in equilibrium R1H 6=
R1F . Denoting with capital letters aggregate variables, the total debt issued by country
j ∈ {H, F } is B1j = B1jH + B1jF .
    The revenues raised by governments in period 1 are distributed to workers with
lump-sum transfers, that is,
                                         j    B1j
                                        T1 = j .                                      (2)

      See also Arellano, Mateos-Planas and Rios-Rull (2013) for a model with partial default.


                                                     7
    Effectively, governments borrow on behalf of workers. Notice that, since B1j is not
restricted to be positive, governments could choose to lend instead of borrowing. In
period 2 the debt will be repaid (partially or in full) and to do so governments raise
taxes from workers (or make transfers if B1j < 0). Thus,

                          T2H = −δ2 B1H ,             T2F = −B1F .                   (3)

    Although country F always repays the debt in full, country H could repay only a
fraction δ2 . The actual repayment is δ2 B1H .


4     Equilibrium in Period 2
To characterize the equilibrium, we proceed backward. We first characterize the
equilibrium in period 2 and then we move back to period 1. The equilibrium in
period 2 takes as given the debt issued by the two countries in period 1, B1j , and the
portfolio composition of entrepreneurs, B1ji , with i, j ∈ {H, F }. Since in this section
we focus on period 2, we abstract from time subscripts. Following is the detailed
description of the sequence of events within period 2:

    1. Aggregate productivity shocks z i are realized.

    2. The H (home) country chooses repayment δ.

    3. Entrepreneurs choose the input of labor li , workers choose the supply of labor
       `i , and the wage wi clears the labor market in each country i ∈ {H, F }.

    4. Production and consumption take place.

   This timing assumption implies that the default decision of the home country
depends on the conditions of the economy, captured by aggregate productivity z H .

4.1     Equilibrium given policy
We start characterizing the competitive equilibrium given the stocks of public debt
{B H , B F } and the repayment policy chosen by the home government, δ. The problem
solved by workers in country i ∈ {H, F } is

                              W i = max c − `ν                                       (4)

   From the first order condition we obtain the supply of labor as a function of the
wage rate,

of transfers (no income effect). The assumption ν > 1 ensures that the supply is
increasing in the wage rate wi .

  To gain analytical tractability, we make the following assumption:

                                                                        l
                                                                            
Assumption 1 The cost of labor takes the form $(w, l, m) = wl           m
                                                                             .

    With this specification of the cost function, the demand for labor, derived from
Problem (6), takes the form
                                            zi i
                                      li =     m,                                 (7)
                                           2wi
which is linear in the post-default financial wealth of entrepreneurs mi . As we will
see, this property also applies to the micro-foundation of the cost function derived
from the general model presented in Section 6.
    The labor market equilibrium is derived by equating the aggregate demand of
labor to the supply as illustrated in Figure 3 and characterized in Lemma 2.

Proof. By equating eqs. (5) to (7) and solving for Li and wi , we obtain the above
expressions.
    The variable M i denotes the ‘aggregate’ financial wealth of entrepreneurs in coun-
try i, after the repayment of government debt. It is the sum of the repaid debts issued
by home and foreign countries, that is,
                                     M i = δB Hi + B F i .                                   (8)
    This expression makes clear that a default in the home country, that is, δ < 1,
reduces entrepreneurs’ wealth which in turn reduces the aggregate demand for labor.
In Figure 3, this is captured by a shift to the left of the demand curve. As a result,
both wages and labor decline in equilibrium. The decline in labor then implies a
decline in output (macroeconomic contraction).
    What is important—and this differentiates our paper from most of the literature
on sovereign default—is that the endogenous macroeconomic contraction arises not
only in the defaulting country (H country), but also in the non-defaulting country
(F country). This is because the default of the home country (δ < 1) also reduces
M F , that is, the wealth of foreign entrepreneurs (see equation (8)). As we will see,
this feature of the model is crucial for understanding the bailout incentives of creditor
countries.
    Another important feature of the model is that the size of the induced contraction
is larger when productivity is high. We state this formally in the following corollary.

Corollary 3 The drop in output Y i (z i ) induced by the default of the home country
is larger in booms,

   This property has two implications: (i) the incentive for the home country to
default increases when the economy is in recession; (ii) the incentive of the foreign
country to bailout the home country increases when the foreign country experiences
an economic boom. Thus, the business cycle is important not only for affecting the
decision to default (which is a feature of many sovereign default models) but also the
decision to bailout a defaulting country (which is a novel feature of our model).

4.2     Optimal default decision without renegotiation
The optimal policy of the home government in period 2 consists of the choice of debt
repayment to maximize the weighted sum of the utility of workers and entrepreneurs,
                                   n                      o
                       V H = max     Ψ U H + (1 − Ψ) W H ,                      (10)
                                    δ≤1

where Ψ is the relative weight assigned to entrepreneurs, and U H and W H denote the
indirect utilities of entrepreneurs and workers as defined in (4) and (6).5
    The state variables for the problem solved by the home government are the stock
of debt B H , the portfolio composition of home entrepreneurs, B HH and B F H , and
the realization of home productivity z H .
    To characterize the solution, it is convenient to consider first the relaxed problem
where the repayment of debt is not subject to the constraint δ ≤ 1. The first order
condition for the relaxed problem can be written as,

                                                 ∂LH HH

                  2. Price effect                       3. Redistribution effect
    It has three main terms, each capturing the welfare effect of default through a par-
ticular channel. We can also see the separate impact of each channel on entrepreneurs
(terms multiplied by Ψ) and workers (terms multiplied by 1 − Ψ).
   1. Macroeconomic effect: This is the macroeconomic contraction induced by de-
      fault, captured by the reduction in employment, ∂LH /∂M H . The central mech-
      anism through which default generates a macroeconomic contraction is by de-
      stroying the financial wealth of entrepreneurs M H = δB HH + B F H . This
      term is multiplied by B HH because larger holdings of home bonds by home
      entrepreneurs result in a bigger destruction of their wealth, leading to a larger
      contraction in the demand of labor. The macroeconomic effect of default is neg-
      ative for both entrepreneurs and workers. For entrepreneurs because it reduces
      the scale of production and, therefore, total profits. For workers it generates
      lower employment (although this is partially compensated by a lower dis-utility
      from working).
   5
    The objective function of the government can be micro-founded with a probabilistic voting model
where two opportunistic candidates compete for elections. It is easy to show that such voting model
results in each politician choosing the policy that maximizes a planner’s problem with weights given
by the political power of each group (see Azzimonti (2011) for details).


                                                11
   2. Price effect: The destruction in entrepreneurs’ wealth, with consequent decline
      in the demand for labor, generates a drop in the wage rate. This is captured
      by the term ∂wH /∂M H . Again, this is multiplied by B HH because the change
      in M H is smaller if the holdings of home bonds by home entrepreneurs is lower.
      This effect is positive for entrepreneurs (since they have to pay less to workers)
      but it is negative for workers (since they receive lower compensation).
   3. Redistribution effect: If the government repays less debt, it redistributes wealth
      from the holders of debt to tax payers. Therefore, the welfare effect for en-
      trepreneurs is negative (since they hold the debt) but it is positive for workers
      (since they pay less taxes).6 While the positive effect on workers is multiplied
      by B H , the negative effect on entrepreneurs is multiplied by B HH since only
      part of the home debt is held by home entrepreneurs.
    To the extent that part of the home debt is held by foreign entrepreneurs, the third
channel redistributes wealth from the foreign country to the home country. This is
also a feature of many other sovereign default models studied in the literature. The
focus of our paper, however, is not on this channel. Instead, we focus on the first
channel: default generates lower financial losses for home entrepreneurs because their
portfolios are internationally diversified. The wage redistribution channel is also part
of our focus but the importance of this channel is secondary compared to the negative
effect on employment.
    Although the direct redistributive effect of default is beneficial for workers, the
macroeconomic effect has negative consequences for them. Thus, from the perspective
of workers, default implies a trade-off: the benefit is the reduction in taxes; the cost
is the reduction in income. From the perspective of entrepreneurs, instead, default
implies only a cost: in addition to the direct loss of financial wealth, entrepreneurs also
earn lower incomes (total profits decline even if entrepreneurs pay lower wages). But
the key insight is that the macroeconomic costs are lower when domestic portfolios are
diversified; that is, when a large share of domestic financial wealth is held in foreign
         FH
assets BM H . This mechanism, which is novel in the sovereign default literature, affects
the incentive of the government to default. We will explore the empirical relevance
of this mechanism in Section 8.
    To further characterize the equilibrium, we will make the following assumption
about the portfolios holdings at the beginning of period 2.

Assumption 4 Portfolio holdings satisfy B HF = B HH and B F H = B F F .

   This assumption implies that half of the debt issued by the home country, B H , is
held by domestic entrepreneurs and half by foreign entrepreneurs. The same for the
   6
    The assumption that only workers pay taxes is not essential. This would be true even if taxes
were equally paid by workers and entrepreneurs. What matters is that taxes are not proportional
to the holding of public debt so that default implies that agents who hold the debt (entrepreneurs)
experience a net loss while agents who do not hold the debt (workers) experience a net gain.


                                                12
debt issued by the foreign country, B F . Although this assumption seems arbitrary at
this stage, we will see later that, when entrepreneurs choose their portfolio optimally
in period 1, this becomes an equilibrium outcome.
    The following proposition characterizes the optimal repayment rate chosen by the
unconstrained home government.

Proposition 5 Suppose that (i) Ψ < 23 , (ii) zH < 2−3Ψ        2ν
                                                        1−Ψ ν−1
                                                                 , and (iii) B H > 0. There
exists a unique solution to the unconstrained maximization problem (10). The opti-
mal unconstrained repayment rate δ u (z H , B H , B F ) is strictly increasing in aggregate
productivity z H and strictly decreasing in B H and B F .

Proof. See Appendix B.

     The restrictions on the parameter space assumed in the proposition ensure that
the objective function is well defined. All results are derived analytically. However,
since the analytical solution is cumbersome, the precise expressions are relegated to
the appendix.
     According to the proposition, the incentive to default—that is, the incentive to
repay a lower fraction of the outstanding debt—is higher when the country is in reces-
sion. By repaying less debt, the government makes the recession deeper: in addition
to the direct impact of lower productivity on employment and output, the destruc-
tion of entrepreneurial wealth associated with lower repayment further discourages
the demand for labor. Thus, the optimal government policy acts as an amplification
mechanism for the aggregate shock. Still, from the government point of view, the
policy is welfare improving.
     We can now characterize the optimal constrained solution, that is, the solu-
tion that is subject to the constraint δ ≤ 1. Given the unconstrained solution
δ u (z H , B H , B F ), the constrained optimal government policy is
                                                    n                          o
                           δ(z H , B H , B F ) = min δ u (z H , B H , B F ) , 1 , (11)

that is, the minimum between the unconstrained policy and the upper bound 1.
    The top panel of Figure 4 illustrates how the fraction repaid δ(z H , B H , B F ) de-
pends on domestic debt, B H , for two realizations of productivity z H . The bottom
panel plots the wealth of home entrepreneurs, M H (after debt repayment). In con-
structing these two plots, the foreign debt B F is kept constant.7
    For low levels of home debt B H , the home government fully repays the debt, that
is, δ(z H , B H , B F ) = 1. However, once the stock of debt inherited from period 1 in-
creases above a certain threshold, the government repays less (δ < 1). Because the
incentive to repay increases with productivity, the threshold is higher when produc-
tivity is high (continuous line vs. dashed line). The optimal repayment policy implies

that post-default financial wealth is increasing in home debt up to a threshold and
then becomes flat. This property is important for determining the costs and benefits
of issuing debt in the first period as we will see later.

Portfolio diversification and externally induced default. Figure 5 illustrates
the importance of portfolio diversification of home residents for the incentive to de-
fault. It depicts the optimal repayment rate of the home country, δ(z H , B H , B F ), as
a function of external debt assets B F , for a given level of home debt B H .
    When the stock of foreign debt increases, home residents hold more of the foreign
debt. This implies that the macroeconomic disruption when the home government
defaults is smaller. Thus, even if the home debt and the amount held by foreigners
do not change, the home government has more incentives to default if residents hold
more of the foreign debt. Notice that we purposely keep the home debt and the
faction held by foreigners constant in order to isolate the usual channel through which
international diversification affects the incentive to default: if more of the home debt
is held by foreigners, default generates a larger redistribution toward home residents.
This channel is also present in other models proposed in the literature. However, the
mechanism emphasized in this paper and illustrated in Figure 5 is different and novel.
    To be more specific, the typical redistribution channel that is present in other
sovereign default models depends on B HH /B H , that is, the fraction of the debt is-
sued by the home country held domestically. The channel emphasized here, instead,

depends on B F H /M H , that is, the fraction of wealth of home residents held in foreign
countries. This is an indicator of portfolio diversification for home residents. In gen-
eral, these two indices are highly correlated and, therefore, when B F H /M H increases,
B HH /B H goes down. The theoretical exercise illustrated in Figure 5, however, iso-
lates the portfolio channel from the redistributive channel by keeping the home debt
B H fixed. Since we are assuming that B HH = B HF , the cross-country redistribution
induced by default does not change. The importance of the exercise is to show that
the default of a country could be driven by the debt issued of other countries.
    Although in this paper we have considered only financial assets issued by govern-
ments, the effect described above could also be driven by the expansion of private
financial markets. For example, a financial boom in advanced economies, either pri-
vate or public, could induce the default of some emerging countries even if financial
and real conditions in these countries have not changed. It is in this sense that default
could be externally driven.

4.3    Financial integration with bailout
Default by the home country also destroys entrepreneurial wealth held by foreign en-
trepreneurs and, therefore, it affects adversely employment and output in the foreign
country. The macroeconomic consequences of sovereign default are then exported
to other countries (spillover). In this section we analyze how the macroeconomic
spillovers create an incentive for the foreign country to bailout, directly or indirectly,
foreign entrepreneurs.




                                                                       15
4.4    Domestic bailout
We first consider the case in which the foreign government bailouts its own en-
trepreneurs if country H defaults. To do so, the F government levies a tax τ on
workers and the revenues are transferred to entrepreneurs. We refer to this as domes-
tic bailout.
    The value of τ is chosen to maximize the country welfare ΨU F + (1 − Ψ)W F (see
Appendix A for a derivation of the analytical expression of this objective). After
substituting all conditions that define a competitive equilibrium, the optimization
problem solved by the F country in response to the default of the H country can be
written as
                          h                    i        h                      i

    The variable M F is the post-bailout wealth of entrepreneurs in country F given the
repayment rate δ chosen by the H country. The terms γ(z F ) and α(z F ) are increasing
functions of the foreign country shock z F . The transfer τ is constrained to be non-
negative and it cannot be bigger than the financial losses incurred by entrepreneurs
when the home country defaults (δ < 1). In other words, the F government cannot
transfer to its own entrepreneurs more than the losses incurrent as a consequence of
the default of the H country, which defines the upper bound on the first constraint
to the problem above.

Ψ ≥ 21 , the welfare function is always increasing in τ , implying that the solution is
τ = (1 − δ)B H /2.

Proof. See Appendix C.

   Figure 6 illustrates the optimal bailout transfer τ for particular parameters. The
dashed line represents the case in which the home country has low productivity,
whereas the solid line corresponds to the case with high productivity. When B H is
low, the home country fully repays the debt and, therefore, the bailout transfer τ is

                                          16
zero. When B H reaches a certain level, the home country repays a fraction of the
debt smaller than 1 (default). In this case the F government compensates the lower
repayment by taxing workers and transferring the revenues to entrepreneurs. Under
the assumption that Ψ = 12 , the F government fully compensates the losses incurred
by foreign entrepreneurs. This implies that domestic bailout eliminates the negative
spillovers that would affect the F country as a consequence of default from the home
country.

    The welfare attained by the H country under this scenario—that is, when it
repays the optimal fraction δ and the F country implements the optimal domestic
bailout—can be written as

where M H = δB 2+B is different from M F because entrepreneurs in the home country
do not receive the bailout τ . The formal derivation is in Appendix A.

4.5    External bailouts
Because the home government ignores the macroeconomic cost of default incurred by
the foreign country, the optimal repayment is not socially efficient. This implies that
both countries may gain from renegotiating the repayment of the home debt.
    Renegotiation takes place only if country H defaults, that is, if it is optimal for
the H country to choose δ < 1. With renegotiation, the two countries bargain the
fraction of the home debt that should be repaid, δ, together with a transfer τ paid

                                                                                   17
by the F country to H country. We think of this payment as an external bailout. To
use a compact notation, we denote the renegotiated policies by π = (δ, τ ).
   Let’s first define some key functions. Given the negotiated policies π, Appendix
A shows that the welfare of government i ∈ {H, F } can be written as

               i
                          h             1
                                          i        h               i

                                 

The vector s = (z H , z F , B H , B F ) denotes the state variables in period 2.
    We can see that a higher repayment δ has positive effects by increasing en-
trepreneurs’ wealth M . These effects are the same for the home and foreign countries.
Higher repayments, however, also imply a cost for the home country due to higher
taxes that home workers have to pay (T H = −δB H + τ ). The bailout transfer τ ,
instead, is a benefit for the home country (since it reduces the tax burden of home
workers) but it is a cost for the foreign country, since foreign workers have to pay
more taxes to cover the transfer (T F = −B F − τ ). Effectively, foreign workers help
home workers to repay the debt of the home country. This is in contrast to domes-
tic bailout described in the previous subsection, where the additional taxes paid by
foreign workers to fund the bailout, are transferred to foreign entrepreneurs.
    Because a higher repayment δ has positive effects on the macroeconomy, the for-
eign government could be willing to pay τ in order to induce a higher repayment from
the home government. Since a higher repayment has also positive effects for the home
country, the foreign government can convince the H government to repay the debt by
‘partially’ subsidizing the repayment. This will become clear below. Before doing so,
however, we need to define the bargaining problem solved by the two governments in
the negotiation of the external bailout.

Negotiation of the external bailout. If the two countries do not reach an agree-
ment, they revert to the equilibrium without renegotiation. The threat value for the
H country is the value of defaulting without renegotiation, that is, V H (s) derived in
(14). The foreign country can always respond to the default with a domestic bailout.
Therefore, the threat value for the F country is V F (s) derived in (12). The bargaining
problem can then be written as
                         h H                iη h F                  i1−η
                max       V (s; π) − V H (s) V (s; π) − V F (s)          ,          (16)
                τ, δ≤1


                                                 18
where η is the relative bargaining power for the home country.
   The bargaining problem maximizes the weighted product of the net renegotiation
surpluses of the two countries. The first order condition with respect to τ determines
how the bargaining power affects the division of the surplus between the two countries,
                                         H
                               η   V (s; π) − V H (s)
                                  = F                 .                              (17)
                              1−η  V (s; π) − V F (s)

    The optimal repayment is determined by the first order condition with respect to
δ. This takes the form
                                 H             F
                              ∂V (s; π) ∂V (s; π)
                                         +             ≥ 0,                        (18)
                                  ∂δ            ∂δ
and it is satisfied with the inequality sign if the solution for the optimal repayment
is binding, that is, δ = 1.
    The Nash-bargaining solution implies that the sum of the (net) marginal benefits
from repaying an extra unit of debt for both countries must be equal to zero (or
equivalently the marginal cost for the home country must be equal to the marginal
benefit for the foreign country).
    Two properties are worth emphasizing. First, this result is independent of the
bargaining weights. Second, it can be easily shown that the Nash-bargaining solution
coincides with the solution to a problem in which τ and δ are chosen by a benevolent
planner who assigns positive weights to both countries. This equivalence derives from
the assumption that the utility from consumption is linear.
    Denote by δ u (s) the optimal and unconstrained repayment without renegotiation
and by δ̄ u (s) the optimal and unconstrained repayment with renegotiation. We then
have the following proposition.

Proposition 7 Suppose that (i) Ψ < 12 , (ii) 2 − α(z H ) − α(z F )] 1−Ψ
                                                                     Ψ
                                                                        − 2 > 0, and (iii)
                                                                u
δ(s) < 1. The optimal and unconstrained repayment rate δ̄ (s) is strictly increasing
in z H and z F , and strictly decreasing in B H and B F . Furthermore, the unconstrained
repayment rate with renegotiation is always bigger than the unconstrained repayment
without renegotiation, that is, δ̄ u (s) > δ u (s).

Proof. See Appendix D.
    What differentiates the optimal repayment with and without renegotiation is that
the latter takes into account only the effects of default in the home country whereas
the former takes into account the consequences for both home and foreign coun-
tries. Debt renegotiation forces the home country to internalize the macroeconomic
spillovers of default and, therefore, it induces higher repayment.
    The constrained solution, that is, the solution that satisfies δ ≤ 1, is
                                            n           o
                                δ̄(s) = min δ̄ u (s) , 1 .                       (19)


                                             19
    As in the no-renegotiation case, total debt B H + B F is fully repaid for relatively
low values of home and foreign debt. Furthermore, higher values of home debt are
associated with lower repayment rates. It is easy to show that, when Ψ ≥ 12 , the
objective function in the Nash bargaining problem is strictly increasing. Hence, δ̄(s) =
1 regardless of the shocks or levels of debt in each country.

Domestic vs External bailouts Figure 7 shows the external bailout transfer for
a numerical example. In this example Ψ = 21 and, therefore, the bailout results in full
repayment, that is, δ̄ = 1.
     The top panels of Figure 7 plot total repayment (left panel) and home repay-
ment (right panel) in the equilibrium without renegotiation (no domestic or external
bailouts). Total repayment is calculated as the ratio between the post-default world-
wide wealth of entrepreneurs over the outstanding worldwide sovereign debt, that is,
M H +M F
 B H +B F
          . If this ratio is equal to 1 it means that the worldwide debt is fully repaid.
When the ratio is smaller than 1 the worldwide debt is repaid only partially. Home
repay, instead, is the ratio of taxes paid by workers in the home country over the debt
                                  TH
of the home country, that is, B     H . Without renegotiation this is equal to the optimal

repayment ratio δ(s).
     The bottom panels of Figure 7 plot the same variables but with an external bailout.
As observed above, since in this example Ψ = 21 , the worldwide debt is fully repaid
under bailout. However, we can see from the last panel that home workers repay only
a fraction of the home debt. Part of the repayment is covered by the transfer τ > 0
that the F country makes to the H country.
     Does the foreign country gain from participating in the external bailout instead of
simply bailing out its own entrepreneurs? Provided that the bargaining Problem (16)
has a solution, the answer is obviously yes. This is because the bargaining value for
the F country cannot be smaller than its threat value (given by the welfare achieved
with domestic bailout).
     Figure 8 illustrates this with a numerical example in which Ψ = 12 . With this
welfare weight, the debt held by foreign entrepreneurs is fully repaid with both do-
mestic and foreign bailouts. So the gain for country F from bailing out country H is
only the difference between the transfers that F workers have to pay with external
and domestic bailouts. The figure plots these two transfers when home productivity
is low (left panel) and when home productivity is high (right panel).
     When B H is small, the home country does not default and, therefore, there is
neither domestic or external bailout. Once B H reaches a certain level, the home
country finds optimal to default and the fraction repaid declines with the stock of
debt. As a result, bailout transfers increase with B H . However, the transfer paid
by country F under a domestic bailout is bigger than the transfer under an external
bailout. This shows why, at least under some conditions, countries may prefer the
more common bailout approach instead of a domestic bailout.

5            Equilibrium in Period 1
The analysis conducted so far has focused on period 2. Given debt issued by the two
governments and the portfolio composition of private agents, we have characterized
the optimal repayment policy of the home country with and without external bailouts.
We can now move back to period 1 and characterize the optimal issuance of debt.
This allows us to derive endogenously also the optimal portfolio composition chosen
by entrepreneurs which in the previous section we took as exogenous (see Assumption


                                                                                                                                  21
4). The issuance of debt and the optimal portfolio compositions will then determine
the states in period 2.
    To keep tractability, we focus on the optimal issuance of debt chosen by the
home government, B H , and assume that the debt of the foreign government, B F ,
is exogenous. This simplifies the analysis because we do not need to consider the
strategic interaction between governments in the first period. We will relax this
assumption when we introduce the general model in Section 6.

5.1     Equilibrium for given policies
Using the previous notation, we denote with δ(s) the fraction of debt repaid in period
2 by the home country. The repayment policy depends on the aggregate states s. In
general, the aggregate states are s = (z H , z F , B HH , B HF , B F H , B F F ). However, as we
will show below, the optimal portfolio choices in period 1 implies that B H and B F
are sufficient to determine B HH , B HF , B F H and B F F . Therefore, in what follows we
use s = (z H , z F , B H , B F ).
    The equilibrium repayment rate will be denoted by δ(s). As we have seen this
depends on the particular environment: no-renegotiation or external bailout. When
necessary to specify the particular environment, we will use δ(s) for the environment
without external bailout and δ̄(s) for the environment with external bailout.
    The equilibrium policy function δ(s) is taken as given by agents and governments
when they solve their optimization problem in period 1. In addition, private agents
take as given the government policies chosen in period 1, that is, B H and B F .
    In period 1 workers behave passively: they consume the endowment plus the
revenues that the government receive from issuing debt. Their lifetime utility is

                              ci2 (s) = e + wi (s)Li (s) + T i (s)

where wi (s) are the equilibrium wage, Li (s) the equilibrium labor supply and T i (s)
the government transfers (taxes if negative), all in period 2. These objects depend
on the states in period 2 as specified in the previous analysis. They also depend on
the particular renegotiation environment: with or without external bailout.
    Entrepreneurs choose optimally their savings and allocation between home and
foreign bonds (portfolio composition) to solve the problem

   The following lemma characterizes the optimal portfolio allocation chosen by en-
trepreneurs.

Lemma 8 In equilibrium, the optimal portfolio choice of entrepreneurs satisfies

                                          bHi + bF i   BH + BF
Proof. See Appendix E.

    The lemma says that entrepreneurs choose the same portfolio allocation in the two
countries. More specifically, given the savings of entrepreneurs in country i, bHi + bF i ,
the fraction allocated to home bonds, bHi /[bHi +bF i ], is the same for home and foreign
entrepreneurs. Obviously, if entrepreneurs in the two countries choose to allocate the
same fraction of savings in home issued bonds, this fraction must be equal to the
aggregate relative supply, B H /(B H + B F ). This shows that the assumption made in
the previous section about the composition of portfolio in period 2 (see Assumption
4) is an equilibrium outcome. This also implies that the sufficient set of aggregate
states is s = (z H , z F , B H , B F ), as we conjectured.
    The choice of the same portfolio composition derives from the assumption that
the two countries are identical in preferences and technology and entrepreneurs do
not pay taxes or receive transfers.8

5.2     Optimal issuance of debt
The objective for the home government in period 1 is

                 V1H (B H , B F ) = ΨU1H (B H , B F ) + (1 − Ψ)W1H (B H , B F ),

the functions W1H (B H , B F ) and U1H (B H , B F ) are the equilibrium lifetime utilities of
workers and entrepreneurs defined, respectively, in (20) and (21). The debt issued by
   8
    If entrepreneurs pay taxes or receive transfers, their disposable income would be affected by
default decisions. Because the foreign government always repays debt whereas the home government
could default, there would be an asymmetry in portfolio decisions. Another required assumption for
the portfolio result is the absence of income effects on the labor supply.


                                                         23
the foreign government, B F , is exogenous in this version of the model and, therefore,
it is taken as given by the H government.
     The optimal issuance of debt from the home government is shown with a numer-
ical example in Figure 9. The figure plots the social welfare function for the home
government as a function of debt B H , and for a given B F . The solid line represents
the no-bailout case, whereas the dashed line is for the environment with (expected)
external bailout in period 2. The optimal debt is the value of B H which maximizes
social welfare.

    In the environment without external bailout, the home government chooses to
borrow B H = 0.24. With anticipated external bailout, instead, the optimal debt is
B H = 0.82, which is bigger than the debt issued without bailout. With anticipated
bailout the home country anticipates that part of the debt will be repaid by the
foreign country and, therefore, it has more incentive to borrow. This captures the
typical moral hazard mechanism induced by the anticipation of bailouts.
    As can be seen from Figure 9, the anticipation of bailout improves welfare for the
home country. But does this also improve the welfare of the foreign country? More
specifically, would the F government also gain by not committing ex-ante to bailout
the H country?
    Figure 10 plots the social welfare for country F with and without external bailout
for different values of B H . As can be seen, the welfare with bailout dominates the
welfare without bailout (where the F country is able to commit to not bailout the


                                                               24
H country). Thus, anticipated bailouts could be efficient not only ex-post (after a
country has chosen to default) but also ex-ante (before the issuance of debt). Although
this result cannot be generalized to any arbitrary parameter configuration, it shows
that it is possible for anticipated bailouts to be ex-ante optimal.

    Why are anticipated bailouts welfare improving? More debt allows for greater
efficiency in period 2. However, with financial integration, when a country issues more
debt, the benefits are shared with other countries. This implies that the country does
not fully internalize the benefits of more debt and, therefore, it issues too little debt.
Anticipated bailouts alleviate this problem. The home country anticipates in period 1
that the foreign country will contribute to the repayment of the debt. This increases
the incentive to borrow, bringing the allocation closer to the efficient one. Effectively,
renegotiation acts as a counterbalancing mechanism for the under-issuance of debt
that results from the fact that countries do not internalize that their issuance of debt
brings benefits also to other countries.


6     General model
In this section we consider three main extensions of the model:

    1. Concave utilities for both workers and entrepreneurs.

    2. Micro-foundation for the cost function $(l, w, m).

                                                                    25
   3. Optimal issuance of debt and default also for the foreign country.
    The concavity of utilities allows us to derive a sharper characterization of the
equilibrium in period 1 when both countries choose their borrowing optimally. With
linear preferences the equilibrium in period 1 is undetermined. The concavity for en-
trepreneurs is also important for the micro-foundation of the cost function $(l, w, m).
The drawback is that it is more difficult to characterize the properties of the model
analytically. The main insights we obtained from the simple model also apply to
the more general model studied here. In particular, (i) employment increases with
entrepreneurs’ wealth M ; (ii) the home government has more incentives to default
in recessions than in booms; (iii) anticipated bailouts result in higher levels of debt
which, importantly, could be welfare improving also ex-ante.
    To facilitate the presentation we first analyze the model in which only the home
country can default in period 2. The case in which both countries could default will
be studied in Section 7.

6.1    Environment without default from F country
The lifetime utility of workers is
                                            
                  ln(c1 ) + βE ln ϕ(c2 , `2 ) ,                ϕ(c, `) = c − `ν

Because the dis-utility of working in period 2 is additive to consumption, the labor
supply still satisfies eq.(5) and it is fully determined by the wage rate.
   The utility of entrepreneurs is also logarithmic, that is,
                                    ln(d1 ) + βE ln(d2 ).
   The production function in period 2 is
                                     y2i = A(z2i , ε2 )l2i ,
where z2i is an aggregate country-specific productivity shock and ε2 is an idiosyncratic
productivity shock specific to an individual entrepreneur. The only modification to
the production function is the addition of the idiosyncratic shock.
    While the aggregate shock z2i is observed at the beginning of the period before
making any production decision (as assumed in the previous model), the idiosyncratic
shock ε2 is observed after choosing the input of labor l2i . This timing assumption
makes the hiring decision risky. Since entrepreneurs are risk averse, the marginal
product of labor must exceed the wage rate to compensate for the hiring risk (risk
premium).
    We continue to assume that the debt repayment of the home country, δ, is decided
after the observation of the aggregate shock z i but before entrepreneurs choose the
input of labor. The following lemma characterizes the hiring decision in period 2
given the debt repayment δ.

                                          A(z ,ε)−w      i
Lemma 9 Let φi satisfy the condition Eε 1+[A(z i ,ε)−w i ]φi = 0. Entrepreneur’s policies

in country i are

                     
where mi = δbHi + bF i is the entrepreneur’s wealth after default.

Proof. See Appendix F.
   As in the simpler model, the demand for labor li depends, linearly, on the post-
default wealth of the entrepreneur. This is because labor is risky and when individual
wealth is lower, the entrepreneur is less willing to take risks. To reduce the risk,
the entrepreneur hires fewer workers. The aggregation of individual decisions then
implies that equilibrium employment and wage in period 2 depend positively on the
debt repayment policies. This is made precise in the following lemma.

Lemma 10 In the competitive equilibrium in period 2

  1. The hiring factor φi is strictly decreasing in δ.

  2. The wage rate wi and aggregate employment Li are increasing in δ.

Proof. See Appendix G.
   We can now move to period 1 taking as given the equilibrium policy rules in
period 2. The first period maximization problems for workers and entrepreneurs
are analogous to those described in Section 5.1. The next lemma characterizes the
entrepreneurs’ portfolio decisions in period 1.

                                           27
Proof. See Appendix H.

    Entrepreneurs allocate a fraction 1 − θH − θF of their initial endowment a to
consumption and the remaining fraction θH + θF is saved. Savings are then invested
in home bonds and foreign bonds according to θH and θF .
    Home and foreign entrepreneurs choose the same saving rates and the same com-
position of portfolios, that is, the same ratio of bonds issued by home and foreign
governments. In equilibrium then, and analogously to our benchmark case, it must
be that, for each country i ∈ {H, F },
                                    bHi         BH
                                            =         .
                                 bHi + bF i   BH + BF
Taking into account this property, we can reduce the sufficient aggregate states in
period 2 to s = (z H , z F , B H , B F ), that is, the aggregate shocks and the outstanding
debt of the two countries.

6.2    Default decisions in period 2: no-renegotiation
Given the aggregate states s, the home government chooses the repayment rate δ in
order to solve

The variables hH , cH , dH (ε) are determined by the competitive equilibrium for given
policies. Denote the solution to this problem by δ(z H , B H , B F ).
    Figure 11 plots the optimal repayment of the home country, δ(z H , B H , B F )B H ,
as a function of the foreign debt B F , which is fully repaid by the foreign country.
The parameters used in the example are ν = 2, e = 1, Ψ = 0.5, the idiosyncratic
productivity takes values {0.9, 1, 1.1} with equal probabilities and the aggregate pro-
ductivity takes values z ∈ {0.95, 1.1}, also with equal probabilities. We assume that
A(z i , ε) = z i + ε. We first fix the outstanding debt of the home country, B H , and
then we plot the optimal repayment δ(z H , B H , B F )B H as we change B F . In the left
panel B H = 0.48 and in the right panel B H = 0.51. Each panel reports the best
responses of the home government, separately, when aggregate productivity in the
home country is low and when it is high. As in the benchmark case, there is more
incentive to default when the country is in a recession.
    The figure shows that as external financial assets B F increase, it is optimal for
the home country to repay less. For low levels of foreign debt, the repayment of the
home country is flat because the constraint δ ≤ 1 binds.

6.3    Domestic bailout in period 2
If the home country defaults, the foreign country could bailout foreign entrepreneurs.
In this case the foreign government raises additional taxes from workers and uses

    Given the holding of the home debt held by foreign entrepreneur, B HF , the capital
losses incurred by foreign entrepreneurs are [1 − δ(z H , B H , B F )]B HF . In the domes-
tic bailout the foreign government chooses the lump-sum taxes raised from foreign

   Notice that the taxes paid by foreign workers for the domestic bailout, τ , are in
addition to the taxes needed to repay for their government debt B F .

6.4    External bailout
The renegotiation protocol is identical to the one in the simpler model that we charac-
terized earlier: the two countries bargain the home debt repayment δ̄(z H , z F , B H , B F )
and the bailout transfer τ paid by country F to country H. This gives rise to the
bargaining problem (16), where the threat values are now defined in (22) and (23).
    To characterize the bargaining solution we resort to the numerical example used
to construct Figure 11. The bargaining share parameter is set to η = 0.5.
    Figure 12 plots the debt repayment. Total repayment captures the ratio of en-
trepreneurs’ financial assets in both countries (M H +M F = δB H +M F ) over the initial
value of debt issued by both countries (B H + B F ). When both countries fully repay
their debt, the ratio is equal to 1. Home repayment without bailout is the repayment

(relative to the debt).
    The figure shows that with bailout the total debt B H + B F is fully repaid for
relatively low values of debt. For very large values of debt, however, the debt would
not be fully repaid. Furthermore, the higher the debt of the home country is, the lower
the fraction [δ̄(z H , z F , B H , B F )B H − τ ]/B H repaid by the home country. Although
not shown, the repayment of the home country increases with the debt of the foreign
country. Starting with a higher foreign debt is similar to giving more bargaining
power to the F country.

6.5     Borrowing decisions in period 1
In period 1 the governments of both countries issue bonds. Country H issues B H at
price 1/RH and country F issues B F at price 1/RF . The revenues are distributed to
domestic workers.
    The issuance of debt in period 1 is made simultaneously and non-cooperatively.

The functions U i (B H , B F ) and W i (B H , B F ) are the equilibrium lifetime expected

    For the numerical characterization, we use the same parameters we used in the
previous examples. In addition, we set the discount factor to β = 0.9825 and the
first period endowments to a = e = 1. The top-left panel in Figure 13 plots the
responses of the two countries as a function of the other country’s debt under the
no-renegotiation regime (no anticipated bailout).
    The responses of the two countries are downward sloping. This is because, as the
debt of the other country increases, part of which is held by domestic entrepreneurs,
there is less need for liquidity. The equilibrium is given by the intersection of the
two response functions. It can be noticed that there is a small range of multiplicity,
that is, the responses functions intersect on multiple points. The range of multiplic-
ity, however, is relatively small and the findings discussed below are (qualitatively)
insensitive to the choice of the particular intersection (equilibrium).9
    The top-right panel depicts the best responses in the bailout case and the equilib-
rium is again characterized by the intersection of the two response functions. Relative
to the case without renegotiation, we observe two differences. First, the equilibrium
debt issued by the home country is much larger whereas that of the foreign country is
smaller. Since the home country knows that there will be a bailout in period 2, which
implies that part of the debt will be repaid by the foreign country, it has an incen-
tive to borrow more in period 1. Essentially, renegotiation makes the debt cheaper
    9
      When B H is relatively small, the home country never defaults in period 2. Thus, the foreign
country’s response to increases in B H simply reflects a lower need to provide liquidity to foreign
entrepreneurs. When B H reaches a certain level, default may occur in period 2. Since the default
decision of the home country depends on B F , the foreign country will take this into account when
it chooses the optimal debt. In particular, the foreign government may choose to reduce more its
own debt when B H increases in order to prevent the home country from defaulting in period 2.
The reaction function becomes steeper and overlaps with the reaction function of the home country.
Once B H has reached a certain level, however, it is no longer beneficial to reduce B F to prevent
default and the reaction function of the foreign country becomes less steep.

for the home country. Second, when there is anticipation of bailout, the worldwide
debt level (B H + B F ) is bigger than without renegotiation. Without renegotiation,
each country ignores the benefits that higher liquidity brings to the other country
(a positive externality). When countries renegotiate in period 2, they will take this
into account, which results in higher overall debt. These properties are qualitatively
similar to those studied in the benchmark economy. The new insight from the more
general environment is that the foreign country optimally reduces its issuance of debt
in period 1. Despite of this, overall liquidity rises.
    The bottom panel of Figure 13 plots the response functions in autarky. Obviously,
being in autarky, the responses of the two countries are insensitive to the debt issued
by the other country. The equilibrium, is still characterized by the intersection of these
two functions. As summarized in Table 1, the worldwide debt (B H + B F ) issued in
autarky is even higher than the worldwide debt in the regime with capital mobility
when there is renegotiation. Therefore, the anticipation of bailout compensates only
partially for the externality in the issuance of debt when markets are integrated.
    Although renegotiation is always efficient in period 2, it is not obvious whether
the anticipation of bailout also increases welfare in period 1, that is, before the two
countries issue B H and B F . This is especially important for the foreign country, that

is, the country that always repays. In the numerical example considered here we find
that the equilibrium with anticipated bailout gives higher expected welfare to the
foreign country when compared to the no-renegotiation equilibrium. This is shown
in Table 1. The bailout equilibrium also gives higher worldwide welfare (compared
to the no-renegotiation equilibrium), where worldwide welfare is defined as the sum
of the two countries’ welfare. The home country, however, achieves lower welfare.
     The intuition for the welfare findings is similar to the one provided in the analysis
of the simpler model: in an integrated economy, each country ignores the benefits that
the issuance of debt brings to the other country and, as a result, the equilibrium debt
is inefficiently low. The anticipation of renegotiation (bailout) increases the incentive
to issue more debt in period 1 and compensates, at least in part, the inefficiency
associated to the externality. Therefore, bailouts can be efficient ex-ante also in the
extended model. The benefits of anticipated bailouts, however, are enjoyed only by
the bailing country. This is because, thanks to the threat of domestic bailout, the
foreign country can extract most of the benefits from higher worldwide liquidity.


7      The role of commitment
In this section, we relax the assumption that the F country always commits to repay
the debt while the H country always defaults if it is optimal to do so. More specifically,
we allow both countries to default in period 2 with some probability. We assume that
with probability ρH the home country keeps its commitment to repay in period 2 and
with probability 1 − ρH it will opportunistically choose whether to default. Similarly,
with probability ρF the foreign country keeps its commitment to repay the debt in
period 2 and with probability 1 − ρF it will choose whether to default. The model
studied in the previous section is a special case with ρH = 0 and ρF = 1.
    The stochastic commitment of governments captures the possible turnover of rul-
ing parties with different political orientation or preferences. For example, we could
think that in period 2 there is a probability of a new ruling party which assigns higher
weight to entrepreneurs.10
  10
    Because the indirect utility of entrepreneurs is strictly increasing in the debt repaid in period 2,
a government that assigns a weight Ψi = 1 to entrepreneurs would never find it optimal to default.


                                                  33
    Since both countries could default in period 2, the repayment decision becomes
strategic. Country H chooses the optimal repayment taking as given the repayment of
country F and the same is done by country F . We then characterize the equilibrium
repayments in period 2 as determined by a Nash game between the two countries.
    Denote by ξ i ∈ {Commit, N otCommit} the commitment state of country i ∈
{H, F }. Given the state vector s = (ξ H , ξ F , z H , z F , B H , B F ), the government of
country i chooses the repayment rate δ i . If the government remains committed to
repay, that is, ξ i = Commit, then δ i = 1. However, if ξ i = N otCommit, the
government behaves opportunistically and will default if this improves its own welfare.
    When ξ i = N otCommit, the government of country i solves

    The function f i is the optimal repayment policy of country i, given the policy of
the other country. A Nash equilibrium in period 2 is defined by the pair (δ H , δ F ) that
satisfies

                                 δ H = f H s, δ F ,

                                                  

    Given the equilibrium in period 2, we can now move to period 1 and solve for the
equilibrium issuance of debt. In determining the optimal issuance of debt, the two
governments take expectations of period 2 variables with respect to the commitment
states in addition to productivities.
    Figure 14 plots the best responses in period 1 for both countries as functions of the
other country’s debt in the no-renegotiation and bailout regimes. In this numerical
example, the probability of commitment is ρH = ρF = 0.5. Even though the specific
shapes of the response functions are different from those plotted in Figure 13, we still
find that the possibility of bailouts induces higher issuance of debt in period 1.11
    To show the importance of commitment, we compare the baseline model to two al-
ternative scenarios with a probability of commitment of 60% (high commitment) and
40% (low commitment) for both countries. Table 2 reports the equilibrium debt and
social welfare for different levels of commitment. For all levels of commitment, the
renegotiation case is associated with higher welfare relative to the no-renegotiation
case. Looking at the mobility regime with bailout we observe that lower commitment
Smaller values of Ψi would be associated with lower repayment values.
 11
    Under stochastic commitment, multiplicity in the no-bailout case typically disappears.

increases equilibrium debt and improves welfare. This is because, with lower com-
mitment there is a higher probability that the debt issued by one country is partially
repaid by the other country (through a bailout), which increases the incentive to bor-
row. This compensates in part the under-issuance of debt as the benefits of creating
financial assets for one country are shared with the other country. Thus, lower com-
mitment brings the equilibrium closer to the case where each country internalizes the
full benefit of issuing debt.


8     Empirical analysis
A important mechanism imbedded in the model is that the composition of domestic
portfolios affects the government’s decision to default. When the level of external debt
assets (e.g. foreign debt held by domestic agents) raises, the domestic government has
higher incentive to default. This mechanism is novel in the international literature
and in this section we conduct an empirical analysis to test its significance using

                                              35
cross-country data for a panel of 31 countries in the period 1993-2011.
    Before moving to the empirical specification, it is useful to summarize what de-
termines the incentive to default in the model. There are two main channels: (i)
the redistribution channel, which depends on the ratio of home debt held by home
            HH
residents BB H and (ii) the portfolio diversification channel which can be captured by
                                                               FH
the share of home financial wealth held in foreign assets BM H . Recall that B HH is
the home debt held by home entrepreneurs, B F H is the foreign debt held by home
entrepreneurs and M H = B HH + B F H is the financial wealth of home entrepreneurs.
                 FH
A higher ratio BM H , keeping everything else constant, lowers the macroeconomic costs
of default and hence increases the incentives to renege the debt. On the other hand,
                   HH
higher values of BB H means that a larger share of the debt is held domestically which
makes default less attractive for the home government. Hence, our theory suggests
that the empirical specification should include both variables. In addition, the model
predicts that the incentive to default is higher in recessions, suggesting the inclusion
of proxies for the business cycle.

From model to data: The data counterpart for our variable of interest, B F H , is
‘External Debt Assets’ obtained from the External Wealth of Nations Database by
Lane and Milesi-Ferreti12 . This annual series, constructed from BIS and IFS data,
includes ‘debt securities’ and ‘other investment’. It is expressed in millions of current
US dollars.
    It is important to emphasize that this variable includes both public and private
debt. Ideally, we would like to have a measure that includes only external public
debt, as this would correspond more closely to our model. However, we observe that
an augmented version of our model that includes private assets would have similar
implications. The reason is because an increase in any type of assets that are not
defaultable by the domestic government would reduce the macroeconomic cost of
default in the home country and hence increases the incentive to default.
    Home debt held by foreigners, B HF , is proxied by ‘External Government Debt’ ob-
tained from Global Financial Data. The variable corresponds to ‘International Debt
Securities, General Government’ Table C1 of the Debt Securities Statistics of the BIS.
Home debt held by domestic entrepreneurs B HH is constructed as the difference be-
tween total home debt, B H , and the part held by foreigners, B HF . Total government
debt is proxied by ‘Central Government Debt’ obtained from Global Financial Data,
which corresponds to ‘Total Debt Securities, General Government’ in Table C1 of the
Debt Securities Statistics of the BIS. Both B HF and B HH are measured in millions of
current US dollars. Total (domestic) financial assets, M H , are constructed by adding
external debt assets and home debt held domestically, that is, M h = B F H + B HH .

    The variables αH and It are, respectively, country and year fixed-effects. Our
set of additional controls XtH includes GDP growth, inflation rates, and an indicator
for whether the country is in default. GDP growth is computed as the difference in
the natural logarithm of GDP from Lane and Milesi-Ferretti’s database (measured
in million of current US dollars). Inflation rates are obtained from the OECD and
correspond to the CPI percentage change from last year. Finally, the default dummy
is obtained from the Global Crises Dataset constructed by Reinhart, Rogoff, and
Trebesch13 . We use the variable ‘Domestic Debt in Default’. The estimation results
are shown in Table 3.
                                                                           FH
    The first specification includes only the main variable of interest BM H , as well as
country and time fixed effects. Consistent with the model, a larger share of external
debt assets is associated with a higher spread, indicating additional default risk. In the
second specification, we restrict the sample to include at least 8 years of observations.
We can see that, while the coefficient is basically unchanged, the goodness of fit
improves, as seen from the higher value of the R2 . The number of countries is only
reduced from 31 to 27.

    In the third specification, we include GDP growth and BB H as additional controls.
The result is qualitatively similar. As expected, higher GDP growth is associated

with lower spreads, which is also consistent with our model. The coefficient on BB H
is statistically insignificant. This suggests that the portfolio composition channel—
which is the novel channel emphasized in this paper—is more important than the
redistribution channel. Compared to the previous specification, the R2 increases
from 0.2 to 0.31.
    Finally, the fourth and final specification includes inflation and the default status
dummy as additional controls. The positive relationship between external debt assets

9    Conclusion
We have shown that the macroeconomic spillovers caused by sovereign default are
crucial for understanding equilibrium bailouts. Although anticipated bailouts gener-
ate the typical moral hazard problem leading to higher debt, this may counterbalance
the under issuance of debt caused by the lack of policy coordination across countries.
    We show this result in a model in which government debt is held by the private
sector for liquidity and insurance purposes and higher supply of debt improves allo-
cation efficiency. With globalized financial markets, part of the debt issued by one
country is acquired by residents of other countries and, therefore, it creates benefits

                                                            38
for foreigners. Because governments do not internalize the benefits for other coun-
tries, they issue too little debt. Anticipated bailouts could correct for this inefficiency
because they reduce the expected cost of debt.
    We have also shown that, when financial markets are integrated, sovereign default
could be induced by increased borrowing of other countries. This is because, when
foreign countries issue more debt, part of the debt is held by domestic agents, making
their portfolio more diversified. More diversified portfolios decrease the macroeco-
nomic cost of domestic default and increase the incentive of a government to default.
From this perspective, the debt problems experienced by some European countries
during 2011 may have been exacerbated by the increased debt (both private and
public) issued by ‘safe’ industrialized countries since the early 1980s. The empirical
analysis conducted in the paper shows that the incentive of a country to default is
affected by the international diversification of domestic portfolios. A channel that has
not been fully explored in the international literature but is central in the analysis of
our paper.

Appendix
A      Government Welfare given Policy
Let policy be denoted by a triplet π = {δ, T H , T F }, where δ is the repayment rate of
the home country and T i denotes transfers to workers in country i. Using Lemma 2
and eq. (4), we can obtain an analytical expression for the utility of workers in period
2 as a function of the shock z i and the stock of debt issued by each country, B H and
BF
                        W i (z i , B H , B F ; π) = e + α(z i )M + T i ,            (26)

binding. From the definition of τ u (z F , z H ), it follows that transfers are also increasing
in z F .

where i denotes the residency of the entrepreneur, j the origin of debt, mi = δ(s)bHi +
bF i are individual financial assets, δ H = δ(s) debt repayment in the no-renegotiation
case, δ H = δ̄(s) the debt repayment rate with bailouts, and δ F = 1. Because (i) the
process determining z i is identical across countries, (ii) the repayment rate of B H is
the same regardless of residency, and (iii) financial assets are internationally mobile,
the FOC is the same for entrepreneurs in both countries. This implies that it will be
optimal for them to choose bHH = bHF . Aggregating this across agents, B HH = B HF .
                                                                                     H
Because in equilibrium B H = B HH + B HF , then it must be the case that B Hi = B2 .

A similar reasoning delivers B F i = B2 .

Let mi = bHi δ + bF i . In the second period, the entrepreneur chooses li (given mi and
z i ) to maximize

                 i

Guess li = φi mi . Under that guess, di = ([A(z i , ε) − wi ]φi + 1) mi . Using the fact
that mi is independent of ε, we obtain
                                       A(z i , ε) − wi
                               Eε                            = 0,                          (37)
                                    [A(z i , ε) − wi ]φi + 1
which confirms the guess is correct given the definition of φi in the Lemma.



G      Proof of Lemma 10

of workers) and the labor demand factor φi (derived from the FOC of entrepreneurs)

    From Lemma 9, the aggregate labor is given by Li = φi M i . Replace eq. (38) into
eq. (37) to obtain

                                         1
                            Eε                        =1                         (40)
                               [A(z , ε) − wi ]φi + 1
                                    i

Replacing the guesses in eq. (39) for j = F

                                       RF
                                                                               
              1                                                     1
                       = βEs                       Eε
        1 − θF i − θHi          θHi RH δ + θF i RF      [A(z i , ε) − wi ]φi + 1

                                                  45
From eq. 40, we know that given the aggregate state, the term involving Eε is equal
to 1. Using the fact that RH = ηRF ,
                                                         
                              1                   1
                                       = βEs Hi H                              (41)
                        1 − θF i − θHi        θ ηδ + θF i
   Replacing the guesses into eq. (39) for j = H, and following the same steps we
obtain
                                                 δH η
                                                         
                             1
                                      = βEs Hi H                             (42)
                       1 − θF i − θHi         θ ηδ + θF i
   Multiply both sides of eq. (41) by θF i , and both sides of eq. (42) by θHi , and add
the resulting expressions. This delivers, after some algebra,

                             θHi (1 + β) = β − (1 + β)θF i                          (43)

We can replace eq. (43) into eq. (41) and obtain
                            "                       #
                                       1
                        βEs β−(1+β)θF i               =1+β                          (44)
                                  1+β
                                        ηδ H + θF i

This determines θF i as a function of η. Notice that since η is not country specific, the
equation implies that θF H = θF F ≡ θF . From eq. (43), we get that θHH = θHF ≡ θH
as well. Hence, the portfolio allocation is the same in both countries.
