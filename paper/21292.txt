On the Effect of the Costs of Operating Formally: ¸˛New Experimental Evidence

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the impact of the elimination of the initial fixed costs of registration on the decision
of informal firms to operate formally in Bogotá, Colombia. The Chamber of Commerce of Bogotá
(CCB) conducts workshops for prospective formal-sector entrants and arranges personalized meetings
for them with CCB agents. The CCB’s decision to significantly reduce the transaction costs of registration
and the entry into force of Act No. 1429 of 2010, which eliminated the costs of the initial procedure
for registering as a formal enterprise and provided exemptions from relevant taxes during the first
years after formalization, provided us with an ideal experiment for studying how the elimination of
the initial fixed costs of formalization would influence firms’ decision to operate formally or not. We
obtained two important results. First, while a workshop treatment had no effect on firms’ formalization
decisions, meetings at the firm with CCB agents raised the likelihood that a business would begin
to operate formally by 5.5 percentage points for all the firms that were invited, at random, to participate
in this arm of the intervention and by 32 percentage points for the firms that accepted the invitation.
Second, the effect on the treatment firms did not persist over time. After a year of formal operation,
it disappeared. These results indicate that substantial reductions in the fixed costs of operating formally
are not effective in formalization choices, since such reductions had no lasting effect on formalization
decisions.

1. Introduction


Informality is widespread in most developing countries. Policymakers are concerned about this
problem because it entails an inefficient allocation of resources, inasmuch as formal and informal
firms compete in the same market but have different marginal costs (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009).
Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012) develop a general equilibrium model in which both firms and
workers choose whether to operate formally or informally. On that basis, they conduct an extensive
static comparative analysis. Since the work of De Soto (1989), a great deal of emphasis has been
placed on the burden represented by fixed formal-sector entry costs. Another major barrier to
formality is thought to be the high taxes levied on profits and labor. While there is an ample body
of literature that evaluates the costs and benefits of formality, there is much less experimental
evidence regarding the impact of fixed costs on the decision to operate formally. An exception is
the empirical work of De Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff (2008 and 2013), which evaluates the
influence of different interventions on a firm’s decision to formalize. One of the approaches that
they tested consisted of giving information to potential entrants about the registration process and
about the possibility of obtaining reimbursement for direct registration costs. They found that this
kind of intervention had no effect on the decisions made by the informal Sri Lankan firms covered
in their study as to whether to formalize or not. In contrast, other treatments, in which actual
payments were made, in addition to the provision of information and the reimbursement of
registration costs, had a significant effect on the firms’ decisions to operate formally.
This paper analyzes the impact of the elimination of initial fixed registration costs on informal firms’
decision to operate formally in Colombia. In order to enter the formal sector of the Colombian
economy, firms must register with the tax agency (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales
(DIAN)) and obtain a taxpayer identification number and card (Registro Único Tributario (RUT)), as
well as obtain a license (matrícula mercantil) from the local chamber of commerce. Fees are charged
for these procedures. Firms also need to renew their licenses every year, which increases the fixed
costs of operating in the formal sector of the economy. In addition, in general, firms have to pay
payroll taxes, value added taxes and income taxes.
In this paper we evaluate two interventions lead ECON ESTUDIO (EE), a research institute in
Colombia (www.econestudio.com) working together with the Chamber of Commerce of Bogotá
(CCB). These initiatives were designed to eliminate the initial fixed costs for firms that wished to
operate formally. EE together with the CCB organized workshops (first intervention) and arranged
personalized meetings (second intervention) to inform entrepreneurs about registration procedures
and the advantages of operating formally. In both treatments, firms interested in starting the
process of formalization would later receive the assistance of CCB agents in conducting all the
necessary paperwork. In addition to the assistance of the CCB agents, the Formalization and Job
Creation Act No. 1429 of December 2010 establishes that the registration process is to be cost-free
for small and micro firms (the population of our study) that are registering for the first time.2 This
initiative thus provided us with an ideal experiment for studying how the elimination of the initial
fixed costs of formalization would influence firms’ decision to operate formally or not, thanks to the
combination of the experiments (workshops and meetings), which has also eliminated all the


2
  This law defines small firms as firms with fewer than 50 employees and total assets of less than 5,000 minimum legal monthly wages
(MLMW). One MLMW was equivalent to Col$ 515,000 in 2011 (US$ 265 using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2011). All firms
included in our sample fit this definition.
transaction costs of registration, and Act No. 1429, which eliminated the costs of the initial
registration for firms created between 2011 and 2014. What is more, Act No. 1429 also establishes
that, in the short run, firms are to be exempted from paying all taxes, thus giving them a clean slate
for the start-up of their formal-sector operations. This intervention was expected not only to induce
firms that were on the verge of entering the formal sector to actually do so, but also to give other
firms the opportunity to experiment with formality at no cost for a year. This latter aspect also adds
a special feature to our experiment, since it enabled us to analyze the sustainability of the project-
induced decision to operate formally once the firms had to renew their licenses (the fee for which,
in the first year after registration, was cut by 50% under Act No. 1429).
Thus, we were able to take advantage of this experiment to study the effect of the virtual elimination
of formalization costs on the decision to operate formally in a context in which no tax liabilities
would be incurred for at least two years. In addition, we were also able to test whether the effects
of this intervention would be sustainable once firms had had the opportunity to learn about the
advantages or disadvantages of operating formally and had to opt to remain in the formal sector by
paying a small fee (which would still be 50% less than it would otherwise have been).
EE conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate these programs’ impact on the decision of a
sample of informal firms in southern Bogotá as to whether to formalize or not. Bogotá, the capital
city of Colombia, has a large concentration of small businesses. Because no frame of reference was
available that could be used to identify which firms should be included in the baseline sample, we
started with one neighborhood, Restrepo, in the center of the locality of Antonio Nariño, which had
not come within the scope of the CCB interventions. In October 2010, a group of research assistants
went door-to-door to screen firms, asking their owners or managers some basic questions that
helped them to identify informal firms that could be included in the baseline sample. The objective
was to pinpoint those firms which had not taken any steps to begin the formalization process. In
order to obtain a large sample, the survey area was expanded by adding the areas located in
concentric circles surrounding Restrepo, thus maintaining this neighborhood in the center of the
circle; we also made sure that the additional survey areas were ones in which the CCB programs had
not yet been implemented.
By matching our baseline sample data with the CCB’s official records, we were able to obtain exact
information on which firms actually formalized after the interventions were conducted.
Furthermore, this data also showed which of the firms that did decide to formalize as a result of the
intervention remained in the formal sector when the time came for them to renew their business
licenses.
We have two important results to report. First, while the workshop treatment had no effect on the
decision regarding formalization, the CCB agents’ visits raised the likelihood of formal operation by
5.5 percentage points for all the firms that were randomly invited to participate (in other words,
this is the intention-to-treat parameter) and by 32 percentage points for those firms that had been
invited and then accepted the invitation (in other words, this is the local average treatment effect).
Second, and very interestingly, the effect of the treatment did not persist over time. After a year of
formal operation, both effects disappeared. What it is more, this was not the result of businesses in
the control group entering the formal sector in order to “catch up” with the others but instead
reflects the decisions of formalized firms not to renew their licenses. This is a very interesting result,
since it suggests that some firms that experiment with formality do not find that it is advantageous
for them to continue operating as formal-sector enterprises even when they do not have to pay
taxes and only have to pay 50% of the license renewal fee.
These results show that a substantial reduction in the fixed costs of operating formally does not play
a key role in a firm’s decision whether or not to formalize, since that reduction had no enduring
effect on the decision to operate in the formal sector. A considerable number of the firms in the
study chose to become formal when it was cost-free but later, when they would be called upon to
pay a relatively small fee, they decided to return to the informal sector. In this sense, this study
corroborates the findings of De Mel et al. (2013), since it suggests that firms remain informal, not
because burdensome entry costs deter them from operating formally, but because they perceive
the benefits of formality to be modest at best.
There is a vast body of literature on the impacts of different types of programs on informality. Bruhn
(2010) and Kaplan, Piedra and Seira (2011) use different panel datasets to analyze the effect of a
Mexican program implemented in 2002 which reduced the time required to register as a business
from 30 to 2 days. Bruhn (2010) uses data from the Mexican National Employment Survey and finds
that the program raised the registration rate of eligible firms by 5%, but that this increase was a
reflection of the creation of new firms rather than the formalization of existing informal enterprises.
They also find that formal employment in eligible industries increased by 2.8%. On the other hand,
Kaplan et al. (2011) use data from the Mexican Social Security Institute and also find that the
program increased the number of formal firms. However, this study did not find significant effects
in terms of the formal employment rate either. Monteiro et al. (2006) and Fajnzylber et al. (2011)
analyze a simplification program in Brazil which reduced both the costs of registration and business
taxes. The first study relies on a difference-in-differences strategy applied to ineligible firms as a
control group for eligible ones. It shows that the program increased formalization by 13 percentage
points in the case of retail firms but had no impact on other sectors. Furthermore, these researchers
find that the effect is stronger for mid-sized firms. Fajnzylber et al. (2011) relies instead on a
regression discontinuity design and finds that the program has had an effect on formalization: a 7.5
percent increase in the number of firms registered as formal legal entities, a 6.3 percent increase in
the registration of microenterprises and a 7.2 percent increase in registration with the tax
authorities. In addition, they find that the program has had an effect on other outcomes, since the
intervention raised the revenues, employment figures and profits of the formalized firms. However,
these authors have not been able to disentangle the various components of the program in order
to determine which of those components has been responsible for the documented effects. Finally,
McKenzie et al. (2010) rely on an instrumental variables (IV) approach by using the distance to the
registration office as an instrument for gauging registration costs in Bolivia. They find that firms with
from 2 to 5 employees that register as businesses then increase their profits, but that profits of
smaller or bigger firms that register as businesses actually decrease. Their results show that while,
in the presence of high formalization costs, some firms would stand to gain in net terms if they
register as businesses with the tax authorities, others would lose from doing so. In the latter case,
operating informally would be a rational choice.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the process involved in registering
as a formal-sector enterprise in Colombia. Section III describes the intervention and Section IV, the
experimental design. In Section V, we present our findings. Finally, Section VI briefly concludes.
2. Establishing a Formal-Sector Business in Colombia


There are two types of registration procedures required of any firm that wishes to operate formally
in Colombia. The first is registration with the tax authorities of Colombia (Dirección de Impuestos y
Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN)), which issues a taxpayer identification number. The second involves
obtaining a license (matrícula mercantil) from the local chamber of commerce in the district where
the firm is located.
First of all, a firm must record its name, its legal status (natural person or legal entity) and its
industrial classification category as per the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)
nomenclature. This process is cost-free and takes just one day. The steps required to obtain the
taxpayer identification number depend on the legal status of the firm (i.e., natural person or legal
entity) but, since our sample is made up entirely of small firms whose legal status is that of a natural
person, we will only focus on the procedure to be followed by that type of business.
The applicant must submit an online form and the business owner’s identity number to the
corresponding chamber of commerce, which, working in conjunction with the DIAN, then issues a
taxpayer identification number and a business license to the applicant. Under the terms of Act No.
1429, this procedure was cost-free during the period 2011-2014 for firms registering for the first
time.
Once a business has received its taxpayer identification number, it is registered with the DIAN.
However, this does not necessarily mean that it is liable for taxes. Small firms, such as those included
in our sample, have to pay income taxes based on their income level, but, under Act No. 1429, small
firms are exempted from paying income taxes for the first two years after registration regardless of
their income level. Additionally, under the legally mandated Simplified Regime, the small firms
included in our experiment did not have to pay value-added taxes.
A firm’s business license is like a person’s ID number. It is evidence that the firm exists and is
authorized to engage in legal transactions with other firms and with the State. Every year, firms
must renew their business licenses before March 31st by paying a fee to the local chamber of
commerce; the amount of that fee depends on the value of their assets. Under Act No. 1429,
between 2011 and 2014, firms renewing their licenses for the first time have to pay just 50% of the
usual fee; the second time around, they pay 75% of the usual fee, and it is only after the third year
of their registration that they have to pay the full amount. In 2013, the renewal cost ranged from
US$ 17 for firms whose asset value was less than US$ 650, to US$ 844 for firms with assets valued
at more than US$ 284 million.3 The taxpayer identification card must be renewed only when the
firm has changed its line of business or activity, and the renewal is free of charge.
Additionally, in order to operate formally, a firm must pay labor taxes. However, here again, under
Act No. 1429, for the first two years firms are exempt from paying these payroll taxes. These
provisions created an ideal experimental environment for our study of the effect that the
elimination of fixed costs has on firms’ decision to operate formally, since, in the short-run, firms

were exempted from paying taxes.4 In addition, given the unusual system put in place for the
renewal of business licenses, although firms did not have to incur any of the administrative fixed
costs of registration if they renewed their licenses, they did need to choose to remain in the formal
sector one year after their initial decision.


3. Interventions

The CCB designed two programs to promote the formalization of small informal firms in Bogotá.
Both interventions had been conducted previously by the CCB in other outlying districts of the city.
ECON ESTUDIO partnered with the CCB to design a system for evaluating these types of initiatives
based on a randomized control trial for the two interventions, which focused on: (1) giving precise
information about the costs and benefits of formalization and the procedure involved in obtaining
a business license; and (2) reducing the non-monetary costs of the registration process. In addition,
as mentioned earlier, Act No. 1429 reduced the initial registration costs by establishing that the
registration process would be free of cost for small firms that were registering for the first time and
by exempting firms from paying taxes for the first two years.


Firms were randomly assigned to the target groups for the two interventions or to a control group.
One of the interventions consisted of workshops run by CCB instructors. The CCB invites informal-
sector entrepreneurs to these workshops so that it can provide them with information about the
advantages and disadvantages of operating formally. It also provides information about the
registration process. Workshops of this type had never been offered before in the area of Bogotá
where the firms in our sample are located, and the CCB agreed not to hold any additional workshops
there until after our study was completed. The workshops that took place during our study were
held at the local CCB office in Restrepo, which was close to the firms included in our sample.

The workshop included: (1) a description of what formality in Colombia entails; (2) a discussion of
the advantages of operating in the formal sector, including the possibility of doing more and better
business with other formal-sector firms, of attending free training courses and of receiving
assistance from the CCB to improve the way in which the business was being managed; (3)
instructions about how to navigate the registration process; and (4) examples of successful firms
that started out in the informal sector but then moved into the formal sector of the economy.

The workshop lasted two hours and then allowed for additional time to provide more information
about the registration process to interested entrepreneurs. The person in charge of providing this
information to the entrepreneurs then contacted them by telephone in order to arrange a meeting
at the CCB to start off the registration procedure. This follow-up support began at the time that the
entrepreneur expressed interest in registration after the workshop and ended when the firm
obtained its business license.




4 Under the terms of Act No. 1429, during the first two years, firms are exempted from paying both labor and
income taxes. Thereafter, they benefit from a gradated scale of reductions. Firms do not have to pay the total
amount of the corresponding taxes until six years after their registration.
A personalized letter, signed by the CCB, inviting the selected entrepreneurs to the workshop was
mailed to them, and this was followed up by a telephone call in order to confirm their attendance
at the workshop and their contact information. The calls were made in two stages: the first in
October and November 2011, and the second in January and February 2012.

The second intervention consisted of personalized visits to interested firms by CCB agents who gave
them the same information that was imparted at the workshop and assisted them with the
registration process if they wished to have that type of support. As is also true of the workshop, this
kind of program is a regular activity of the CCB. The firms included in our sample had never received
these kinds of visits, however, and an arrangement had been made with the CCB not to make such
visits again until the experiment was over. The CCB-trained agents visited entrepreneurs after
having phoned them and, if they agreed, setting a date and time for the visit. The CCB does not send
agents to visit entrepreneurs unless they agree to meet with a CCB agent during the initial phone
call. After the first visit, which is for information purposes only, CCB agents return only to the firms
that agree to register.

Throughout the rest of this discussion, all the firms that were assigned to the first or the second
treatment will be designated as Intention-to-Treat Group No. 1 or No. 2 (ITT1 and ITT2, respectively).
Similarly, all the firms that agreed to participate in the first or second treatment will be designated
as T1 or T2, respectively.



4. Experimental Design
4.1. Experimental Sample
EE conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of their interventions. The study
took place in the south of Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia, which has a large concentration of
small businesses. Because no frame of reference was available that could be used to identify which
firms should be included in the baseline sample, we started with one neighborhood, Restrepo, in
the center of the locality of Antonio Nariño. In October 2010, a group of research assistants went
door-to-door to screen firms by asking entrepreneurs some basic questions that would help them
to identify informal-sector firms that could be included in the baseline sample.
The objective was to identify firms that had not taken any steps to initiate the formalization process.
In order to obtain a large sample, the number of firms surveyed was expanded by including areas in
concentric circles surrounding Restrepo, while keeping that neighborhood in the center of the circle.
More firms than we expected said that they were operating formally: from a sample of 7,871, only
2,099 admitted that they did not have any type of registration or said that they had not completed
the second stage of the formalization procedure (i.e., they did not have a current business license).
Our baseline sample was thus made up of these 2,099 firms. The baseline survey was collected in
October, 2010.
However, when we cross-checked our baseline records with the official records of the CCB, we
realized that some entrepreneurs who had said that they did not have a current business license
actually did have one. These firms were removed from the sample, leaving a total of 1,927 informal-
sector firms that did not have a business license and had fewer than 10 employees (thus fitting the
definition of microenterprises set out in the Microenterprise and Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprises Act of Colombia. These firms are sited in seven localities in south and central Bogotá,
and 30% of them are located in the Restrepo neighborhood of Antonio Nariño.


4.2. Business Characteristics
The firms included in the baseline sample have the following characteristics: 59.3% of them have
only one employee, 25.4% have two employees and just 6.8% have four or more employees. Most
of them (71.7%) have been operating for less than 10 years; 63.5% of the firms are retail firms, 14.1%
are hotels and restaurants, 12.8% are manufacturing industries and the rest (9.7%) provide other
types of services. Most of them are located in shops (71%) or in other fixed locations (20.6%); 7.4%
of them are located in the entrepreneur’s house and the rest are located in a factory or office. The
premises of 65% of the firms are quite small (less than 10 m2); 96.7% of the firms do not have
branches, 2.4% are a branch of another business and 0.8% are the main branch. In 25.2% of all cases,
the entrepreneur owns the property where the business is located.
In all, 96% of the firms have total assets amounting to less than Col$ 85.5 million at 2011 prices (US$
442,000)5 and 2.5% have assets of more than Col$ 257.5 million at 2011 prices (US$ 1,350,000).6 In
terms of sales, 13% report monthly sales of less than one minimum legal monthly wage (MLMW),7
29.2% report sales of between one and three MLMW, and 34.4% report sales of between three and
nine MLMW. Most firms report profits per month of less than two MLMW (79.7%); 9.7% report
monthly profits of between two and three MLMW, and only 10.4% report profits of more than three
MLMW. A total of 65.5% do not keep any type of accounting records; 29% have a log book in which
they register their operations; and 3% state they that use some other type of accounting system.
Only 2.3% say that they keep formal accounting records. A full 76% of the firms do not give any type
of receipt to their clients; 7.3% give a receipt; and only 16.7% bill clients after the transaction is
completed.
Some of these statistics can be compared with the results from a 2010 nationwide survey conducted
by the National Statistics Department (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística
(DANE)) of Colombia. This survey includes only firms with fewer than 10 employees. Table 1 shows
the results, which indicate that the firms in the baseline sample are smaller, in terms of both income
and number of employees, than the firms in the DANE sample. This difference is to be expected,
since the firms covered in the DANE survey include both informal and formal businesses, while the
firms in our baseline sample are all informal-sector businesses and, as attested to by the economic
literature, informal businesses tend to be smaller than formal enterprises (La Porta and Shleifer,
2008). The distribution of the types of activity is similar, although services are under-represented in
our sample relative to the DANE sample. This may be attributable to the fact that we restricted our
sample to firms in Bogotá, whereas the DANE survey covered the entire country.

 This was equivalent to 166.7 minimum legal monthly wages (MLMW) at 2011 prices converted to dollars using the exchange rate as of
December 31, 2011.

 This amount was equivalent to 500 minimum legal monthly wages (MLMW) at 2011 prices converted to dollars using the exchange rate
as of December 31, 2011.

    A minimum legal monthly wage was equivalent to Col$ 515,000 in 2011 (US$ 265 using the exchange rate for December 31, 2011).
4.3. Self-Reported Reasons for Operating Informally


Firm owners were asked what they knew about the registration process and what they believed to
be the costs and benefits of obtaining a taxpayer identification number and business license. A total
of 48% of the owners said that they knew about business licenses, and 54.4% said that they knew
about taxpayer identification numbers. Those who admitted knowing about taxpayer identification
numbers and business licenses were then asked why they did not have them. Regarding the
identification numbers, 32.8% said that they were “useless”; 27% said that they “could not afford
one because their business is too small or young”; and, 17.2% felt that they “do not have enough
time to obtain one”. As for business licenses, 21% responded that they were “useless” and another
21% said that “it would mean that you would have to pay taxes”; 18% felt that they “could not afford
one because my business is too small or young”; another 11.5% answered that they already had one
(which was false, according to the data obtained from the CCB).


With respect to the potential benefits of operating formally, the most frequent answers were
“avoiding penalties” (41.6%), “improving the image of the firm” (33.5%), “having greater growth
opportunities” (23.5%), “having more marketing opportunities” (20.1%), “having access to financial
markets” (19%) and “gaining access to inputs” (15%). Only 10% of the entrepreneurs answered that
operating formally does not have any benefits.


4.4. Experimental Group Balance
The sample of 1,927 firms was randomly divided into three groups. The first one, with 362 firms
(19% of the sample), was the control group and did not receive any treatment. The second group,
made up of 1,017 firms (53% of the total), was designated Group ITT1. The third group, composed
of 548 firms (28% of the total), was designated Group ITT2.
Tables 2 and 3 show the balance between each treatment group and the control group. In both
tables, we can see that, for almost all the variables, we do not reject the null hypothesis of no mean
differences among groups. There are only two exceptions in Table 2, where only two variables are
unbalanced (out of 59) at the 10% significance level. This provides evidence that the control group
and Group ITT1, on the one hand, and the control group and Group ITT2, on the other hand, were
statistically equivalent before the treatment.


5. Empirical Results

5.1. Take-up

Not every firm assigned to a treatment group accepted the invitation to join one of the treatment
groups. Possible reasons for this include the following: some firms may have closed down or moved
between the time that the baseline survey was conducted and the time that the invitations were
issued; they may have changed their telephone number; there may have been an error in the
number recorded during the survey; or they may have never received the letter of invitation sent
because there was a change of addresses in Bogota during the first half of 2011.

Of the 1,017 firms assigned to Group ITT1, 119 did not receive the invitation and 762 received the
invitation but did not accept the treatment. Therefore, from that group, only 136 firms actually
received Treatment One (T1). Similarly, of the 548 firms assigned to Group ITT2, 281 could not be
contacted in order to arrange a meeting with a CCB agent and 172 were contacted but did not agree
to a meeting. Thus, only 95 firms actually received Treatment Two (T2).

Table 4 presents the relationship between assignment to treatment and actual take-up, which can
be described as:



                    𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 − 𝑢𝑝𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛾 𝐼𝑇𝑇(𝑘)𝑖 + 𝛽 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 (1)


Where the dependent variable is a dummy that takes the value of 1 if firm i takes up the treatment
that it has been assigned to; 𝐼𝑇𝑇(𝑘)𝑖 is a dummy that takes the value of 1 if firm i belongs to Group
ITT1 or Group ITT2 (see columns 1, 2 and 3 in Table 4) or either of them separately (columns 4, 5
and 6 in Table 4), and 𝑋𝑖 is a set of control variables measured at baseline. Some specifications
include as regressors the age of the business and an interaction between the age of the business
and the corresponding intention–to-treat variable. All the specifications are presented with and
without variables that control for the characteristics of the firm (locality, area and sector of the
business, number of employees and average education level of the staff).

The likelihood of receiving the treatment can be gauged on the basis of a firm’s assignment to either
treatment (ITT) or to Treatment One (ITT1) or Treatment Two (ITT2). Specifically, being assigned to
either treatment raises the likelihood of take-up by 14 percentage points. On the other hand, being
assigned to Treatment One increases the likelihood of take-up by 15 percentage points, while being
assigned to Treatment Two increases the likelihood of take-up by 16 percentage points. These
results indicate that the effects of assignment to Group ITT1 and Group ITT2 on the likelihood of
take-up are similar.

In regard to the age of the business, columns 3 and 6 show that older firms are more likely to take
up treatment, while the interaction between a firm’s age and the intention-to-treat dummy is
significant only for Group ITT1.8



5.2 Intention-to-Treat Effects

We now analyze the official records of the CCB to determine which of the firms in our sample
became formal after the treatments. We found that some of the firms in each group did so: 9 firms
from the control group started to operate formally; of the firms in Group ITT1, 17 firms that were


8 Other specifications, including nonlinear terms for the firms’ age, have been considered, but the additional
terms were not statistically significant.
never contacted or that rejected the treatment and 12 firms that received the treatment started to
operate formally; and, finally, of the firms in Group ITT2, 17 firms that were never contacted or
rejected the treatment and 27 firms that received the treatment formalized.

Table 5 shows the impact of being assigned to treatment on the decision regarding formalization,
which can be described as follows:



                 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑡 𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛾 𝐼𝑇𝑇(𝑘)𝑖 + 𝛽 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 (2)



Columns 1 to 6 present the results of the model in which the dependent variable is a dummy that
takes a value of 1 if a firm operates formally in 2012; columns 7 to 12 provide the same information
in the event that a firm operates formally in 2013. Both dependent variables were obtained from
the CCB records. As in Table 4, the independent variables are assignment to any treatment (ITT), on
the one hand (columns 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9), or assignment to Treatment One (ITT1) or Treatment Two
(ITT2), on the other hand (columns 4, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12). Again, some specifications include
independent variables for the age of the business and an interaction between the age of the
business and the intention-to-treat variable. All specifications are presented with and without a set
of variables that control for the characteristics of the firms.

Being assigned to any treatment raises the likelihood of formalization by 2.1 or 2.9 percentage
points in 2012, depending on the specification. However, when we evaluate the impact of each
treatment separately, we find that assignment to Treatment One has no effect on the likelihood of
formalization. On the other hand, assignment to Treatment Two has an effect of 5.5 or 6 percentage
points in 2012, depending on the specification. Yet, one year later, in 2013, none of the treatments
had any effect on the decision to formalize.

All the specifications provide evidence that the age of the business is not significant in terms of the
decision to formalize, regardless of which intention-to-treat group the firm was in.

Although some firms from every group have formalized, more of the firms from Group ITT2
formalized after the treatment. However, in order to ascertain whether the firms from that group
formalized because of the treatment, it is important to determine whether the formal firms from
that group actually received Treatment Two. Table 6 shows that more firms from Group T2
formalized after the treatment and, specifically, that 4.9% of the firms that were assigned to Group
ITT2 formalized after the treatment. This percentage is higher than the percentage of firms from
other groups that formalized (2.9% for Group ITT1; 1.1% for Group T1; 2.5% for the control group).



5.3 The Effects of Receiving Treatment

Table 7 shows the impact that receiving any of the treatments has on the decision to operate
formally. We rely on an instrumental variables (IV) identification strategy where we instrument the
treatment variable with the assignment of treatment (ITT). This IV strategy provides evidence about
the causal relationship between the treatment and the formalization decision. Specifically, we
estimate the following system:



                                𝑇(𝑘)𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛿 𝐼𝑇𝑇(𝑘)𝑖 + 𝜃 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜈𝑖 (3)
                                                      ̂𝑖 + 𝛽 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 (4)
                     𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛾 𝑇(𝑘)



Where regressions (3) and (4) are the first and second stages of the 2SLS estimator of the local
average treatment effect. As in Table 5, we present different specifications for the different
dependent variables (2012 or 2013).



The results indicate that receiving any treatment (TT) raises the likelihood of formalization during
the next year by 14 or 20 percentage points, depending on the specification. However, this effect is
derived entirely from the second treatment. If we evaluate each treatment separately, we find that
the workshop (Treatment One) had no effect on the formalization decision. In contrast, receiving
visits from CCB agents (Treatment Two) raised the likelihood of formalization by 30, 32 or 37
percentage points, depending on the specification. Once again, there was no effect exerted by any
of the treatments in the following year (2013) and, for all the specifications, the age of the business
was not significant in terms of the likelihood of formalization.

These tables yield two important results. First, the workshops are ineffective in raising the likelihood
of formalization. In contrast, the CCB agents’ visits increased the likelihood of formalization. There
are several possible explanations for this differential result. One possibility is that Treatment Two is
more effective than the workshops. Another alternative could be that the firms that decided to take
up Treatment Two are different from the ones that received Treatment One. Also, obviously, the
real reason could be a combination of these two possibilities. However, we do not have sufficient
experimental variability to determine which of these options is an accurate explanation of why
Treatment Two increased the likelihood of formalization while Treatment One did not. Table 8
shows a comparison of the groups that self-select into receiving Treatment One and Treatment Two
that may be useful in determining whether there were any significant differences between the
groups before the treatment.

As Table 8 shows, firms that received Treatment Two have been in business for a longer period of
time, have higher asset values, profits and investments, and belong to higher socioeconomic strata.9
Thus, firms with these characteristics seem to have been more predisposed to take up Treatment
Two. This result could explain why Treatment Two had an effect on firms’ formalization decisions
while Treatment One did not. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences in the
treatments themselves are what made one treatment more effective than the other.


9 In Colombia, socioeconomic strata are area classifications on a scale from 1 to 6 (where 1 represents the
lowest-income area and 6 the highest). Based on this classification, the lower strata (1 and 2) receive subsides
for public services, while the higher strata (5 and 6) have to pay taxes to fund them.
Another important result is that Treatment Two influenced the decision to operate formally only in
the first year after treatment; the following year, when newly formalized firms had to renew their
license, the treatment had no effect on the formalization outcome variable. In other words, firms
that were persuaded to formalize after the treatment were operating informally again in 2013. This
result indicates that the types of treatments studied in this paper do not have a sustained effect. It
is important to note that this result was not generated by decisions on the part of control-group
firms to formalize a year after the treatment, thereby “catching up” with the outcome for the
treatment group, but rather by the decision of formalized firms not to renew their legal certification
(see Figure 1).

This result provides evidence that, at least in Colombia, the fixed costs of formalization are not what
prevents firms from operating in the formal sector of the economy. Even when firms are already
operating formally, they sometimes decide to return to the informal sector. Thus, this choice must
be based on other types of margins. This result backs up the results of De Mel et al. (2008 and 2013),
which indicate that firms remain informal, not because of burdensome entry regulations that deter
them from operating formally, but rather because they perceive the benefits of operating formally
as being quite modest at best. It is important to recall that, for those firms that registered for the
first time after the experimental Act No. 1429 had exempted them from paying taxes during the first
two years and from paying the full fee for renewing their business licenses, the costs of remaining
formal during 2013 were extremely low. This, in turn, suggests that firms perceive the benefits of
formality as being so modest that, even when the costs of continuing to operate formally have been
greatly reduced, they nonetheless prefer to return to the informal sector.



6. Conclusions

In most developing countries, policymakers are concerned about the extent of informal economic
activity and its consequences. Although there are several factors that could affect the size of the
informal sector in equilibrium (Galiani and Weinschelbaum, 2012), ever since the work of De Soto
(1989), a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the burden represented by fixed formal-sector
entry costs. While there is an ample body of literature on the evaluation of the costs and benefits
of formality, there is much less experimental evidence regarding the impact of fixed costs on the
decision to operate formally.
This paper analyzes the impact of the elimination of initial registration fixed costs on the decision of
informal firms to operate formally in Colombia. We rely on a randomized control trial (RCT) strategy
for evaluating the effectiveness of two types of interventions which the CCB conducts (workshops
and meetings with CCB agents). These two interventions reduce the fixed costs of registration by:
(1) giving precise information about the costs and benefits of formalization and the procedure for
obtaining a business license (matricula mercantil), and (2) reducing the non-monetary costs of the
registration process. In addition, Act No. 1429 reduced initial registration costs by establishing that
the registration process was to be cost-free for small businesses that were registering for the first
time and by exempting such firms from paying taxes for the first two years. Thus, the CCB’s
elimination of all the transaction costs associated with registration as a formal-sector enterprise and
the entry into force of Act No. 1429, which did away with initial registration fees for such firms,
provided us with an ideal natural experiment to use in studying the effects of the elimination of
initial fixed costs on firms’ decisions as to whether to operate formally or to remain in the informal
sector.


We have two important results to report. First, while the workshop treatment had no effect on
formalization decisions, meetings with CCB agents raised the likelihood that a business would begin
to operate formally by 5.5 percentage points for the population of all the firms that were invited to
participate at random (in other words, this is the intention-to-treat parameter) and by 32
percentage points for the firms that accepted the invitation (in other words, this is the local average
treatment effect). Second, and very interestingly, the effect of the treatment did not persist over
time. After a year of formal operation, both effects disappeared. What it is more, this was not the
result of decisions by firms in the control group to formalize and thus “catch up” with the others,
but was instead a reflection of the fact that formalized firms decided not to renew their licenses.
This is very interesting, since it suggests that some of the firms that experiment with formality do
not find it sufficiently beneficial to remain in the formal sector even when they do not have to pay
taxes and only have to pay 50% of the usual fee for renewing their license.
These results indicate that substantially reducing the fixed costs of operating formally does not play
a key role in firms’ formalization choices, since it has no lasting effect on their decision. Specifically,
firms choose to be formal when it is cost-free but, the following year, when they are faced with a
small monetary cost, many of them decide to return to the informal sector. This paper thus
corroborates the results of De Mel et al. (2013), since it suggests that firms remain informal, not
because burdensome entry costs deter them from operating formally, but rather because they
perceive the benefits of formality to be modest at best.
