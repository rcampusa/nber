                                           ABSTRACT

We examine whether examiners were informed and contributed to the health of the banking
sector. Information included quantitative information that was eventually made public,
quantitative information that remained private, and subjective information dependent on the
examiner’s production of additional, “soft” information that informed examiner assessments of
the quality of bank assets and management. All three types of information were useful for
gauging the condition of the bank, and affected bank behavior, including a publicly observable
signal (skipping a dividend payment). Participants in the market for bank liabilities reacted to this
signal in ways that promoted market discipline.

1. Introduction

        The supervision and examination of commercial banks by trained examiners is a key
component of efforts by regulatory authorities to promote the health and stability of the financial
sector. Nonetheless, the impact that examiners have is not well understood, in part because of
the confidentiality of the process and of the outcomes. Previous work has found that
examinations produce useful information about bank condition, but has offered only modest
insights into the mechanisms at work. Some studies find that bank examiners collect valuable
private information, which inform regulatory ratings of bank health, which are useful in
forecasting asset prices and changes in the condition of the bank (Berger and Davis 1994;
DeYoung, Flannery, Lang, and Sorescu 1998, Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hirtle, and Lucca 2016). These
studies, however, do not provide evidence about whether and how this information is used by
supervisors or markets to affect bank behavior. 1 Other studies have found that banks subject to
more intensive examinations tend to have lower loan delinquency rates (Rezende and Wu 2014;
Hirtle, Kovner, and Plosser 2016), but the mechanism by which this happens remains unclear.

        In this paper, we are able to use detailed records of bank examinations to provide insights
into the types of information possessed by the examiner and illuminate how that information was
used to influence the actions taken by the bank. The bank examination records we use are from
the examinations of National banks by examiners in the United States Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) during the National Banking Era (1863-1913) which are publicly
available in the National Archives. Looking at these reports allows us to see the sorts of
information that the examiners were collecting and observe how the examiners put together
different pieces of information to arrive at an overall assessment of the condition of the bank and
make their recommendations. Moreover, by observing sequential examination reports, we are
also able to observe the response by banks to the recommendations of the examiners.

        The National Banking Era was the first time that widespread and systematic use of bank
examiners was employed in the U.S. Despite periodic panics that would temporarily close large
parts of the banking system, the failure rate of National banks was fairly low and comparable to
that of the modern era. The analysis here sheds light on whether the examiners had a role in

1Flannery, Hirtle and Kovner (2017) show that stress test results influence market perceptions of banks,
providing evidence of a likely synergy between regulatory and market discipline.

                                                     1
keeping the bank failure rate low. There is little existing evidence about the effectiveness of
National bank examinations. In his Annual Reports, the Comptroller of the Currency, the head
of the OCC, praised examiners, but also call for improvements in the examination process (1887,
1889, 1891). Crays (1941) argues that the bank examiners during this period paid close attention
to the health of banks in order to protect the payment system. White (1983) notes that the
National banks had a much better reputation than state banks, in part because of the examination
process; but he also notes that the policy of the time of paying examiners based on the number of
banks that they examined may have reduced the incentive to conduct thorough and high quality
examinations. Moreover, in 1892, there were nearly 3,800 National banks to be examined and
41 examiners. As each examiner had to examine over 90 banks, on average, they would have
needed to conduct their investigations at a fairly rapid pace and it is not certain how thorough
they would have been able to be.

       From an analytical standpoint, the examination process during this time period has some
desirable features. First, banks were examined roughly once each year irrespective of their prior
observed condition, which mitigates some of the endogeneity concerns that arise in modern
studies where troubled banks tend to be examined more frequently than other banks. Second,
one of the typical disciplinary recommendations by examiners was that the bank suspend the
payment of dividends. Such an action was publically observable. Thus, we are able to study the
impact of having some information about the results of the examination revealed to the market
(albeit imperfectly, as there were other reasons that banks may have opted to skip paying
dividends).

       We start our analysis by considering the sorts of information generated by the
examination process. We categorize this information as being either quantitative information
that the examiner was required to collect, or soft information based on the judgment and skill of
the examiner. These two types of information reflect different aspects of the examination
process. Quantitative information would not necessarily require an expert to obtain it. For
instance, examiners were asked to state whether the president of the bank had to post a
performance bond and to provide the value of loans that met a statutory definition of being
delinquent. In contrast, to be useful, soft information in the report requires expertise on the part
of the examiner. For instance, the examiners were asked to comment on whether the


                                                  2
management was capable, whether the board of directors was exercising oversight, and whether
loans were adequately secured. This information may have been valuable in evaluating the
health of the bank, but its production required training and judgment.

           As we consider the value of the information in the examination report, we recognize that
there were other sources of information about the health of banks. Five times a year, the
Comptroller required banks to file a report of condition covering basic balance sheet information
(the Call Report), and this report was also required to be published in a local newspaper. The
Comptroller also included one of these reports for each bank in his published annual report. The
information contained in these public balance sheets also presumably shed light on the condition
of the banks. A subset of the quantitative information in the examination report is the same as
the information disclosed to the public. Thus, we categorize the quantitative information in the
examination report as either publically observable information or as private information.

           A summary statistic of the examiner’s evaluation of the condition of the bank was the
estimated losses the bank was likely to incur on its assets. This loss estimate was central to the
examiner’s determination of whether to recommend that the bank be disciplined, such as by
requiring it to suspend the payment of dividends or write down the value of its capital. Using the
examination reports from 1892 for a sample of banks in larger cities in the South and West of the
United States, we decompose the estimated losses into three parts associated with (1) the
quantitative balance sheet that was made available to the public, (2) the quantitative information
only available in the examination report, and (3) the soft information residual, which we attribute
to the judgment of the examiner. We show that our residual is correlated with subjective
assessments reported in the examination report, such as whether, in the examiner’s opinion, the
management was “capable and prudent.”

           We then test whether these three components have predictive power for three bank
outcomes. 2 Our first outcome measure is whether the bank survived the panic of 1893, one of
the most severe stress events of the National Banking Era. The second measure is an indicator of
bank profitability between 1892 and 1894: the growth rate of surplus and undivided profits. The
third measure, the change between 1892 and 1894 in the ratio of other real estate owned


2   This methodology is similar to the one used by DeYoung, Flannery, Lang, and Sorescu (1998).

                                                         3
(typically collateral seized when a loan went bad) relative to assets, is an indicator of loan
performance.

        We find that all three component parts of estimated losses are useful for predicting our
outcome measures. Finding that the part of estimated losses attributable to public information is
informative confirms contemporary assessments (and recent academic research) that the holders
of bank liabilities (both depositors and other banks) found the information in the Call Report
useful for evaluating the health of the banks (Calomiris and Mason 1997, Calomiris and Mason
2003, Carlson 2005, DeYoung, Flannery, Lang, and Sorescu 1998, White 1984). Finding that
private quantitative data from the examination report has predictive power indicates that
examiners collected useful additional hard information during examinations, such as information
about assets, as well as measures of corporate governance choices (see also Calomiris and
Carlson 2016). Finally, that the residual soft information is informative indicates that the
examiner’s training and judgment were valuable for producing information.

        We are able to investigate whether individual examiners were particularly tough or easy.
We find that, in general, the examiners appear to have been fairly uniform in their translation of
balance sheet metrics into loss estimates. The loss estimates from the few examiners that were
either particularly easy or tough do not display significantly differential predictive power for
bank outcomes.

        Finally we look at whether the examiners were able to use their assessments about the
condition of the bank to take actions that promoted bank health and resiliency. The examiners
did not have many remedial recommendations available to them. One recommendation that they
did often make, if their loss estimate was sufficiently large, was for the bank to skip its dividend
payment and use the additional retained earnings to cover charge offs of bad loans. Even
controlling for other factors, we find that such a recommendation increased the likelihood that
the bank did skip its divided by 23 percent. Furthermore, banks for whom the examiner
recommended that dividends be skipped tended to charge-off losses to a greater degree than
other banks. 3


3
  Hirtle, Kovner, and Plosser (2016) find that modern banks that receive more regulatory scrutiny tend to have more
conservative loan loss provisioning practices. Thus, both their results and our results suggest that one channel
through which examiners played a role is through the managing of losses.

                                                         4
        In addition, it appears that the examination report may have provided a signal to the
public that could have been used to support market discipline. Banks that skipped paying a
dividend tended to pay higher rates for funds than other banks. If an unfavorable examination
report raised the likelihood that banks skipped paying a dividend and potentially increased
borrowing costs for the bank, then the examination process and market discipline would have
reinforced each other. 4 This signal, and the interaction with market discipline, is similar to the
findings of Flannery, Hirtle, and Kovner (2017) that bank equity prices respond to the news
contained in the modern Federal Reserve stress tests.

        Overall, our results indicate that the examiners in the National Banking Era were a
valuable part of the information collection process, both through their access to objective
information about assets and banking practices, and through their processing of soft information.
We also find that this information was used to discipline banks, and that regulatory discipline
(reflected in dividend suspension) had implications for additional market discipline.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data that we use in our
analysis, as well as the examination process that created the data. Section 3 discusses the
methodology that we use to evaluate the usefulness of different types of information available to
and provided by the examiners. Section 4 reports empirical results. In Section 5, we test
whether individual examiners differed in their toughness, and investigate whether those
differences mattered for the predictive content of their judgments. Section 6 describes how the
monitoring of the examiners was related to the discipline of poorly performing banks. Section 7
concludes.

2. Data

        The data we use come primarily from the examination reports prepared in the early 1890s
by the OCC examiners. The examination reports were quite detailed and, in this section, we
describe the parts of these reports that are salient for our analysis. We also use data from the
Reports of Condition or “Call Reports” from the same period and describe that information
briefly as well.


4
  There were other reasons why banks might not pay a dividend. For instance, newer banks tended to omit them in
favor of building up their surplus and undivided profits.

                                                       5
        Given that gathering information from examination reports for all national banks would
be prohibitively time consuming, we focus on a particular, and important, subset of National
banks in our analysis, namely banks located in important western and southern cities. We explain
the desirability of focusing on this group of banks in Section 2.2.

2.1. Primary data sources

        Examination reports were written by the field examiners hired by the OCC. The
information in these reports reflects the private information of the examiner after looking over
the books of the bank—typically over a two day period. The examination reports are a rich
source of information that cover many aspects of the operations of the National banks, including
the structure and quality of corporate ownership and governance, the distribution and quality of
the loan book, amounts of assets related to real estate, and the composition of liabilities. 5 Some
material the examiner collected was quantifiable, such as the value of loans for which real estate
served as collateral or whether there was a loan and discount review committee with at least one
board member who was not a manager. Other information was much more subjective, such as
requests for the examiner to comment on the “general character of loans” or whether the bank
officers were “capable, prudent, and of good reputation.”

        At the end of the report, the examiners were asked to provide a quantitative assessment of
the likely losses that the bank faced. The loss estimates could be related to loans that were
considered “bad” or were likely to have to be written down, or to problems with other assets,
such as an over-valued banking house or real estate that had been acquired when a borrower had
defaulted. Such assets generally were liquidated at less than the value at which they were carried
on the books. Based on these loss estimates, the examiner might recommend that the bank take
action to set aside resources to write-off bad assets, or if losses were severe, write down the
value of its capital.

        The second source of data is the Report of Condition, or “Call Report” which was a
report of the balance sheet of the bank provided to the OCC about five times a year. A copy of
each report was retained on site and the examiner could check this report against the books of the


5
 Calomiris and Carlson (2014) in particular provide a detailed summary of the contents of the Examination Reports
during this period. See also Robertson (1968) for more information on the examination process.

bank as well as use the information to compare against the current condition of the bank. 6 The
information in the call report was public. In fact, banks were required to publish some basic line
items from the call report in a local newspaper about the time it was sent to the Comptroller. In
his Annual Report, the Comptroller also included the call reports for all the national banks for
one of the five filing dates. This information was reportedly used by the public and other banks
to monitor the condition of individual banks and was considered useful information about the
health of the bank. Indeed, the information about the balance sheets of all individual banks in
the annual report was considered valuable enough that the Comptroller considered publishing
this volume twice a year (Comptroller of the Currency 1890).

         We are interested in how the information in these two sources is related to how the banks
fared in and after the Panic of 1893. Therefore, we (mainly) use the examination and call reports
that mostly closely precede the Panic. The Call Report is only available once per year and we
use the September 1892 Call report. For the examination report, we use the examination report
that started closest to, but not after, May 1, 1893 (just before the onset of the Panic).

2.2. The sample

         The sample consists of 205 national banks drawn from 37 cities. During this time,
National banks operated as “unit” banks with a single bank location. The cities include all the
reserve cities and a number of the larger cities in the Southern and Western part of the country. 7
We focus on this region because it was the most seriously affected during the Panic of 1893; this
event will provide a test of the value of the information collected by the examiners. Indeed,
nearly all the cities in our sample had at least one bank close during the panic. The banks in the
sample comprise all the National banks that were located in these cities that both filed a
September 1892 Call Report and had an examination report prior to May 1, 1893.

         The banks in the sample are generally comparable in size. They range from $200,000 in
assets to $8,000,000. Thus, the sample excludes the tails of the banking system, the largest



6
  It is noteworthy that examiners were also asked to verify the information provided on the call report. Doing so
ensured that the information being reported there was accurate and thus useful. We are not able to measure this
benefit, but it would be in addition to the other benefits noted elsewhere in the paper.
7
  Reserve cities were officially designated as such. Interbank deposits placed in the National banks located in
Reserve cities could be counted as part of the legal reserve of other national banks.

                                                          7
money center banks and small banks operating in small communities. Additionally, as the banks
in the sample are in either reserve cities or larger cities, they also likely had access to broadly
comparable ranges of business opportunities. Thus, the banks in the sample are generally
comparable to each other. It is important to note that our sample reflects a particular slice of the
banking system at the time, an important slice consisting of the institutions connecting the
periphery to the center, but a slice nonetheless.

2.3. The examination process

       Examiners were generally assigned to a region and in charge of reviewing the banks in
that region. We find that, when visiting a town, the examiners would typically look at several
banks. White (1983) points out that examiners were paid by the number of banks that they
examined and that the examiners had to pay their own expenses, which creates an incentive for
the examiners to minimize the number of days spent traveling. If the town had only a few banks,
then the examiner would look at them all. However, we also observe that, if the town had a more
substantial number of banks, perhaps six or more, then the examiners would generally break up
the examinations. He would typically examine several banks, then leave to look at banks
elsewhere, and return a few months later to examine the rest of the banks. The examinations
typically took two days, although they could be done in a single day or take as long as five days.

       As noted by White (2009), one concern about the process of looking at multiple banks in
a town at the same time is that once banks learned that at examiner was in town, they might have
“window dressed” their balance sheets to make the condition of the bank appear more favorable.
This could lead to biased comparisons among banks based on the sequence of examination. In
the Appendix, we consider this potential for window dressing bias and show that it does not
appear to be important, given that it was not visible in bank cash holdings (where it should be
particularly pronounced).

       We also considered whether examiner turnover might be endogenous to the severity of
examiners’ opinions. If so, it is conceivable that turnover could be associated with reduced
examiner discipline, which might bias comparisons of examinations across banks that does not
take account of such bias. In the Appendix, we consider this possibility, and find no evidence
that examiner turnover resulted from relatively negative examination reports.


                                                    8
3. Methodology

         In this section, we describe two methodological approaches to evaluate the usefulness of
the information collected by the examiners. We also describe in more detail the variables used in
the analysis.

3.1 Methodological approaches

         We are interested in whether the private information on the examination reports was
useful in assessing the condition of and prospects for the banks above and beyond the public Call
Report information available from the banks and the Comptroller’s office. In addition, we are
interested in whether both the quantifiable information in the examination report and the soft
information the examiner collected during his assessment of the bank are useful for forecasting
bank outcomes.

3.1.1 Decomposition approach

         The foundation of both approaches is the loss estimates provided by the examiner. These
estimates provided a numerical summary of the overall condition of the bank. The estimates
were central to supporting any recommendation the examiner might make about whether to
discipline the bank and to determining the particular type of discipline to impose (suspension of
dividends, capital write-down). Thus, the examiners presumably took considerable care when
making these estimates. 8

         We start our analysis by decomposing the loss estimates into the portions that can be
attributed to each of our three sets of information: the quantifiable information observable to the
public from the Call Report and bank location, the quantifiable information observed only by the
examiner that was contained in the examination report, and soft information the examiner. Here
we follow a similar procedure has been used elsewhere in the literature to extract the portion of


8
  Examiners were expected to have some knowledge of the quality of the local businesses to help them make these
evaluations and loss estimates. One examiner indicated that he was new to the city in which he was examining
banks and reported that he had sought out the local agent from Bradstreet’s, a private credit rating agency, to help
him evaluate the quality of the loan book. (Examiner report of the North Texas National Bank of Dallas, TX,
charter 3834, 3/2/1893).

                                                          9
quantitative ratings due to private information (DeYoung et al. 1998). The decomposition is done
by orthogonalizing the three sets of influences on the loss estimate. Orthogonalization permits us
to compare the relative importance of the three influences in our regression analysis. The
orthogonalization requires us to pick an ordering between the two quantitative influences, and we
believe it is natural to put the public information first in the ordering, which attributes any
covariation between the two to public information. This provides a conservative assessment of
the role of the examination process. 9

           In the first step of the orthogonalization, we regress the loss estimates on publicly
available information both balance sheet variables and location attributes:

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 + 𝜀𝜀                                     (1)

The predicted values from this regression are the part of losses that are attributed to public
information while the residual (ε) is the part of the loss estimate related to the private information
of the examiner (quantitative and soft) that is orthogonal to the public information.

           In the second step, we regress ε on the private quantitative information.

𝜀𝜀 = 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝜏𝜏                                                                                   (2)

The predicted values from this regression are the part of losses that are attributed to private
quantitative information while the residual (τ) represents the portion of losses that we attribute to
the examiner’s soft information. To be precise, our decomposition approach gives us:

9
 As a robustness check, we switched the order of orthogonalization to place the quantitative information from the
examination first. We continue to find that both sets of information are valuable and that there were only minor
changes in the relative importance of public vs. private information.

                                                                        10
          Having decomposed expected losses in this way, we then investigate whether any of the
component parts are related to the subsequent performance of the bank, either during the panic or
over the next two years.

Outcome = f (α 3 + β 4 L1 + β 5 L2 + β 6 L3 )                                                                                  (3)

If the loss estimates contain any information useful for forecasting the evolution of the condition
of the bank, then one or more of the three components should be associated with the subsequent
outcomes.

3.1.2 Direct prediction approach

          The above methodological approach we employ uses the information available to the
examiners to explore whether the examiner’s ex ante expectations of performance are related to
subsequent bank performance. An alternative (direct prediction) approach estimates the
relationship between the observable information of all kinds and performance measures with the
benefit of hindsight available to us as researchers to see whether the component of the loss
estimate attributed to the soft private information of the examiner (τ) is useful in predicting
outcomes as well as to determine the value of the data collected by the examiners. Here we
would estimate:

𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 = 𝑓𝑓(𝛾𝛾1 𝜏𝜏 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝛾𝛾3 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝛾𝛾4 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)   (4)

Thus we have two different approaches for assessing the value the soft information provided by
the examiners.

3.2 What variables should be informative?

          When considering the kinds of variables that we should expect to matter in our analysis,
and the context in which they will matter, it is helpful to think of risk at three levels: loan level
risk, asset level risk (of which a subset is loan level risk), and institution level risk (of which a
subset is asset level risk).

          The examiner was asked to estimate expected losses for the assets, not just the loans, of
the bank. To do so, they considered the riskiness of the loan book, which they observed directly.
They considered loan delinquencies and the adequacy of any collateral when estimating losses.

                                                                   11
Additionally, they might also have taken into account corporate governance practices (such as
the practices of the loan committee, if any) that could impact the riskiness of the loan book, such
as the strength of checks and balances embedded in the loan approval process. The examiners
would also have evaluated potential losses from other non-loan assets of the bank, such as the
bank building and furnishings, and the assets held by the bank that were acquired from
foreclosing on loans.

       In addition to asset losses, there are a variety of other variables that would be expected to
matter for some of the outcomes that we observe, which outsiders should find useful to consider
when evaluating the riskiness of the bank, even if these were not part of the examiners’ asset loss
estimates. An obvious example is the leverage of the bank. Leverage positively affects the
default risk of the bank; more leveraged banks should be more likely to fail in the event of a
given shock to the value of assets. In addition, leverage could be a sign of a bank’s willingness
to take risk, which outsiders might use as a signal of the otherwise unobservable riskiness of the
bank’s loan portfolio. However, because the examiners observe the loan portfolio directly and
are familiar with management practices of the bank, we expect that leverage would not be
especially helpful for them in predicting the asset losses of the bank. We include leverage and
other non-asset institutional level risk measures, such as deposit composition, in our regressions
of loss estimates just in case the examiner took some signal from them, but we do not expect
them to matter in those regressions.

       Our two procedures approach the value of soft versus quantitative information, and their
implications for bank outcomes, in different but complementary ways. Our decomposition
approach uses only examiner knowledge. This approach focuses on how outcomes are related to
risks that appear on the asset side of the balance sheet (loan level and asset level risk), as
perceived by the examiner. The alternative approach allows us to assess more broadly the value
of pieces of information ex post. It compares the value of subjective information against a
holistic picture of the bank’s failure risk (not just asset loss risk) and considers how failure risk
relates to different outcomes.

3.3 Variables




                                                  12
        We have three sets of information: public quantifiable information, which consists of
both call report data and location variables; private quantifiable information based on
quantifiable information in the examination reports; and private soft information where we do
not use any observable information. Here we describe the variables we construct for each of the
three sets.

3.3.1 Public quantifiable items from the call report

        We construct several variables from information reported in the Call Report. We consider
these to be both publicly observable and “hard” quantifiable information. The variables we use
have clear interpretations and many have been found to be associated with failure risk in prior
studies.

        The first of these variables is bank size, which we measure using the log of total assets.
Larger banks presumably can diversify loan risk better, and may have greater ability to pick
higher quality managers, and therefore, may have lower expected losses.

        A direct indicator of the quality of the assets of the banks available from the call report is
“other real estate owned,” which typically measures real estate acquired by a bank after a loan
went bad. We expect such loans to be predictive of higher expected losses. Another asset side
variable that we employ is the ratio of cash to assets. Cash holdings are riskless and thus reduce
asset default risk. They also reduce liquidity risk by enhancing the ability of the bank to meet
obligations as they come due. While not as riskless as vault cash, interbank deposits are also
fairly safe and liquid, so we include the ratio of interbank deposits to assets. Interbank deposits
might also provide a signal about risk preferences; Calomiris, Heider, and Hoerova (2017)
suggest that banks that hold more cash assets (especially when those cash assets are held in a
verifiable form outside the bank, such as interbank deposits) may be incentivized to manage loan
risk more conservatively.

        We also include variables related to the funding profile of the bank. These variables may
be relevant either because of their contribution to liquidity risk, or because their presence is
correlated with otherwise unobservable asset risks. Bills payable and/or rediscounts are higher
cost forms of funding and borrowing through these instruments was considered imprudent in



                                                  13
many cases. 10 Reliance on this funding source has been found by prior studies to predict bank
failure during the National Banking Era, as well as during subsequent periods (Calomiris and
Mason 1997, 2003, Carlson 2005). Bank reliance on this high cost source of funding may have
provided information about bank management or risk preferences, leading examiners to expect
higher asset losses even though there is no direct connection between this variable and asset
losses. For that reason, we add an indicator for whether the bank borrowed money in this way.
We also include the ratio of individual deposits to total liabilities. While it is not obvious
whether this variable would necessarily be linked to failure, the examiner might have considered
the role of individual depositors in funding base of the bank when estimating losses.

        Our final call report variable is the bank’s capital ratio, defined as the ratio of net
worth—capital, surplus, and undivided profits—to assets. As discussed above, while this
variable does not directly affect the asset risk of the bank, lower leverage may be correlated with
otherwise unobservable expected asset losses.

3.3.2 Public quantifiable items linked to bank demographics and location

        Various other bank attributes and locational factors would have been apparent to both the
examiners and the general public, and therefore, should be included as control variables. We
classify several control variables as publicly available information. Older banks might have
more experienced personal and be better run. We thus include the log of the age of the bank as
an observable attribute.

        The interbank deposits placed in other National banks located in reserve cities were
allowed to count toward National banks’ reserve requirements. Given their systemic importance,,
examiners may have subjected reserve city banks to greater scrutiny. We control for this
possibility by including an indicator variable for whether the National bank was located in a
reserve city. There is some indication from prior studies that banks located farther west tended
to behave differently (Calomiris and Carlson 2016), so we also control for the distance the city is
away from New York City, the center of the financial system.




10
  However, it was not uncommon for banks to resort to using these sources of funds during the harvest season. Use
of such borrowing for these purposes was generally understood to be less problematic.

                                                       14
       County population size also may have mattered; larger populations might contain more
lending opportunities, which might in turn have meant that banks could choose from a better
pool of potential borrowers. We therefore add a control variable to account for the (log of the)
county population. Similarly, the types of nearby lending opportunities might also have shaped
loss expectations. In particular, the large seasonal swings associated with agriculture, or the
potentially volatile nature of mining, may have been viewed as informative of asset risk by
examiners. Thus we include variables indicating the importance of agriculture in the state
economy and an indicator for whether the state had notable mining activities (at least $1 million
in gold or silver was mined in the state in 1891).

3.3.3 Private quantifiable items linked to the examination report

       The reports that the examiners filed with the Comptroller contained considerably more
information about the condition of the bank than was available through the Call Report. This
information, in combination with the examiner’s recommendations, could be used by the
Comptroller to determine whether to take disciplinary action against the bank, or could inform
decisions regarding the renewal of charters (during the National Banking Era, bank charters had
to be renewed every 20 years). There are a number of quantifiable items in the examination
report that the examiners might have used to inform their estimates of losses.

       As noted above, certain loans were specified as meeting a statutory definition of being
“bad.” For loans that were bad based on objective specifications, it did not take an expert to
determine whether the loans were problematic, although judgment was still necessary to estimate
expected losses. We use the share of total loans that consisted of these technically bad loans as
one private quantitative measure the examiner could have considered when forming loss
estimates.

       We also include ratios related to particular loan categories that were observed by the
examiner. Real estate loans were considered riskier loans and National banks were forbidden
from originating loans secured by real estate collateral. National banks were however, allowed
to take real estate collateral to secure previously existing debts. We therefore include the portion
of loans backed by real estate as another quantitative indicator the examiner may have
considered when estimating losses. Another type of loan listed on the examination report was


                                                 15
demand loans, which are loans that could be called for repayment at the discretion of the bank.
Comments by the examiner suggest that these were viewed as offering more liquidity to the bank
than time loans. It is possible that the examiner considered these loans of a different credit
quality, and also may have seen them as reducing liquidity risk.

        We also include variables related to the governance and operation of the bank, which
prior work has shown may matter for risk taking. One governance variable is the share of the
bank’s equity owned by managers in the top three officer positions (president, vice-president,
and cashier). Calomiris and Carlson (2016) find that banks for which the three top officers
owned a greater proportion of bank shares tended to be more conservatively run institutions. The
number of shares owned by these individuals was listed in the examination report, and the total
number of shares could be observed easily because total shares equal the paid-in-capital of the
bank divided by one-hundred. 11 We also considered governance measures that indicate whether
non-management shareholders were monitoring the management. These include whether the
president needed to post a performance bond (as a device for managing fraud), the log of the
number of meetings the board held each year (based on whether the examiner whether the board
met weekly, monthly, semi-annually, etc.), and whether there was an independent discount
committee that monitored the loans. All three of these items were specifically required to be
stated in the examination report. 12

        Finally, we include two other measures related to the liabilities of the banks. First, one
item described in the examination report was whether the bank issued certificates of deposit “for
the purpose of borrowing money.” These were CDs that were issued to other banks and secured.
They paid higher rates of interest than interbank deposits, but lower rates of interest than bills
payable. Comments from the examiners make it clear that these CDs often were a close
substitute for bills payable or rediscounts, but structured in such a way as to avoid being required
to be reported as one of those more suspect items. Coffin (1890) provides a dim view on the use



11 In a few instances, the book value of the shares was not equal to one hundred, but these were noted in the

call report.
12
   Calomiris and Carlson (2016) use the sum of five indicators based on these pieces of information as well as
whether the cashier had to post a performance bond and the share of the board of directors that consisted of non-
managers. We use individual governance characteristics here as the examiner may have put different weights on
different attributes than the equal weighting used by Calomiris and Carlson.

                                                        16
of these certificates as a signal of bank risk. Thus, having information on the use of such
liabilities by the bank might be indicative of riskier behavior.

       Second, the examination reports provide more detailed information regarding the
composition of individual deposits than the call report. Recent research, such as Ramierez and
Zandbergen (2013), have found that individuals’ checking deposits were a more stable funding
source during crisis episodes than other deposits. It is unclear whether contemporaries would
have made this inference, nevertheless, we include the ratio of checking deposits to total
individual deposits as another indicator available from the examination report that is potentially
related to the riskiness of the bank.

3.3.4 Outcome variables

       We focus on three outcome variables. The first is whether or not the bank closes—
defined as fails, suspends temporarily, or otherwise ceases operation—between the September
1892 call report (or most recent examiner report) and the end of 1893, after the panic. The use of
this broad measure of closure to measure the failure of banks does not distinguish among many
possible definitions of “failure.” A bank could fail (be liquidated by regulators) if the regulators
decide to take possession of the bank and appoint an outside receiver to liquidate the institution;
this typically occurred if losses were expected to exceed the net worth of the bank. A voluntary
liquidation would occur if the owners of the bank decided to unwind the bank without the
regulators appointing a receiver; this could occur if the bank had incurred losses that were not so
severe as to completely wipe out equity. Potentially, a bank could also be voluntarily liquidated
if the owners simply decided that the bank was no longer expected to be profitable, although
there is not much sign of this in our sample. Finally, a bank could suspend operations
temporarily. This might occur if there was a “run” on the bank in which liability holders sought
to withdraw more cash than the bank had available, forcing the bank could shut its doors. If the
owners desired to reopen, the examiners were sent to evaluate the bank to verify that its
condition was generally sound and then would give permission.

       Rather than try to distinguish among these various cases of bank “failure.” we focus
simply on whether any of these events occurred. In our sample, 16 banks were placed in
receivership, 7 were voluntarily liquidated, and 35 suspended temporarily but reopened. In


                                                 17
general, higher loss estimates of any sort should be associated with an increased likelihood of
closure.

       The other two outcome variables capture bank performance following the panic. These
measures, therefore, are observed conditional on the bank having survived the panic. The first is
the change in the ratio of other real estate owned relative to assets between the September 1892
call report and October 1894 call report. As other real estate owned is associated with the
seizing of collateral once a loan has gone bad, a change in this ratio is indicative of an
improvement or deterioration in the health of the bank’s loan portfolio. We expect that the
change in other real estate owned will be relatively greater for banks with higher expected losses.

       The last outcome variable is the percent change in the bank’s surplus and undivided
profits between the 1892 and 1894 call reports. These balance sheet items reflect the retained
earnings of the bank. An increase in these items could be a sign of a more profitable bank. The
existence of current retained earnings also affected banks’ ability to write off bad loans without
reducing surplus and undivided profits. If current those profits were insufficient to cover loan
losses, then the bank would write-down its surplus and undivided profits to cover write-offs of
bad assets. Higher expected losses would be linked to both higher write-offs and lower
accumulations of income, so we expect a negative association between the growth of surplus and
undivided profits and different measures of expected losses.

       Definitions of all variables appear in Table 1. Summary statistics are reported in Table 2.

4. Analysis of the value of examiner private information

       Here we present our baseline results as well as a variety of robustness exercises.

4.1 Analysis using the decomposition approach

       Beginning with the decomposition approach, we estimate equation 1 to analyze how
publicly available information contributed to the examiner estimates of total losses. These
results are reported in Table 3. The adjusted R2 of the regression indicates that more than one-
third of the variation in loan loss estimates can be explained by publicly observable information.
Only one of the balance sheet variables from the call report is statistically significant; the ratio of
other real estate owned (OREO) is strongly and positively related to estimated losses. Given that

                                                  18
these assets were the result of loans that went bad, this result is not surprising. Locational
attributes (country and state characteristics and the reserve city indictor) played a notable role in
determining the examiner loss estimates. As expected, we find that banks in reserve cities
tended to have lower estimated losses than other institutions. Examiners appear to have had a
more positive views of mining activities as banks in areas where mining was more prevalent
tended to have lower expected losses. Agricultural activity appears to have been more suspect as
examiners tended to increase estimates of expected greater losses at banks in areas where
agriculture was more important. Estimated losses also tended be higher in more populous areas.

        The role of non-public quantifiable factors available from the examination report in
explaining the part of losses not explained by public information (equation 2) is shown in Table
4. 13 The adjusted R2 is 0.13 which indicates that the variables reflecting private quantitative
information explain an appreciable share of the residual from the first stage. Banks that had
more loans secured by real estate were expected to have higher losses. Additionally, banks that
funded themselves with certificates of deposit issued to other banks were also expected to have
higher losses. Observing the use of such liabilities seems to have led the examiner to be more
skeptical of the quality of the assets the bank was reporting. Banks that made use of formal
corporate governance tools, such as having an independent loan review committee or requiring
the president of the bank to post a performance bond, were considered by the examiner to have
lower expected losses, ceteris paribus. There is one puzzling result: banks for which the board
met more frequently were expected to have higher asset losses; this finding suggests that
involvement of the directors may have been viewed as a response to greater risk.

        The residual from the second stage is our measure of the loss estimate that is related to
the soft information of the examiner that is used in his assessment of the condition of the bank.
To assure ourselves that we are in fact capturing something associated with the expertise and
perceptiveness of the examiner, we examine how this residual is related to some of the
characterizations made in the examination report that illustrate aspects of “soft” information.
One useful characterization is whether the management was viewed by the examiner as capable
and efficient, both subjective ideas. For the 25 banks for which the examiner had concerns about


13The standard errors from this regression are determined using a bootstrap approach that estimates
equations 1 and 2 jointly for 500 repetitions.

                                                    19
the capability and efficiency of the management, the average residual is 0.013. At the other
banks, the residual has an average value of -0.002. (The difference is significant at the 1 percent
level.) The higher residual at banks were the examiner had concerns about the quality of the
management is consistent with the idea that the residual is capturing some of the “soft”
information from the examiner about the quality of management.

         Overall these results suggest that both the public and private quantitative information
were incorporated into the loss estimates provided by the examiner, but that there was still
substantial room for soft information to play a role in the examiner’s loss estimate.

         We next turn to testing whether the three decomposed parts of the loss estimate are useful
in predicting the outcome measures. The results of regressing the three outcome measures on the
loss estimate components are shown in Table 5. 14 The results confirm that all three components
contributed to loss forecasts. The coefficients on all three components have the expected signs in
all cases. Higher expected losses raise the likelihood of failure, reduce the growth rate of surplus
and undivided profits, and are associated with having an increase in other real estate owned on
the bank’s books. 15

         We find that that the loss estimate that we attribute to “soft” private information has
useful predictive power. A one standard deviation increase in the expected losses attributable to
soft private information (.027) increased the likelihood that the bank closed by about 11
percentage points; thus the effect is economically large. We also find that the loss estimate
based on soft information helps predict the future performance of the bank. A one standard


14
   The standard errors in Table 5 are determined using a bootstrap approach that estimates the first, second, and third
stage jointly (estimation of equations 1, 2, and 3) for 500 repetitions. In each of these repetitions, we impose the
constraint that the number of failed banks is not too low, which would cause problems in estimating the bank
closure regressions, nor too high, which would cause problems estimating the regressions involving the
change in net worth and change in other real estate owned. For the closure regressions, we report raw probit
coefficients in the Table to facilitate comparison with the bootstrapped standard errors while the text describes the
marginal effects.
15
   We examined how much the three components contribute to the R2 of these regressions. We find that the public
information was most informative and accounted for about 80 percent of the pseudo R2 of the failure regression,
about 35 percent of the adjusted R2 of the change in new worth regression, and about 45 percent of the change in
OREO regression. Soft information was also fairly informative and accounted for about 45 percent of the
explanatory part of the change in OREO regression and about 10 percent of the overall explanatory power for the
other two regression. Private quantitative information contributes about half of the explanatory power for the
regression involving the change in net worth and about 10 percent of the explanatory power for the other two
regressions.

                                                          20
deviation increase in this type of estimated loss is associated with a reduction in the growth of
surplus and undivided profits of 28 percentage points (a bit less than one standard deviation) and
boosts the change in other real estate owned by about 1 percentage point (about half a standard
deviation).

         The part of total expected losses attributed to private quantifiable information has
predictive power for the two outcome measures that are available for banks that survive the
panic, but has less predictive power for closure around the time of the panic. A one standard
deviation increase in this component (0.012) is associated with a reduction in the growth of
surplus and undivided profits of 18 percentage points and with a boost in the change in other real
estate owned by .6 percentage points (about one-fourth of a standard deviation). Thus, the size
of the effects are slightly less than for the part of losses due to soft information.

         The part of total expected losses that are attributable to public information and location
effects are particularly valuable for predicting closure. Here a one standard deviation increase in
this measure (0.024) is associated with an increase in the probability of failure of 16 percentage
points. The connection to the subsequent change in retained earnings is also quite strong. The
coefficient implies that a one-standard deviation increase in this component of expected losses
reduces growth in in surplus and undivided profits by 28 percentage points. Interestingly, we
find no relationship between this part of estimated losses and the change in other real estate
owned.

         These results show that the soft information provided by the examiners was quite useful
in assessing the health of the bank. The soft information appears to be statistically related to our
three outcome measures and has comparably sized effects as the other components of the loss
estimate.

4.2 Analysis using the direct prediction approach

         We now turn to our alternative (direct prediction) framework and test whether the
component of losses attributable to soft information has predictive power for various outcomes
after accounting for the public and private quantifiable information directly. The results of
regressing our outcome measures on the component of losses associated with soft information,



                                                  21
the quantitative indicators of bank condition, and locational attributes are shown in Table 6. 16
The first column of the Table displays results when the outcome variable is closure during the
Panic of 1893, the second column has results for when the outcome is the growth of surplus and
undivided profits, and the third column reports results when the outcome is the change in other
real estate owned. 17

         The results in these tables support the view that soft information provides important
information about the condition of the bank. The component of losses we attribute to the
examiner’s judgment continues to forecast the outcome variables despite the fact that the
quantitative variables are now able to forecast directly the outcome variables, rather than acting
through their impact on the examiner’s expected losses. The sizes of the soft information
coefficients are not greatly changed, indicating that the economic size of the relationships remain
similar in this approach as in the previous approach.

         The other variables in the regressions affect outcomes in ways consistent with our
expectations. Using money borrowed from other banks, either via certificates of deposit or bills
payable and rediscounts, provided a negative signal about growth in surplus and undivided
profits. Notably, the coefficients on these variables in this case are nearly identical. This result
is consistent with the statements in the examination reports that these two forms of borrowing
were close substitutes.




16
   The standard errors in Table 6 are determined using a bootstrap approach that estimates the first, second, and third
stage jointly (estimation of equations 1, 2, and 4) for 500 repetitions. In each of these repetitions, we impose the
constraint that the number of failed banks is not to low, which would cause problems in estimating the bank
closure regressions, nor too high, which would cause problems estimating the regressions involving the
change in net worth and change in other real estate owned. For the closure regressions, we report raw probit
coefficients in the Table to facilitate comparison with the bootstrapped standard errors while the text describes the
marginal effects.
17
   We make one modest change to the independent variables in the regression for the change in OREO. Because the
dependent variable is the change in the ratio of OREO to assets from 1892 to 1894, including the ratio for 1892 on
the right hand side in a linear specification would mean that we are estimating the effect of the other independent
variables of the ratio in 1894 rather than on the change. Instead, we substitute an indicator variable for whether the
bank had an 1892 ratio in excess of the median ratio. As an alternative, we tried estimating a Tobit regression using
the level of the 1894 ratio and using the 1892 ratio as a control. That specification produced similar qualitative
results.

                                                          22
       Banks that had more net worth relative to their assets (i.e. were less leveraged) were less
likely to fail during the crisis. These banks also tended to experience greater increases in their
other real estate owned over the next couple years.

       The impact of greater involvement in real estate proved to be mixed, but was generally
detrimental. Banks with more other real estate owned (loans gone bad and collateral seized) on
their balance sheets in 1892 were more likely to close. Both a greater share of loans that
consisted of real estate loans and having more other real estate owned are associated with lower
growth in surplus and undivided profits. Banks with high levels of other real estate owned in
1892 also tended to see larger increases in this ratio by 1894.

       The deposit base also mattered for the outcomes we consider. Banks that were funded
more by individual deposits appear to have done better in surviving the panic. Banks with more
checking deposits tended to have stronger growth in retained earnings and lower growth in their
other real estate owned.

       With respect to corporate governance, we find that banks that required that the president
be bonded tended to experience slower growth in other real estate owned in subsequent years.
Our other corporate governance variables are not significant predictors.

       Location mattered. Banks in reserve cities were less likely to close and tended to fare
better after the Panic, with greater increases in their surplus and undivided profits. Banks in
states with large mining activity tended to have higher growth in their surplus and undivided
profits following the panic while banks in more populated areas had lower growth.

4.3 Comparison to modern results

       Our finding that examiners during the National Banking Era had valuable private
knowledge (both because of private hard information, and because of private soft information) is
in line with research regarding the information produced by modern examiners. Berger and
Davis (1994) find that downgrades of regulatory ratings (which are not observed by the public)
tend to occur in advance of declines in equity prices. Their result suggests that examiners have
private information, especially with regard to potential deteriorations in condition. DeYoung,
Flannery, Lang, and Sorescu (1998) regress regulatory CAMEL rating on publicly observable


                                                 23
information and see if the residuals have information for future movements of the prices of
subordinated debt. They find that the residuals have predictive power, which provides evidence
that the examiners possess useful private information.

         Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hirtle, and Lucca (2016), look at the types of information possessed
by examiners; they find that examiners pay attention to information about internal processes,
internal controls, and regulatory compliance, but that the assessments of information about
capital and liquidity seem more closely associated with deteriorations in bank health. Similarly,
we find that measures of capital and liquidity, as reflected in the examiner assessments, mattered
for bank outcomes. However, our results put more weight on the value of internal controls. We
find that measures of governance and internal controls are strongly associated with the
examiner’s estimates to total losses and that even our measures of soft information appears to be
correlated with indicators related to concerns about the quality of the management.

4.4 Examiners’ errors

         All of this is not to say that examiners were perfect. Bank managers appear to have been
able to hide problems in their institutions if they were particularly determined to do so. One
illustrative example is the Indianapolis National Bank. Two successive examiners reported that
the bank appeared to be in good shape. The examiner in June 1892 reported that the bank was in
good condition and was prosperous. On July 17, 1893, the examiner reported that the bank was
“in excellent condition.” Seven days later the bank failed. There was a run which closed the
bank on July 24. 18 A receiver was appointed on August 3. By the end of 1900, the receiver had
returned to depositors only 60 cents on the dollar, which was low by the standards of other
National bank failures; White (2017) calculates that payout rates averaged around 70 percent for
much of the National Banking era. The bank president had apparently been engaging in
numerous deceptive practices to support the failing business of his sons. These practices
included issuing small loans to all the employees of these businesses to make it look like the
loans were better distributed and inflating the value of collateral. Detecting fraud can always be




18
  Other banks also appear to have thought the bank was not in terrible shape. The Indianapolis Journal of July 26,
p.1, reported that the clearinghouse of the city had extended the bank a $50,000 loan when the run first started a few
days previous.

                                                         24
a challenge and clearly the examiners missed this particular episode. We provide this example to
highlight the challenges of processing soft information.

5. Did examiner identity matter?

         We know the names of the examiners that conducted each examination. 19 Here we
investigate whether expected losses contained an examiner fixed effect, and whether these fixed
effects mattered for gauging the relationship between expected losses and bank outcomes. If so,
then it may be desirable to include examiner fixed effects in the regressions.

         To test for differences in examiner strictness, we create indicator variables for each
examiner that performed at least five examinations. There were 18 examinations that were made
by six individuals that conducted less than five examinations each; these form the control group
against which we compare the other examiners. We then regress estimated total losses on these
examiner indicator variables, along with the quantitative variables used above, both public and
private, and locational controls.

         The results are reported in Table 7. In most cases, we find that the coefficients on the
examiner indicator variables are small and insignificant. This finding suggests that, broadly
speaking, banks were held to a fairly uniform standard.

         There are a few exceptions. Mr. Stone and Mr. Gannon appear to have been relatively
tough while Mr. Brush and Mr. Chamber were comparatively easy. We looked at whether the
banks that these individuals examined fared worse or better in any of our measures. To do so,
we regress the three outcome measures on the quantitative variables, the part of estimated total
losses attributable to soft information, and either indicators for having a tough/easy examiner or
the indicators for having a tough/easy examiner interacted with the soft information residual
(results not shown). We do not find any systematic evidence that having a tougher or easier
examiner made a difference for the three outcomes. Thus, we do not believe it is necessary to
include examiner fixed effects in our reported results.



19
  We do not know very much else about these individuals, such as their experience when conducting the
examinations. The Comptroller did include a list of examiners in his 1892 Annual Report and again in the 1902
Report. (We have not been able to locate similar lists in other years.) Of the 41 examiners listed in 1892, only 6 of
them were still examiners in 1902. This turnover suggests that the tenure of the examiners was fairly moderate.

                                                          25
6. Discipline provided by examiners on poorly performing banks

        In the previous sections, we have found that that both the hard and soft information in the
examination reports were useful in constructing loss estimates, and that these estimates are
indicative of the condition of the bank. Here we consider whether the examiners were able to
use this information to push for corrective behavior to promote the health and resiliency of
National banks. We investigate whether and how examiners affected the behavior of the banks
that they examined.

        When an examiner had concerns about a bank and expected that losses were likely to be
particularly large, there were a limited number of actions he could recommend, which were part
of the statutory authority of the OCC. If the bank was found to have violated certain rules, such
as its reserve requirement, the bank was not supposed to make new loans or pay dividends; the
examiner may have been able to point out such a circumstance. If the bank was found to have a
capital impairment—estimated losses exceeded the surplus and undivided profits—the
Comptroller could require an assessment against shareholders to pay the deficiency or could
appoint a receiver if the deficiency was not remedied (or if the bank was deemed insolvent). 20

        We find that, in practice, the examiners made other recommendations even though those
recommendations did not flow from any explicit statutory backing. Some recommendations
were mild, such as suggesting that the bank use a more modern bookkeeping system. On the
other end of the spectrum, the examiner might recommend that the bank charge off bad assets by
writing-down the value of its capital stock. The most common recommendation was that the
bank skip paying a dividend, even if the reserve requirement was met, and instead use its
earnings to charge off bad assets or to rebuild the surplus and undivided profits of the institution.
Out of our sample of 205 institutions, this course of action was recommended 33 times, for about
15 percent of the sample. More severe recommendations, such as writing-down capital or
making assessments against shareholders, were recommended for 8 of the institutions.

        To understand whether recommendations for corrective action grounded in loss estimates
were effective in improving the health and resilience of banks, we consider several aspects of the


20
 The Comptroller could also allow the bank to voluntarily liquidate or write-down the value of its capital. See
Comptroller of the Currency (1887, p.91).

                                                        26
disciplinary process. We first consider whether the assessment the examiner provided affected
whether that same examiner visited the bank subsequently. Finding that the examiners were more
likely to be replaced if they provided high loss estimates might indicate that they were less able
to discipline the bank. In the Appendix, we show that this was not the case; negative
assessments had no effect on examiner turnover.

       Next, we consider how the examiner’s recommendation affected the behavior of the
bank. When the examiner recommended not paying a dividend, the intent was that the bank
would instead use the increased retained earnings to fund the charge off some of its bad assets.
We look at whether a recommendation resulted in such behavior. Finally we look at whether
there is an observable connection between the recommendation of the examiner and market
discipline in the market for bank liabilities. In particular, we examine whether the interest rates
the bank paid on its overall funding base, or on the funds it borrowed using rediscounts and bills
payable, which may have been particularly sensitive to the condition of the bank, were affected
by a decision to not pay dividends.

       When investigating the disciplinary aspects of the examination process, we look at how a
reported problem in an initial examination filing, which we refer to as the baseline exam, is
related to information reported in the subsequent exam. When considering this subsequent
exam, we exclude cases where the next examination is of a closed bank, as these may well differ
from a normal bank examination. As an alternative, we also looked at how the results of the
examination preceding the baseline exam affected the responses in the baseline exam. Changes
in the variables reported on the examination form in earlier years make it difficult to control for
the condition of the bank prior to the baseline examination. Nevertheless, results using the data
that are available from the earlier reports are quite similar to the ones reported here.

6.1 Examiner recommendations and subsequent action

       We examine how banks responded to the recommendation that they not pay dividends,
and to examiners’ recommendations that they charge off bad assets. We first focus on whether
or not the subsequent exam reported that the bank had not paid dividends in the past six months.
We regress an indicator for whether the bank paid such a dividend on an indicator for whether
the examiner had recommended that the bank skip paying the dividend. We are interested in


                                                 27
whether the recommendation of the examiner influenced the decision of the bank to skip the
dividend above and beyond what the bank might have done itself based on its own assessment of
its condition. 21 In order to do so, we include in our regressions the quantitative indicators of
bank health that we used previously.

       Our results, reported in Table 8, show that banks for which the examiner recommended a
suspension of dividends were less likely to have paid a dividend in the past six months. This is
true even after controlling for other variables reflecting the condition of the bank.

       The examiner intended that the funds not being used to pay dividends would instead be
used to fund charge-offs of bad loans. We test whether the charge-off rate was indeed higher for
banks for which the examiner recommended that the dividend not be paid. A positive result here
implies two things. First, it implies that the bank had sufficient earnings to be able to charge off
bad assets; if the banks had no earnings, then it could not charge off any bad assets. Second, a
positive result implies that the bank made a choice to dedicate those earnings to charging off the
bad assets. While we know from the previous result that the dividend suspending bank did not
pay any funds (if available) as dividends, the bank could instead have opted to place those funds
into its surplus and undivided profits. Recall that the estimated losses are the opinion of the
examiner. If the bank disagreed, then it could comply with the recommendation of not paying
dividends while expecting to pay out dividends in the future once the losses expected by the
examiner did not materialize.

       Our measure of the charge-off rate is based on examiner reports’ indications of the
amount of losses that the bank had charged off, any premiums charged off, and any decreases in
value of assets charged off since the last examination. The charge-off rate is the sum of these
charge-off amounts divided by the assets at the time of the last report. We then regress this
charge-off rate on whether the examiner recommended that the bank not pay dividends.

       The recommendation to suspend dividends was based on the examiner’s estimates of the
expected losses the bank would incur. One might expect that if a bank had more observably bad
assets, such as elevated levels of other real estate owned, then the bank itself would prefer to


21Moreover, the examiner could only recommend the suspension of dividends. For a recommendation to
have had stronger legal force, the Comptroller would need to issue a letter to the bank.

                                                 28
charge-off more bad assets. Thus, in order to see whether the recommendation by the examiner
might have resulted in charge-offs above and beyond what the bank might have opted to do
itself, we again include in our regressions the quantitative measures of condition, public and
private, as well as locational factors that we used previously. As a further check for whether it
was the examiner’s recommendation that mattered, we test an alternative specification in which
we use the measure of the examiner’s soft information component of estimate of losses from the
decomposition analysis, rather than the indicator for recommending the suspension of dividends.

       The results confirm that the examiner was able to push the bank both to suspend
dividends and to charge-off more bad assets. In Specification 1 of Table 9, we see that banks for
which the examiner had recommended that dividends not be paid tended to have higher write-
down rates. In fact, the estimated coefficient indicates that at such banks the write-down rate
was almost twice as high as the average rate of 0.8 percent. Further, we find that the judgmental
soft information part of the examiner’s loss estimate is also associated with a higher charge-off
rate even controlling for other factors related to condition. In Specification 2, we find that the
measure of losses based on subjective information also tended to result in higher charge-offs.
These results provide further support for the idea that the examiner’s recommendation provided a
push for the bank to change its behavior. Interestingly, we don’t find that many of our control
variables are significant. We do, however, find that banks that had an active discount committee
to review loans tended to have lower write-down rates.

       Our finding that examiners were able to pressure banks to reduce bad assets through write
downs are consistent with the narratives provided by the examiners about their impact of the
behavior of banks:

   This is one of the largest and best reputed banks in the city. I frankly told the president and
   cashier that were it not that I know from general results that the bank was perfectly solvent
   the appearance of the paper, if judged by comparison with other banks, would give me a
   strong suspicion otherwise. I told them that their paper looked on its surface about the worst
   of any in my district. These open expressions spurred them on to a betterment of the
   appearance of the loans as a body…At the urgent request of the president and cashier, I
   remained in the bank for two days during which time notices were sent out and considerable
   technically bad and overdue paper was collected or put in better shape…(Examination report
   of First National Bank, Los Angeles, charter 2491, 12/31/1891)




                                                 29
         Our results about the change in behavior at the banks must be compared to our results
regarding the forecasting power of the decomposed parts of the loss estimates. With respect to
bank closure, given that the examinations typically happened only shortly before the panic, it is
likely that the banks did not have much time to substantially change their behavior. Thus, we
can be fairly confident that the decomposed loss estimates are predictive of closure rather than
causal. For the change in other real estate owned, it is striking that even though we find that
examiner recommendations of skipping a dividend resulted in a higher charge-off rate, the
amount of these bad assets still increased. Presumably they would have increased more in the
absence of the examiners’ encouraging banks to charge them off.

6.2 Market discipline

         Not paying dividends was potentially a signal to the stockholders of the bank that there
were problems with the bank’s performance. (It was not a perfect signal however. While low
profitability was the most common reason for not paying a dividend, there were other reasons.
For example, newly chartered banks tended not to pay dividends as they sought to grow their
surplus in support of future loan expansion.)

         As the suspension of a dividend was not a common event, it seems likely that the
suspension of a dividend would have been noted by market participants. 22 Indeed, examiners
reported some discussions with managers of troubled banks in which those managers expressed
concerns about potential reputational consequences of omitting the dividend. We test whether
banks that did not pay dividends suffered serious enough consequences that the suspension of
dividends resulted in the banks paying higher interest rates on their funding generally, or in the
in the interbank market, where lenders are potentially more informed. Furthermore, because the
maturities of rediscounts and bills payable were shorter, those sources of funds may have been
able to react more quickly to information about dividends. Finding evidence that skipping
dividends raised banks’ funding costs would suggest that the examination process provided a
public signal about the quality of the bank in a way that was reinforced by market discipline in
the market for bank liabilities.


22
  Other researchers have found that the suspension of dividends was an important signal of condition in this era.
For instance, Riddiough and Thompson (2016) find that that equity market participants used the suspension of
dividends as a signal about the quality of firms around the time of the collapse of Ohio Life in 1857.

                                                         30
       We compute the weighted average cost of funds that banks paid using the rates the
examiner reported that the bank paid on interbank deposits, on retail CDs, and on bills payable
and rediscounts as of the baseline examination report; the examiners reported that banks paid no
interest on checking deposits. (Not all these rates were reported by all examiners so the sample
is reduced slightly due to missing data.) We multiply these rates by the respective amounts of
these liability items listed on the balance sheet and divide by the total of these items. We also
look separately at the rates banks paid on bills payable and rediscounts.

       We then regress these measures of funding cost on whether the bank had omitted its
recent dividend payment, including call report variables that would have been observable to
other banks (using the 1891 call report as the 1892 information would generally not have been
available yet) and locational controls. As reported in Table 10, banks that had omitted their most
recent dividend payment tended to pay higher rates on their debt, and paid higher rates to borrow
from other banks, controlling for other public indicators of their condition. Thus, it appears that
the suspension of dividend payments triggered by a poor examination report contributed to
disciplining of the bank in the debt markets, and in particular, in the interbank market.

7. Conclusion

       In this paper, we find that the subjective information gathered by the bank examiners of
the national banking era while conducting their examinations was important in shaping their
overall assessments of the bank and were informative about the condition of the bank. We find
that the part of overall expected losses that we attribute to this subjective information were useful
in predicting whether a bank would fail in the panic, how profitable it would be in the next
couple years, and how the banks’ loans would perform. We also find that the private quantitative
information collected during examinations was informative about the health of the bank. The
information that was valuable was not limited just to additional measures regarding the assets of
the bank, but included information about the quality of the management and corporate
governance of the bank.

       We find that examiners were able to use the results of the examination process to
improve the health of the banks. Recommendations by examiners that a bank’s poor condition



                                                 31
warranted the suspension of a dividend appear to have prompted many banks to shift the use of
their earnings from dividend payouts to funds that could be used to charge off bad assets.

       We also find evidence that the suspension of dividends as a consequence of a bad
examination report may have affected banks through market discipline in the market for bank
liabilities. Dividend suspending banks faced higher debt funding costs.




                                               32
Appendix

Here we consider two points referenced in the text: (1) whether the sequence of examination
within a city gave rise to window dressing that might bias the relationship between examination
measures and bank condition, and (2) whether the probability of an individual examiner
returning to examine a bank was affected by the content of the prior examination report.




Window Dressing

           The incentive to window dress might be reduced to the extent that the examiner did not
review all banks in the larger cities in the same visit. Nevertheless, to check for evidence of
window dressing, we look at whether the first bank in the town to be examined had
systematically different balance sheet characteristics than the banks that were examined soon
thereafter. As the examiner might not examine all the banks in a town in a single visit, we
consider a bank to be the first to be examined if no bank in the town had been examined in
previous six months and to be a subsequent bank if another bank had been examined within the
past six months, although for nearly all banks considered to be subsequent another bank had been
examined in the town within the past two days.

           Our comparison of the findings of the examiners for the first banks examined in a town
and the other banks is reported two groups of banks is in Table A1. We generally find little
difference between the first bank examined and the banks examined subsequently. The share of
banks that are deficient in their cash reserve is almost identical, as was the share of banks with
loans in excess of the legal limit. About the same share of banks reporting that they used
borrowed money, a practice that was frowned upon by the examiners (if anything, a higher share
of banks that were examined after the examiner had been in town for a while were found to be
using borrowed money). The one place where we do see some evidence of window dressing is
in the share of loans that were “legally bad. 23” Legally bad loans were those on which interest
was past due for a period of six months, unless they were well secured and in the process of
collection (Coffin 1890, Alcorn 1908).” generally meaning that they were past due by some


23   Section 5204 of the Revised Statues

                                                  33
period of time or inadequately secured. Thus it appears that banks did make an effort to renew
loans or gather more collateral once the examiner appeared in town, but otherwise efforts to
window dress appear to have been minimal. 24




Loss estimates and examiner turnover

        As part of our analysis of the examination process, we considered whether examiner
turnover might be associated with reduced discipline on banks. In particular, in light of the
heterogeneity of examiners’ opinions, we consider here whether the rotation of examiners may
have depended on the severity of their prior reports. We start by looking at whether examiners
that noted larger expected losses were more or less likely to revisit the bank. In particular, we
test whether the ratio of estimated losses to assets reported by the examiner for the baseline
examination affected the likelihood that the same examiner was also the examiner for the
subsequent examination. If examiners pointing to problems were less likely to return, then the
bank may have been willing to take the chance that the next examiner might provide a more
favorable report. However, as shown in Table A2, we find no evidence that this was the case.
There appears to have been little association between expected losses and whether the examiner
returned. 25 Thus, we find no evidence that examiner turnover would have been associated with
reduced discipline.




24
   We also looked to see whether more troubled banks were examined first. We did not find any evidence of
differences in estimated losses between banks examined first and banks examined subsequently, which suggests that
troubled banks were not examined first. We did find that examinations of troubled banks typically took longer,
usually an extra day or so.
25 If we consider the losses reported on the previous exam and whether that examiner saw the bank in the

baseline exam, we find that a bank was less likely to have a change in the examiner between the two reports if
the examiner in the prior examination had made a higher estimate of losses. This, if anything, would have
increased the discipline provided by the examiners.
