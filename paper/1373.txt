                                  ABSTRACT




        The purpose of this paper is to compare the behavior of an econon

subject to labor contracts with an econonr where the labor market clears in

an auction manner. Such a comparison is intended to reveal the information

content of real wages in a flexible econonryr. The analysis reveals two

distinct costs inflicted by nominal contracts and demonstrates that optimal

macro policies can eliminate one of them.

 I. Introduction

      Labor contracts that pre—set wages for a given period may introduce short—

 run wage rigidities. Those rigidities imply that macroeconomic stabilization

 policies may enhence welfare by using information that was unavailable at the

 time of the wage negotiation.1 The purpose of this paper is to compare the

behavior of an economy subject to labor contracts with an economy where the

 labor market clears in an auction manner. Such a comparison is intended to

reveal both the information content of real wages in an auction-type economy

and the appropriate benchmark at which optimal macro policies should aim.

     In an economy where the labor market clears in an auction manner, the

real wage is set so as to clear the labor market. In a contracting economy,

however, there is no such a market. Thus by comparing an auction—type economy

with a contracting economy we may assess the role of an additional market, and

suggest how, in an environment that lacks a market, policies can be designed

to substitute in part for its absence.

     The analysis is conducted in an economy of the type put forward by

Fischer and Gray. These authors consider the case of an economy where nominal

wage contracts for period t are negotiated in period t—1, before prices of

period t are known. The implicit assumptions of these models are that

economic agents are risk neutral and that the existence of labor contracts

reflects the cost of continuous wage re—negotiation.

     We allow for two types of shocks. First, we have a monetary shock.

Next, each producer is subject to a specific productivity shock. We consider

the case in which a given producer observes his specific shock, but the

aggregate real shock is not observed directly.2 We consider a rational

expectation environment, in which the available information set can be used by



                                     —1—
agents in order to infer the value of some of the shocks.

     The analysis demonstrates that the effect of an auction labor market is

to reveal through the resultant real wage the aggregate productivity shock.

In a contracting economy we lack a market, consequently we have an equilibrium

that fails to reveal the aggregate productivity shock. Thus, nominal

contracts inflict two types of cost. The first relates to the deterioration

in the aggregate information available to the decision maker, due to the

presence of one less economy—wide market.3 The second relates to the

consequences of inflicting wage rigidity, which reduces the flexibility of

wage adjustment to unforeseen shocks. The purpose of the paper is to study

the interaction of these two costs and to assess the role of optimal macro

policies in such an economy.

     The paper is organized in the following manner: Section II describes the

model. Section III solves it for the corresponding optimal policies. Section

IV offers concluding remarks. The Appendix summarizes the notation used in

the paper.



II. The Model

     Let us consider a monetary economy composed of k producers. Those

producers sell their output in a competitive market. Output is produced by

means of a fixed input (capital) and labor. As in Fischer and Gray, we

consider the case in which, due to the costs of continuous wage re—negotia-

tion, wages and employment are governed by labor contracts. Nominal wage

contracts for period t are negotiated in period t-1, before current prices are

known, so as to equate expected labor demand to expected labor supply. But

actual employment in period t is demand determined, and depends on the

realized real wage. These models also allow for partial indexation, which is



                                     —2—
set according to certain optimizing criteria. The implicit assumptions of

these models are that economic agents are risk neutral, and that the existence

of labor contracts reflects the cost of continuous wage re—negotiation. The

present paper shares these assumptions.

      Suppose that the labor supply is given by:



(1)          L =      A.
                            (p-•)



where W is the money wage at time t, and                  is the price level. Labor is the

only mobile factor, and output of producer i is given by:



(2)          Y =      Lit     •
                                    exp



where Lit is the labor employed by producer i, and                    is the productivity

shock effecting producer i. We consider the case in which                    is known to

each producer.4       1.i is taken to be normally distributed, independently over

producers and over time, with mean zero.

      As a reference point, let us start with the "non—stochastic equilibrium",

i.e., the equilibrium in the economy if the value of all the random shocks is

zero. Let us denote by a lower—case variable the percentage deviation of the

upper—case variable from its value in the non—stochastic equilibrium. Thus,

for a variable X ,
                  t
                       xt   = (X — X )
                                t   0
                                          /X0   ,   where X is the value of X if all
                                                          0
random shocks are zero. To simplify notation, we delete the time index.

Thus, (x, x+j) are replaced by (x, x ).                  To facilitate discussion it is

useful to take a log—linear approximation of the model around its non—

stochastic equilibrium, writing the model in terms of percentage deviations.

This is equivalent to the use of a first—order approximation of a Taylor



                                                —3—
expansion around the equilibrium. We proceed by assuming that the number of

producers is sufficiently large for each producer to be a price taker.

      Employment by producer i(L) is determined by



                                           —
(3)         Max
                   P(L)     •

                                                     Li.
             Li


Solving this equation we obtain that, using our shorter notation,



(4)          l = c[p      — w +




where

      In deriving eq. 4, we make use of the assumption that the productivity

shock is observable by each producer. To simplify exposition, we take the

case in which each small producer has the same infinitesimal share of the

market. Thus, aggregate employment (1) and output (y) are given by



                          — w + p]
(5)          1 =   a[p


(6)          y =
                    k1            — w +          +         = a[(p—w) + uI
                   i= 1
                    k
      Where i =             denotes the aggregate productivity shock. Although
                   i= 1




producer I observes his own productivity shock                      aggregate    shock ji   is   not

observable directly, and the subsequent analysis will study the inference

problem associated with the determination of the perceived value of the

aggregate shocks. To close the model, we should specify the wage and price

level determinations.



                                                 —4—
           In a fully flexible economy, w corresponds to the wage that clears the

labor market, i.e. w =
                                 (    —   W)/W;     where   is the flexible equilibrium wage

rate, and W is the equilibrium wage if all shocks are zero. Under the labor

contract, the wage contract for period t is pre—set at time t—l at its

expected equilibrium level in a fully flexible regime,

 E(IfIi) .          E(I)         is the expectation operator, conditional on the

information available at time t—1 (In_i). Under a partial wage indexation the

actual wage is allowed during the contract's duration to respond partially to

unexpected changes in the price level:



(7)               log W = log E(jI_i) + b[P —



or,    in terms of our shorter notation5:



(7')              w = bp.



The case where b is set to zero corresponds to nominal wage rigidity, whereas

b =    1    is the case of real wage rigidity. The subsequent analysis studies the

determinations of b.

           To analyze the price level determinations, we should specify the money

market. Let the demand for money balances be



(8)              M =        .Y    •
                                      exp(—cz   •




where          is the expected inflation:



                    =                     —
                        [E(P÷iII)

                                                    —5—
Throughout the paper we proceed by invoking the assumption of rational

expectations. Agents are assumed to know the model and to observe all

prices. Each producer observe his own               productivity   shock (u) but not the

aggregate shock            (p)   .   In   case of need,agents would use the available

information to generate inferences regarding the aggregate productivity

shock ('          denotes the aggregate information set at time t, that includes

all current prices and knowledge of the model.

       The supply of money balances is gIven by:



(10)            log    =    log M + m —       y • Pt.


       mt is the stochastic shock to money balances, assumed to be generated by

a white—noise process



(11)                  N(0, V),



where V(or V(x)) stands for the variance of x.

       We would like to allow the monetary authorities to conduct a monetary

policy by means of a feedback rule that adjusts the money supply with

elasticity -y     with respect to the deviations of prices from their non—

stochastic level. Due to the nature of our model, we can focus our attention

on the properties of the stationary equilibrium for which the current values

of the stochastic shocks do not affect the expected values of future

variables. Equilibrium in the money market (Md = MS) allows us to derive the

following condition:




                                                 —6—
 (12)            my+p(ci++1).

Thus:

(13)             p =
                         1   + a + y + a(1—b)



Consequently, real wage T is given by



                     —   W —
                                     — (1—b)     a — m)

(14)                             p    1 + a + y + a(1—b)



        Equation 13 implies that observing the price level provides us with

information regarding the discrepancy between the monetary and the real shock.



III. Optimal Policies

        Subject to our assumptions, for a given real wage Ci) employment is

demand determined. This implies that if real wages deviate from their market

clearing level we obtain a welfare loss. Assuming risk neutral agents, and

the absence of other distortions, we can measure this welfare loss (for

derivations, see Aizenman and Frenkel (1983)) by

which the labor market clears in an auction fashion. The welfare loss is

proportional to the discrepancy between t and .                   Optimal policies are
derived such as to minimize the expected value of the welfare loss conditional

        Next, we turn to the derivation of real wages in a flexible equilibrium

III    a. Flexible Economy Equilibrium

        In a flexible economy wages are determined such as to clear the labor

market:

such an economy output is given by

        Equations 5, 6', 12, 17 can be applied to derive the real wage ()   for   a

flexible economy, yielding:

                                           —8—
wage and employment are free from monetary consideration. In the absence of

 clearing the labor market, we obtain only partial information because the

aggregate productivity shock (t)                    is   not revealed. Instead, we observe only

the sum of the monetary and real shocks, as embodied in the price signal.

Thus, the distinction between nominal and real shocks plays an important role

in our subsequent discussion because of the absence of labor market

clearing. Combining eq. 7', 16 and 18 we obtain the value for the welfare

loss as perceived by the policy maker (conditional on Is):



(19)            H(b, yII) = E                        (1—b)p}2II].    Alternatively:

        The aggregate productivity shock is not observable in our economy. Yet,

its perceived value (E(II)) enters the considerations of the decision maker

as one of the determinants of the perceived welfare loss (H). His knowledge

of the price (p) allows him to infer a value for ji

shock relative to the monetary shock. Eq. 20' allows us, after some

manipulations, to present H as



(19'           H {((l + ++ (1-b))                   -

        From this it         is evident that optimal policies are given by



                       1—b

Where * refers to the optimal value of the parameter in question.

        Several observations are in order. Inspection of equation 22 reveals

that for a stable covariance structure, the value of optimal policies is time

independent. This condition holds despite the use of currently available

information in deriving the various policies. Furthermore, it can be shown

that the same outcome for optimal policies for period t would be obtained if

one used the information available in the previous period (i.e., if one


derived Mm E(WLII_i)). As has been reported elsewhere (Aizenman
       - ,b

and Frenkel (1983)), optimal outcome can be obtained by monetary policy alone,

or by wage indexation. Thus, equation 22 defines a negative trade—off between

optimal monetary policy and optimal indexation.8 For a given monetary policy

 (-i), optimal indexation rises with the relative importance of monetary to

real shocks, having properties similar to the optimal indexation obtained by



                                            —1 0—
Gray.

        Optimal macro policies equate the contract real wage to the expected

clearing real wage, as perceived by the policy maker. I.e., subject to

optimal policies the real contract wage,          ,   is:

(23)               =
                       E(I)
       Optimal policies do not eliminate the welfare loss due to the absence of

a flexIble labor market. To appreciate thi& point notice that, subject to

optimal policies, the real contract wage diverges from the market clearing

wage (r      i).       This Is because optimal policies are based upon the

information available to the policy maker, which does not Include in our case

knowledge of the productivity shock. The market clearing wage, however,

depends upon the aggregate productivity shock, which is observable in flexible

economy via the equilibrium market clearing wage. Subject to optimal

policies, the discrepancy between the real contract wage (t) and flexible

equilibrium real wage () is orthogonal to the information available to the

policy maker. Thus, we cannot reach a more favorable outcome by macro

policies alone.9

       Subject to optimal policies, employment is given by:



(24)          1* =        — E(TtIIt)].


The supply of labor, however, corresponds to



(25)          c EGII)


                                          —11—
Using equation 18 we obtain that the discrepancy between the two is given by



(26)          (c + c) [E(TlIt) —        tl
       This entails a welfare loss (relative to the case of a flexible

equilibrium) equal to


                *        -        —
(27)          WL =   c[E(TtIIt)       Ttl

       This loss occurs because in our case optimal macro policies cannot clear

the labor market. Such a situation is attributable to the asymmetric nature

of our framework in which the producer bases his employment decision upon a

productivity shock that is observable to him but not to the policy maker.'°

The non—observability of the aggregate shock is the consequence of the missing

market. Thus, nominal contracts inflict two types of costs. The first

relates to the deterioration in the aggregate information available to the

decision maker as a result of having one less economy—wide market. The second

relates to the consequences of inflicting wage rigidity. This rigidity reduces

the flexibility of wage adjustment to shocks that were unforesble at the

contract negotiation. Optimal macro policies can eliminate only the second

source of costs, by generating a real wage that would adjust appropriately to

those shocks that the policy maker can observe (or infer). Such optimal

policies can not eliminate the cost caused by nominal contracts due to

deteriorated aggregate information. If nominal contracts generates non—

revealed asymmetric information, as is the case in the present model, then

optimal macro policies will not generate equilibrium in the labor market.

This, however, is the combined result of nominal contracts and asymmetric

 information.

        A formal statement of this argument can be summarized in the following

 manner: let us measure the expected welfare loss at period t generated by the

 contract relative to the flexible equilibrium. We do so conditionally on the

 basis of information available to the policy maker (It):

Due to a missing market, aggregate information available to the decision maker

at time t deteriorates to I• The first term measures the welfare

consequences of the deteriorated information set. This term is also equal to

 E(WLII) (i.e., the expected welfare loss subject to optimal macro

policies). Next, subject to nominal contracts real wages may diverge from

their perceived optimal value (EG'tII)); due to wage rigidity Introduced by

the contract. This cost is measured by the second term. The third term

represents the cost resulting from the interaction between the first two

costs. Optimal macro policies enable the elimination of the second type of

cost, nullifying the second and the third terms in eq. 28. Optimal macro

policies cannot, in general, eliminate the costs due to information that is

asymmetric and non—revealed because of the missing market.

       Thus, the first term in equation 28 measures the welfare loss due to a

missing economy—wide clearing labor market. It can be shown to be equal to

       This welfare loss increases with the relative importance of unanticipated

monetary volatility (1—) and with the volatility of aggregate productivity

shocks. This loss may    not   reflect a distortion if the costs of clearing the

labor market in an auction fashion exceed the costs caused by the absence of

an auction labor market (eq. 29).h1



IV. Concluding Remarks

       This paper has compared a flexible economy, in which the labor market

clears continuously, with a contracting economy, of the Fischer Gray type.

The comparison reveals that in a contracting economy we have one less economy—

wide market, implying that information that is revealed in a flexible economy

equilibrium may be missing in a contracting economy. In our model, this

applied for the aggregate productivity shock. Consequently, wage contracts

inflict two types of cost. The first relates to the possession of less

aggregate information, whereas the second refers to the wage rigidity

introduced by a wage contract. Optimal macro policies eliminate the second

type of cost, generating real wages that adjust appropriately to the shocks

that the policy maker can infer. If nominal contracts generate asymmetric,

non—revealed information, optimal macro policies will not eliminate the first

cost. Subject to optimal macro policies we find that the resultant deviation

from the flexible equilibrium are non—systematic (i.e., they are orthogonal to

the information set guiding the policy maker).

 1.    For a discussion of such policies in a rational expectation setting, see

       Gray (1976) and Fischer (1977). For a more recent discussion see Karni

       (1983); Canzoneri, Henderson and Rogoff (1983), Aizenman and Frenkel

       (1983) and Marston and Turnovsky (1983).

2.    A framework with a similar menu of shocks was applied by Marston and

      Turnovsky (1983) to assess the stabilizing role of taxation and

      ndexat ion.

3.    On the role of an economy—wide capital market in revealing information

      see Barro (1980).

4.    The case in which a uniform productivity shock is not observable directly

      has been studied by Aizenman and Frenkel (1983).

5.    In deriving equation 7' we use the fact that in our model W    log

       E(WIIti).
6.    Notice that once that i is revealed, we can infer m from the price
                                                                           signal1
      thereby obtaining full information.

7.    This is a short cut to the more lengthy computation following the

      undetermined coefficient method. An analogous short Cut is adopted in

      Canzoneri, Henderson and Rogoff (1983) in the context of an analysis of

      the information content of interest rates.

8.    In Aizenman and Frenkel (1983) we evaluate optimal policies for the case

      in which producers do not directly observe a uniform productivity

      shock. The resultant values for optimal macro policies have similar

      characteristics to those obtained in the present paper. They are derived

      in a symmetric information setting where they are shown to clear the

      labor market.

9.   Further welfare improvement may be achieved by invoking policies that use

     information which is available to the firm at the micro level [see

     Marston and Turnovsky (1983)], or policies that attempt to improve the

     aggregate information set. In both cases, the marginal benefit should be

     weighted against the marginal cost of implementing those policies.

     rates, in the context of asymmetric information, see Canzoneri, Henderson

     and Rogoff (1983).
