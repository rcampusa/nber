                                         ABSTRACT

We evaluate the long-term effect of a “girl-friendly” primary school program in Burkina Faso,
using a regression discontinuity design. The intervention consisted of upgrading existing three-
classroom schools to six-classroom schools to accommodate more grades. After seven years, the
program increased enrollment by 15.5 percentage points and increased test scores by 0.29
standard deviations. Students in treatment schools progress further through the grades, compared
to students in non-selected schools. These upgraded schools are effective at getting children into
school, getting children to start school on time, and keeping children in school longer. Overall,
we find that the schools sustain the large impacts observed about three years earlier, with
enrollment declining slightly from 18.5 to 14.9 for the cohorts of children who were exposed to
both the first and second phases of the intervention.

I. Introduction

The growth in primary school enrollment rates worldwide is one of the major recent success stories
of development policy. Unfortunately, not all countries have shared in this achievement. Most
notably, children in parts of sub-Saharan and South Western Asia attend primary school at much
lower rates than children in the rest of the developing world (Glewwe et al. 2011). In 2011, for
example, the developing world had achieved gross enrollment rates of 109 percent 2, but Mali,
Burkina Faso, and Niger, the three worst performing countries in West Africa, averaged a dismal
84, 81, and 67 percent, respectively. Students from these countries are also less likely to complete
elementary school, let alone transition to secondary school (Glewwe et al. 2011). Although the rest
of the world shifts focus to improving secondary school enrollment rates and improving
employment outcomes for older teens and young adults, these countries risk falling further behind.

Quasi universal elementary school participation implies that the gender gap in enrollment has
virtually disappeared. In countries where enrollment rates are still low, girls are less likely to be
enrolled than boys. In 2011, gross enrollments of boys and girls in the developing world were 111
percent and 107 percent, respectively. In Sub-Saharan Africa, gross enrollments were 105 percent
for boys and 97 percent for girls. The gender gap was even wider when considering the countries
with the lowest enrollment rates. In the same year, enrollment rates for boys and girls were 85
percent and 79 percent in Burkina Faso; 97 percent and 86 percent in Mali; and 75 percent and 62
percent in Niger. Hence, even by African standards, the gender gap in primary school participation
persists in these three countries.

A number of factors influence parents’ decisions to enroll children in schools. Economically, the
decision reflects a trade-off between the returns to education and the costs of schooling,
particularly the opportunity cost of children’s time. Within this framework, however, infrastructure
seems to play an important role (Alderman, Kim, and Orazem 2003; Breierova and Duflo 2004;
Duflo 2001; Handa 2002; Paxson and Schady 2002) 3. Reducing the costs of schooling by building

  Duflo (2001) shows a substantial increase in the number of schools in Indonesia led to an increase in educational
attainment of an average of 0.12 to 0.19 years of schooling for men, with sizable increases in their economic returns
from schooling. Breierova and Duflo (2004) focus on maternal outcomes of the school expansion program in Indonesia
and find a strong significant effect on women’s educational outcomes. Paxson and Schady (2002) assess the
educational impact of Peru’s Social Investment Fund during the 1990s. During a six-year period starting in 1992, the

                                                        -1-
more schools and making them more accessible significantly increases the probability that families
choose to enroll children (Kondylis and Manacorda 2012), particularly girls. This is true in
developing countries in general, as well as areas with stubbornly low enrollment rates (Burde and
Linden 2013; Kazianga et al. 2013; Shaffner 2003; Theunynck 2009). There is also evidence that
the quality of the infrastructure matters and that providing amenities targeted at facilitating the
enrollment of girls can significantly improve their enrollment (Glewwe and Jacoby 1996; Mason
and Rozelle 1994). In addition to attracting and maintaining more students in school, overall school
quality has also been shown to improve teachers’ effectiveness (Chaudhuri et al. 2006).

Unfortunately, this literature provides little detail on the process through which infrastructure
improves primary school enrollment (Filmer 2007). 4 Moreover, although there is ample evidence
indicating that enrollment increases when the distance to the nearest school decreases, only few
studies investigate the effects of improved school facilities on learning outcomes (Burde and
Linden 2013; Kazianga et al. 2013). We build on Kazianga et al. (2013) by analyzing a second
longer-term, follow-up survey of the unique Burkinabe Response to Improve Girls’ Chances to
Succeed (BRIGHT) school construction program. The program, which started in 2005, constructed
high quality schools with “girl-friendly” characteristics in the parts of the country with the lowest
enrollment rates. The Burkinabe Ministry of Education selected villages for the program based on
a needs assessment that provides for the use of a regression discontinuity design. The repeated
cross-sectional design allows us to use the existing RD design to assess the continued viability of
providing high-quality schools seven years after the start of the program during a period in which
the schools expand beyond their initial three grades into later primary school grades.

Overall, we find that villages selected for the BRIGHT program continue to have better and higher
quality infrastructure and resources with significantly more amenities targeted at improving the
enrollment of girls. With only one exception (gender sensitivity training), we find a greater
prevalence in these gender-focused characteristics seven years after the start of the program than



program engaged in building and upgrading school infrastructure (mainly classrooms). As in the case of Indonesia,
Paxson and Schady find that investment in school infrastructures increased enrollment rates, especially for the rural
poor, and that school attendance increased, especially for young children.
4
  Notice that expanding schooling options might not consistently improve educational outcomes (Ganimian and
Murnane 2014). For instance, Newman et al. (2002) argue that education projects in Bolivia may have improved
school infrastructure, but had little impact on education outcomes. On the other hand, Pradhan and Rawlings (2002)
find that education investments have a positive impact on schooling outcomes.

                                                        -2-
at 2.5 years. Additionally, although schools in selected villages remain older than other schools,
almost all villages in the sample have access to a school within their village. The difference in the
probability that an unselected village has a school is only 9.9 percentage points, and 95.7 percent
of selected villages have schools. 5 These differences imply that the effects observed in the current
survey are much more likely due to differences in the quality of the schools rather than just the
presence of a school.

The BRIGHT program continues to improve students’ enrollment rates significantly. We find that
children between the ages of six and seventeen in villages selected for the program are 15.5
percentage points more likely to be enrolled in school and score 0.29 standard deviations more on
a standardized achievement test. We find evidence of modest reductions in child labor across a
range of household chores, but we find no effects on children’s growth for the associated feeding
programs. The relative lack of effect of the feeding program is likely due to low school
participation rates. Despite the large treatment effects on school participation, primary school
enrollment rates in selected villages are only 47.6 percent. Unlike the 2.5 year effects, we now find
that the program has significantly larger effects for girls than boys across a range of outcomes,
including enrollment, test scores, grade progression, and household work supporting earlier
evidence of the importance of the girl-friendly characteristics. Noticeably, the gender gap closes
in educational outcomes (enrollment, test scores, grade progression) in selected villages.

The data also provide evidence about how these schools improve children’s outcomes. Although
we find that the enrollment effects are consistent across children of all ages, the test score effects
accrue disproportionately to older children. At the same time, we find that the children in selected
villages are much more likely to stay in school longer, matriculating to higher grade levels. This
seems to be due largely to the BRIGHT schools’ ability to encourage children to start school
earlier. In fact, the entire difference in test scores between selected and unselected villages can be
explained by the fact that children in selected villages are more likely to have progressed to higher
grade levels. We find no evidence that the fact that BRIGHT schools are older or offer more grade
levels plays a role.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We present the BRIGHT program in Section II. In
Section III, we describe our methodology. We establish the internal validity of our approach in
Section IV. We discuss our results in Section V for academic outcomes and in Section VI for
secondary outcomes. We investigate heterogeneity in Section VII, and conclude in Section VIII.



II. Description of the BRIGHT Program

The BRIGHT program was designed and implemented to improve the educational outcomes of
children in Burkina Faso and girls’ education in particular in a context where the government was
embarked on a 10-year education investment program (Levy et al. 2009 and Kazianga et al. 2013).
The first phase of BRIGHT consisted of constructing primary schools with three classrooms from
grades one to three and implementing a set of complementary interventions, including separate
latrines for boys and girls, canteens, take-home rations and textbooks, and community engagement
activities. An independent impact short-term evaluation of the BRIGHT program was carried out
in 2009 (Levy et al. 2009, Kazianga et al. 2013) examining the impacts of the program for children
between the ages of 5 and 12.

In the first three years of operation, the BRIGHT program increased enrollment by 20 percentage
points, based on the household survey data collected in 2008 (Ley et al. 2009; Kazianga et al.
2013). The impact on whether a child was present on the day we visited the school, however, was
16 percentage points. These effects are in line with other educational interventions that investigate
the effects of school construction in developing countries (Duflo 2001, Andrabi Das, and Khwaja
2013). The effects imply that BRIGHT I was responsible for increasing enrollment rates from
about 35 percent to 55 percent (household-reported outcome) or from about 31 percent to 47
percent (school-based outcome).

In the first phase of the program, the impact in enrollment was also accompanied by large positive
impacts on student test scores, which covered math and French. The impacts on both math and
French test scores were approximately 0.4 standard deviations. In this context, an impact of this
size implied that for a student who started at the 50th percentile of our sample, attending a BRIGHT
school is predicted to increase his or her test score to approximately the 80th percentile.



                                                 -4-
To ensure sustained success of the BRIGHT program, the government of Burkina Faso extended
the program using $28.8 million in compact funding. This second phase of the BRIGHT program
was implemented from 2009 to September 2012 and consisted of constructing three additional
classrooms from grades four through six in the original 132 villages with the continuation of the
complementary interventions provided during the first three years of the program. The
complementary interventions included:

•   School canteens (daily meals for all): Daily meals were offered to all boys and girls who
    were enrolled in school.
•   Take-home rations: Girls who had a 90 percent attendance rate received 8 kilograms of dry
    cereal each month to take home.
•   School kits and textbooks: Textbooks and school supplies were to be provided to all students.
•   Mobilization campaign: The purpose of the mobilization campaign was to bring together
    communities and those with a stake in the education system to discuss the issues involved in,
    and barriers to, girls’ education. The campaign included informational meetings; door-to-
    door canvassing; providing gender-sensitivity training to ministry officials, pedagogical
    inspectors, teachers, and community members; sponsoring a girls’ education day; radio
    broadcasts; posters; and providing awards for female teachers.
•   Literacy: The literacy program had two components—adult literacy training and mentoring
    for girls. For each of the two project years, Tin Tua organized adult literacy training and
    training for student mothers/female role models.
•   Local partner capacity building: Training included local officials in the Ministry of
    Education, Bisongo monitors, and teachers. Specific training included completing school
    registers.

The overarching goal of the BRIGHT program was to increase primary school completion rates
for girls, as the government of Burkina Faso identified girls’ education as one of the key avenues
through which poverty could be reduced while stimulating economic growth. The combination of
classroom construction and complementary interventions were meant to yield short-, medium-,
and long-term outcomes for girls, parents—mothers, in particular—community members, and
teachers. The primary intervention is the construction of girl-friendly schools. These schools can
directly affect enrollment and attendance of girls, which in turn could improve their academic

                                                -5-
skills and, in the long-term, their employment prospects and incomes. The additional amenities are
likely to contribute to improving girls’ enrollment and academic skills, but may also improve other
outcomes.



III. Methodology

A. Research Design

The Ministry of Education (MoE) determined the allocation of schools within the BRIGHT
program in coordination with MCC. The strategy sought to target villages able to serve the largest
number of children via objective, transparent criteria. They proceeded as follows:

    1. From the country’s 301 departments, 293 villages were nominated from 49 departments
        due to their low levels of primary school enrollment.
    2. A staff member from the MoE administered a survey to each village.
    3. The results of the survey then determined each village’s score using a set formula that
        heavily weighted the number of children likely to be served from the proposed and
        neighboring villages. Girls were given additional weight. 6,7
    4. The MoE then ranked each village within the 49 departments, selecting the top half of
        villages within each department to receive a BRIGHT school. In the event of an odd
        number of villages, the median village was not treated, and the two departments that had
        only a single nominated village had their villages selected.
Ultimately, 127 villages received the BRIGHT program. The selection algorithm identified 138
villages for inclusion in the BRIGHT program, but 11 of these villages did not participate. This
seemed to be mainly due to problems with the location. For example, the BRIGHT design called
for the creation of a well, but suitable wells could not be dug in some of the proposed villages.
Five villages that were not initially selected via the algorithm were selected as replacement
villages. It seemed that these were the next highest ranked villages. However, we could not confirm
that this was the formal rule nor could we determine why only 5 of the 11 villages were replaced.


6
  As noted in Kazianga et al. (2013), the information on which the score is based seems very noisy, probably because
the survey was based largely on information provided by the leader of each village. For example, the score is at best
weakly correlated with most outcomes both in the prior and current study.
7
  The details of the scoring formula are available in Kazianga et al. (2013).

                                                        -6-
Because the vast majority of villages received a school in compliance with the selection algorithm,
we treat the 16 villages as noncompliers and estimate intent-to-treat effects.



B. Empirical Specifications

The selection algorithm creates a series of RD designs within each department. Although the
within-department assignment rule is not statistically ideal, we include department level fixed
effects in all estimations to ensure that villages are only compared to other villages within the same
department. Finally, to transform the score variable used to assign schools such that all villages
received the BRIGHT program if their score was larger than the same value, we calculate for each
department the midpoint between the scores of the highest scoring village not assigned to receive
the program via the algorithm and the lowest scoring village assigned to it. The variable
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆j is then defined to be the village score relative to this midpoint. It is the value of the
midpoint subtracted from each village’s score.We then estimate treatment effects via the following
model using ordinary least squares:

                          𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 + 𝑓𝑓(𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 )+δ𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝛾𝑍𝑍𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗   (1)

The estimates are performed at the child-level with each child designated as child 𝑖𝑖 in household
ℎ in village 𝑗𝑗 in department 𝑘𝑘. We designate the outcome of interest with the variable 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . The
matrix 𝑍𝑍𝑘𝑘 is a vector of department fixed effects, and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 includes child and household
demographic characteristics. Specifically, the set of characteristics includes those variables listed
in Table 2. 8 The indicator variable 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 is set to one if the selection algorithm designated the child’s
village for the BRIGHT program, and 𝑓𝑓(𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆j ) is a polynomial expansion in the relative
score of the village. Since the MoE assigned the treatment at the village level, we cluster by village
using the standard Huber-White estimator.

As in Kazianga et al. (2013), we find the score variable uncorrelated with most outcomes. This
allows for the use of a low-ordered polynomial. Following the previous paper, we use a quadratic
specification as our preferred one and use other orders in robustness checks. All the results are



8
  For parsimony, we have consolidated some of the control variables into the indexes presented in Table 2. However,
the results are invariant to including the individual components of the index instead.

                                                                -7-
robust to polynomials of other orders. Additionally, because the coefficients on the score variables
are so small, we measure the relative score variables in units of 10,000. 9

Finally, we conduct an additional robustness check for our main outcomes (assignment to
BRIGHT II, enrollment, and total test scores) in which we estimate the location of the discontinuity
using the estimation technique proposed by Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008) and Hansen (2000).
The technique involves estimating the following model for all values of 𝛼𝛼1 in the range of
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆j :

                                 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐼𝐼(𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅_𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗≥𝑎𝑎) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑗𝑗 .                        (2)

For each estimate, we calculate the 𝑅𝑅2 statistic, and calculate the maximand. These estimates are
presented graphically in Figures 1, 2, and 3.

C. Data Collection

The survey was fielded in the spring of 2012, i.e. exactly four years after the survey of BRIGHT I
discussed in Kazianga et al. (2013), and consisted of a household and a school survey. The
household sampling frame comprised all households within the 290 villages (out of the original
293 villages) that applied to the program, including all of the villages in the participant and
comparison groups for this study. In each of the sampled villages, interviewers conducted a census
to identify households with school-age children between 6 and 17 years old. In each village, 36
households were randomly selected from the list generated from the census. This yielded 10,507
households and 26,430 children between 6 and 17 years old. 10

The school survey included all schools in sampled villages and schools located within 10
kilometers of the sampled villages that children from the household survey reportedly attended. A
total of 332 schools were included in the sample.

Two separate survey instruments were administered to households and schools. The household
survey included questions on households’ characteristics and possessions, children’s educational
outcomes (such as enrollment and attendance), parents’ perceptions of education, anthropometric


9
  The details of the scoring formula are available in Kazianga et al. (2014).
10
   A total of 25,291 children took the math assessment and 23,613 children took the French assessment. The number
of children taking the test is smaller than the total number of children in the sampled households because administering
the tests required face-to-face meetings with the children, and some children were not available.

                                                                -8-
measurements for children, and the extent to which any children in the household worked.
Anthropometric measurements included child height, weight, and upper arm circumference.
Finally, math and French tests were administered to all children ages 6 to 17 who lived in the
households interviewed in the household survey, regardless of school enrollment. A total of 25,291
children took the math assessment and 23,613 children took the French assessment. These tests
were administered immediately after the household survey.

The school survey collected information on the schools’ physical infrastructure and supplies as
well as school personnel characteristics. Interviewers collected attendance and enrollment data for
children who were enrolled in the school. The enumerators used the information provided by
parents in the household survey to track and verify that students are effectively enrolled. The
school survey was administered during the same period as the household questionnaire, allowing
interviewers to visually confirm attendance of household children.



IV. Internal Validity

A. Treatment Differential

We demonstrate in Kazianga et al. (2013) that the assignment algorithm generates a sharp 87.4
percentage point difference in the probability that a village participates in the BRIGHT I program,
despite the minor level noncompliance described in the previous section. In Table 1, we
demonstrate that a similar discontinuity exists in the probability that villages participate in
BRIGHT II. Using our preferred specification in column two, we find a difference of 88.4
percentage points. These estimates are consistent when estimated using higher or lower ordered
polynomials (columns 2 through 4), allowing the polynomial coefficients to differ by BRIGHT
assignment (column 5), and using a probit model (column 6).

We illustrate the results graphically in Figure 1, focusing on the narrow range of (-250, 250). 11 The
solid line in the figure provides estimates from a local linear regression with a bandwidth of 60
and an Epinechnikov kernel, and it is consistent with the estimates from Table 1. The dashed line



11
  The full range of the relative score is (-924, 3,741). This is slightly different than the range in Kazianga et al. (2013)
due to the inclusion of the small number of villages that could not be surveyed in 2008.

                                                            -9-
presents the estimated R^2 statistics from equation (2). As expected, the value of the maximand is
less than 0.01, which is consistent with the discontinuity occurring at zero.



B. Continuity

In addition to the treatment varying discontinuously, the other critical identification assumption in
a regression discontinuity design is that all characteristics not influenced by the treatment do not
vary discontinuously. In Kazianga et al. (2013), we demonstrate both that the distribution of
villages (using the test suggested by McCrary [2008]) and the socio-demographic characteristics
of children do not vary discontinuously at the cut-off point. However, in the four years since the
last survey, differential migration could result in the emergence of discontinuities in household or
child characteristics.

To provide evidence on the continued reasonability of the continuity assumptions, Table 2
provides the estimated discontinuities for the socio-demographic variables in our current survey
using equation (1) without the socio-demographic controls. 12, 13 Of the 16 estimates tested, all are
practically small, and only three are statistically significant at conventional levels. 14 To check the
magnitude of the estimated differences, we regress our two main outcomes, enrollment and test
scores, on the set of control variables, and estimate the cross product of this vector of coefficients
and a vector containing the estimated discontinuities in Table 2. This provides a net estimate of
the potential bias resulting from the observed discontinuities. Both are very small, particularly
relative to the observed treatment effects (column 1 of Tables 4 and 5). For enrollment, we estimate
the projected bias to be 1.2 percentage points and 0.031 standard deviations for enrollment and the
total test score respectively. 15




12
   The estimates include department fixed effects.
13
   The discontinuities for the individual variables in the indexes presented in Table 2 are provided in Table A1 in the
Appendix.
14
   The sample size is large enough that a joint test of all of the discontinuities using seemingly unrelated regressions
yields a Chi2 statistic of 34.49 (p-value is 0.0047) despite the size of the estimated discontinuities.
15
   The individual estimates for this calculation are provided in Tables A2 and A3 of the Appendix.

C. Estimated Differences in School Infrastructure

Given that we have an internally valid research design, we finally estimate the effects of
assignment to the BRIGHT program on the educational infrastructure experienced by children in
the villages. This allows us both to characterize the treatment and assess whether the characteristics
of BRIGHT schools have been sustained. 16 We provide these estimates in Table 3 using data from
the household and school surveys. 17 Except for the probability that a village has a school, which
includes all villages, the sample for all estimates includes only those villages with primary schools.
Similarly, we estimate the effect on the probability of having a primary school at the village level
but estimate effects on the remaining variables at the school level. 18 All estimates are performed
using equation (1) with only department fixed effects. We cluster the standard errors for the school
level estimates by village. Columns 2 and 4 provide the treatment effect estimates and columns 1
and 3 provide the limit at the discontinuity for unselected villages. We estimate these using the
same specification as the discontinuity estimates but without department fixed effects.

The estimates show that seven years after the start of BRIGHT I and the implementation of
BRIGHT II, villages selected for the BRIGHT program still have significantly better educational
infrastructure than unselected villages. First, Panel A demonstrates that BRIGHT villages have
better access to schools. Villages are still 9.8 percentage points more likely to have a school, but
this is a significant reduction from the 31.5 percentage points difference that existed in 2008
(Kazianga et al. 2013). This pattern suggests that unlike the evaluation of BRIGHT I, the effects
observed in the current analysis are primarily driven by differences in the characteristics of the
schools rather than their presence. However, BRIGHT schools are more accessible. Families are
5.4 percentage points more likely to report the existence of a direct route to the school and estimate
that the travel time is 7.8 minutes less than the 29 minutes it takes to get to schools in nonselected
villages.

In addition to being more accessible, the BRIGHT villages are also of better quality. They have
both more programs and better resources. Starting with Panel B, we find that schools in BRIGHT
villages have been open longer, are less likely to report having excess demand, and offer more

16
   For reference, these estimates are provided in Tables A2 and A3 of the Appendix.
17
   Estimates for a range of other variables including those including in the teacher quality and classroom quality
indexes are provided in Appendix Tables A4-A6. The estimates are consistent with those in Table 3.
18
   Data from the household surveys is aggregated to the school level.

                                                      -11-
grades than schools in unselected villages. As expected, the average schools in selected villages
go through about the sixth grade, while other schools average almost one grade level less. The
estimates in Panels C then show that selected villages also have a larger number of usable
classrooms, better quality classrooms, teacher accommodations, dry rations programs for all
children, and a better supply of desks and textbooks.

Schools in selected villages also have more teachers. In Panel D, we find that schools in selected
villages have more teachers (2.5 more per school) and student teacher ratios that are 5.9 students
per teacher smaller than schools in unselected villages. In terms of quality, the lack of differences
in the qualifications index indicates that the quality of the teachers in selected villages is similar
to those of other teachers. The individual components of the index are provided in Table A7. All
of the estimates for the individual components suggest few differences in teacher quality except a
small difference in experience where teachers in selected villages are slightly (5.6 percentage
points) more likely to have more than 10 years of experience. This is notable because in 2008, the
teachers in selected villages were more likely to be new teachers with less than five years of
experience. So, the quality of teachers has increased in the last four years. This is likely due to the
natural transitions between teachers because teachers can request a transfer after three years at the
same school.

As we describe above in Section II, an important part of the BRIGHT facilities is the incorporation
of “girl-friendly” characteristics designed to target the enrollment of girls. In Panel E, we show
that four years later, schools in selected villages have not only sustained these characteristics they
have, with one exception, improved relative to the schools in unselected villages when compared
to 2008 with one exception. For each of the characteristics except for sensitivity training, selected
schools are 34 to 58 percentage points more likely to have each amenity. These differences are
much larger than in 2008, despite schools in unselected villages also improving significantly along
each margin except dry-rations programs for girls where they remain at the 2008 level. 19 The one
exception, however, is gender sensitivity training where the difference in 2012 is only 16
percentage points compared to 50 percentage points in 2008. Because the levels of training in the



19
  It is important to note that although the estimates in Table 3 are estimates of the limit for unselected villages, the
estimates provided in Kazianga et al. (2013) are averages for all unselected villages. Although the estimates are all
very similar, we provide the unselected limits for each in Table A7 of the Appendix.

                                                         -12-
unselected villages are roughly the same, the problem is that selected villages have fewer teachers
who have received the training. 20

Finally, even if schools have better characteristics, there is always the question of whether families
are sufficiently aware of the differences that change enrollment decisions. We collected data on
some characteristics from both households and school administrators. This includes whether
schools have gender segregated latrines, a canteen, a feeding program, dry rations, and a preschool.
This allows us to check parents’ awareness by comparing the estimated differences. The
household-based estimates are in Table A4 of the Appendix and they are remarkably consistent
with the estimates in Table 3, suggesting that parents are aware of the better characteristics
available in selected village schools.



V. Academic Outcomes

We start by analyzing the effects of BRIGHT on overall enrollment. The treatment effect estimates
created using equation (1) are presented in Table 4. We start with students’ self-reported
enrollment. Using our preferred quadratic specification with full controls, we find in column 1 that
being selected for the BRIGHT program increases children’s probability of being enrolled by 15.5
percentage points. In columns 2 through 7, we vary the specification, estimating the effects without
controls 21 (column 2), with a linear polynomial (column 3), with a cubic polynomial (column 4),
allowing the quadratic polynomial coefficients to differ with the discontinuity (column 5), using a
probit model (column 6), and using our verified enrollment measure (column 7). All of these
estimates are consistent with or preferred estimate. 22 The net result of these higher enrollment rates
is that, on average, children in villages selected for the BRIGHT progress 0.68 more years in
school.




20
   There is no evidence of gender sensitivity training for teachers in the second phase. Thus, teachers who received
the training may have left.
21
   In particular, it is important to note that the similarity of the estimates with and without controls reinforces the
internal validity of the research design.
22
   The verified enrollment estimates are lower than the preferred estimates. However, this difference likely results
from the differential measurement error inherent in the verification process as described in Section 3.C. In spite of this
downward bias on the treatment effect, however, the estimate does support the existence of a large effect on
enrollment.

                                                          -13-
Table 5 presents the estimated effects on test scores. Again, the preferred specification presented
in column 1 shows a large, positive average effect of the BRIGHT program on test scores. Students
living in villages selected for the BRIGHT program score 0.29 standard deviations higher than
students in unselected villages. Again, the estimated effect is consistent across the same range of
specifications we used for the enrollment outcomes. In the Appendix (Tables A9 and A10), we
demonstrate that the observed treatment effect is consistent across both the math and language
sections of the exam and across many of the specific competencies. We also provide
unstandardized treatment effect estimates using the percentage of correct answers for each subject
and the aggregate scores.

Finally, Figures 2 and 3 provide graphical depictions of the estimated treatment effect on the
narrow range of (-250, 250). The depicted discontinuities in each are consistent with the estimates
in Tables 4 and 5. Additionally, the estimates of the fit of different discontinuities are maximized
at a point that is less than 0.01, consistent with a discontinuity at zero.

To better understand the underlying causes of these effects, we disaggregate the estimates by age.
Figure 4 presents the estimated treatment effects for enrollment (left axis) and total test score (right
axis) by age. For each age, we provide the estimated treatment effect and the 95 percent confidence
band. The enrollment effects are surprisingly consistent for all children despite the fact that the
BRIGHT schools end at grade 6. This is consistent with the wide age distributions of students
enrolled in all of the schools. The effects on test scores, however, are not consistent. Older children
have much larger treatment effects than younger children.

We explore two possible explanations for the heterogeneity by age. First, as we showed in the
previous section, schools in selected villages are older and have more grade levels than other
schools. So, students in selected villages may simply be mechanically further along in primary
school than students in unselected villages. However, this does not seem to be the case. Figure 5
provides estimates of the probability that children have completed primary school grades. If the
observed effect had resulted from the fact that children had just had an opportunity to progress
further in selected villages, we would expect larger treatment effects on later grades. However,
this is not the case. The observed effects seem reasonable when compared to the effects from the
2008 survey (right axis), but the treatment effect is decreasing in grade level.



                                                  -14-
The effect does, however, seem to be related to grade progression. Figure 6 provides estimates of
the highest grade achieved by age, along with the test score effects from Figure 5 for reference.
The treatment effects line up very closely. Finally, if grade progression does explain the variation
in observed test score effects, then one would expect that controlling for the highest grade achieved
would explain much of the observed test score treatment effect presented in column 1 of Table 5.
These estimates are presented in the first two columns of Table 6. Using either fixed effects
(column 1) or including the variable as a linear control (column two), grade progression, in fact,
explains the entire test score treatment effect. This is not the case for the two mechanical
explanations. The final four columns contain similar estimates controlling for the number grades
available to students or the number of years that a village has had a school, but neither explains
any of the observed treatment effects.

To understand why students in BRIGHT schools progress further, we compare the types of
students in schools in selected and unselected villages. The differences, of course, are not internally
valid treatment effects, but they do offer suggestive evidence of possible bases of the observed
effects. 23 Table 7 provides estimates at the discontinuity of different measures of the relationship
between grade progression and age. Each estimate is constructed using equation (1) with and
without controls for villages with schools using children currently enrolled in school.

In Panel A, we estimate differences in measures of students’ age relative to their grades. First, we
show that only 35.9 percent of students in unselected villages can be considered age appropriate
for their grade. 24 The proportion in selected villages is 8.5 percentage points higher. The next two
rows show that the underlying reason is that students are too old rather than too young. If we
estimate the number of years that children are “off-grade”, students in unselected villages are on
average 1.26 years off while students in selected villages are about a quarter of a year closer to
being the right age for their grade.

In Panel B, we show that the reason for this pattern is that students seem to be more likely to start
school younger—closer to the appropriate age. The first two rows show that children-selected
villages are more likely than other students to start school on time, and on average, start school

23
   In fact, the observed effects on enrollment (Table 4) and the probability that a village has a school (Table 3) strongly
suggest that the comparison lacks internal validity.
24
   Students are expected to start first grade at age 7. So, students are classified as age appropriate if their age is within
a year of their grade plus six.

                                                           -15-
overall at a younger age. The remaining columns show that other determinants of grade
progression are not likely factors. There is no difference in the probability that children skipped a
grade, experienced a break in schooling, or changed schools. There is a difference in grade
repetition, but this works in the opposite direction with students in selected villages more likely to
have been held back. 25

It is important to note that these results suggest that although access to high-quality schools can be
extremely beneficial; they alone are insufficient to ensure that a large percentage of students
complete primary school. These schools are effective at getting children into school. They also
seem to get children to start school at the right age and keep them in for longer periods of time.
However, even selected villages have low enrollment rates. For example, only 51 percent of
primary school aged students (ages 6-12) are currently enrolled in school. Additionally, as the
declining treatment effects in Figure 5 demonstrate, keeping students in school once they have
started is a challenge for all schools, even if BRIGHT schools may have a comparative advantage.

Finally, an important question is whether the BRIGHT schools have been able to sustain the large
impacts observed in 2008. However, both the current sample and tests are more expansive that the
previous ones, including both older children and a wider variety of test questions. To estimate
equivalent treatment effects, we restrict the current sample to the same set of students surveyed in
2008 (ages 6 through 12) and estimate the effects on test scores using only those competencies
included on the 2008 exams. 26 First, the effect on enrollment for these children has fallen from
18.5 percentage points to 14.9 percentage points. This small decline is likely due to the increase in
the presence of schools in unselected villages, and is in line with previous estimates of the likely
effect of the increased presence of schools in unselected villages. 27 The test score effect declined
during this period from 0.41 in 2008 to 0.23 in 2012, but comparing test scores is more difficult

25
   Teachers and administrators of individual schools make the decision about whether or not children progress to the
next grade. There is no standardized criteria or higher administrative unit that makes these decisions. Because students
in selected schools do have higher test scores on average, it may be that BRIGHT schools are setting higher promotion
standards than other schools. This could be another source of the quality difference in the two types of schools.
26
   The competencies for the current tests are listed in Tables A9 and A10 in the Appendix. The tests administered in
2008 were much shorter. The tests included only number identification, counting, greater–than/less-than, and single
digit addition and subtraction on the math test. The language test included letter identification, reading simple words,
and fill-in-the-blank in sentences.
27
   For example, in Kazianga (2013), we estimated that placing a non-BRIGHT school in a village caused an increase
in enrollment of 26.5 percentage points. In the intervening four years, the difference in the probability that a selected
village had a school dropped by 21.7 percentage points, implying that we should expect a decline in the treatment
effect by 5.8 percentage points, which is a bit larger than the observed decline in the effect.

                                                         -16-
because they are a function of more than enrollment. They are a function, for example, of both the
duration of enrollment or the highest grade achieved. However, like the results presented above
for the 2012 survey, we find that the treatment effect on test scores in the 2008 survey is also
entirely explained by the highest grade a child achieves, suggesting that the BRIGHT schools may
still be as productive relative to other schools as they were four years ago. 28



VI. Secondary Outcomes

A. Health

As shown in Table 3, schools in selected villages are more likely to have feeding programs and
preschools, and even absent the greater availability of the programs, children are more likely to
be enrolled and have access to them. This raises the possibility that the program may have
affected children’s health. We assess this possibility in Table 8. However, the data suggest that
the program has had no effect, likely due to low school enrollment levels.

First, we use the anthropometric measures described in Section III.C to assess directly whether
being selected for the BRIGHT program improved students’ growth. Across all outcomes, we
find no effect. Some care is required in evaluating the individual treatment effects because as
described in detail in the table notes, some of the measures are only available for a subset of the
children. However, for each of the measures that are only defined for a restricted sample, we re-
estimate the treatment effects for the less restrictive measures on the smaller sample in Panel A
of Table A11 of the Appendix. None of the estimated treatment effects is statistically significant
at conventional levels. 29

To investigate the lack of an effect, we estimate the child level treatment effects on participation
in the programs in Panel B of Table 8. Children are participating in the programs. Children living
in a village selected for BRIGHT are more likely to participate in school feeding programs,
participate for longer periods of time, and attend schools that offer dry rations programs.


28
   This is true if we include highest grade achieved linearly or as fixed effects. Results are available upon request.
29
   There are also a few clear outliers in the data. So, we also check the robustness of the results by estimating the
treatment effects while excluding outliers. These results are presented in Panel B of Table A11 in the Appendix.
Except for one outcome, we find no effects for each measure estimated on each subset of the data. Because this is the
only treatment effect estimate of 29 to be statistically significant, this is likely a spurious result.

                                                        -17-
However, when we look at consumption of food within the household in Panel C of Table 8, we
find no increases in the total amount of food consumed. The measure is, of course, because it
asks only whether a family member consumed the indicated food in the last two weeks rather
than measuring quantities, 30 but it is consistent with the observed lack of effects on children’s
growth. The lack of an effect on sorghum and millet is particularly surprising because these are
the grains distributed in the dry rations program. This pattern can be, however, explained by the
observation that millet and sorghum are two of the most common staples, and therefore most
households are likely to have eaten these staples in the last two weeks.

These results are in contrast to existing studies documenting the effectiveness of such programs
(such as Kazianga, de Walque, and Alderman 2014). The reason may be that although we
observe differential levels of participation in Panel B of Table 8, the magnitudes are small.
Children in selected villages are only 17 percentage points more likely to participate in a school
feeding program than the 23 percent of children participating in unselected villages. The net
effect is an additional 0.8 days in the program in addition to the day a week that students in
unselected villages spend in feeding programs. The treatment differential is a bit larger for dry
rations programs with children in selected villages being 30 percentage point more likely to
attend a school with such a program (and this difference seems largely to be due to programs
targeted at girls), but because only 6.6 percent of children in unselected villages participate in
these programs, the total number of children attending a school with a dry rations program is still
low. The main cause of these low participation rates is the low overall enrollment rates. If, for
example, we estimate the participation rates for enrolled children only, the estimates are much
higher: 75 percent participation in feeding programs in unselected villages with a 12.4
percentage point differential for selected villages, and 19 percent participation in dry rations
programs with a 58 percent differential in selected villages. 31 This suggests that the best strategy
for generating effects on children’s health may be to focus on further improving enrollment.




30
   We ask about all family members because evidence exists that take-home rations change the allocation of food
within the household and affect other family members (Kazianga, de Walque, and Alderman 2014).

                                                     -18-
B. Child Work

Attending school requires students not to engage in other activities during the time that they are
in class or studying. One of the main opportunity costs is work that the child might otherwise do
for pay or for the family. Analysis of the data from the 2008 survey found no effect of the
program on children’s work (Kazianga et al. 2013). 32 We assess the effects of the program using
the later data set on the same set of outcomes in Table 9. 33 In contrast to the earlier results, we
find that the program modestly reduced the number of children engaged in each activity by 2.5 to
5.9 percentage points. Given the fraction of children engaged in these activities in control
villages, this represents an average 9.2 percent relative decrease across all measures. Compiling
the outcome into a standardized composite work index, we find a reduction of 0.14 standard
deviations.

The increased school attendance documented above displaces child labor only modestly.
Presumably, even when children are enrolled in school, they still engage in some form of child
work, especially the tasks that are compatible with school hours. For instance, Kazianga, de
Walque and Alderman (2012) document how an increase in enrollment in rural Burkina Faso due
to a school feeding intervention did not reduce children participation in household chores.
Similarly, Kondylis and Manacorda (2012) find that school proximity in rural Tanzania increases
school attendance but has not significant effects on child labor.



VII. Heterogeneity

A. Heterogeneity by Gender

A key component of the BRIGHT program consists of services targeting girls’ enrollment. As a
result, we investigate whether the program had differential effects on girls in Table 10. Consistent
with the significant improvements in girl-friend infrastructure observed in Section IV.C, we find
that in the intervening four years, the program has become much more successful at targeting girls.

32
   It should be noted that de Hoop and Rosati (2014) find conflicting results, arguing that the program actually
increased children’s work in some specifications using the same data.
33
   The outcomes presented in Table 9 are limited to those in which at least 10 percent of children report participating.
We present the results for rarer forms of child work in Table A12 of the Appendix. We find no effect of the program
on these other measures. However, the effect on the aggregate work index is robust to the inclusion of these other
measures.

                                                         -19-
We disaggregate the effects by interacting the indicator for whether a village was selected with an
indicator set to one if the child is female.

We find that the program had significantly larger effects on girls than boys. Girls’ enrollment
increased by 11.3 percentage points more than boys, and their test scores increased by 0.21
standard deviations more. In total, girls reached 0.45 higher grade levels than boys, more than
eliminating the existing disparities in test scores and grade progression. These results are larger
than the differentials observed in the 2008 survey where we estimated a 4.7 percentage point
differential in enrollment for girls and found no difference in the effects on test scores.

These results have two important implications. First, the BRIGHT program more than eliminates
the gender gaps in education in a relatively short period of time—about seven years, thus
demonstrating how to achieve one of the priorities of the Millennium Development Goals. Second,
the impacts of BRIGHT on learning outcomes (particularly in math) contrast with the evidence of
gender gaps in test scores (particularly in math) documented in both high and low income countries
(Bharadwaj et al. 2015; Dickerson, McIntosh and Valente 2010; Fryer and Levitt 2010), and
suggest that within the right environment girls perform at least as well as boys in test scores,
including language and mathematics (e.g., Muralidharan and Sheth 2015).

Because many of the dry rations programs are also targeted at girls, we might also see larger effects
for girls’ growth. We assess this in Panel B, but as with the overall results, we find no differences
by gender. Additionally, because the dry rations were likely consumed by the entire family, we
also estimate differences in treatment effects for children who live in a household that includes a
school-aged girl as well as estimate differential effect by the number of school-aged girls. We find
no effect or differential effects for these specifications either. As with the overall results, these are
likely explained by the low overall enrollment rates. 34

There are also likely to be differential effects on child work given that girls are much more likely
than their brothers to do household work and that some components of the BRIGHT schools focus
on facilitating the enrollment of girls with specific household responsibilities. The preschools, for
example, were designed to allow girls who had to tend to their younger siblings to attend school.
These estimates are presented in Panel C. We find differential effects in the probability that girls


34
     These results are available upon request.

                                                  -20-
collect firewood and clean, and despite the null effects on the other outcomes, we find an overall
reduction in the work index of 0.11 standard deviations. Thus, the BRIGHT schools reduced the
number of children engaged in these activities overall, and also succeeded in further reducing the
rates for girls. 35



B. Heterogeneity by grade

The analysis of the individual components of the math and French tests broken down by grade
level is provided in Tables A9 and A10 of the online Appendix. In Table A9, columns 1 and 4
show the percentage of correct answers to the math tests and the standardized scores of the math
tests in nonselected villages, respectively. columns 2 and 4 show the estimated effect of BRIGHT
on each given characteristic, using the percentage of correct answers (column 2) and the
standardized test score (column 4).

Starting with the percentage of correct answers, we find that the program increased the math scores
at all grades and across all individual components of the tests. The program increased the test
scores by 0.81 percentage points in first grade, by 0.85 percentage points in second grade, and by
0.46 percentage points in third grade. The test scores by individual components increased from 2.4
to 13.7 percentage points in first grade, from 7.2 to 11.6 percentage points in second grade and
from 4.0 to 4.9 percentage points in third grade. Given the percentage of correct answers in control
villages, the estimates correspond to an average 16.7 percent relative increase in first grade, 66.7
percent increase in second grade, and 82.1 percent increase in third grade. Hence, the relative gains
in math increase with the grade levels, suggesting that the program effects accumulate through the
grades.

In column 5, we demonstrate that the standardized test score for students living in villages selected
for the BRIGHT program score 0.26 standard deviations higher than students in unselected villages
overall. Again, the estimated effect is consistent across all the sections of the tests and across all
grades.


35
  Given the availability of the preschools, we also estimate a triple interaction in which the treatment effect and gender
variables in Panel C are further interacted with the number of children under the age of 6 and an indicator for whether
or not there are children under the age of 6 in the household. We find no differential effects for either measure of
young children in the household. These results are available upon request.

                                                          -21-
We report the French test scores in Table A10, and the layout is similar to Table A9. Starting with
the percentage of correct answers, we find that in first grade, the program raised the test scores
between 9.1 and 13.8 percentage points. In second grade, the test scores increased by 11 percentage
points for “letter identification with accents” and by 10.1 percentage points for “matching word to
picture”. In third grade, the scores increased by 4.9 to 6.3 percentage points. The program effect
is consistently positive across all competencies and all grade levels. The relative increase in the
percentage of correct answers is 53: 5 percent for first graders, 67.5 percent for second graders and
93 percent for third graders. The pattern of increasing relative gains in grade levels virtually
matches the pattern observed for the math tests. Combining all test components and all grades, we
a relative increase of 64.1 percent.

The standardized test scores are shown in column 5. The test scores in selected villages increased
by 0.30 standard deviations in first grade, by 0.27 standard deviations in second grade and by 0.22
standard deviations in third grade. The combined effect is 0.30 standard deviations for all grades
and test components. These gains are also consistent across grades and individual test components.



VIII. Conclusion

The preceding analysis demonstrates the long-term sustainability of high-quality primary schools
with amenities designed to target the enrollment of girls. We find that seven years after the start of
the program, children in village selected to receive one of these schools are 15.4 percentage points
more likely to be enrolled in school and score 0.29 standard deviations higher on standardized
achievement tests. Children of all ages experience similar gains in enrollment, but older children
experience larger gains in learning than younger children. These differences in academic
achievement between village and children seem to reflect higher levels of grade progression in
selected villages among older children. We find no effect on children’s growth, but we find modest
reductions in children engagement in household work. Reflecting the emphasis on “girl-friendly”
amenities, these effects also accrue disproportionately to girls. Girls in selected villages have
significantly higher enrollment rates, test scores, and grade progression, and they are less likely to
engage in household work.

These results have important implications for future work. First, as part of the growing research
effort into the production function of primary schools, school starting age and grade promotion
may be important areas of research. The wide variations of ages that we observe in the primary
schools in this study are not unusual. Moreover, it may be that an important part of encouraging
children to complete primary school and matriculate at secondary schools is getting students to
start school on time. Conversely, although many studies focus on children in the targeted age
groups (for example, Burde and Linden 2013), older students may comprise a significant portion
of the benefits of primary school programs.

Additionally, although the emphasis on research into school enrollment is shifting to secondary
school enrollment in much of the developing world, more research into understanding why
families choose not to enroll their children in these poor performing countries may be necessary.
Although improved infrastructure seems to be highly effective in improving the enrollment rates
of children and, in particular, girls. Infrastructure alone may not be sufficient to bring the remaining
countries with low primary school enrollment rates into line with the rest of the developing world.
Despite the impressive relative effectiveness of these very well resourced primary schools, the
enrollment levels of villages selected for the program average only 47.6 percent. These low
participation rates may even limit the effectiveness of add-on programs like the school feeding and
dry-rations programs in the BRIGHT schools.

Note: Robsut standard errors in parentheses (clustered at the village level). *** Signficant at the 1 percent level, **
Significant at the 5 percent level, * Significant at the 10 percent level. This table presents estimates of the estimated
discontinuity in the relationship between a child's probability of being enrolled during the 2012-2013 academic year and
the child's village being selected for the BRIGHT program using the indicated specification for equation (1). Columns 1-6
show estimates of the model based on self-reported enrollment information. Column 7 uses a model based on whether or
not a child was directly observed in class during the survey of the child's school. Column 8 uses a model based on the
highest grade a child achieved in school, regardless of current enrollment. Relative score is measured in units of 1,000
points because of the small magnitude of the coefficients.

Note: This table presents evidence of the continuity of the various household asset and housing quality characteristics with respect to the relative score. For each
characteristic, Columns 1 and 3 present the average characteristic for children and households in villages that were not selected for the BRIGHT program
calculated using no control variables and a quadratic specification for the relative score function. Columns 2 and 4 present the estimated discontinuity in the
given characteristic using equation (1) with no control variables and a quadratic specification for the relative score function. Significance at the 1, 5 and 10 level
is indicated by ***, ** and * respectively.

Note: This table presents estimates of various school characteristics as reported on the household survey based on whether or not the child's
village was selected for the BRIGHT program. Only schools visited during the school survey are included. Column 1 presents the average
characteristics for schools children in villages that were not selected for the program attended calculated using no control variables and a
quadratic specification for the relative score function. Column 2 presents the estimated discontinuity in the given characteristic using equation (1)
with no control variables and a quadratic specification for the relative score function. Significance at the 1, 5 and 10 level is indicated by ***, **
and * respectively.

Note: This table presents estimates of child health characteristics using a consistent sample based on whether or not the child's village was selected for the BRIGHT program. Columns 1 and 3 present
the average characteristics of children in villages that were not selected for the program calculated using no control variables and a quadratic specification for the relative score function. Columns 2
and 4 present the estimated discontinuity in the given characteristic using equation (1) and including the indicated variable as a control in the regression. Panel A estimates do not exclude outliers,
whereas Panel B estimates exclude outliers greater than four standard deviations from the mean. Significance at the 1, 5 and 10 level is indicated by ***, ** and * respectively.

Note: This table presents estimates of the estimated discontinuity in the relationship between a child's probability of being enrolled during the 2012-2013 academic year
and the child's village being selected for the BRIGHT program using the indicated specification for equation (1). Columns 1 and 6 show estimates of the model based on
self-reported enrollment information. Columns 4 and 9 use a model based on the highest grade a child achieved in school, regardless of current enrollment. Relative score
is measured in units of 1,000 points because of the small magnitude of the coefficients. Column (2) only includes those students who completed the math assessment.
Columns (5) and (10) use the number of "types" of chores completed by a child in a given week. Significance at the 1, 5 and 10 level is indicated by ***, ** and *
respectively.
