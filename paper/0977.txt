                      Labor Force Participation:
                        Timing and Persistence


                               ABSTRACT




     This paper examines the relative importance of timing and persistence

 elements in explaining cyclical fluctuations in labor supply. Data from

 the natural experiment provided by World War II and cross—sectional data

 on American local labor markets, as well as aggregate time—series data

 are used in the empirical work. We find little evidence that timing

 effects play an important role in labor market dynamics. The evidence

 suggests that views emphasizing persistence are more accurate, and that

previous employment tends to raise the probability of subsequent employment.

     Much of the development of applied economic theory within the past

25 years has emphasized the importance of viewing economic decisions in a

life cycle context. Consumption decisions are today frequently viewed

as being determined by wealth or permanent income. The human capital

revolution has brought life cycle considerations to the forefront of

modern labor economics. While the life cycle dynamics of labor force

participation decisions have important implications for macroeconomic

theory and policy, they have received relatively little empirical at-

tention. With the notable exceptions of Lucas and Rapping (1969) and

Hall (1980), none of the large body of work on cyclical fluctuations

in employment has explicitly relied on a dynamic model of labor supply.1

     This paper uses several types of data to examine two elements of

participation dynamics. The first is the aspect of "timing" which is

implicit in the work of Lucas and Rapping, and in Mincer's (1966) early

discussion of hidden unemployment. The timing argument, which is presented

most explicitly in Ghez and Becker (1975)? holds that leisure is easily

substitutable across periods. Hence relatively small transitory move-

ments in the perceived real wage or real rate of return can have large

effects on the path of labor supply as individuals time their partici-

pation to coincide with periods of high transitory wages. On the other

hand, permanent changes, because they do not affect the timing decision,

are expected to .have a much smaller effect on participation.

     It is this view of labor supply which underlies new classical macro—

economic models. The dependence is made explicit in Lucas (1975), who
                                   —2--




 claims that "what we do know indicates that leisure in one period is an

 excellent substitute for leisure in other nearby periods." The ability

 of classical macroeconomic models to explain fluctuations in employment

 depends on the presence of strong intertemporal substitution effects.

Unless leisure is very substitutable across periods, large observed

 cyclical variations in employment could not possibly be caused by the

response of labor supply to the relatively small fluctuations which are

 found in real wages and real interest rates.

     It is by now clear that models in which only timing elements are

present cannot fully account for cyclical fluctuations. The restrictions

imposed by rationality imply that the expectational errors which gene-

rate business cycles are serially uncorrelated. The serial correlation

which is characteristic of business cycles can only be explained in terms

of mechanisms which cause shocks to be propagated over several periods.

While Lucas (1975), Blinder and Fischer (1980) and Sargent (1980) have

considered alternative explanations of persistence in the demand for

labor, little attention has been devoted to the question of persistence

in labor supply, To a substantial extent, a demonstration of substantial

persistence in labor supply decisions undercuts the plausibility of models

based on a high elasticity of labor supply with respect to transitory wage

movements since it is difficult to see why a long—run decision should be

strongly responsive to transitory developments.

     The second element of labor force dynamics which we consider is

embodied in the "persistence" hypothesis, In this view, past work ex—
                                  —3--




 perience is a key determinant of current employment status. Because of

high separation costs and costs of finding new employment, those who are

 employed tend to remain employed. Persistence of employment might also

be rationalized on human capital grounds. Those who are employed longer

tend to accumulate more human capital, which raises the return to work

in the future relative to leisure. Those out of the labor force may also

develop household—specific capital or commitments (i.e., children) which

reduce the return to working relative to remaining outside the labor force.

There is also some reason to believe that the taste for work may be af-

fected by work experience. Such habit formation effects have been well

documented in demand analysis.2

     This aspect of labor force dynamics appears to be quite important

in microeconometric studies of employment patterns. Freeman (1977) pre-

sents extensive evidence indicating that the probability of separation

from employment declines with the duration of employment. This result

is obtained separately for voluntary separation (quits) in Freeman

(l977b) and for voluntary separations (layoffs) in Medoff (1979). Of

course it is possible that this pattern results from individual hetero-

geneity. Those with high withdrawal possibilities are less likely to be

observed as employed than those with low probabilities. Heterogeneity

has been considered by Heckman (1978) and Yatchew (1977) as an explana-

tion of persistence in labor force participation; both conclude that at

least for married women, true state dependence exists. Chamberlain (1978)

has devised a methodology for estimating the size of the persistence effect.

He finds that, after controlling for individual differences, prior experience
                                  —4—



raises the odds of participation by a factor of seven. Other researchers

have found evidence that persons with employment experience are more likely

to be re—employed quickly when unemployed. Persistence effects of this

magnitude imply that any measure which affects employment will have import-

ant long—run effects.

     The differing macroeconomic implications of models in which timing or

persistence effects predominate are highlighted by the following example.

In an economy which is initially in equilibrium, the government unexpectedly

undertakes expansionary policy.3 Irrespective of whether timing or per-

sistence predominates, the initial impact of the change is an increase in

employment and labor force participation. However, timing and persistence

effects are opposite in the longer run. An extreme version of the timing

hypothesis would hold that individuals desire to spend a fixed proportion

of their lives in the labor force which they schedule to coincide with peri-

ods of maximum opportunity. If this is the case, labor supply after the

shock will be less than it would have been had the shok never occurred,

as individuals "schedule" themselves out of the labor force.

     Such scheduling effects have been used to counter arguments that the

fluctuations in participation that accompany changes in the unemployment

rate imply a significant discouraged worker effect.4 What appears to be

discouragement is actually the effect of individuals timing their parti-

cipation to coincide with periods of maximum opportunity. When timing

predominates, output gains from expansionary policy are illusory. They

will be cancelled by a reduction in subsequent output as workers time
                                  —5—



their withdrawal from the labor force. Thus, models with strong inter—

temporal substitution effects imply that a transitory increase in the

real wage will reduce subsequent labor supply. Moreover, a permanent

upgrading of opportunities in a timing world would imply a much smaller

increase in participation than observed in the short run because sche-

duling effects would no longer occur.

     Persistence effects, however, yield a long—run increase in labor

supply. Short—run increases in employment will tend to persist as workers

remain in the labor force because of habit formation, adjustment costs,

or human capital accumulation. Hence, concurrent changes, on this view

understate the total increment to output from expansionary policy. The

effects of persistence described here potentially complement the process
                                                                5
of worker upgrading discussed in Okun (1973), and Thurow (1976).

     The relative empirical importance of timing and persistence effects in

labor supply is an issue with important implications for macroeconomic theory

and policy. Both effects essentially deny the "natural rate" hypothesis

as a medium—run proposition. They imply that policy can have an extended

impact on the rate of employment without repeatedly fooling economic agents,

because in both views labor supply is conditioned by past employment ex—

pe.rience.6 It is this link which translates short—run policy effects into

longer—run impacts. As is clear from the preceding discussion, timing and

persistence effects have exactly the opposite implications for the long—run

direction of expansionary policy. This paper is directed at determining

their relative importance in economic fluctuations.

     The next section of the paper examines a natural experiment which

potentially can shed light on the question at hand. During World War II,

the level of female employment and participation rose precipitously. We

examine the aftermath of the conflict to see whether the war had a positive

or negative impact on subsequent female participation. The third section

of the paper lays the groundwork for the econometric analysis, by outlining

a simple model of life cycle labor supply which is capable of embodying both

timing and persistence effects. The model developed in this section can be

examined using several types of data. Section 4 of the paper uses the model

to examine the relative importance of timing and persistence effects in ac-

counting for the time—series behavior of the aggregate labor force partici-

pation rate. The fifth section of the paper examines the timing and per-

sistence effects using cross—section data. Essentially, the analysis relies

on the observation that differences in unemployment over time are dominated

by transitory movements, whereas geographic differences are for the most

part permanent. The sixth section of the paper summarIzes the empirical

results and discusses their implications.

 Section 2: The Impact of World War II

     Before developing a formal model of life cycle labor supply, it is

instructive to examine the one natural experiment which history has pro—

vided.    The Second World War period and its aftermath offer an ideal

testing ground for timing and persistence effects. From 1940 to 1944 real

output in the United States increased 46.4% while the unemployment rate

fell from 14.6 to 1.2 percent and averaged 1.3 percent from 1943—1945.

The expansion in real output occurred at a time when large numbers of men

were drawn into the Armed Forces increasing the job prospects and potential

earnings of women, After 1945, unemployment rose slightly but remained

below 4.0 percent through 1948. In the recession of 1949, the unemployment

rate rose 2.1 points to 5.9%. The decade of the 1940's provides a good

example of a large spurt in aggregate demand followed by a return to normal

growth,

     In perhaps the first statement of the timing hypothesis Milton Friedman

underscored the instructive quality of the World War II period:

        the reaction to a higher wage rate expected to be temporary
     and then to revert to a lower level will tend to be very different
     than the reaction to a higher wage rate expected to be permanent.
     The temporarily higher wage rate would seem more likely to bring
     forth an increased quantity of labor from a fixed population than
     a pernianently higher one, since there would be strong temptation
     to take advantage of the opportunity while it lasts and to buy
     leisure later.

    An interesting case in point is the experience of the United States
    during World War II, when both the fraction of the population in
    the labor force and the average number of hours worked per week
    were substantially higher than during the pre—war period.7

Friedman proyldes no explicit empirical analysis of changes in participation

oyer the period yet it is implicit in his discussion that World War II marked
                                  —8—



a period of transitory wage gains which ought to be followed by an increased

purchase of leisure in later years. This effect should have been accentuated

by the large buildup of wealth which took place during the War. In contrast,

if persistence effects were dominant market attachment would have increased

with increased work experience, and World War II would have had a long—run

positive impact on observed participation.

     The issue of long—run versus transitory effects seems particularly im-

portant for the female labor force, and particularly for married women. Since

almost all able males are always in the labor force, there is little variation

in male participation and thus little to be learned about the impact of tran-

sitory movements in job opportunities and wages. Females participate much

less than men, and their behavior appears to be much more sensitive to labor

market conditions. Moreover, because of the large increase in the Armed

Forces and the consequent increase in job opportunities, women were parti-

cularly affected by the expansion of demand during World War II.

     The impact of World War II on the participation oT adult women is docu-

mented in Table i.8 From 1890—1940, the participation rate of adult women

25—64 increased from 13.9 to 25.7 percent, a compounded annual rate of in-

crease of 1.2 percent per year. In striking contrast, between 1940 and 1944,

the participation rate rose 23.5 percent (25.7 to 32.5) or 6.0 percent per

year. Among married women, participation increased 2.5 percent per year

from 1890 to 1940 (4.6 to 15.6), but a remarkable 11.3 percent from 1940 to

1944 (15.6 to 23.9), The marked increase in participation of married women

was not confined to a specific age group. After rising very slowly in the

 twenty—year period before 1940, for example, participation by married

women ages 45—64 more than doubled in the early years of the war.

     The data in Table I suggest that the war had a major impact on the

market behavior of adult women, particularly those who were married.9 The

data also suggest that the increase in participation was not short—lived.

Table lipresents projected values of labor force participation, based on

trends estimated dyer the periods 1890—1930 and 1890—1940, for married

women and adult women 25—64. Comparison of actual and predicted values

confirms the long—term effects of the war. For adult women 25—64, the

trend fitted through 1940 predicts the 1940 participation rate, but the

actual rate remains above the trend throughout the subsequent decade. The

results for married women are even more striking; the actual rate averages
                                                                 10
24.7 percent above the trend for the three time periods noted.

     The failure of the participtin rate to fall below the trend after

the transitory developments of the war had passed seems to be evidence

that persistence effects dominated the effects of timing. It is important

to note that both effects seem to have been present. The fact that we observe

a decline in participation after 1945 suggests that a significant number of

women responded to the extraordinary opportunities of that period, and then

scheduled themselves out of the labor force in subsequent years. Yet there

is little support for a strong version of the timing hypothesis, which would

have predicted a fall of labor supply below trend after the war. It seems

evident that strong persistence effects were at work. Indeed, the labor

have been permanently increased by World War II.

     To alternative explanations of the apparent positive long—run effect

of the war experience deserve further comment. First, it is frequently

argued that the war brought changes in social attitudes towards women in

the workplace. However, these changes were caused in large part by the

increase in the number of women working during the war. Changes in atti-

tudes should be viewed as factors through which the effect of employment

experience on long—run increases in participation is mediated. That work

experience during the war affected attitudes is evident in a 1944 survey

conducted by the United Auto Workers)° Half of the women surveyed, who

had never worked in a factory before the war, professed a desire to con-

tinue in a factory after the war. Over 85% desired to remain employed in

some capacity.11 The view that the increased participation of women was

due to a general change in attitudes rather than the conditioning effect

of wartime experience is also belied by a comparison of cohort participa-

tion rates. The participation rate of women 20—24, who were not directly

affected by the war actually fell between 1940 and 1950. If the change

in attitudes were general, it would have been expected to rise along with

other participation rates.

     A second explanation of the long—run increase in female participation

following the war relies on the argument that reduced discrimination and

increased productivity led to a rise in the permanent relative wage of women
                                    — 14 —




following    World War II, and thus to an increase in participation. Insofar

as this reflected human capital accumulation during the war, it is consistent

with persistence effects. However, there is not much evidence that the

male—female wage differential fell between the immediate pre— and post—war
           12
periods.
     The results presented in this section, while quite suggestive, are

based on relatively fragmentary data. While there is an indication in the

data that persistence effects dominated timing effects, this conclusion de—

serves much more careful scrutiny. In the next section we develop the model

which underlies the more sophisticated econometric analysis of the timing

and persistence effects presented in subsequent sections.

 empirical work in this study. The model follows closely that of Lucas—

 Rapping (.1969), However, it does differ in several respects, notably

 the treatment of expectations and our focus on participation rather

 than aggregate labor supply, Because much of the focus of this study

 is on how past behavior as well as expected future developments influ—

 ence participation it is necessary to employ a three—period framework,

 rather than the more common two—period formulation.

         Individuals are assumed to maximize an intertemporal utility func—

 ton of the forrn;


     U                                                                (1)


where c represents consumption and 9 represents leisure, measured as a

prcporton of total time endowment, The period t—l is assumed to repre-

sent the entire past, and the period t+l embodies the whole future. It

is assumed that the ndiyidual at time t      takes   consumption and labor

supply decialons in period t—l as given.

     Individuals maximize the utility function (1), taking as predeterm-

ined previous employment experience, and the level of assets At, which

may be positive or negative, The solution to the maximization problem

will depend on their expectations of future nominal wages, w+i, future

prices          and the interest rate r. The budget constraint holds that

1ifetime consumption cannot exceed lifetime earnings,

        Since the focus of this analysis is on the participation decision,
the first—order conditions for the maximization of (1) are of little con-

cern. It suffices to observe that an interior maximum with positive

participation will occur if the market wage w, exceeds the reservation

wage w*, The reservation wage, w, is the minimum wage at which an in—

dividtial will supply a positive amount of labor, that is, join the labor

force.

        For the moment we assume, following Lucas and Rapping, that the

labor market is in equilibrium, though this assumption will be relaxed

subsequently. If the iabpr market is in equilibrium, the prevailing

market wage is potentially available to any possible participants. The

reservation wage will depend on tastes, past employment, future oppor-

tunities and assets, This may be written as:
                              e       e

        w f((1_Zi) p ,        ••,
                             wtl_l   Pt+1
                             (l+r) (l+r)

Notice that we assume here that economic agents know the true price

level at each point in time and so rule out misperceptions of the types

stressed in same recent macroeconomic models,

        The central qustion of this paper can be posed in terms of the

signs   of   the derivatives of w with respect to the arguments in (2). The

standard assumption that leisure is a normal good yields the unambiguous

conclusion  that f4 > 0, that is, an increase in wealth, ceteris paribus,
raises the reservation wage, The signs of the effects of the other
variables    in (2) depend on the form of the utility function (1).

      Consider first the sign of f1, the impact of previous employment

 experience on current labor supply. With assets held constant, previous

employment will affect the reservation wage only insofar as it affects

the marginal rate of substitution between current leisure and consump—

tion. The types of arguments usually put forward in discussions of

intertemporal substitution suggest that                  is negative. In-
                                            '-

creases in previous work effort raise the marginal disutility of cur-

rent labor. Formulations adopting this assumption explicitly have

been used by Sargent (1980) and Kydland and Prescott (1981). The

effect however is theoretically ambiguous. In the presence of adjust-

ment costs, habit formation effects, or accumulation of "leisure capital"

the sign can easily be positive.

     The effects of changes in the other arguments of (2) can be analyzed

in a similar fashion. Both expected future wages and prices have uncer-

tain effects, Increases in future wages have a negative income effect

on current labor supply. The substitution effect depends on the sign

of U+i, If it is positive, the substitution effect is positive and

leisure today and in the future are complements. In the case of an ad—
                                                                              13
ditively separable utility function _____        is unambiguously negative.

This illustrates that past experience and future opportunities do not

have symmetric effects, since past employment experience has no effect

in this case, The difference arises essentially because of the income

effects of future wage changes. Increases in expected future prices

have a positive income effect on labor supply, and an ambiguous substi—

     So far the theory has been developed for a single individual. People

will in general differ in both their tastes and market opportunities as

well as in their previous experience and asset accumulation. As a result

there will exist a joint distribution of market and reservation wages.

The aggregate participation rate L5 is then given by:


     LS =          g(w,w*) dw dw*                                                (3)
             fJ
             w >   w
It is readily apparent that                  >    0:   an increase in wages available to

all workers will unambiguously raise the participation rate. The so—called

"added worker" effect cannot exist in this model. Essentially, this is

because at zero labor supply, increases in the wage do not change income.

Income effects could be brought in if labor supply was modelled as the

result of joint maximizaton by individuals within a family. They may also

arise from changes in non—contemporaneous wages.

     It follows from (3) that the participation rate is a function of the

wage level, and the determinants of the shadow wage. Recognizing that the

labor supply relation is homogeneous of degree zero in wages and and prices

leads to the labor supply function:
                                      e             e

                                                                     '




where LS is the fraction of the population in the labor force. For conve-

nience we assume a logarithmic functional form. Equation (5) may then be

rewritten as:
                                      — 19 —

     + 4      ________   +    fl At
     Equation   (5) differs from the Lucas—Rapping formulation in that the

term (l_Pi) is included, reflecting the assumed dependence of the demand

for leisure on leisure enjoyed during the preceding period. While such a

dependence would seem to be a clear property of the Lucas-Rapping model,

it is lost in the translation into their estimating equation. The term

(l-.i)   does appear in their equation but only as a result of a Koyck
transformation. While they expect and obtain a      positive impact of pre-

vious labor supply, it is    clear from the above   discussion that the effect

is actually ambiguous. A strong form of the timing hypothesis would pre-

dict a negative effect of lagged labor supply (apart from its role as a

distributed lag generator).

     At this point, it is useful to consider the expected signs of         .   .   . ,t3.
The signs depend on the relative importance of persistence and timing elements

in luctuations in labor supply. A key parameter is , the elasticity of

current labor supply with respect to past employment experience. Sufficiently

large intertemporal substitution effects would insure that        < 0 so that in-

creases in experience reduce subsequent participation. On the other hand,

persistence effects imply l > 0 so that increases in employment experience

raise the participation rate.     The coefficient of      is expected to be posi-

tive, as increases in contemporaneous real wages raise the attractiveness
                                    — 20 —




of   seeking work. The sign of     depends on the relative size of timing and

persistence effects. If timing elements predominate,       will be negative as

increases in expected wages cause labor supply to decline because of inter—

temporal substitution effects. In the context of a model like that of Lucas

and Rapping, one would expect that 2 +        0, since the long—run wage

elasticity of labor supply is expected to be small. If adjustment costs or

capital accumulation effects cause labor supply decisions to have a perma-

nent character, the sign of      will be positive. The sign of     is

ambiguous while     is expected to be negative.

      Equation (5) as it stands is a labor supply curve. If the labor market

were always in equilibrium, it could be estimated directly using the employ-

ment ratio (proportion of the population who are employed) as the dependent

variable. If, however, the labor market does not always clear, the level of

employment cannot be taken as measure of desired labor supply. However, a

measure of supply is provided by the labor force participation rate, the

proportion of the population looking for work or workihg, This variable is

the measure of labor supply used in this study. However, estimates using

employment as the dependent variable are also discussed.

      It is important to be clear about the issues involved in choosing be-

tween the employment and participation rates as dependent variables in

equation (5). Lucas and Rapping take the position that an equation like

(5) characterizes the level of employment, not the participation rate. On

their hypothesis, workers who choose not to work because of a transitory

decline in wages show up as unemployed and so are counted as labor force

participants. Thus their argument implies that studying the labor force

participation rate would obscure the important intertemporal substitution
                                    — 21 —




 effects   of wage changes. Although estimates of equation (5) using employment

 are presented below, we regard the Lucas—Rapping interpretation of the unem-

 ployment rate as problematic for several reasons. First, it provides no

 explanation for the fluctuations in the participation rate which account for

 a sizeable part of observed employment fluctuations. Second, unemployment

 is defined as inability to find work at prevailing wages. Individuals who

 are intertemporally substituting out of employment presumably know the pre-

 vailing wage, and do not desire work. They should therefore not report

 themselves as unemployed. Finally, our previous analysis, Clark and Summers

 (1979), of individual unemployment experience suggests that the assumption

 of continuous labor market equilibrium is very problematic.

     Once the possibility that the labor market may not clear is recog-

nized, it is necessary to modify equation (5). When involuntary unemploy-

ment exists, the assumption that all who want them can get jobs at the pre—

vailing wage is no longer appropriate. Individual decisions regarding labor

supply will be affected by the knowledge that search costs are higher when

unemployment is higher. Since the mean duration of a completed spell of

employment in the United States is only about 20 months (Clark and Summers

1979a), relatively small changes in the duration of pre—employment search

can have a large impact on the return to seeking employment. By increasing

the duration of search as well as by reducing the pooi of good jobs, and

increasing the risk of layoff, unemployment discourages labor supply. We

thus include the unemployment rate as an additional explanatory variable

in some of our empirical work. In the next two sections we estimate alter-

native forms of (5) using both aggregate time—series and cross—section

data for different demographic groups.

Section 4: Time—Series Evidence
      This section describes the estimation of (5) using time—series data.

Before the model can be estimated, it is necessary to develop operational

measures of the variables. Both the proxy for previous employment expert—

ence and the measurement of expectations of inflation and the real wage re-

quire discussion. In equation (5) previous experience is represented simply

by (l_tl). This term is supposed to represent       the entire past experience
of   a population group. Using simply the previous yearTs employment experi-

ence would be inappropriate since the logic of both the timing and persis-

tence effects suggests current labor supply is conditioned by a longer

history. We therefore follow the work of Houthakker and Taylor (1970) in

developing a measure of the "stock" of past employment. We assume that

the labor supply of a cohort depends on a set of variables Z (such as those

contained in (5)) and on its past employment experience. Past employment

experience is assumed to be represented by;


      E* —

                 V
                 L.

                      1

where L is the lag operator. Since participation is a function of this

stock and the set of variables Z it is clear that:


             =            +                                        (7)



where PRt is the participation rate. Using (6) the model can be expressed

in terms of observables as:


       FR =               — ZtiA + XPR + iEi.                      (8)
                                          — 23 —




 Alternatively,     as discussed in the previous section, the employment ratio

 could be taken as the dependent variable. Using equation (5) and (8), and

 appropriate measures for participation, employment and Z, the most general

 specification of our estimating equation can be written


        PR         + iEti +        + 3tWf +             +         + 6t +    XPRi
                                                                                       (9)

where t   indicates   time,    is the contemporaneous real wage,               and

are expected future discounted wages and prices, Eiis the ratio of em-

ployment to population in the previous period,                   is a measure of the
                                                            14
unemployment rate, and v is an error term in M.                  The time trend has been

included to reflect the possible influence of slowly changing determinants

not captured by other included variables. In this formulation, the coeffi-

cient        measures the persistence of labor supply, while A reflects the lag

in formation of the habit stock. The long—run impact of an increase in em—

ployment experience is         .   This   may be interpreted in two different ways.

It represents the increase in the participation rate at time t,              if employment
in all previous periods were raised by one unit. It also can be interpreted

as the sum over all future periods of the increases in participation arising

from a one—shot increase in employment.

     Equation (6) gives us a way of measuring the employment stock and de-

riving the estimating equation in (9); the second issue which must be con-

sidered is the development of measures of expected wages and prices. Most

standard econometric procedures seem inappropriate because theory suggests
                                   — 24 —




that   labor supply should depend on the expected discounted value of wages

and prices over a long horizon. Our procedure for medelling expectations

begins with an estimate of a set of vector auto—regressions relating wages,

prices, and real output.15 These vector auto—regressions are then simulated

using data for each year in the sample to generate forecasts of wages and

prices for the succeeding 5 years. These variables,               are then ad-

justed to an after—tax basis and discounted back to year t,       using   year t's
                                                                             e

       This procedure is somewhat arbitrary in its choice of horizon and in

the specification of the vector auto—regressions. However, it seems to be
                                     — 25 —




 the   only computationally feasible way of handling the modelling of expecta-

 tions which are more than one period ahead. Rational expectations techniques

 of the sort developed by McCallum (1976) are not applicable in the. current

 example because of the quasi—differencing involved in moving to equation (8).

       The data used in the actual estimation cover the period 1951— 1981. We

 have chosen to use annual data because timing and persistence effects are

 likely to be badly confounded with seasonal fluctuations in higher frequency

 data, Our measures of the participation rate and employment ratio are age—

 adjusted rates calculated as fixed weight averages of age-specific rates.

This age—adjusted participation rate is used to avoid biases introduced by

the changing age structure of the population.

       In the results reported below, we have omitted assets from the estimating

equation. Like others before us (e.g. Lucas and Rapping (1969)), we found

assets to have no significant relationship to participation. This conclusion

is based on an assets measure which includes the real value of household finan-

cial holdings, excluding equity. A variety of other aèsets measures which

included equity, housing and social security wealth were tried with little

change in the results,

       Several econometric issues arise in the estimation of equation (9).

First, the equation is highly non—linear in the parameters, necessitat-

ing non—linear estimation. Second, the error term v is likely to be

serially correlated. Even if the error term in equation (7) relating

participation to Z and E* were not serially correlated, the transforma-

tion of E* involved in deriving the estimating equation would induce

moving average error. Serial correlation in the error term is parti—
                                   —26—


cularly serious in this case because both lagged participation and employment

are included in the regression equation. Since there is no reason to suppose

that the error in (8) follows a simple auto—regressive scheme, the usual

corrections (e.g. Cochrane-Orcutt) are not appropriate. We have chosen to

estimate the equation using two—stage non—linear least squares, treating

both lagged participation and employment as endogenous. The instrument

list includes a time trend, a squared trend, real Federal government spending,

the rate of money growth and the real per—capita stock of non—residential

capital, along with the included exogenous variables. In addition, to

allow for simultaneity, the contemporaneous wage is treated as endogenous.

      A third econometric difficulty is collinearity,which frequently pre-

cludes disentangling estimates of A, which determines the mean lag of the

"past employment" effect, and       the impact effect of changes in employment

experience. Frequently, the estimated values of A lie outside the range

o <   A<l,   and so the equations are not meaningful. Therefore, in many of

the equations reported below, the value of A is constrained to the a priori

plausible value of .9. None of the qualitative conclusions were affected

by the imposition of this constraint. In particular, all of the conclu-

sions regarding the effects of transitory wage changes are wholly unaffected

by the choice of A.

      Table III presents estimates of several variants of equation (9) using

the log of the participation rate as the dependent variable. The results

do not suggest that timing effects have an important role to play in ex-

plaining cyclical fluctuations. The estimated elasticity of labor supply

with respect to a transitory wage change is always small and sometimes

negative. Nor is there any clear evidence of a negative relationship

between expected future wages and labor supply, as predicted by models
which emphasize timing effects. No clear conclusions emerge about the

effects of changes in the price of future consumption. It is noteworthy

that the increases in the unemployment rate of mature men do appear to reduce

the participation rate, as theory predicts.

     The data provide weak support for the importance of persistence in

explaining fluctuations in labor supply. It is not possible to interpret
                                                             (3)—(5) of Table
the estimated effect of employment experience in equations

III because the estimated value of X lies outside its permissible range.

In equation (8), where a time trend is not included, the estimated effect

of the "employment stock" variable is both substantivcly and statistically

significant. However, when a time trend is included as in equation (6)

and (7), the "employment stock" coefficient remains positive but becomes

insignificant. Estimates using the employment—population ratio as a de-

pendent variable are reported in Table IV. The results are qualitatively

similar to those obtained using the participation rate as a dependent

variable. Here the evidence of persistence effects is very weak. Even

when the time trend is omitted as in equation (6) of the table, the em-

ployment stock variable is statistically insignificant. Not surprisingly,

the cyclical indicator, UN, enters the employment equations in a highly

significant way.

     The time—series evidence presented here suggests that transitory vari-

ations in the perceived real wage have little effect on the rate of labor

force participation. We find no indication in the data of the strong inter—

temporal substitution effects which are the basis of classical macro models.

These findings on the effect of transitory wage changes are consistent

with the positive impact of lagged employment found in Table III.

While the quality of the evidence on lagged employment precludes

strong conclusions, the results suggest that work may be habit—forming.

Clearly, if experience in employment persists so that the decision to work

is a relatively long—term commitment, it is not surprising that transitory

wage changes have no discernible effect on labor supply.

     These results conflict quite sharply with those of Hall (1980), who

finds that the data support the intertemporal substitution hypothesis. Part

of the conflict may lie in Hall's inclusion of fluctuations in hours per

worker. The most serious problem, however, is Hall's measurement of the

"intertemporal substitution parameter." He assumes that labor supply deci-

sions are driven only by the price of future consumption in terms of today's

labor, It is difficult to see what utility function would have this prop-

erty in which the current price of consumption and future price of leisure

are irrelevant. Our findings are consistent with the generally negative

results obtained by Altonji (1982), and Mankiw, Rotemberg and Suirners (1982)

regarding the intertemporal substitution hypothesis.

 Section 5: Cross—Section Evidence

      The comparison of the relationships between labor market variables

 which are observed in time—series and cross—section data can shed light

 on the importance of timing and persistence effects. In particular,

 this section shows that recognizing the distinction between transitory

 and permanent effects embodied in the two hypotheses provides a frame-

work for reconciling the large differences between cross—sectional and

 time—series estimates of the relationship between unemployment and

participation rates, The conflict between these two types of evidence

emerged in the early 1960ts when several studies found large discouraged

worker effects using decennial census data on local participation and

unemployment rates, while other studies found very small effects using

time—series data (Long 1958, Barth 1968, Bowen and Finnegan 1969).

     Attempts to reconcile the divergent results have generally focused

on possible biases in the cross—section evidence, In his often cited

review of the evidence Ni-ricer (1966) conjectured that cross—section

estimates were biased by omission of migration, seasonal differences

across SMSA's in census timing and common errors in the rate of parti-

cipation and unemployment which give rise to a spurious association.

Mincer also noted but did not pursue the permanence of state unemploy—

merit differentIals. Bowen and Finnegan (1969) have examined each of

these possibilities and suggest that none can satisfactorily explain

the difference between the two sets of estimates.'7 More recent at-

tempts to resolve the anomaly (e.g. Fleisher and Rhodes 1976) have

also been unpersuasive18
                                    — 32 —




       These results suggest that cross—section and time-series estimates

cannot be reconciled by pointing to biases in the cross—section data. A

potentially more fruitful approach is to recognize the fundamental dif-

ferences between intertemporal and interspatial variations in unemploy-

ment. At any point in time in any labor market the rate of unemployment

is composed of both a permanent and a transitory component. In cross—

section data, most yariation in unemployment is presumably due to vari-

ation in the permanent component across regions. This is in contrast

to the aggregate tijne—series data where variation in the transitory

component is likely to be dominant. Cast in these terms, the cross—

section data provide estimates of the long run or permanent effect of

unemployment, while transitory effects are captured with time—series

data
       At this point, it is important to be clear about the interpreta-

tion of the measured unemployment rate. In this section, we adopt the

'traditional'T interpretation, which holds that the labor market does

not clear and that the unemployment rate affects the attractiveness

of seeking work. It is then meaningful to speak of the effect of

changes in differences in unemployment rates on labor force partici—

pation rates. We prefer the traditional interpretation of the unem-

ployment rate to that of Lucas and Rapping for several reasons. Most

important, the substantial permanent component in the differences be-

tween local unemployment rates suggest that they are not consequences

of transitory wage movements, In addition, the evidence that parti-

cipation and unemployment rates are negatively correlated is difficult
                                  —33—



 to account for in the classical view, Indeed, in its strong form, it

 lacks an explanation for fluctuations in the participation rate. Other

 results described below also incline us towards the "traditional" inter-

pretation of unemployment fluctuations,

           In order to reconcile the time—series and cross—section esti-

mates, it is necessary to examine the relationship between transitory

and permanent effects, and to establish the conditions under which the

permanent effect dominates, This is precisely the issue discussed in

Section 3 which distinguishes the timing and persistence effects. There

we found that persistence effects imply that employment in previous

periods raises current participation. Short—run effects persist. If

persistence effects predominate, the response of labor supply to perma—

rient changes in demand should exceed the response to transitory changes.

This prediction, which is borne out by the data, is not consistent with

strong forms of the timing hypothesis, which imply that the response to

transitory fluctuations should exceed the response to permanent changes.

     It thus would seem that the predominance of persistence effects re-

ceives substantial support in the comparison of cross—section and time—series

evidence, Similar support emerges from a comparison of transitory and

permanent effects using cross—section data. Use of cross—section data

provides a strong test of the relative importance of timing and persis-

tence effects since the two views of labor force dynamics have sharply

different implications for the appropriate demand variable in cross—

sectional equations, The timing view holds that the important determ—

Inant of participation is the deviation of demand from its normal level.
                                      —34—



When it is above its normal level, workers schedule themselves into

the labor force, leaving when it falls below normal.   The persistence

view, on the other hand, implies that the normal level of demand is

the appropriate variable since workers make labor supply decisions on

a long—term basis.

     The model embodied in this discussion can easily be made explicit.

It is assumed that the level of demand may be represented by ER, the

proportion of those desiring work who have it (1 — the unemployment rate).

We postulate that participation in region i, PR., depends on the perma-

nent level of demand, ER1, and the level of transitory demand, ER, de-

fined as (ER1     ER'5, A simple characterization of the participation

equation is given by;

             f(ER', ER, z1)                                       (10)
     PRi

where Z. is a vectbr of variables other than demand conditions which
       1

influence   the participation rate.

     As the discussion in the preceding paragraph makes clear, the per-

sistence view predicts that ER will be large while ER is not impor-

tant; the timing hypothesis has the opposite implication.   The distinction

between the two hypotheses may be drawn more sharply by considering their

implications for a change in the normal rate of employment holding con—

stant the current rate, It is apparent from equation (10) that

The preceding discussion implies that this expression should be positive

if persistence dominates and negative under the timing hypothesis. Intu—
                                              — 35 —




     itively,   with current opportunities held constant, a decline in future

    opportunities will increase labor supplied by a worker who can easily

    substitute leisure across periods. On the other hand, it will make

    current employment less attractive to a worker for whom leisure is com-

    plementary across periods.

         These implications of the timing and persistence hypotheses are

    clearly subject to empirical verification. To test the conditions laid

    out above we have estimated a basic labor supply model using the

    data from the 1970 U.S. Census on partici-

    pation and selected determinants by state. Time-series data (1966—1974)

    on unemployment by state were taken from the power Report of the

    President, These series are based on a combination of data on unemploy-

    ment insurance, payrolls and, for some states, the monthly CPS. In addi-

    tion to variables measuring the permanent and transitory effects of un—

    employment we have included measures of the permanent or expected real

wage as well as structural and demographic variables which affect parti-

cipation through the shadow wage, As a first approximation we assume

that variation in nominal wages across states reflects primarily van—

ation in the permanent component of real wages, so that the level of prices

is excluded from the model. 19

     The expected effects of the structural and demographic variables in-

cluded in equations (12) and (13) have been dealt with at length in a variety

of places and will receive only brief mention here. Education and degree of

urbanization are expected to have a positive effect on participation through

their effects on labor force attachment and the costs of transportation.

Nigration is expected to raise participation in the receiving areas and

    lower participation in states with net outflow. The proportion of black

    men (women) in the population is included to control for well—known dif-

    ferences in participation behavior between blacks and whites. The variable

    is expected to have a positive sign in the female equation, and a negative

    sign in the equation for males. The proportion of women in the population is

    incauded as a measure of potential competition among women; the expected

    sign is negative. The proportion of women with a child under six is ex-

pected to raise the shadow wage and thus to reduce participation. The ex-

pected sign of own—wage variables (1nWW. in (12) and 1nWM. in (13)) is posi-

tive.        Male earnings have been included in the female equation to allow

for the effects of joint decision—making in the family and are expected to

reduce female participation. Female earnings on the other hand are speci-

fied to have no effect on male participation,

     Estimates of the basic model for both men and women are presented
Table V. The principal coefficients of interest, a and a11 (37 and 8 for

men) are presented in rows 9 and 10; for convenience we have computed the sum

of the coefficients in row 11. The results provide clear support for the un—

portance of persistence effects. The long—run effects of unemployment clear-

ly dominate the transitory effects in virtually all demographic groups.        The

difference between the permanent and transitory components is less than zero

in only three cases, and in no case is the negative coefficient significant.

We find the strongest evidence of the persistence effects among women for

whom the timing phenomenon was expected to be particularly relevant.   In

each of the female age grQups, except women over 65, the transitory employ—

inent rate is totally insignificant, often entering with a negative sign.

In contrast, the permanent effects are large and significant. For women

45—64, for eampie, thepermanentef!ect (a10) is 2.46, which implies that

a decline in the permanent rate of unemployment from 0.06 to 0.05 would

raise the participation rate by 2.46 percent. The trahsitory effect for

this group, on the other hand, is —3,15, clearly reflecting the dominance

of the permanent employment rate which enters negatively in the deviation.

The total effect of the permanent rate is thus 5.61. Similar positive

effects are found for younger women as for women 45-64. Only among women

over 65 does the timing hypothesis find any support and here the estimates

are not particularly precise. The sum of the permanent and transitory ef—

fects is —,10, which may be marginally important in determining the parti-

cipation behavior of women over the age of 65. A somewhat stronger finding

for   men over 65 leads to the paradoxical conclusion that the timing view,

a construct based on life cycle considerations, finds its support only among

those nearing the end of their adult lives.

      The results in rows 10 and 11 of Table V clearly suggest that changes

in the expected rate of unemployment strongly influence the participation

decisions of most demographic groups. This conclusion is buttressed in

row 12 of Table V, which presents estimates of the effect of unemployment

assuming no transitory effects (i.e.,         =   0).   Among most demographic

groups the expected rate of employment enters significantly with a relatively

large positive coefficient. Differences in the size of the employment effect

within and across demographic groups are consistent with the theoretical role

of unemployment laid out in Section 3. We find that unemployment is more

important in those groups where employment durations are short. Thus within

the male and female categories teenagers are more sensitive to variations

in unemployment than are older persons. Similarly, within age groups, women

tend to be more responsive than men. It should be noted, however, that the

coefficients for the older adult men are far from trivial. We estimate

that a 1 point decline in the long—term unemployment rate (0.06 to 0.05)

leads to a 0.6 percent increase in the participation of men 25—44, and a

1.3 percent increase in the rate of participation of men 45—64.

      The evidence on the relative importance of timing and persistence in

the cross—section data relies on the use of the unemployment rate to cap-

ture market opportunities. We have already discussed some of our reasons

for preferring this kind of interpretation in section 3. But there are
                                    - 42



two additional issues that need to be addressed. In the first place,

classical models would call for the use of permanent and transitory real

wages rather than unemployment rates as explanatory variables. The results

of including real wages in time—series regressions have been discussed in the
preceding section. We have made an attempt to gauge their effect in the

cross—section analysis by calculating real wages by state. We used the

BLS Standard of Living Estimates for 35 cities to construct state price

indices; wages were based on data for manufacturing by state. Both per-

manent and transitory wage variations had only minor effects on state par-

ticipation and employment rates. Therefore the unemployment rate has been

used as a proxy for th,e attractiveness of entering and remaining in the

labor force. The role of wages and prices in explaining cross-section

differences in participation remains an important area for future research.


     A second problem concerns the effect of omitted variables. Although
                               structural characteristics of each state in
we have included a number of
                                                that omitted common third
the equation, there is always the possibility

factors account for the observed correlations between unemployment and par-

ticipation rates. We explored this issue by using other variables such as

the employment—population ratio in place of the unemployment rate. This
                                                    20
had little effect on the qualitative conclusions.

     The analysis in this section has shown the predominance of the expected

or natural level of demand in explaining participation differences across

states. Except for those over 65, there is no evidence for the notion that
                                             significantrole in decisions
transitory changes in opportunities play a

about participating in the labor force. These results suggest that a

rise   in expected opportunities, holding current opportunities constant,

will call forth an increase in participation, a response consistent with

the implications of persistence in labor supply. The notion that individuals

schedule their labor supply according to variations in current opportunities

finds little support in these data.

Section 6: Conclusions
                                                                       in
    The results in this paper suggest the importance of persistence

labor market decisions. A variety of types of evidence suggest that pre-

vious employment experience has an important effect on subsequent labor

supply. This implies that labor supply decisions are not very responsive
                                                      While no one of the

tests presented in this paper can be regarded as decisive, in conjunction

they suggest that persistence elements are more important than timing 'ele-

ments in explaining fluctuations in either the number of persons employed

or the number participating in the labor force.      Our results leave open

the possibility that timing elements are important in explaining cyclical

fluctuations in average hours worked and in work effort.

     Acceptance of these conclusions has important implications for both

macroeconomic theory and policy. These results cast doubt on the medium—

run relevance of the natural rate hypothesis. Because policy affects the

level of employment in the short run, it has a long—ruh effect on the po-

sition of the labor supply schedule. Workers drawn into the labor force

by cyclical upturns tend to remain even after the boom has ended. The con-

verse is true for shocks which reduce employment.     At this point, the quan-

titative importance of these effects is uncertain, although our interpre-

tation of the evidence reported here suggests that they are quite important.

     This paper has only begun to touch on the implications of alternative

life cycle labor supply models for macroeconomic questions. Both the empi-

rical and theoretical work des-cribed in this paper could usefully be extended
                                     — 45 —




 in   several directions. It would be valuable to develop tests which can

 distinguish different aspects of persistence. In particular, the model

 developed here completely ignores the accumulation of human capital. The

 explicit inclusion of human capital in the model would provide a more

 satisfactory basis for rationalizing the observed persistence in labor

supply, and would also suggest relationships between employment experi-

ence and subsequent wage levels. It would be valuable to extend the em-

pirical work reported here by attempting direction estimation of utility

function parameters using recently developed rational expectations tech—

niques. Unsuccessful estimates of a relatively simple utility function

which takes no account of persistence effects are presented in Mankiw,

Rotemberg and Summers (1982). While these extensions would be valuable,

it is unlikely that they would call into question the main conclusion

reached here that a proper theory of labor supply must come to grips

with the persistence of participation,

1. At the conference where this paper was presented we became aware of
    the important paper by Altonji (1982). His work provides a comprehen-
    sive set of econometric tests of what this paper calls the timing
    hypothesis.

2.   The most extensive empirical work is reported in Houthakker and
     Taylor (1970). Theoretical analysis is surveyed by Pollack (1978).

3.   In a Keynesian framework, this may. be interpreted as temporarily
     increasing aggregate demand, and Increasing employment opportunities.
     In the context of a classical model, it can be thought of as an un-
     expected increase in the money stock, leading to a transitory increase
     in the perceived real wage. In either case t±e expansionary policy
     is taken to be temporary in its direct effect.

4, For a, recent statement of this argument, see Wachter (1977).

5.   It is tempting but inaccurate to regard persistence effects as argu—
     ments in support of expansionary policy. If the economy is initially
     at an optimal Walrasian equilibrium, locking additional workers into
     employment is not an efficiency gain. Of course this conclusion does
     not hold if the "natural rate" of unemployment is inefficiently high,
     as Phelps (1972) suggests is likely to be the case. If, as has been
     suggested, work is habit—forming, no clear basis exists for welfare
     judgments,

6. Such hysteresis effects in which the equilibrium level of employment
    is affected by the transition path have been discussed by Phelps
    (1972), but have, to our knowledge, received no enpirical attention.

8. Ideally one ought to look at the participation of women     of different
    ages rather than different cohorts. Thus, for example,     the appropri—
    ate way to examine the impact of the war on 50—year—old    women is to
    look at 46'-year--olds in 1940 and 56—year—olds in 1950.   Available
    data, however, precludes such an analysis.

9.   This result was also obtained using employment instead of labor force
     participation as a measure of labor supply. It should be noted that
     the participation rates for married women have not been adjusted for
     differences in fertility. As others have noted, adjusting for ferti—
     lity would accentuate the divergence between actual rates and extra--
     polation of 1930—19.40 trends (See; Bowen and Finnegan, 1969, pp. 200
     - 201), Fertility in 1940 was exceptionally low, while 1950 was part
     of the post—war baby boom, It may be that a fertility correction is
     inappropriate since ferti1ity is jointly determined with labor supply.

  10.       It might be argued that the purportedly permanent shifts in. participation
            induced by the World War II experience actually reflect the very weak
            economy of 1940. In order to test this possibility, trends were esti-
            mated in 1930. This leads to even greater discrepancies between predicted
            and actual participation, both during and after the war. As a further
            check, we estimated trends using data for the whole 1890 — 1980 period.
            The results werequalitatively similar, although the estimated effects of
            the war on subsequent participation were significantly reduced. Of course,
            this procedure may be inappropriate because the war presumably affected
            post—war data.

            Both in aggregate and within occupations, there was virtually
            change in the ratio of male and female hourly and/or
                                                                 yearly earnings
            between 1939 and 1950. The data must be interpreted cautiously be-
            cause of a plethora of selection effects.


 13.        Strictly speaking, all that is required is that (1) can be represented
            as V1(c l, l +
 14. In the empirical work below, we use the unemployment rate for 35—44
      year old men. This avoids problems of demographic adjustment.

 15. The estimateswereperfoed using annual data for the period 1949—1981.
        Two lags on each variable were included. Wages are measured using an
        index of compensation in the private business sector. Prices are meas-
        ured using the consumption price deflator, and output is measured as
        real GNP.

16. The tax rate is the sum of the average marginal tax rate imposed on
     labor income, Federal income taxes, state and local taxes and Social
     Security taxes. The municipal bond rate is then used, as a crude proxy
     for the other tax interest rate.

17.     In the empirical work reported below, we control for migration so
        this difficulty does not arise. In results which are not reported,
        measures of demand were used other than the unemployment rate with
        very little effect on the results. The problem of seasonality in
        the census sampling is not dealt with.

18.     Fleisher and Rhodes argue that the unemployment rate is properly
        treated as endogenous in participation equations. However, the
        instrumental variables they employ, such as the growth rate of
        employment are probably at least as likely as unemployment to be
        correlated with the error term in the participation equation.

19.     In the results reported below, earnings are used as a wage proxy.
        This creates an obvious upwards bias in the estimate of wage effects
        on labor supply.
