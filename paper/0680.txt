                 Inflation, Capital Taxation and Monetary Policy



                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper discusses the effects of the interaction between inflation
and the taxation of capital income. The principal conclusions are:

(1) Inflation substantially increases the total effective tax rate on
     the income from capital used in the nonfinancial corporate sector.
     The total effective tax rate has risen from less than 60 percent in
     the mid—1960's to more than 70 percent in the late 1970's.

(2) The higher effective tax rate reduces the real net rate of return to
     those who provide investment capital. In the late l97Os, the real
     net rate of return averaged less than three percent.

(3) The interaction between inflation and existing tax rules contributed
     to the fall in the ratio of share prices to real pretax earnings,
     or, equivalently, to the rise in the real cost to the firm of equity
     capital.

(4) By reducing the real net return to investors and by widening the
     gap between the firms' cost of funds and the maximum return that they
     can afford to pay, the interaction between tax rates and inflation
     has depressed the rate of net investment in business fixed capital.

(5) The failure to consider correctly the effects of the fiscal structure
     has caused observers to underestimate the expansionary character of
     monetary policy in the past two decades.

(6) The goal of increasing investment while maintaining price stability
     can be achieved with tight money, a high real interest rate, and
     tax incentives for investment. A high real net—of—tax interest rate
     could reduce residential investment and other forms of consumer
     spending while the tax incentives offset the monetary effect for
     investment in business capital.

     The interaction of inflation and isiting tax rules has
powerful effects on the American economy      Inflation distorts

the measurement of profits, of interest payments and of capital
gains. The resulti ng mismeasurement of capital income has caused
a substantial increase in the ef

come from capital employe d in th e nonfinancial corporate sector.
At the same time, the deci ucti bil ity of nominal interest expenses

has encouraged the expans ion of consumer debt and stimulated the
demand for owner—occupied housing. The net res ult has been a
reduction of capital accumu lation.
     These effects of the fiscal structure have been largely
ignored in the analysis of monetary policy     As I explain in

this paper, I believe that the failure of the m onetary authorities

to recognize the implicati on of the fiscal str ucture has caused
them over the years to und erestimate just how expans ionary mone—
tary policy has been. Nor eover, because of our fiscal structure,

attempts to encourage investment by an easy—money po licy have
actually had an adverse impact on investment in plant and

equipment.

     In the first three sections of this paper, I review some

of my own research on the impact of inflation on effective tax

rates, share prices, and nonresidential fixed investment. The
fourth section discusses how ignoring the fiscal structure of
the economy caused a misinterpretation of the tightness of
monetary policy in the 1960's and 1970's. The paper concludes
by commenting on the implications of this analysis for the
mix of monetary policy, fiscal policy and the tax structure.

 1.   Inflation, Effective Tax Rates and Net Rates of Return


      Our tax laws were written for an economy with little or

 no inflation. With an inflation rate of six percent to eight

percent or more, the tax system functions very badly. The
problem is particularly acute for the taxation of income from
capital. Despite reductions in statutory rates over the past
two decades the effective tax rates on the income from savings

have actually increased sharply in recent years because infla-
tion creates fictitious income for the government to tax. Savers
must pay tax on not only their real income from savings but also
on their fictitious income as well.

      Without legislative action or public debate, effective tax
rates on capital income of different types have been raised
dramatically in the last decade. This process of raising the
effective tax rate on capital income is hard for the public at
large or even for most members of Congress to understand. What
appear to be relatively low rates of tax on interest income, on
capital gains, and on corporate profits as measured under current

accounting rules are actually very high tax rates, in some cases
more than 100 percent, because our accounting definitions are
not suited to an economy with inflation.

      As anyone with a savings account knows, even a 12 percent
interest rate was not enough last year to compensate a saver
for the loss in the purchasing power of his money that resulted
from the 13 percent inflation. The present tax rules ignore this
                                    4




 and tax the individual on the full nominal amount of his interest

 receipts. An individual with a 30 percent marginal tax rate
 would get to keep only an 8.4 percent return on an account that

 paid 12 percent. After adjusting this yield for the 13 percent
 inflation in 1979, such an individual was left wi th a real after—

 tax return of minus 4.6 percent! The small saver was thus penal—
 ized rather than rewarded for attempting to save.
       The effect of inflation on the taxation of capital gains
is no less dramatic. In a study published in 1978 (Feldstein
and Slemrod, 1978) ,       Joel   Slemrod and I looked first at the ex—

perience of a hypothetical investor who bought a broad portfolio
of securities like the Standard and Poors' 500 in 1957, held it

for twenty years and sold it in 1977.          An investor who did that
would have been fortunate enough to have his investment slightly

more than double during that time. Unfortunately, the consumer

price 1ev el also more than doubled during that time.             In terms
of actual purcha sing power, the investor had no gain at all on
his inves tinen   t.    And yet of course the tax law would regard him
as having    double d    his money and would hold him accountable for
a tax liab   ility     on this nominal gain.
      After seem g this experience for a hypo thetical investor,

we were ea ger    to   know what has been happening to actual investors
who have realized taxable capital gains and loss es. Fortunately,
the   Internal Revenue Service has       produced   a very   interesting set
of data: a computer tape with a sample          of more than 30,000 in—
                                5




dividual tax returns reporting realized capital gains or losses
on corporate stock in 1973. While the sample is anonymous, it
is the kind of scientific sample that can be used to make accurate
estimates of national totals.

     The results of this analysis were quite astounding. In
1973, individuals paid tax on $4.6 billion of capital gains on
corporate stock. When the costs of those securities are adjusted
for the increase in the price level since they were purchased,
that $4.6 billion capital gain is seen correctly as a loss of
nearly one billion dollars. Thus, people were paying tax on

$4.6 billion of capital gains when in reality they actually
sold stock that represented a loss of nearly a billion dollars.

Moreover, although people paid tax on artificial gains at every
income level, the problem was most severe for those investors
with incomes of less than $100,000.
     While the lower capital gains tax rates that were enacted
in 1978 reduce the adverse effects of inflation, lowering the
tax rate does not alter the fact that people will continue to
pay taxes on nominal gains even when there are no real gains.
They now pay a lower tax on those gains but they still pay a
tax on what is really a loss.
     Although interest recipients arid those who realize nominal
capital gains are taxed on fictitious inflation gains, by far
the most substantial effect of inflation on tax burdens is the
extra tax paid because of the overstatement of profits in the
                                    6




 corporate sector.        In a paper published last year (Feldstein
 and Surnniers, 1979       Lawrence Summers and I found that the mis—
 measurement of de preciation and mv entories raised the 1977
 tax burden on the income of non—f inancial corporations by more

 than $32 billion.        This repr e   sen ts   a 50 percent increase in
 the total tax paid on corpor ate so urce income by corpora tions,

their sha rehol der   s   and their cr editors.
      Some lawyers and econom ist s have prey lously argued that
inflation does not increase the effective tax rate on real

corporate income because firms deduct nominal interest payments
(rather than real inter est payments) in calcu lating taxable

profits.    Equivalently, corporations are not taxed on the fall
in the re al value of th eir debts that results from inflation.

Although thi S argument is valid if one looks only at the taxes

paid by the corporation         it is wrong when one considers the
taxes paid by creditors and shareholders. As our calculations

show, the extra tax paid by the creditors on the inf lated

interest p ayments is as large as the tax savings by corporations
and their owners. Debt can ther efore be ignored in evaluating

the net impact of inflation on the total tax burden on corporate

capital.
     More recently, James Poterba and I have updated these
Ca icu lations   and extended the analysis to include the taxes

paid to state and local g overnments on the capital used by
nonfi nancial corporations (Feldstein and Poterba, 1980) .             We
                             7



found that the 1979 effective tax rate on the total real

capital income' of the nonfinancial corporate sector was 74
percent. Thus, taxes now take three—fourths of the total real
capital income on corporate capital. This represents a return
to the tax level of the mid—1950's before accelerated deprecia-
tion and the investment tax credit began reducing the total
tax burden. Even if attention is limited to Federal taxes,
our calculation shows that by 1979 the Federal government
taxes on corporations, their shareholders and their creditors
equaled 65 percent of the total real capital income of the
nonfinancial corporations net of the state and local taxes

paid by corporations.
     The implication of a 74 percent total effective tax rate
on corporate income is clear. Since the real rate of return
on corporate capital before all taxes was 9.1 percent in 1979

(Feldstein and Poterba, 1980) ,   the net rate of return was only
about one—fourth of this, or 2.3 percent.




     1This includes both economic profits and the return to
creditors.

 2.   Inflation, Tax Rules and Share Prices


      A potentially important way in which inflation can alter

 the rate of real investment is by changing the cost to the firm

 of equity capital    i.e., the ratio of share value per dollar of

 pretax earnings.    In a smoothly functioning economy with no dis-

 tortionary taxes, inflation should have no effect on the cost

 of equity cap ital: both the earnings per share and the share
 price should increase over time at a faster rate because of
 inflation but their ratio should be unaffected. In fact, taxes
 interfere wit h this neutrality and a iter the ratio of the share

 price to the pretax earnings.
      In   think ing about the relation between inflation and share
 prices, it is crucial to distinguish between the effect of a
 high constant rate of inflation and the effec t of an increase
 in the rate of inflation expected for the future. When the
steady—state rate of inflation is higher, share prices increase
at a faster rate. More specifically, when the inflation rate
is steady, share prices rise in proportion to the price level
to maintain a constant ratio of share prices to real earnings.
In contrast, an increase in the expected future rate of inflation
• causes a concurrent fall in the ratio of share prices to current

earnings. Although share prices then rise from this lower level




      'This section is based on Feldstein (1978a, 1980c)
                              9




at the higher rate of inflat ion, the ratio of share prices to

real earnings is permanently lower. This permanent reduction
in the price—earnings ratio occurs because, under prevailing

tax rules, inflation raises the effective tax rate on corporate

source income.

     An important reason for the lower ratio of price to pretax—
earnings is that an increase in the permanent rate of inflation
raises the effective tax rate on equity capital. The magnitude
of this increase reflects the role of historic cost depreciation,
the use of FIFO inventory accounting and the extent of corporate
debt. A numerical calculation with realistic values will indicate
how these separate effects are combined. Consider an economy
with no inflation in which each share of stock represents the
ownership claim to a single uni t of capital (i.e., one dollarts
worth of capital valued at its reproduction cost) and to the
net earnings that it produces.    The marginal product of capital
(net of depreciation), f, is subject to a corporate income tax
at effective rate t1. In the absence of inflation, this effective
rate of tax is less than the statutory rate (t) bec ause of the
combined effect of accelera ted depreci ation and the investment
tax credit. The corporation borrows b dollars per unit of
capital and pays interest at rate r. Since the se interest

payments are deducted in calculating corporate income that
is taxed at the statutory rate t, the net cost of these borrowed
funds is (l-t)br. The net return to equity mv estors per unit
of capital in the absence of inflation is (l-t1)f' —   (l—t)br.
                                     10




          What happens to this net return when the inflation rate

 rises? For simplicity, consider an instantaneous and unantici—
 pa ted    increase to inflation at rate i that i
 forever. Under existing U.S . tax law, inflation raises taxable
 profits (for any fixed level of real profits) in two ways.
First, the value of deprecia tion allowances is based                the
original or "hi 5 tor i   c"   cost of the asset rather than on its
current value.      When pr ices rise, this h 1 s   tori c   cost method
of depreciation causes the real value of depreciation to fall
and the real value of taxable profits to rise. Second, the

cost of maintaining inventory levels i s understated for firms
that use the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method of inventory

accounting. A linear approximation tha t each percentage point
of inflation increases taxable profits per unit of capital by
X implies that the existing treatment of depreciation and

inventories reduces net profits by tx per unit of capital.
      When there is a positive rate of inflation, the firms'
net interest payments ((l-t)br) overstate the true cost to
the equity owners of the corporations' debt finance. Against
this apparent interest cost it is necessary to offset the re-
duction in the real value of the corporations' net monetary

liabilities. These net monetary liabilities per unit of capital
are the difference between the interest-bearing debt (b) and

the non—interest—bearing monetary assets (a)
                                          11




       Combining the basic net profits per unit of capital, the

extra tax caused by the existing depreciation and inventory
rules, and the real gain on net monetary liabilities yields
the real net return per unit of capital,


(1)        z =
                 (l—t1)f'
                            —       (l—t)br       —   txi   +   (b—a)i.

The effect of inflation on the real net equity earnings per

unit of capital (z) depends on the response of the interest
rate Cr) to the inflation rate (1). In general, the change
in equity earnings per unit change in the inflation rate
(dz/di) depends on the tax and finance parameters and on the
effect of inflation on the interest rate (dr/di) according to:


(2)          =   —(l-t)b             -   tx   +   (b-a).

Econometric studies indicate that the nominal interest rate has
risen approximately point-for-point with the rate of inflation.

Assuming   that dr/di =         1    implies

(3)          =   —(l—t)b    —       tx   + (b—a).

             =   t(b-x) - a.

Thus, equity owners:            (1)      gain tb (per unit of capital) from a
rise   in inflation because nominal interest expenses are deducted
in calculating taxable income; (2) lose tx because of the under-

statement of cost due to the use of historic cost depreciation
and FIFO inventory accounting; and (3) lose a because they hold

non—interest bearing monetary assets.
                              12




      Recent values of these parameters imply that dz/di
 is negative and therefore that inflation would reduce the

 equity earnings per share.   In 1977, nonfinancial corpora-
 tions had a total capital stock of $1,684 billion and owed net

 interest—bearing liabilities of $509.7 billion,1 implying that
 b=0.302. The monetary assets of the NFCs had a value of $54.8
 billion, implying that a=0.033. Since the corporate tax rate
 in 1977 was t=0.48, these figures imply that dz/di=0.1l3-tx.
     While it is difficult to calculate x as precisely as t, b
and z, it is clear that tx exceeds 0.113 and therefore that

dz/di is negative. Recall that xi is the overstatement of

taxable profits per dollar of capital caused by inflation at
rate i. Feldstein and Summers (1979) estimate that in 1977
inflation caused an overstatement of taxable profits of $54.3
billion of which $39.7 billion was due to low depreciation and
$14.6 was due to artificial inventory profits. Thus in 1977
xi=54.3/1684=O.032. The implied value of x depends on the rate




     'The capital stock, valued at replacement cost in 1977
dollars, is estimated by the Department of Commerce. The net
liabilities are based on information in the Flow of Funds tables.
Feldsteiri and Summers (1979) report the net interest—bearing
liabilities of NFCs as $595 billion. For the appropriate debt
measure in this work, the value of the net trade credit ($72.7
billion) and government securities ($12.9 billion) must be
subtracted from this $595 billion. The subtraction of net trade
credit reflects the assumption that the profits of NFCs include
an implicit interest return on the trade credit that they extend.
The new information is from the Federal Reserve Balance Sheets
of the U.S. Economy.

    of inflation that was respo nsible for these additional taxable
    profits. For the inventory compon ent of the overstated profits,
    the relevant infla tion rate is the one for the concurrent year;

    for the depreciation component, the re levant inflation rate is

    a weighted average o £ the inflation ra tes since the oldest re—

    maining capital was acquired but with greater weight given to
    inflation in more re cent years.    The consumer price index rose

    6.8 percent in 1977, an average of 7.2 percent in the preceding
    five years, and 4.5 percent and 1.9 percent in the two previous
    five year periods.1 An inflation rate of 7.0 percent is there-
    fore a reasonable upper bound for the relevant rate and 5.0
    percent is a reasonable lower bound. A value of i=0.06 implies
    that x=0.53 and therefore that tx=0.256, even at the upper bound
    of i=0.07, x=0.46 and tx=0.22.     Both of these values are clearly

    above the critical value of 0. 113 required for dz/di to be

    negative.
         By itself, the fact that the inflation-tax interaction
•

    lowers the net of tax equity earnings tends to depress the
    price—earnings ratio. This is reinforced by the fact that the
    nominal increase in the value of the corporation's capital stock




         'The index of producer prices for finished goods rose 6.6
    percent in 1977 and an average of 5.9 percent for the previous
    decade, essentially the same as the CPI.

induces a capital gains tax liability for shareholders. But
the net effect on the share price level depends on the effect
of inflation on the investors' opportunity cost of investing
in stocks. Because households pay tax on nominal interest
income, inflation lowers the real net yield on bonds as an
alternative to share ownership. At the same time, the favorable
tax rules for investment in land, gold, owner—occupied housing,
etc. imply that the real net opportunity cost of shareholding
does not fall as much as the real net yield on bonds and may
actually rise.' In considering these interactions of inflation

and tax rules, it is important to distinguish households and
non—taxable institutions and to recognize that share prices
represent an equilibrium for these two groups.
     In Feldstein (l980c), I evaluated the effect of inflation
on the equilibrium share price, using a very simple model with
two classes of investors. That analysis shows that if the
opportunity cost that households perceive remains unchanged
(at a real net—of—tax 4 percent) , a rise in the inflation rate

from zero to 6 percent would reduce the share value by 24 percent.2
A one—fourth fall in the households' opportunity cost of share




     1This point is developed further in Feldstein (1978b, l980d)
and in Hendershott (1979), Hendershott and Hu (1979) and Poterba
(1980)

     2Th• makes no allowance for the effect of the induced re-
duction of the capital stock on the subsequent pretax return.
Summers (1980) shows explicitly how that would reduce the fall
in the equilibrium share value.
                            15




ownership (from 0.04 to 0.03) would limit the fall in the

equilibrium share value t o only 7 percent.
     The real net cost of equity funds rose from about 7 per—

cent in the m id 1960's to about 10 percent in the mid—l970's.

On balance, I believe that the   nteraction of inflation and
the tax rules is responsible for part, but only part, of this

very subs tantial rise in the real cost of equity capital.
Inflation may also depress share prices because of a perceived

increase in risk (as Malkell has stressed) or because investors

confus e nominal and real returns (as Modigliani has emphasized)

These additional explanations are not incompatible with the

 3.   Inflation, Tax Rules and   Investment

      The rate of business fixed investment in the United
 States has fallen quite sharply since the mid-1960's. The
 share of national income devoted to net nonresidential fixed

 investment fell by more than one-third between the last half
of the 1960's and the decade of the 1970's: the ratio of
net fixed nonresidential investment to GNP averaged 0.040

from 1965 through 1969 but only 0.025 from 1970 through 1979.
The corresponding rate of growth of the nonresidential capital

stock declined by an even greater percentage: between 1965
and 1969, the annual rate of growth of the fixed nonresidential

capital stock averaged 5.5 percent; in the 1970's, this average
dropped to 3.2 percent.
      An important reason for this decline has been the inter-
action of the high rate of inflation and the existing tax rules.

As the discussion in the previous two sections hasmade clear,
the nature of this interaction is complex and operates through
several different channels.      I have investigated this effect in
Feldstein (1980a) by estimating three quite different models of
investment behavior. The strength of the empirical evidence
rests on the fact that all three specifications support the same
conclusion.
                              17




     The simplest and most direct way relates investment to

the real net return that the providers of capital can earn on
business capital. As I noted in section 1 of this paper, the

combined effects of original cost depreciation, the taxation of
nominal capital gains, and other tax rules raises the effective

tax rate paid on the capital income of the corporate sector and
thus lowers the real net rate of return that the ultimate sup-

pliers of capital can obtain on nonresidential fixed investment.
This in turn reduces the incent lye to save and      distorts   the

flow of saving away from fixed nonresidential       investment.   Ev en

without specifying    the mechanism by wh ich   the financial marke ts

and mana gerial deci sions achieve this reallocation, the varia—
tions in investment   during the past d ecades can be rela ted to
changes in the real   net rate of return.
     The real net r ate of return varied around an avera ge of
3.3 percent in the 1950's, rose by the mid—1960's to 6. 5 percent

while averaging 5.0 percent for the 1960's as a whole, and then
dropped in the 1970's to an average of only 2.8 percent. A

simple econome tric model (relating net fixed business investment
as a fraction of GNP to the real net rate of return and to

capacity utili zation) indicates that each percentage point rise
in the real net return raises the investment—GNP ra tio by about
one-half a percentage point. This estimated effect is quite
robust with respect to changes in the specification        sample period,
and method of estimation. It implies that the fall in the real
                            18




net rate of return between the 1960's and the 1970's was large

enough to account for a drop of more than one percentage point
in the ratio of investment to GNP, a reduction that corre spond s
to more than one- third of the net investment ratio in the 1970's.

     This general conclusion is suppor ted by two quite different
alternative models of investment.   The first of these relates
investment to the d ifference between the max jmum potential ra te
of return that the firm can afford to pay on a "standard" pro ject
and the actual cost of funds. The second is an extension of the

Hall-Jorgenson (196 7) investment equation th at incorporates all
of the effects of I nflation and the user cost of capital. Al—

though none of the three models is a "true" picture of reality,

the fact that they all point to the same conclusion is reassuring
because it indicates that the finding is really "in the data
and is not merely an artifact of the model specification.

4. The Fiscal Structure and Effects           of   Monetary Policy

       The intellectual tradition in monetary analysis has caused
the effects of the economy's fiscal structure           to be ignored.
Whatever the      appropriateness   of this division    of labor between
monetary    spec ialists   and tax specialists in earlier decades,
it has clean      y been inappropriate in more recent years. As I
have   argued e lsewhere (Feldstein, 1976, 1980b), the fiscal
structure    of   our economy is a key determinant of the macro—

economic equ ilibrium and      therefore of the effect of monetary

policy.     The   failure to take fiscal    effects into acc ount has
caused a mis interpret ation 0f     the    expansionary and    di s tortive
character of monetary policy in the 1960's and 197 0's.

       During the dozen years after the 1951 accord between the
Treasury and the Fed, the interest rate on           Baa bo nds   varied

only in the narrow ra nge between 3½ percen t         and 5   percent. In
contrast, th e past 15 years have seen the Baa rate rise from
less than 5 percent in 1964 to more than 12 percen t at the end

of 1979. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that the mone-
tary authori ties, other government officials, and many private
economists h ave worried throughout this period that interest

rates might be getting "too high". Critics of what was per-
ceived as     ight money" argued that such high interest rates
would reduce investment and therefore depress aggregate demand.

       Against all this it could be argued, and was argued, that
the real mterest rate had obviously gone up much less. The
correct measure of the real interest rate is of course the
                                20



difference between the nominal interest rate and the rate of
inflation that is expected over the life of the bond. A
common rule of thumb approximates the expected future infla-
tion by the average inflation rate experienced during the
preceding three years. In 1964, when the Baa rate was 4.8
percent, this three—year rise in the GNP deflator averaged 1.6
percent; the implied real interest rate was thus 3.2 percent.
By the end of 1979, when the Baa rate was 12.0 percent, the
rise in the GNP deflator for the previous 3 years had increased
to 7.8 percent, implying a real interest rate of 4.2 percent.
Judged in this way, the cost of credit has also increased sig-

nificantly over the 15 year period.
       All of this ignores the role of taxes. Since interest
expenses can be deducted by individuals and businesses in
calculating taxable income, the net—of—tax interest cost is very
much less than the interest rate itself. Indeed, since the
nominal interest expense can be deducted, the real net—of—tax
interest cost has actually varied inversely with the nominal
rate of interest. What appears to have been a rising interest
rate over the past 25 years was actually a sharply falling real
after—tax cost of funds. The failure to recognize the role of
taxes prevented the monetary authorities from seeing how ex-

pansionary monetary policy had become.
      The implication of tax deductibility is seen most easily
in   the   case of owner—occupied housing. A married couple with
a $30,000 taxable income now has a marginal federal income tax
                              21



rate of 37 percent.     The 11.4 percent mortgage rate in effect
in the last quarter of 1979 implied a net-of—tax cost of funds

of 7.2 percent. S ubtracting a 7.8 percent estimate of the
rate of inflation (based on a three year average increase, in
the GNP deflator) leaves a real net—of-tax cost of funds of

minus
_____ 0.6 percent.     By comparison, the 4.8 percent interest
rate for 1964 translates into a 3.0 percent net—of-tax rate
and 'a 1.4 percent real net—of—tax cost of funds           Thus, although
the nominal interest rate had more than doubled and the real
interest rate had also increased s ubstantially, the rel eva         n t

net—of-tax real cost of funds had actually fallen from 1.4
percent to a negative 0 .6 percent.    (See f igure 1.)

     As this example shows, taking the eff ects of taxation
into account is particularly impor tant bec ause the tax rules
are so non—neutral when there is inflation      •     If the tax rules

were completely indexed, the eff ect   of the       tax system on the
con duct of monetary policy would   be much 1 ess     significant.
But with existing tax rules, the movements of the pretax real
interest rate and of the after—tax real interest rates are

completely different     I think that monetary policy in the
last decade was expa nsionary because the monetary authorities
and others believed that the cost of funds was rising or
steady when in fact it was falling significantly.

      The fall in the real after-tax interest rate has caused
a rapid increase in the price of houses relative to the general
price level and has sustained a high rate of new residential

construc tion (Poterba, 1980) .   There were, of course, times
when the ceilings on the interest rates that financial inst i    tu -


tions cou id pay caused disintermediation and limited the Lund s
available for housing. To that extent, the high level of

nominal i nterest rates restricted the supply of funds at the
same time   that the corresponding low real after—tax interest
cost incre ased the demand for funds. More recently, the raising
of certain interest rate ceilings and the development of mort—

gage—backed bonds that can short—circuit the disintermediation
process have made the supply restrictions much less important
and have therefore made any interest level more expansionary
than it otherwise would have been.
      The low real after-tax rate of interest has also encouraged
the growth of consumer credit and the purchase of consumer
durables. It is not surprising that, with a n egative real net
rate of interest, house mortgage borrowing has soared to over

$90   billion a year, more than double the rate in the early
1970's. More generally, as I noted in section 1, even house—
holds that do not itemize their tax deductions are affected by
the low real after—tax return that is available on savings.
Because individuals pay tax on nominal interest income, the
real after—tax rate of return on saving has become negative.
                                24




It seems likely that this substantial fall in the real return
on savings has contributed to the fall in the personal saving
rate and the rise in consumer demand.
     The evidence summarized in the first section shows that
the analysis is more complex for corporate borrowers and in-
vestors because inflation changes the effective tax rate on
investments as well as the real net—of—tax interest rate.

Nore specifically, because historic cost depreciation and in-

ventory accounting rules reduce sub stantially the real af ter—
tax return on corporate investments, an easy—money policy

raises the demand for corporate capital only if the real net
cost of fu nds falls by more than the return that firms can

afford to pay   •   This balance between the lower real net interest
cost and the lower real net return on investment depends on the
corporation t s debt—equity ratio and on the relation between the

real yields t hat must be paid on debt and on equity funds.    It

is difficul t to say just what has happened on balance. In a

preliminary s tudy, Lawrence Summers and I concluded that the
rise in the nominal interest rate caused by inflation was

probabiy slig htly less than the rise in the maximum nominal
interest rate that firms could afford to pay (Feldstein and
Summers, 1978). However, that study made no allowance for the
effect of inventory taxation or for the more complex effects
of inflation on equity yields that I discussed in section 2.
                             25




 My Current view, based on the evidence reviewed in section 3,

 is that, on balance, expansionary monetary policy reduced the
demand for business investment at the same time that it increased
 the demand for residential investment and for c onsumption goods.
     It is useful to contrast the conc lusion of this section
with the conventional Keynesian analysis. According to the

traditional view, monetary expansion lowers interest rates which
reduces the cost of funds to investors and t herefore encour ages

the accumulation of plant and equipment. In the context of the

U.S. economy in recent years, this statement is wrong in thr ee

ways. First, a sustained monetary expansion raises nominal interest
rates. Second, although the inter est rate is higher, the real
net—of—tax cost of funds is 1ower.   And, third, the lower CO St
of funds produced in this way encour ages investment in hou s i   ng

and consumer durables (as well as gr eater consumptio n in general)
rather than more investment in plant and equipment.    Indeed,
because of the interaction of tax rules and inflation, a monetary

expansion tends to discourage saving and reduce investment in
plant and equipment. The low real net—of—tax rate of interest
on mortgages and consumer credit is an indication of this mis—
allocation of capital.

     Perhaps the problems of misinterpretation and mismanagement
might have been avoided completely if the monetary authorities
and others in the financial community, as well as the Congress
                             26



and the economics profession, had ignored interest rates com-
pletely and focused their attention on the money supply and
the credit aggregates. Presumably, under current Federal
Reserve procedures, there will be more of a tendency to do
just that. But since the temptation to look at rates as well
is very powerful, it is important to interpret the rates cor-
rectly. What matters for the household borrower or saver is
the real net—of—tax interest rate. A very low or negative real
net—of--tax rate is a clear signal of an incentive to overspend

on housing and on other forms of consumption. What matters
for the business firm is the difference between the real net—of—tax
cost of funds (including both debt and equity) and the maximum
return that, with existing tax laws, it can afford to pay. The
difficulty of measuring this difference should be a warning
against relying on any observed rates to judge the ease or
tightness of credit for business investment.
                                  27



5. The Mix of Monetary and Fiscal Policies


     There is widespread agreement on two central goals for
macroeconomic policy:     (1)   achieving a level of aggregate demand
that avoids both unemployment and inflation, and (2)     increasing
the share of national income that is devoted to business invest-

ment. Monetary and fiscal policy provide two instruments with
which to achieve these two goals. The conventional Keynesian
view of the economy has led to the prescription of easy money

(to encourage investment) and a tight fiscal policy (to limit
demand and prevent inflation). Our low rate of investment and
high rate of inflation indicate that this approach has not

worked. It is useful to review both the way such a policy is
supposed to work and the reason why it fails.

     Keynesian analysis, based on a theory developed during
and for the depression, is designed for an economy with sub-
stantial slack and essentially fixed prices. This Keynesian

perspective implies that real output can be expanded by increasing
demand and that the policy mix determines how this increased out-
put is divided between investment, consumption and government
spending. In this context, an increase in the money supply
favors investment while a fiscal expansion favors consumption

or government spending.
     There is a way in which a policy mix of easy money and
fiscal tightness could in principle work in our relatively

fully—employed economy. The key requirement would be a per—
                              28



sistent government surplus. Such a surplus would permit the
government to reduce the supply of outstanding government debt.
This in turn would induce households and institutions to sub-

stitute additional private bonds and stocks for the government

debt that was removed from their portfolios. The result would
be an increased rate of private capital accumulation. Under

likely conditions, this substitution of private capital for
government debt would require a lower rate of interest and a
relative increase in the stock of money.1

     Unfortunately, the traditional prescription of easy money
and a tight fiscal position has failed in practice because of

the difficulty of achieving and maintaining a government

surplus.2 As a result, the pursuit of an easy money policy
has produced inflation. Although the inflationary increase in
the money supply did reduce the real after—tax cost of funds,




     i-See Feldstein (1980b) for a theoretical analysis in which
this possibility is considered.

     21t might be argued that the inflationary erosion of the
real government debt means that the government has in fact had
real surpluses even though nominal deficits. But such an inflation
adjustment also implies an equal reduction in private saving, in-
dicating that private saving has in fact been negative. The con-
ventional government deficit should also be augmented by the off-
budget borrowing and the growth of government unfunded obligations
in the social security, and civil service and military service
pension programs.
                                29




 this only diverted the flow of capital away from investment in

 plant and equipment and into owner—occupied housing and consumer
 durables.   By reducing the real net return to savers, the easy
 money poi icy has probably also reduced the total amount of new
 saving.

      The traditional policy mix reflects not only its optimistic
view about the feasibility of    g ov er nm en t   surpluses but also its
overly narrow conception of ther ole of fiscal policy. In the
current macroeconomic tradition, fiscal policy has been almost

synonymous with variations in the net g overnment surplus or
deficit and has generally igno red the p otentially powerful in-
centive effects of taxes that infiuence marginal prices.
     An alterna tive policy mix for achi eying the dual goals of
balanced demand and increased    bus i ness   investment would combine
a tigh t—mon ey policy and fisca1 incentives for investment and

saving.    A tight-money po1 icy would preven t inflation and would
raise the real net—of—tax rate of interest.           Although the higher
real rate of interest would tend to deter al1 forms of residential

and nonresidential investment, specific incentives for investment in
plant and equipment could more than offset the higher cost of
funds. The combination of the higher real net interest rate
and the targeted investment incentives would restrict housing
construction and the purchase of consumer durables while increasing
the flow of capital into new plant and equipment. Since housing and
                                30



consumer durables now account for substantially more than half

of the private capital stock, such a restructuring of the in-
vestment mix could have a substantial favorable effect on the

stock of plant and equipment.

     A rise in the overall saving rate would permit a greater
increase in business investment. The higher real net rate of
interest would probably induce such a higher rate of saving.
This could be supplemented by explicit fiscal policies that
reduced the tax rate on interest income and other income from

saving.

     In short, restructuring macroeconomic policy to recognize
the importance of fiscal incentives and of the current inter-

action between tax rules and inflation provides a way of both

reducing the rate of inflation and increasing the growth of the

capital stock.
