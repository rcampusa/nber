        The Adjustment of Expectations to a Change in Regime:
            A Study of the Founding of the Federal Reserve



                                   ABSTRACT




       The founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 led to a substantial

  change in the behavior of nominal interest rates.   We examine the timing of

  this change and the speed with which it was effected.   We then use data on

  the term structure of interest rates to determine how expectations responded.

  Our results indicate that the change in policy regime was rapid and that

  individuals quickly understood the new environment they were facing.

           The Adjustment of Expectations to a Change in Regime:

               A Study of the Founding of the Federal Reserve


          N. Gregory Mankiw, Jeffery A. Miron, and David N. Weil*




     How the economy reacts to a major change in the policy regime is an

issue of widespread disagreement.   At one extreme, some economists (e.g.,

Thomas Sargent, 1982, 1983) suggest that if a change in regime is

sufficiently credible, the economy will move quickly to the new rational

expectations equilibrium. Yet others (e.g., John Taylor, 1975; Benjamin

Friedman, 1979; Christopher Sims, 1982) argue that instant credibility is

unlikely and that rational individuals should typically be expected to learn

gradually about the new stochastic environment. This disagreement over how

quickly economic agents perceive a change in their environment naturally

leads to disagreement over the short-run impact of policy changes.

     This paper is a case study of one particular change in regime--the

introduction of the Federal Reserve System at the end of 1914. We use data

on the term structure of interest rates to estimate how quickly individuals

came to understand the new stochastic environment in which they were

operating. Since long—term interest rates in part reflect expectations of

future short-term interest rates, term structure data allow us to infer how

expectations adapted to this change in regime.
                                     —2—

     In Section I we provide a brief historical overview of the introduction

of the Federal Reserve System. Our emphasis in particular is on the

prevailing view of the impact of the Fed prior to its beginning of

operations. Such historical evidence is by its nature difficult to

interpret and highly controvertible. Our reading of the historical record,

however, is that observers during 1914 expected the Fed to effect a major

change in the economic forces determining interest rates.

     We document in Section II that a substantial change in the stochastic

process of short-term interest rates did indeed occur. In the period from

1890 to 1910, short rates were quickly mean—reverting and highly seasonal.

By contrast, in the period from 1920 to 1933, short rates were much more

persistent; indeed, they were close to a random walk. There is little doubt

that there was a major change in the stochastic process generating interest

rates.

     In Section III we examine the relation between long-term (six-month)

and short—term (three-month) interest rates. Since the long rate

incorporates an expectation of a future short rate, a change in the

stochastic process generating short rates should alter the relation between

long and short rates. In other words, as Robert Lucas's (1976) critique

suggests, the parameters of traditional term structure equations relating

long rates to short rates (e.g., Franco Modigliani and Richard Sutch, 1966)

should not remain invariant across regimes. In particular, since shocks to

the short rate were less persistent in the 1890—1910 period than in the

1920-1933 period, the long rate should be less responsive to the short rate
                                      —3—

 in the earlier period. We find that the relation between six-month and

 three-month rates did in fact change in the way suggested by

 expectations-based theories of the term structure.

     We examine in Section IV the timing of the change in regime. Using

switching-regression techniques, we estimate that the most likely date for

the change in the stochastic process of the short rate is between December

1914 and March 1915. This estimate, which uses only interest rate data,

coincides almost exactly with the date at which the Federal Reserve began

operation. We consider the possibility that the change in regime was

gradual, but find instead that it occurred essentially all at once.

     In Section V we study how quickly financial market participants

perceived the change in regime. Our inferences are based on the premise

that long-term interest rates depend on individuals' perception of the

stochastic process the short rate is following. If there was a substantial

lag in individuals' recognition of the change in their environment, then the

relation between long rates and short rates should have changed long after

the change in regime itself took place. By contrast, we find that the

change in the relation between the six-month rate and the three-month rate

roughly coincided with the change in regime. This finding suggests that

financial market participants quickly understood the stochastic processes

generated by the new policy regime and that, at least for this historical

episode, the convergence to the new rational expectations equilibrium was

quite rapid.

     We conclude in Section VI. The evidence from the founding of the Fed
suggests that a major change in a policy regime, backed with the

establishment of new and powerful institutions, can be understood very

quickly by financial market participants. It would of course be imprudent

to extrapolate directly this single historical episode to the evaluation of

other sorts of policy proposals. This episode does illustrate, however, the

potential for rapid adjustment of agents' expectations in the face of

substantial and widely believed changes in the continuing policy rule.


I. Historical Overview

     The year 1914 witnessed two crucial events in the world of finance:1

the creation of an important new institution, the Federal Reserve System,

and the elimination of an old one, the classical Gold Standard.2 In the

sections that follow, we provide econometric evidence that there was a

substantial change in regime and that this change was understood by

financial market participants at the time. Our goal in this section is

to show that such a conclusion is historically plausible; indeed, it is

suggested by the literature of the time. After describing briefly the

events surrounding the passage of the Federal Reserve Act and the opening of

the Reserve Banks, we show that the relevant economic actors were aware that

a regime change was taking place and had a rough idea of how the new regime

would differ from the old.

     The proximate cause of the founding of the Fed was the financial panic

of 1907, which severely disrupted the economy and was widely blamed for

the 1907—1908 recession. In 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich-Vreeland

Act, the most important result of which was creation of the National
                                     -5—

Monetary Commission. This group of legislators, academics, and bankers

published a report in 1910 that discussed in enormous detail the positive

and negative features of the United States' and foreign finanical systems;

the report served as a major impetus to the founding of the Fed. The

Federal Reserve Act passed into law on December 23, 1913. The presidents

of the banks met for the first time in July of 1914 and discussed the

organization the system would take; the banks officially opened for business

on November 16, 1914.

     It is hard to believe that any change of regime was more widely

perceived than the founding of the Federal Reserve.   Paul Warburg, a

well-known investment banker and advocate of the creation of the Fed,

specifically applied the metaphor of a change in political regime, calling

the Fed's founding "the Fourth of July in the economic life of our nation."3

The New York Times for November 16, 1914 editorialized that "the starting of

the Federal Reserve system, although incompletely, opens a new era in which

'old statistics do not count.'"4 We could not hope for a more precise

description of how an economic actor should respond to structural change.

      The precise manner in which the Fed would operate was of course not

known by financial market participants. The discussion in the report

of the National Monetary Commission, however, makes clear that at least one

essential function of the Fed was to operate a discount mechanism that

would provide credit in times of excess demand, thereby dampening interest

rate fluctuations and decreasing the frequency of bank failures. The day

before the opening of the Fed, Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo

announced:
                                     —6—

     The opening of these banks marks a new era in the history of business
     and finance in this country. It is believed that they will put an
     end to the annual anxiety from which the country has suffered
     for the last generation about insufficient money and credit to move
     the crops each year, and will give such stability to the banking
     business that extreme fluctuations in interest rates and available
     credits which have characterized banking in the past will be
     destroyed permanently. 5

The financial press also believed that the introduction of the Fed would

initiate an "elastic" currency and credit system.6 No longer would interest

rates have to move over such a great range to match the supply and demand

nr
     The evidence -indicates strongly that financial market participants

understood the intentions of the new institution. What we are unable to

extract from the histor-ical record is whether businessmen at the time of the

Fed's founding expected it to accomplish its assigned tasks, or

alternatively, how long they expected the Fed would take to reach full

operation. We can determine, however, that within a year of the opening of

the Fed, popular opinion was that, as far as stabilization of the credit

market was concerned, the Fed had accomplished all that it had set out to

do. "What has thus far been done has been effectual in rendering stable and

more uniform rates of discount prevalent throughout the country," wrote

"Washington Notes" in the Journal of Political Economy.7 On the subject of

whether the Fed was wholly responsible for the year of ease in the credit

markets that had followed its founding, The Times wrote:


     Few will contend that the favorable progress of the year is altogether
     due to the betterment of the conditions of banking and of commercial
     credit through the operation of the Reserve system. Fewer still will
     contend that the system did not reenforce the forces making for recovery
     in ways that hardly anybody foresaw. No doubt the extremely easy money
     market assisted, but the money market would hardly have been so easy
                                     —7—

     without the certainty that there would be no currency-scarcity under the
     Federal system.8




II. The Stochastic Process of the Short Rate

     The historical evidence presented above suggests that the behavior of

short—term interest rates was a key feature of the change in regime

associated with the founding of the Federal Reserve System. It is therefore

natural to focus on this variable when studying the transition from the old

regime to the new one.9 The interest rate series that we examine here is the

three—month time loan rate available at New York City banks for the first

week of each month during the period from 1890 to 1933.10 New York was

already the major financial center of the country at this time. As John

James (1978, pp. 61-64) reports, most loans in bank portfolios were

short-term and most loans in New York were fixed maturity. We are thus

examining here the rates on an important form of short-term commercial

credit. Since there was no significant Treasury bill market until the early

1930s, it is one of the principal short—term rates in the economy.

     Table 1 shows the autocorrelations of the short rate during two

different sample periods.11 The first ends clearly before the changes that

led to the new regime, while the second begins several years after the

changes had occurred (as well as after the end of World War I). We present

the autocorrelations for both the level of the rate and its first difference.

The standard deviation of the short rate, both in levels and first

differences, is provided at the bottom of the table.
                                    —8—

     For the 1891-1910 period, the first autocorrelation of the level of the

short rate is 0.75, and the autocorrelations die out fairly quickly. Seven

out of the first eight autocorrelations of the change in the short rate are

negative, indicating that the short rate was at least partly mean—reverting.

For the 1921-1933 period, the first autocorrelation of the level is close to

one and the autocorrelations die out very slowly. All the autocorrelations

of the change in the short rate are small for this later period.

    The regression results in Table 2 confirm the impressions given by

Table 1. We show, for the two sample periods, regressions of the short rate

on its own lagged value, including and excluding seasonal dummies. In the

earlier period, the coefficient on the lagged short rate is significantly less

than one, again indicating that the short rate was mean—reverting. Also, the

seasonal dummies enter strongly significantly in the first period.12 In the

later period, the coefficient on the lagged short rate is close to one and the

seasonal dummy variables do not enter significantly, suggesting that the short

rate is close to a random walk. These results demonstrate that the process

for the short rate was very different after the founding of the Federal

Reserve and the abandonment of the Gold Standard.


III. The Short Rate Process and the Term Structure of Interest Rates

     In this section we examine the implications of expectations-based

theories of the term structure for a traditional term structure equation,

such as that suggested by Modigliani and Sutch. As the Lucas critique

suggests, one should not expect such an equation to remain invariant when

there is a fundamental change in the stochastic process generating short
                                          —g-

rates. We show that the parameters of a reduced form equation estimated

over the two regimes considered in the previous section did -in fact change

in the way one would have predicted.


Theory

      Let rt be the three—month yield and Rt be the six-month yield.

Consider a reduced-form equation relating the longer-term rate to the

short—rate:


(1)       Rt =

where a and    are parameters and t is a random error. Equafion (1) is the

simplest version of the Modigliani-Sutch equation. This sort of equation,

often with additional lags, is used for policy analysis both in large—scale

models such as the MPS model (as noted by Olivier Blanchard, 1984) and in

smaller—scale simulation models (e.g., Richard Clarida and Benjamin

Friedman, 1984).

      Expectations-based theories of the term structure relate the long—term

rate to current and expected future short-term rates. With monthly data,


(2)      Rt = 5 (rt +       Etrt+3)   +



where Et denotes the expectation conditional on information available at

time t and e denotes the term premium. On the basis of the evidence

discussed above, let us suppose the short rate follows a first-order

autoregressive process.13    That is, ignoring the constant and seasonal dummies

for simplicity,
                                       -10-

(3)        rt+l =   p   rt +


Equations (2) and (3) imply that


(4)        Rt =      (1 + p3) rt +


The standard expectations theory of the term structure, which is the

hypothesis that the term premium is constant, thus implies a restriction

across equations (1) and (3).    In particular, it implies that


(5)            =    (1 + p3).


The more persistent are shocks to the short rate (higher p), the greater is

the response of the long rate to the short rate (higher ).

      If   the term premium 8 is constant through time, as the expectations

theory assumes, then equation (4) has no error. More generally, however, if

the term premium varies but is uncorrelated with the short rate, then

equation (4) has an error but this error does not change the restriction in

equation (5). Since the restriction in equation (5) is much more general

than the expectations theory, the abundant evidence against the expectations

theory (e.g., Robert Shiller, John Campbell, and Kermit Schoenholtz, 1982;

Gregory Mankiw and Jeffrey Miron, 1985) is not directly relevant to this

restriction.

      Once one interprets the error in the Modigliani-Sutch equation

as the term premium, however, there is no reason to suppose it is serially

uncorrelated. Below we quasi-difference equation (1) to correct for serial

correlation. As long as the term premium is uncorrelated with the short
                                      —11—

rate at leads and lags, the restriction in equation (5) continues to hold.

     We can now see the implications of a change in the stochastic process

generating the short rate. Since the dynamic process of the short rate

(equation 3) changed from 1890-1910 to 1920—1933, there should have been a

change in the parameter of the Modigliani-Sutch relation (equation 1).     In

particular, since shocks to the short rate became more persistent, the

long-term interest rate should have become more responsive to the short-term

interest rate.



Evidence

     Tables 3 and 4 present estimates of equation (1) for the two sample

periods considered in Section II.   In Table 3 we use the level of long and

short rates, while in Table 4 we use quasi-differenced data in order to

account for serial correlation. The filter we use is (1 - 0.5 L), which is

suggested by the Durbin-Watson statistic of the regression in levels and

appears to leave the residual approximately serially uncorrelated. The

coefficient estimates we obtain with quasi—differenced data are not

qualitatively very different from those we obtain with the raw data. We

hereafter restrict our attention to the results with quasi-differenced data.

     These results show clearly the effects of regime changes predicted by

Lucas. In particular, the relation between long rates and short rates

changed when the process for short rates changed in the way that the

expectations theory predicts. The coefficient in the Modigliani-Sutch

regression increased from 0.47 to 0.93 between the two periods.   At least
                                      —12—

by the time period covered in our second sample, agents had come to

understand that a new, more persistent, process for the short rate was in

effect, and they had altered their behavior accordingly.14

     The results, however, are not completely consistent with the simple

theory discussed above. While the sort of parameter drift observed is in

line with that predicted by theory, the point estimates of the coefficient

-in the Modigliani-Sutch equation are somewhat different than predicted. The

short rate equation in Table 2 predicts a coefficient of 0.73 for the

1890—1910 period and 0.97 for the 1920—1933 period, in contrast to the

actual estimates of 0.47 and 0.93. Thus, for the earlier period, the point

estimate -is quite different from what the theory predicts.

     Table S presents joint estimates of the two equations imposing the

cross-equation restriction in equation (5). The estimate of the parameter in

the Modigliani-Sutch equation is 0.61 for the 1890—1910 period and 0.94 for

the 1920—1933 period. Not surprisingly, these estimates are between those

in Table 4 and those implied by Table 2. A formal likelihood ratio test of

the cross-equation restriction between the short rate equation and the

Modigliani—Sutch equation rejects that restriction for the 1890-1910 period

but not for the 1920—1933 period.'5

     This statistical rejection of the cross-equation restriction appears

attributable to the assumption that the term premium is uncorrelated with

the short—term interest rate. To illustrate directly the covariation

between the term premium and the short rate, we can regress the excess

holding return on long bonds, (Rt —   0.5(rt   +   rt+3)),   on the short rate, rt,
                                        —13—

adjusting the standard errors for the moving average residual. The

coefficient on the short rate is -.11 with a t—statistic of 1.84 in the

1890-1910 period and -.01 with a t-statistic of 0.35 in the later period.

Hence, covariation between the term premium and the short rate appears to

account for the statistical rejection in the early period.16 While this

covariation invalidates the cross-equation restriction in equation (5), a

more persistent short rate (higher p) nonetheless leads, ceteris paribus, to

a more responsive long rate (higher ).        It   is in this weaker sense that the

evidence is consistent with the theory presented above.



IV. The Timing of the Change in Regime

     In this section we try to pin down the timing of the change in the

stochastic process for the three—month interest rate. We begin by

determining the most likely date for the change in regime, conditional on

the assumption that the change occurred all at once.             We then consider the

possibility that the change in regime occurred gradually over time.


Step Switching

     Suppose that the process for the short rate obeyed

         rt+l =      K0 + p0   rt +   vt.,     t =

         rt+l    =      +p     rt +   v.t.,    t =   T51....,T
where T5 is the switch date (the first period of the new regime). Our goal

is to estimate T5. The procedure we use is the maximum likelihood

procedure suggested by Stephen Goldfeld and Richard Quandt (1976) and

recently applied by John Huizinga and Frederic Mishkin (1985) to the
                                                     —14—

stochastic process followed by real interest rates. Assuming normal errors,

the log likelihood function for this model is



           log L =   -        log(2ir)   -
                                                                                (1   -

We can determine the maximum likelihood value for T5 by computing the

maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for all possible TS and

then choosing the value of T with the maximum likelihood.

      Table 6 shows the log likelihood of various possible switch dates

around the maximum likelihood switch date.17 According to these results, the

most likely date of the new regime is December 1914 when month dummies are

excluded but February 1915 when month dummies are included. Remember that

the Federal Reserve System opened for operation on November 16, 1914. This

econometric estimate of the date of the new regime is thus very close to

the date an historical account would suggest.

     To judge the degree of confidence one should have in these point

estimates of the date the new regime began, we calculate the posterior odds

ratio for alternative switch dates. If one has diffuse priors (that is,

one considers all possible switch dates equally likely), then the ratio of

the likelihood values for different switch dates produces the posterior

odds ratio. The posterior odds ratio is the ratio of subjective
                                     —15—

probabilities of different switch dates conditioning on the data.18

     Table 6 shows, for a range of possible switch dates, the posterior

odds ratio of that date as a switch date compared to the maximum likelihood

date. The months from December 1914 to March 1915 are all highly probable

as the date of the regime change. The relative odds for the dates before

December 1914 or after May 1915, however, are extremely low. Hence,

although we cannot be certain of the exact date of the sw-itch, we can

conclude with a high degree of confidence that the date for the switch was

within a few months after the beginning of the Federal Reserve System.

     Since the posterior odds ratio for any potential switch date before

December 1914 is very low, the change in the stochastic process for short

rates is more likely attributable to the founding of the Fed than to the

abandonment of the Gold Standard.19 The Gold Standard was suspended at the

outbreak of World War I in August 1914. The results in Table 6 indicate

that the months between the beginning of the War and the introduction of the

Fed are more consistent with the old regime than with the new regime. A

casual examination of the data easily explains this result. Between

November 1914 and December 1914, the short term interest rate fell from 6

percent to 4 1/8 percent. If the new (random walk) regime had already

been in effect, such an event would have been very unusual: it would have

required approximately a four standard deviation shock. Under the old

(mean—reverting) regime, such an event was much less atypical: it required

approximately a one standard deviation shock.   Hence, these data imply that

it is very unlikely that the new regime began before December 1914.20

Logistic Switching

        Our second procedure for determining the timing of the change in the

process for short rates is to estimate a time-varying parameter model that

allows the coefficients of the short rate equation to change gradually over

time, rather than moving instantaneously from the old to the new values as

in the switching regression above. Specifically, we assume that the

parameters of the short rate equation follow a logistic curve. That is,

the short rate process is



           r÷1 =        + pt'.'t   +



while   the parameters for this process change as


           Kt   = (1—L(t))K0       +   L(t)K,
                =
                    (1—L(t))p0     +
                                       L(t)p,
                =   (1—L(t))2c2        +


where


           L(t) =
                      e a+ôt
                    1+e
All the parameters of the short rate process adjust continuously together.

     The parameters a and a determine when the regime change occurs. In

particular, at t =    -a/ô,   L(t) =       1/2 and the logistic curve has its
inflection. At this date, the short rate process is an equal mix of the

old and the new regimes.
                                               —17—

      The parameter 5 determines the rate at which the parameters change

 from their old values to their new values. Since L(t) reaches one only

 asymptotically, the parameters approach their new values asymptotically.

 To judge the speed of the change in regime, define the dates t(1/4) and

t(3/4) implicitly as

          L(t(1/4)) =    1/4
          L(t(3/4)) =    3/4.
Then t(3/4) -   t(1/4)   is the period of time it takes for the parameters to

make one half of the adjustment (from one-fourth new regime to

three—fourths new regime). Straightforward algebra shows that

         t(3/4) -   t(1/4)      =   log(9)/o
Hence, the parameter S is inversely related to the rate of adjustment

between regimes. The limit of the logistic curve (6 — oo) is the step

function, so this time—varying parameter model includes our earlier model

as an extreme case.

     Table 7 presents results for the logistic time-varying parameter

specification of the short rate process. The parameters are estimated with

maximum likelihood assuming normal errors; see Goldfeld and Quandt.

We estimate the short rate process both excluding and including month

dummies. To reduce the computational problem, when month dummies are

included, their coefficients are set equal to the values estimated for the

old and new regimes as presented in Table 2.

     Since the rate of adjustment is the key parameter here, we present

the results for various rates of adjustment, choosing the remaining
                                     -18-

parameters to maximize the likelihood function. For each rate of

adjustment, we present the maximum likelihood switch date (L(T5) = 1/2), the

maximum likelihood value achievable with that rate of adjustment, and the

posterior odds ratio for that rate of adjustment relative to the maximum

likelihood rate of adjustment.

     The results in Table 7 indicate that either the step function (8 = co)

or a very steep logistic curve has the highest likelihood value.   Since the

implied switch dates for these curves are in the first few months of 1915,

these steep logistic curves closely approximate the step function considered

above. The likelihoods of less steep logistic curves, however, are much

lower. We can conclude with a high degree of confidence that most of the

change in regime occurred in less than one year.



V. Learning About the Change in Regime

     In Section III we demonstrated that, at least after a period of several

years, agents had correctly responded to the new stochastic process for    the
short rate. Here we estimate how quickly this response occurred. As in our

treatment of the short rate process, we examine both step switching and

logistic switching.

     The relationship between long rates and short rates depends on agents1

perception of their environment. Suppose, for example, that even after the

stochastic process for the short rate had changed to the more persistent

process, agents had believed that the old mean-reverting process for the

short rate was still in effect. (Such a situation might arise if agents had
                                     -19-

applied standard regression techniques to recent data to estimate the short

rate process.) In this case, fluctuations in the short rate would have been

perceived as more transitory than they truly were. The long rate, which

depends on the expected short rate, would have responded to the short rate

as under the old regime. In other words, if perceptions adjusted gradually

to the new regime, then the change in the empirical relationship between

long and short rates should lag the change in the short rate process.


Step Switching

     Table 8 presents the log likelihood of the Modigliani-Sutch equation

for a range of possible switch dates around the maximum likelihood date.21

The maximum likelihood switch date is December 1914 when month dummies are

excluded and October 1914 when month dummies are included. The posterior

odds ratio of all dates from October 1914 to January 1915 are fairly high.

We can state with a high degree of confidence that the Modigliani-Sutch

equation changed within a few months of the date the process for the short

rate changed, even though we cannot be confident about the exact date. The

data strongly support the conclusion that agents quickly understood that

the introduction of the Fed had changed the stochastic environment in which

they were operating.


LoQistic Switching

     We present estimates of the logistic model for the Modigliani-Sutch

equation in Table g22 Both excluding and including month dummies, the

maximum likelihood estimate of the time it took for the parameters to move
                                     -20-

half-way is one month, and the implied switch date is November 1914. The

posterior odds ratios presented in the Table show that adjustment periods of

several months are reasonably likely, but that an adjustment period of six

months or longer is highly improbable.

     This result, that the participants in financial markets reacted quickly

and properly to the change in the stochastic process of the short rate within

a few months, is striking. It is clear that agents could not have estimated

the new process for the short rate in just a few months. Our results

suggest, nonetheless, that they had a good understanding of exactly what the

new regime would be like. This finding is particularly dramatic, because

the new regime was not the sort of event for which there were many past

observations from which to draw infererences.

     Indeed, the data are consistent with an even stronger conclusion. We

can see from the results that the Modigliani-Sutch equation may have changed

before the process for the short rate changed. This finding suggests that

agents anticipated the effects of the introduction of the Fed and modified

their behavior accordingly, even before the Fed actually existed. If agents

knew in October that the process for short rates would change in December,

then the long rate implied by the expectations theory should have

incorporated this fact. As we discuss in Section I, the Act establishing the

Fed was passed in 1913, and the announcement of the opening of the Fed

occurred in July 1914. Thus, as a matter of history, agents did know when

the Fed would begin operations. It is not implausible that agents also

understood in advance the impact the Fed would have on the pattern of

interest rates.

VI. Conclusion

     The picture that emerges from this study is that of a remarkably fast

adjustment of expectations and behavior in the face of a major change in the

economic policy regime. We of course cannot determine exactly the timing and

rate of adjustment to the new regime. Nonetheless, it would be difficult

to reconcile these data with the hypothesis that agents observed the new

regime for many months before responding to it.

     Several caveats are in order. First, by looking only at term structure

data, we are able to examine only the expectations of a relatively small

group: New York financiers and businessmen who participated in the time loan

market. Indeed, it may not even be necessary that all members of this group

held the correct expectation right away; arbitrage by a well—informed subset

might have produced the results we find. One should be cautious in applying

our findings to situations in which the relevant expectations are those of a

larger or less sophisticated group of economic actors.

     Second, the implications of the regime change that we study, at least

for short-term credit markets, were not difficult to predict. Since

interest rate stability was one of the announced targets of Fed policy, no

one should have been surprised that the stochastic process of short rates

did in fact change. In many other cases of regime changes, the crucial

expectations are those of non-target variables. In these cases, the

relevant economic actors must have an implicit or explicit model of the

economy, which complicates their problem of understanding the new regime.

    Finally, we note that observers in 1914 could have had a high degree of
                                     -22-

confidence that the Federal Reserve System would function as had been

announced in advance. There was only modest political opposition to the new

institution and no apparent benefits to the Fed in not fulfilling the

expectations it had created. Our study does not speak directly to the

problem of achieving credibility for an optimal but time—inconsistent

policy.

     The primary implication of all these caveats is that many particular

circumstances facilitated the rapid adjustment of expectations to the regime

change studied here. We therefore cannot be certain whether this phenomenon

is to be found more generally. But the creation of the Federal Reserve does

illustrate the surprising speed with which financial market participants can

at times respond to a major change in the economic policy regime.

Data Appendix

     The data used in this paper are the time loan rates available at New York

banks during the first week of the month from 1890 to 1933.   In 1910, the

National Monetary Comission compiled these data from 1890 to 1909 by

tabulating them from the Financial Review. We updated these series using the

Review and the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, which took over from the

Review in 1921. The rates are reported as a range, which is typically 12.5

to 25 basis points in size. We use the midpoint of the range. Tables Al and

A2 report all the data used.

1.   The year 1914 also saw the outbreak of World War I. Our estimates of

the stochastic process followed by the short-term interest rate indicate

that the short rate followed essentially the same process in the 1915-1918

period as in the 1919-1933 period. It appears, therefore, that the war was

not itself the major factor -in the regime change examined here. Truman

Clark (1986) has recently called into question whether the change in the

behavior of interest rates at this time was due to the founding of the

Federal Reserve, noting that a similar change took place in other countries

as well. Clark provides no alternative explanation, however. While our

econometric results below point to the founding of the Fed rather than the

abandonment of the Gold Standard as the likely cause of the regime change,

our analysis of the adjustment of expectations does not rely on the Fed

being the source of the change.


2.   The classical Gold Standard effectively came to an end at the outbreak

of World War I at the beginning of August 1914. During the period

1919—1931, most countries expected to return to a fully operational Gold
                                     -36-

Standard and several resumed specie payments for limited periods. Overall,

however, the period was not very similar to the classical Gold Standard era.

6.   The Wall Street Journal wrote, "The periodical convulsions in the money

market for some time past had indicated clearly that there was something

wrong with the currency medium of exchange of the country which was shown to

be the lack of elasticity of circulation." (November 16, 1914, page 1) The

New York Times wrote, "When the new regime is fully operative, the currency

volume will rise and fall with bank deposits, which will rise and fall with

the course of trade." (November 16, 1914, page 8)

9.   Our focus here on the nominal short rate and the term structure of

nominal interest rates is not meant to imply that real interest rates are

unimportant. The expectations theory implies a change in the relation

betheen long and short nominal rates even if, as Robert Shiller (1980)

suggests, the stochastic process for real rates did not change.

 10. This data set is described in the Data Appendix and is examined in Mankiw

and Miron (1986a).


11. We end the second sample in 1933 because in that year the Glass—Steagall

act introduced a variety of banking regulations. The results would be

essentially the same if we ended the second period before the beginning of

the Great Depression in 1929.


12. The seasonal fluctuations in interest rates, which are not of primary

importance for the issues we address in this paper, are discussed in

Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1963, pp. 292-296), Shiller (1980), Miron

(1986), Clark (1986), and Mankiw and Miron (1986b).



13. The assumption implicit here is that individuals have no information in

forecasting the short rate other than the variables included in this

equation. This assumption is obviously a strong one and can only be

justified as an approximation. One test is to include the long rate in the

forecasting equation, since the long rate would reflect any additional

information on the future short rate. For the 1890-1910 period, the long

rate coefficient is statistically significant but the improvement in fit is

very small: the standard error of estimate falls by only .027 (2.7 basis

points) .   For the 1920—1933 period, the long rate coefficient is not

statistically significant. Hence, the assumption that agents have little

information additional to that in our posited forecasting equation appears

empirically plausible.

14. Stanley Fischer (1983) writes, "It is indeed remarkable that the Lucas

policy evaluation critique has triumphed without any detailed empirical

support beyond Lucas's assertion that macroeconometric models in the 1960s

all predicted too little inflation in the 1970s. The general point made by

the cr-itique is correct and was known before it was so eloquently and

forcefully propounded by Lucas. That the point has been empirically

relevant, however, is something that should have been demonstrated rather

than asserted." The evidence from the founding of the Fed provides such a

demonstration.


15. Under the assumption that the error in the Mod-igliani-Sutch equation is

the term premium and independent of the error in the short rate equation, the

joint log likelihood is the sum of the two individual log likelihoods. We

maximize the joint log likelihood by numerical optimization. We do not impose

here cross—equation restrictions on the month dummies, which allows for the

possibility of a seasonal term premium.


16. Measurement error in the short rate is observationally equivalent to a

negative covariation between the term premium and the short rate. While

there is clearly some measurement error in these data, since the interest

rates are the midpoint of a reported range of typically 12.5-25 basis

points, we suspect that the measurement error is not sufficiently great to

explain the results reported in the text.


17. We have searched over all possible switch dates 1890-1933, but only

report values around the global maximum. Since the coefficient estimates

are essentially the same as those in Table 2, we do not report them here.
                                     —39—

 18. We view this posterior odds ratio as a simple metric for judging how

 flat or steep is the likelihood function. Note that for each switch date,

the remaining parameters are chosen to maximize the likelihood. An

alternative caTculation (see, e.g., Donald Holbert, 1982) would be to posit

a prior joint distribution over all the parameters, to use the likelihood

function to yield a posterior joint distribution over all the parameters,

and then to integrate out the remaining parameters to produce the posterior

marginal distribution for the switch date. In our application, since the

most likely values of the remaining parameters vary very little over

plausible switch dates, we believe this latter calculation would produce

similar conclusions.


19. We do not intend to suggest that the abandonment of the Gold Standard

was completely irrelevant. If the Gold Standard had continued in effect,

the Fed may have been less able to affect nominal interest rates.


20. If the single observation of the November-December drop in the short

rate is excluded, we are unable to distinguish between the abandonment of

the Gold Standard and the founding of the Fed as the cause of the regime

change.


21. The coefficient estimates are essentially the same as those in Table 4.


22. We again reduce the computational problem by using the estimates in

Table 4 for the month dummies.
