                                           ABSTRACT

The U.S. Social Security system has helped keep many retirees out of poverty. However, according

to the Social Security and Medicare Trustees, Social Security faces a future financial shortfall of

$10.4 trillion in present value. This enormous imbalance has received little attention in public

debates about Social Security. Instead, the media and policymakers continue to focus on the

program's trust fund and several other ad-hoc measures that create a misleading impression of the

size of Social Security's financial problem. Although the Social Security Trust Fund is not projected

to be exhausted until 2042, Social Security's $10.4 trillion present value imbalance is accruing

interest and will grow by $600 billion during 2004 alone. The current cash-flow federal budget,

however, is biased against reforms that would improve Social Security's finances. As shown herein,

a new federal accounting system would remove this bias.

                The U.S. Social Security system has helped keep many retirees out of
        poverty. However, according to the Social Security and Medicare Trustees,
        Social Security faces a future financial shortfall of $10.4 trillion in present value.
        This enormous imbalance has received little attention in public debates about
        Social Security. Instead, the media and policymakers continue to focus on the
        program’s trust fund and several other ad-hoc measures that create a misleading
        impression of the size of Social Security’s financial problem. Although the Social
        Security Trust Fund is not projected to be exhausted until 2042, Social Security’s
        $10.4 trillion present value imbalance is accruing interest and will grow by $600
        billion during 2004 alone. The current cash-flow federal budget, however, is
        biased against reforms that would improve Social Security’s finances. As shown
        herein, a new federal accounting system would remove this bias.

                                              1. Introduction

        Social Security covers almost the entire U.S. population, providing participants and their

spouses with retirement, disability, and other benefits during different stages of life. Social

Security is currently the largest single outlay in the U.S. federal budget and it is judged by many

to be one of the most successful programs in U.S. history. Although Social Security replaces

only about 40 percent of annual earnings prior to retirement on average, it provides an important

“first pillar” of retirement income. Social Security is often credited with reducing poverty among

the elderly in the United States (Engelhardt and Gruber, 2004).

           Participation in Social Security is mandatory for most occupations.3 Social Security is

financed by a 12.4 percent payroll tax on covered earnings up to a limit ($87,900 in 2004) that

increases each year with the economy-wide average wage. This tax is split evenly between

employer and employee. Participants earn “fully insured” status after they contributed for 40

calendar quarters.         Fully insured participants do not accrue a contractual right to specific

amounts of benefits.4 Instead, they earn a non-contractual right to benefits that are payable

according to the laws in effect at the time--laws that are subject to change by Congress.

           Thus, Social Security is a “defined benefit” plan where a retiree’s benefit is determined

by a specific formula applied to his or her wage history. In contrast, periodic withdrawals from a

voluntary tax-favored retirement plans -- 401(k), 403(b), Keogh, and others -- generate

retirement income based directly on a person’s previous contributions and subsequent returns.

           Whereas withdrawals from voluntary tax-favored retirement plans are fully funded by

previous contributions, Social Security was mostly financed on a “pay-as-you-go” basis between

the 1940s and the early 1980s: payroll tax revenue collected each year was paid out almost

immediately as benefits rather than saved. This financing structure meant that those who retired

shortly after Social Security was launched received more benefits from Social Security in present

value than they paid in past taxes. These windfalls continued as the Social Security program’s

coverage and benefits expanded after 1950 until well into the 1970s (Geanakoplos, et al., 1998).

           Unfortunately, the windfalls to previous generations do not come for free: they must be

paid for by future generations who receive lower rates of return on their payroll taxes compared

to the rates they could have earned if they instead invested their contributions in government

bonds. In fact, all future generations are worse off (Breyer, 1989).5

1.1. Building the Trust Fund

         During the early 1980s, the independent Office of the Actuary at the Social Security

Administration projected that revenues would fall short of benefit outlays during the early part of

the twenty-first century, largely due to the retirement of “Baby Boomers.” While Baby Boomers

have contributed significantly to the labor force during the past several decades, they will soon

retire and the number of workers alive to support retirees will decrease substantially. As shown

in Figure 1, today there are almost five people of working age (between 20 and 64) for each

retiree age 65 and over. By 2030, the number of working-aged people per retiree will decline to

less than three; by 2080, the ratio will decline to about two.

         The Social Security Act, therefore, was amended in 1983 in an attempt to increase the

system’s cash flow over the subsequent 75 years.                       The amendments raised payroll taxes,

subjected benefits to income taxation, and scheduled a gradual increase in the full retirement age

from 65 to 67 beginning in 2003. These changes have generated surpluses since 1983 that are

deposited into the Social Security trust fund. The investment of these surpluses into Treasury

securities has resulted in the accumulation of $1.6 trillion in the program’s trust fund.

         Despite these reforms, the Social Security system is still mostly pay-as-you-go financed.

Although $1.6 trillion appears to be a large number, it is sufficient to pay current retirees their

scheduled benefits for just three years. Had the 1983 Amendments “fully funded” the Social

Security system, the trust fund would hold about $12.7 trillion today. In that case, contributions

 Assuming that the growth rate of the economy is less than the interest rate (the so-called “dynamic efficiency”
condition), the present value of the gains and losses across all past, current and future generations is exactly zero.

by past and current generations would have been sufficient to cover their own benefits, and no

burden would have to be imposed on future generations.

1.2. Future Shortfalls Projected -- Again

           Although the 1983 Amendments were projected at the time to have resolved Social

Security’s financial shortfalls during the subsequent 75 years, projected imbalances began

appearing soon thereafter. As shown in Figure 2, payroll tax surpluses are currently projected to

continue until 2018 – the so-called “crossover” date – after which projected benefits will exceed

revenues. The trust fund will then be gradually depleted to cover the cash flow shortfalls and it

is expected to be exhausted by 2042.

           The Social Security Trustees project that the program’s present value of benefits under

current law over the next 75 years will exceed by $3.7 trillion the present value of its payroll tax

revenues plus the current value of the trust fund. The present value calculation discounts future

financial shortfalls at the government’s borrowing rate. In other words, if the government

deposited an additional $3.7 trillion immediately into the trust fund by raising taxes or reducing

spending, it would be able pay benefits scheduled under current law during the next 75 years.

An infusion of funds into the trust fund would also increase public and national saving if it were

not re-borrowed and spent on other government programs—a topic of recent debate.6 If the new

monies were entirely spent on other programs, the government’s overall capacity to pay future

benefits would not increase even though the trust fund would be larger.

           One reason that 75-year imbalances reappeared after 1983 is due to the “moving

window” phenomenon. In 1983, the 75-year projected window ended at 2057 whereas today it

    See Diamond (2003), Nataraj and Shoven (2004) and Smetters (2004).




                                                        4
ends in 2078. Most of the $3.7 trillion imbalance comes from simply moving the 75-year

window to cover the years 2058 through 2078 when cash flow shortfalls are projected.

           The problem of a “moving window” implies that reforms that produce solvency over just

75 years will soon begin to exhibit insolvency again as the window continues to move forward

into the future. As shown in the first panel in Table 1, the 2004 Social Security Trustees’ Report

projects that Social Security system faces an additional $6.7 trillion imbalance in present value

(as of 2004) after the year 2078. So a reform that solved Social Security’s 75-year imbalance

today would soon be insolvent as the 75-year window moved beyond 2078.

           Adding the $6.7 trillion imbalance after the year 2078 to the $3.7 trillion imbalance

projected through 2078 produces a present value imbalance of $10.4 trillion. Barring any reform

this year, this $10.4 trillion imbalance will grow with interest, just like any regular “debt

rollover.” According to 2004 Social Security Trustees’ Report, this imbalance grow by about

$600 billion over just a single year.7



                                       2. Measuring Sustainability

           Whereas the concept of solvency has typically been used to determine whether the

government can afford to pay benefits over the next 75 years, the concept of sustainability refers

to the ability to pay benefits into the indefinite future. A Social Security reform that achieves

solvency over a limited horizon but not sustainability will soon fail to even achieve solvency as

the time window moves to include future years. However, a reform that is projected to be

sustainable is also projected to be solvent during future years.      Under current conditions,

    The 2004 Social Security Trustees’ Report, Section IV.B.5.a.




                                                           5
achieving sustainability is harder than achieving solvency because sustainability requires making

an additional $6.7 trillion in adjustments in order to address the shortfalls after 2078.

        An ad-hoc measure of sustainability that is routinely used by the government involves

determining whether the following two conditions are satisfied.8 First, is the Social Security

system solvent? That is, can Social Security afford to pay benefits over the next 75 years out of

revenue collection over the next 75 years under current law plus the current trust fund value?

Second, is the trust fund projected to be increasing in size toward the end of the 75-year

window? Social Security is deemed to be sustainable if both conditions are met.

        This ad-hoc measure of sustainability, though, assumes that the trust fund will continue to

increase in size after the 75th year. This assumption is often not valid. For example, the recent

reform plan by Peter Diamond and Peter Orszag (2004) appears to be sustainable under this ad-

hoc approach. In particular, their reform plan is projected to achieve 75-year solvency and the

trust fund is projected to start increasing toward the end of the 75th year. However, in order for

the trust fund to not begin decreasing at some point after 75 years, tax rates must continue to

increase after the 75th year in order to pay projected benefits. If tax rates did not continue to

increase then their plan would appear to be sustainable under the ad-hoc approach but the trust

fund would eventually become depleted at some point after the 75th year.9

        Conversely, a reform might not appear to be sustainable under the ad-hoc measure even

though it fully eliminates the current $10.4 trillion present value imbalance. For example, Model

2 of the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (2001) is not projected to achieve

  See, for example, the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (2001, pp. 68 – 71), The Economic
Report of the President (2004, p. 139), The 2004 OASDI Trustees Report (Section IV.B.5.a)
9
  Diamond and Orszag (2004), however, advocate continuing to increase payroll tax rates after year 75.




                                                        6
solvency over the first 75 years – the first condition for sustainability under the ad-hoc measure -

- without general revenue transfers from the U.S. Treasury. However, if its reform measures

were kept in place after the 75th year, Model 2 would more-than eliminate the existing $10.4

trillion imbalance even without general revenue transfers. That is, the cost savings after the 75th

year in the reform would more-than offset in present value the shortfalls during the first 75 years.



                                  3. Bias in Policy Making

       The traditional ad-hoc measure of sustainability, therefore, has important shortcomings.

But probably the most important weakness of this and other traditional measures of Social

Security’s finances is that these measures introduce a bias in policymaking.          In particular,

reforms that could actually reduce Social Security’s $10.4 trillion imbalance – improving Social

Security’s long-run sustainability – often worsen each of the more traditional measures,

including the trust fund exhaustion date, the crossover date, and the 75-year imbalance.

       Consider the following reform known as an “actuarially-fair carve out.” Social Security

participants would be allowed to “carve out” some of their payroll taxes and deposit them into a

personal account that would be used to augment their traditional benefit. Since these participants

would now be contributing less to the traditional system, their traditional benefit would be

reduced by an “actuarially-fair” amount equal to one dollar in present value for each dollar they

carved out and deposited into their personal accounts.

       This reform would have no impact on the $10.4 trillion imbalance. Each dollar that the

government loses in payroll contributions would be fully offset by a dollar that the government

saves in present value of future benefit payments.          Furthermore, unless capital markets




                                                 7
responded in an uninformed manner (discussed in more detail later), this reform would not affect

wages, interest rates or the Gross Domestic Product in any year. Neither would this reform

change the net lifetime resources available to any household born at any time; in economic

terms, this reform would be fully neutral.

         Still, this reform would worsen all three of the traditional measures. The trust fund

would become exhausted earlier because of the short-run decline in payroll contributions;

similarly, the crossover date would occur sooner. The 75-year imbalance would also worsen

because some of the benefit reduction would fall beyond the 75-year window.

         Let’s modify the example to consider a “carve out with a haircut.” Under this approach,

a participant’s traditional Social Security benefit would be reduced by more than a dollar – say,

$1.10 – for every dollar carved out and deposited into his or her personal account. A worker

might be willing to take this “haircut” on his or her future benefits in order to obtain greater

control over his or her retirement resources.

         Now, the $10.4 trillion imbalance would be reduced since the government saves more on

benefit payments in present value than it loses in contributions. Still, the traditional measures of

Social Security’s finances would again worsen.10 If policymakers, therefore, continued to focus

on these traditional measures, this reform might be rejected even though it would improve Social

Security’s financial outlook. Because all calculations are made on a present value basis, this

reform would actually improve Social Security’s finances immediately – not just eventually.

         In sum, the traditional measures used to analyze Social Security’s finances are not very

revealing of the program’s true financial status, and they are biased against reforms that could

10
  Technically, whether the 75-year imbalance would improve or worsen would depend on the timing of the haircut.
In any case, the 75-year imbalance measure would fail to capture many of the benefit reductions after the 75th year.




                                                         8
reduce Social Security’s current $10.4 trillion imbalance. The traditional measures can also

influence the design of reform plans. For example, in Model 2 of the President’s Commission to

Strengthen Social Security, participants are allowed to carve out up to 4 percent of payroll, up to

a maximum of $1,000 per year (wage indexed over time). The Commission had to impose the

$1000 contribution ceiling because it did not want the traditional Social Security system to

“lose” too much money over the 75-year projection horizon since a large fraction of the

concomitant benefit reductions occurred after the 75th year. Model 2, however, could easily

eliminate the entire $10.4 trillion imbalance even with larger personal accounts.



                                   4. New Accounting Measures

        Beginning with the 2003 Social Security Trustees’ Report and continuing with the 2004

Report, the Trustees now report two important new measures of Social Security’s finances.

Beginning in 2004, the Medicare Trustees’ Report also includes these measures for the Medicare

system. These measures provide considerable insight into the financial status of both programs,

and they have recently been endorsed by the Social Security Advisory Board’s Technical Panel

on Assumptions and Methods that is composed of leading economists and actuaries outside of

the Social Security Administration.11 Indeed, these new measures correspond to the way that

economists have thought about these Social Security’s finances for many years.12

        The first measure is sometimes called the “open group unfunded obligation.” It sums

across all past, present and future generations (or “groups”) the amount of benefits that they

11
   See “The 2003 Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods Report”
[http://www.ssab.gov/NEW/documents/2003TechnicalPanelRept.pdf].
12
   See, for example, Auerbach (1994), Gokhale and Smetters (2003), Auerbach, Gale and Orszag (2004), and
Gramlich (2004), Rettenmaier and Saving (2004).




                                                       9
received (and are projected to receive) in present value less the amount of taxes they paid (and

are projected to pay). It can be calculated as the present value of projected future Social Security

benefits minus the present value of projected payroll taxes and minus the current value of the

trust fund.

        The open group unfunded obligation indicates the extent that the current Social Security

program is unsustainable – that is, it shows Social Security’s financial imbalance arising from all

generations—past, present, and future. Table 1 shows that based on calculations provided by the

independent Office of the Actuary at Social Security, the Trustees estimate the open-group

obligations at $10.4 trillion in present value. So, in order to make Social Security sustainable,

scheduled benefits must be reduced and/or taxes increased so that the sum of these cost savings

plus new revenues total $10.4 trillion in present value.

        The second measure is sometimes called the “closed group unfunded obligation.” It

shows the amount of Social Security’s $10.4 trillion imbalance from providing benefits to past

and present generations (those aged 15 and older plus those who are dead as of 2004) in excess

of their payroll taxes in present value. This calculation is “closed” to future generations whereas

the “open group” includes past, current, as well as future generations.

        Table 1 shows that, based on calculations provided by the independent Office of the

Actuary at Social Security, the Trustees estimate that past and current generations are projected

to receive about $11.2 trillion more in benefits in present value than they will pay in taxes. In

contrast, future generations (those aged 14 and younger in 2004 as well as the unborn) are

projected to receive $0.8 trillion less in benefits than they will pay in taxes (see Table 1). The

“overpayment” by future generations, though, is not enough to pay for the “overhang” of $11.2




                                                 10
trillion they are projected to inherit from current and past generations under current law. Either

future generations will have to pay an additional $10.4 trillion in present value or generations

alive today will have to make this sacrifice, or a combination of both.

        The open-group and closed-group measures are robust to the criticisms that apply to

traditional measures of Social Security’s finances—as note above. For example, both measures

would correctly identify the economic as well as intergenerational neutralities of the actuarially

fair carve out discussed earlier. In the case of a “carve out with a haircut,” the open-group and

closed-group measures would both decline, corresponding to a move toward sustainability and

smaller burdens on future generations. In contrast, the traditional measures such as the trust fund

exhaustion date and crossover date would both show a worsening of Social Security’s finances.

4.1. Usefulness of the Closed-Group Measure

        While the open-group measure obviously plays a very useful role in determining

sustainability, the closed-group measure is not as widely understood. Still, the closed group

measure plays a crucial role in understanding Social Security’s impact on the economy.

        Some believe that the closed group measure is mostly meaningful to the extent that the

Social Security was intended by policymakers to be “fully funded” (Goss, 1999).13 In that case,

the closed group obligation would be zero since each generation would pay its own benefits.

        But the closed-group measure is a very important statistic even in a pay-as-you-go system

for two key reasons. First, it indicates the extent that any reform will reshuffle fiscal burdens

across generations. For example, supposed that Social Security benefits were increased and

financed on a strict pay-as-you-go basis by increasing payroll taxes. This policy change would

13
  An equally plausible story is that policymakers allowed Social Security to become mostly pay-as-you-go over
time because the burdens being placed on future generations were not easily observable under traditional measures.




                                                        11
have no impact on the open group unfunded obligation measure nor any impact on any of the

traditional measures of Social Security’s finances discussed earlier.                        But the closed-group

measure would increase because this reform would transfer wealth from future generations to

current generations. Current generations would gain from this policy change since they will

receive more in benefits in present value than they paid in taxes; indeed, current retirees would

receive additional benefits for free. But future generations would pay for this windfall by

receiving a benefit that is less valuable than the additional taxes they pay in present value. The

closed-group measure will clearly indicate this intergenerational transfer.

         Second, the closed-group measure indicates the extent that pay-as-you-go financing may

“crowd out” private saving and, hence, increase interest rates, reduce wages, and reduce the

nation’s Gross Domestic Product.14                Consider again a pay-as-you-go financed increase in

benefits. Because this reform transfers resources from future to current generations, it reduces

the amount of money today’s generations must save for their own retirement. This reform,

therefore, could permanently reduce the economy’s level of capital.15

         The CBO (1998) estimates that one dollar’s worth of closed-group obligations could

reduce private saving between zero and $0.50, although this range of estimates is subject to

considerable uncertainty. It follows that Social Security may reduce the U.S. capital stock by as

much as $6 trillion and reduce GDP by as much as $1.1 trillion each year.16 Nonetheless, as


14
   The impact of Social Security financing on private saving is an empirical issue first analyzed by Feldstein (1974).

   The Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, however, argues that parents might leave a larger bequest in response to a
transfer from their children, thereby leaving national saving unchanged (Barro, 1974). Altonji et al.’s (1992)
empirical tests, however, reject this hypothesis. Consistently, Gokhale et al. (1996) trace a large share of the secular
decline in U.S. national saving during the last several decades to the fiscal transfers from workers to retirees.
16
   The calculated reduction in GDP assumes Cobb-Douglas production with inelastic labor supply, a net-of-
depreciation capital share of 0.25 and a current capital-output ratio of three. The calculation also assumes that the
private saving offset is constant at $0.50 for each $1 of closed-group obligation.




                                                          12
noted above, the traditional measures as well as the open-group measure do not indicate these

large macroeconomic effects. Presumably, any discussion of Social Security reform would want

to take into account the impact of a reform on the economy. Although Social Security has had

many successes, its potentially large deleterious effect on the capital stock and national output

probably deserves more attention in the debate over Social Security reform.

4.2. Long-Run versus Short-Run

         Since the open-group measure extends the traditional 75-year imbalance measure beyond

the 75th year, one might at first be tempted to argue that the open-group measure places too much

emphasis on Social Security’s long run finances. In particular, one could imagine a hypothetical

“reform” that does nothing to fix Social Security’s finances during the first 75 years but enacts

large reforms after the 75th year in order to eliminate Social Security’s $10.4 trillion imbalance.

         This potential criticism, however, is misplaced since it forgets the fact that the $10.4

trillion open-group obligation measure is in present value terms. Besides adjusting for inflation,

the present value calculation adjusts for the real interest costs that are saved from paying

obligations sooner rather than later. For example, increasing payroll taxes by $1 today would

reduce the open-group obligation by, of course, $1. But postponing this $1 tax increase (still

measured in 2004 inflation-adjusted dollars) by 100 years would reduce the $10.4 open-group

obligations by only 4.7 cents today.17 Postponing the dollar tax increase 150 years would reduce

the unfunded obligations by only 1 cent. In other words, attempting to postpone reforms would

require promising to enact unrealistically large reforms later on.



17
  This calculation uses an inflation-adjusted interest rate of 3.1 percent, the rate used by the Trustees to calculate the
$10.4 trillion unfunded obligations.




                                                           13
           Moreover, a delay in attempting to bring Social Security’s financial troubles under

control would also be clearly indicated by the closed-group obligation measure. In particular,

letting current generations “off the hook” by postponing reforms would produce a larger closed-

group obligation than a reform that required current generations to bear more of the costs.

           Rather than drawing “too much” attention to the long run, the open-group and closed-

group obligation measures actually remove the current biases embedded in the traditional

financial measures against reforms that could improve Social Security’s long-run financial

outlook. These newer measures also draw attention to the truer magnitude of the reforms that are

needed to place Social Security on a sustainable path and, hence, indicate the urgent need for

action. Social Security’s open-group unfunded obligations of $10.4 trillion are almost three

times as large as its imbalance over the next 75-years, despite the fact that shortfalls after the 75th

year are heavily discounted in the present value calculation, as discussed above.

4.3. Sensitivity to Assumptions

           Another common criticism of present value estimates beyond 75 years is that they are

sensitive to the underlying demographic and economic assumptions.18 Of course, uncertainty

should only enhance the desire to take remedies rather than to ignore the expected problem.19

           Furthermore, as shown in Gokhale and Smetters (2003), the size of the policy changes –

either tax increase or benefit cuts – that are needed to reduce Social Security’s imbalance are not

affected by much under different interest rate and productivity assumptions and different

demographic projections. Although the present value of the imbalance will be altered by changes

in these underlying assumptions, the present value of Social Security’s tax base and future

18
     See, for example, CBO (2004).
19
     This fact holds under any standard preference toward risk that exhibit a prudence motive.




                                                           14
benefits also move almost proportionally and in the same direction. As a result, the increases in

tax rates or cuts in benefit rates required to eliminate Social Security’s current fiscal imbalance

exhibit little sensitivity to parametric changes in economic and demographic assumptions.



                                    5. Improving the Federal Budget

           Recently, numerous media organizations have reported that the “transition” to personal

accounts would cost as much as $2 trillion over the first 10 years. However, these “transition

costs” are often an artificial by-product of incomplete accounting in the current federal budget.

           To be sure, diverting payroll tax revenue to personal accounts will increase the debt held

by the public. But the concomitant reductions in the present value of future Social Security

benefits are not counted in the current federal budget since it omits Social Security’s unfunded

obligations. As a result, an “actuarially-fair carve out,” for example, appears to involve a short-

term “transition cost” in the form of more government debt even though the reform is neutral.

           The President’s 2005 Budget, like previous budgets, highlights the deficits projected over

the next five years along with the amount of debt held by the public. The debt held by the public

represents the net federal liabilities to the public accumulated from past overspending. Because

this Budget is, in effect, “backward looking,” it fails to account for the present value imbalances

in Social Security, Medicare as well as other government programs.

           The government’s current backward-looking accounting would be illegal if done by

companies in the private sector. Indeed, under ERISA and FASB rules, private-sector firms are

required to make projections of their pension and retirement health obligations.20 Although the


20
     See, e.g., Howell Jackson (2004) and comments to his article appearing immediately after his article.




                                                           15
methodology used in reporting future pension and other liabilities in the private sector is

different than the one suggested here (arising from the fact that a private company cannot assume

it will operating indefinitely into the future), the notion of complementing cash-flow-shortfall

projections with present values of projected financial imbalances is not a very radical one.

5.1. Augmenting the Federal Budget’s Summary Tables

        Table 2 shows how Social Security and Medicare’s unfunded obligations could be

integrated into the President’s federal budget in order to remove the bias against reducing these

unfunded obligations. In creating this table, we calculated the imbalances for Social Security,

Medicare and the Rest of Federal Government for the end of each year shown using the policy,

economic and demographic assumptions in the President’s 2005 Fiscal Year Budget.21

        Although the President’s Budget and the Trustees use similar demographic projections,

the economic assumptions differ somewhat.                 Notice, for example, that we estimate Social

Security’s imbalance at $8 trillion (compared with the Trustees’ estimate of $10.4 trillion) and

Medicare’s imbalance at $61 trillion (compared with $62 trillion).22 The main reason that our

estimates are a little smaller than the Trustees is that we use a larger discount rate (a 3.6 percent

inflation adjusted rate versus the Trustees’ 3.1 percent rate). Our larger discount rate has a more

noticeable effect in reducing Social Security’s imbalance relative to Medicare’s because Social

Security’s cash flow deficits are projected to occur at a later date than Medicare’s.




21
  Our methodology is discussed in detail in Gokhale and Smetters (2003). The current numbers update that report.
22
  The Trustees’ projected fiscal imbalance for Medicare (Parts A, B, and D) can be found in Tables IIB.11, II.C16,
and II.C22 of the 2004 Medicare Trustees’ Report. The $62 trillion imbalance includes the present value of general
revenue contributions for Parts B and D, which are not funded. Our own $61trillion calculation is larger than the
value we reported in Gokhale and Smetters (2003) that was written before Part D became law. Another difference
between our estimates and the Trustees’ is that our estimates, like the budget, are stated in end-of-year dollars.




                                                        16
         Table 2 shows that the Rest of the Federal Government actually has a present value

surplus (negative imbalance) of about $5.6 trillion under current law.23 The Rest of the Federal

Government is equal to current level of debt held by the public plus the present value of

expenditures on defense, Medicaid, education, homeland security and all other federal

government programs (except Social Security and Medicare) less the present value of all federal

revenue sources (except Social Security and Medicare Part-A payroll taxes).24                                 These

calculations include all of the President’s recently enacted and proposed policies.

5.2. Removing the Bias Against Pre-funding

         Consider, now, how an “actuarially-fair carve out” would affect the more inclusive

budget presented in Table 2. Suppose that a person alive starting in 2004 is allowed to carve out

$1 in 2004 and deposit it into a personal account in exchange for an actuarially-fair reduction in

their future Social Security benefits equal to $1.

         The “Fiscal Imbalance in Social Security” in Table 2 for the 2004 end of year would

remain unchanged by this reform. The revenue loss from the carve-out would decrease the value

of the Trust Fund by $1 in magnitude. But the “Future Net Benefits of Living Generations”

would decrease by $1 due to concomitant reduction in future benefits -- a perfect offset. The

“Fiscal Imbalance in Social Security” would remain unchanged in all future years as well.

         Similarly, the “Fiscal Imbalance in the Rest of Federal Government” would remain

unchanged in the year 2004. The debt held by the public would increase by $1 because of the

23
   This calculation is larger in magnitude than the value we reported last year (Gokhale and Smetters, 2003) for the
2004 Budget, largely due to adjustments in economic and policy assumptions in the 2005 budget.
24
   As Auerbach, Gale and Orszag (2004) point, however, our distinction between Medicare and the Rest of the
Government is a little artificial since Medicare Parts B and D are partially financed by general revenue rather than
with dedicated payroll taxes. We separate out Medicare because, similar to Social Security, it has been traditionally
viewed as a distinct entitlement program even though payroll taxes cover only a small fraction of actual costs. In
any case, the Total Fiscal Imbalance for the U.S. Government is unaffected by our decomposition.




                                                         17
loss in revenue but the “Liabilities to Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds” would decrease

by $1 – again, a perfect offset. Furthermore, the “Fiscal Imbalance in the Rest of Federal

Government” would remain unchanged in future years

        In sum, an actuarially-fair carve out would decrease the size of the Social Security trust

fund and increase the size of the debt held by the public. But it would have no impact on the

Fiscal Imbalances of Social Security or the rest of government, consistent with the economic-

neutrality of this reform. In contrast, if we restricted our focus to just the debt held by the public

in Table 2 -- as under current budget reporting -- we would interpret this reform to imply that the

government’s fiscal position has worsened.

        This example, therefore, illustrates that the traditional measures, including the debt held

by the public and the trust fund, are potentially very misleading. The more inclusive fiscal

imbalance measures—the open and closed group obligations—properly capture the neutrality of

an actuarially fair carve out reform.



                               6. “Implicit” Versus “Explicit” Debt

        Table 2 combines the government’s “explicit debt” in the form of debt held by the public

with the “implicit debt” debt in the form of the present value of future Social Security and

Medicare benefits. Debt held by the public is a legal liability that must be honored by the

government unless it declares bankruptcy.25 Social Security and Medicare benefits, however, are

only obligations of the government, which can be altered by an act of Congress.



25
  Of course, in practice, the government can use inflation to reduce the real value of nominally-denominated debt.
The government would have to declare bankruptcy, however, to avoid paying off inflation-protected instruments.




                                                        18
       It might appear at first that commingling implicit and explicit debt effectively “bonds”

the value of Social Security and Medicare obligations, putting them on par with the liability to

repay the debt held by the public. But this perspective, if valid, should also apply to the short-

term projections made in the current federal budget; the “projected” nature of the budget has not

changed with the more inclusive measures. Indeed, unlike the current federal budget framework,

the fiscal imbalance measure presented in Table 2 would clearly indicate the unsustainable

nature of the federal government’s fiscal policy.



                              7. Reaction of Capital Markets

       In theory, real interest rates should not increase in response to an actuarially fair carve-

out reform of Social Security because investors should be indifferent between a dollar of explicit

debt and a dollar of present value of future Social Security benefits. However, in practice,

capital market participants may be discounting future Social Security benefits at a higher rate

because they perceive that at least some of these benefits might not be paid. Replacing a dollar

in present value of future Social Security benefits with a dollar of explicit debt, therefore, could

worsen how investors perceive the outlook of the federal government’s finances.

       Of course, it is not obvious that explicit debt liabilities are really more likely to be paid or

serviced in real terms than Social Security obligations. Indeed, the opposite is feasible. Most

explicit debt is nominally denominated and so its value could be easily eroded through a small

increase in inflation compounded over time.           In contrast, Social Security benefits, once

determined, are fully protected against inflation, and they will likely remain so well into the

future, especially as the share of retirees in the population increases over time.




                                                 19
       However, even if the legal distinction between government debt liabilities and Social

Security obligations is deemed important, the federal government’s budget would be incomplete

if it did not report all sources of projected outlays. The purpose of the budget is to show the

projected financial ramifications of the continuation of current (or newly proposed) law – it is

not meant to predict future law. Uncertainty about future law itself is more appropriately

handled through policy, not by omitting the sources of promises under current law.

       For example, if policymakers believe that market participants discount future Social

Security benefits by 10 percent above the government’s discount rate then policymakers could

offer a carve out with a 10 percent “haircut” (as discussed earlier) to avoid disrupting capital

markets. But, without any policy change, it would be inappropriate to simply discount future

Social Security benefits in Table 2 by an extra 10 percent since that would not correspond to

current law. Indeed, if federal budget projections incorporated the risks associated with how

future policymakers might change the law, the very meaning of a budget would be undermined.

Policymakers would never have to worry about the financial ramifications of current (or

proposed) laws because they could just assume that future policymakers would fix the problems.

By definition, there would never be a problem and, hence, no need for budget projections.

       Instead, the ramifications of current law itself must be fully exposed as a precondition to

enact change. We conjecture that the adoption of an inclusive budgetary framework, as shown in

Table 2, would signal that the government is now serious about reducing its fiscal imbalance,

which would improve that capital market’s outlook. As explained earlier, an actuarially fair

carve-out does not reduce the federal government’s fiscal imbalance. Rather, it is completely

neutral. So the government would still have to either increase taxes or reduce the growth rate in




                                               20
benefits (maybe with a “haircut”) in order to lower its fiscal imbalance.                Officially

acknowledging a fiscal imbalance in excess of $63 trillion, as shown in Table 2, would likely

prepare the environment for taking action sooner rather than later.         If, instead, the fiscal

imbalance were allowed to grow over time, it could further erode the confidence of market

participants in the government’s ability to meet its future obligations.



                                         8. Conclusions

       Traditional accounting measures tell us very little about the true fiscal problems facing

the Social Security system, and they are biased against reforms that could reduce the federal

government’s fiscal imbalance. This paper presents an alternative and more inclusive budgetary

framework, one that incorporates the present value imbalances in Social Security, Medicare, and

all other government programs. The adoption of such a budgetary framework would remove an

important accounting roadblock against Social Security reform. Explicitly recognizing the

existing $63 trillion federal fiscal imbalance could also ease the way to fiscal reforms and likely

improve the operation of capital markets.
