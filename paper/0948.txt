       Are High Income Individuals Better Stock Market Investors?



                               ABSTRACT


        This paper presents evidence that the corporate stock owned by

high income investors appreciates substantially faster than the stock owned

by investors with lower incomes. Those with very high incomes enjoy the

greatest success on their investments while those with incomes under

$20,000 have the least success. The evidence indicates that the differences

are large and that they have persisted for a long time.

            This paper presents evidence that the corporate stock owned by high

income investors appreciates substantially faster than the stock owned by

investors with lower incomes. Those with very high incomes enjoy the greatest

success on their investments while those with incomes under $20,000 have the

least success. The evidence indicates that the differences are large and that

they have persisted for a long time. Since the present paper represents what we

believe is the first such evidence of income class differences in the rate of

return,1 our results must be regarded with some caution. But if        this   apparent

fact   stands up to further scrutirj, there are important implications for a wide
variety of issues including the theory of efficient markets, the rate of saving,
and   the distribution of wealth.

            Our evidence is based on tax    return   data on individual shareholder

transactions. Section 1 describes our data and method of calculating rates of

return and   presents   the basic estimates. The second section then discusses

several possible sources of bias. Additional         results based on data for a   dif-

ferent year are presented in the third section. A final section discusses some

of the implications of our finding.

1. The Data, Method and Results for 1973

            The basic data are a sample of 57,676 individual Federal income tax

returns that reported corporate stock capital gains in the year 1973.1 These

returns report more than 250,000 corporate stock transactions. For each tran-

saction, we have data on the cost of the asset, the proceeds from the sale, and

the dates when the stock was acquired and when it was sold. Associated with

each transaction is a variety of information about the taxpayer, including his

adjusted gross income, the value of his other capital gains, etc. The sampling

weight for each observation makes it possible to estimate population means for

any desired subgroup of taxpayers.

            Our analysis focuses exclusively on the capital gains realized on cor-

porate   stock. Since the rate of gain is likely to be particularly great on
stock acquired through np1oyee stock options or by company founders, we have
eliminated such transactions from our sample. Our analysis         deals   only with stock
acquired by open market purchase. This also eliminates shares acquired by          gift

or   bequest. The restriction to shares acquired in ordinary market transactions
eliminates approximately 87,000 transactions.
            We have also eliminated from the sample any      transaction for which the

holding   period is not reported (approximately 1ii,O0O transactions) or for which
the total capital gain reported on the tax return is not equal to the sum of the
individual transaction gains (approximately 35,000 transactions). These exclu-
sions    reduce the final   sample to 90,022 transactions.2


1These data were compiled by the Internal Revenue Service for the 1973 Capital
 Gains Study. The tax returns represent a weighted probability sample of all
 individual tax returns for that year.
2We have repeated some parts of our      analysis   without imposing the last of these
 restrictions and found very      similar results   for the larger sample.

            Consider nov the way in which we use our data on individual transac-

tions to calculate the average rate of return in each income class. We begin by

evaluating for each taxpayer an income defined as adjusted gross income minus

the capital gains on corporate stock that are used to calculate the rates of

return. Taxpayers are then divided into six broad income groups: less than

zero; zero to $20,000; $20,000 to $50,000; $50,000 to $100,000; $100,000 to

$200,000; and greater than $200,000. The relatively small number of individuals

whose net adjusted gross incomes (i.e., AGI minus the corporate stock capital

gains) are negative but who have sold corporate stock are typically investors

with large and complex financial transactions whose income reflects large losses

in business activities, tax shelters, partnerships, etc. The average value of

corporate   stock sales among these individuals      was more than $11,000 and   there-
fore more than    the   average sales in any of the other income groups except among
those with incomes over $200,000.
            Within each income group, transactions are divided according to the
time   since   the stock was purchased. For this purpose, we use 11 time intervals
ranging from     less   than six months to more than 20 years.
            For each combination     of income class and   holding period, we can esti-
mate   the value of stock sold     per dollar of original   cost. bre specifically, let

Sjj be the net sales receipt in transaction j of an individual in income group

i of an asset that has been held for time period t. Similarly, let Cut be the

original cost of this asset and let wjjt be the sampling weight associated with

that transaction (i.e., the inverse of the sampling probability). The total

value of the stock sold after a holding period of t years by individuals in

income class I is thus Sit =
                                   EjwjjtSjjt and   the corresponding initial cost of

Cit =    EjwjjtCjjt.
                                         —le.-




             The value of stock sold per dollar of original cost can be used to

calculate the rate of return for each combination of income class and holding

period.]-     For stock sold after t years by investors in income class i, the rate

of return rt is defined by the equation:


(1)                   sit
                            =


or
                                           S
 2                          =   —
                                t
                                  in
                                          Cit


The value of t used in this equation is the weighted average of the holding

periods     for stocks sold within the time interval for the particular holding
period.2
             Table 1 presents the 66 estimated. rates of return by holding period
and income class as well as for all income classes combined.     There is a clear

general     pattern. The two highest income groups (with incomes over   $100,000)




1Note that the ratio of aggregate sales value divided by initial cost is equiva-
 lent to a weighted average of the sales to cost ratios for individual transac-
 tions, weighting by initial investment as well as by the sanling weights:


                       Ejwjsj                    (   )
                                       EjwjCj

                       Ejwjcj           Ejwjcj

2Note that our procedure of calculating the rate of return based on aggregate
 sales and aggregate costs gives an unbiased estimate of the sample rate of return
 for each income group and time period. The alternative procedure of calculating
 rates of return for each transaction and then averaging the rates of return
 gives an underestimate of the rate of return on the total investment made by
 investors in class i and time period t.

All rates of appreciation refer to stock acquired in the open market and sold in
1973. Income is defined as adjusted gross income minus the capital gains on the stocks
that were used in calculating the rates of appreciation.
generally have higher rates of return         than   the two lower income groups.          Those
with negative net incomes generally have the highest rates of return.

              A more direct comparison is facilitated by calculating a simple

average rate of return for each income class. With this restriction, equation

1 suggests the regression equation:


                           Sit
(3)              in __________         = ai   +   r1t   +   ejt
                           Cit


where ejt is a random error. The constant term a1 permits testing whether

income   group I buys stocks that are "undervalued" or "overvalued" in the sense
that their price adjusts up or down independent of the length of time that the
asset is held. Note that the 11 values of t             are   not uniformly spaced but
correspond     to the weighted average holding periods for the 11             intervals.
              Table   2 presents the estimated regression coefficients based on the

rates of return for all       of the holding periods.1        The results are striking. In
the   first   four equations, the estimated rate of return rises notonically frcn

14,7 percent among investors with adjusted gross incomes between zero and $20,000

to 8.3 percent among investors with incomes over $200,000. The standard errors

are quite small and the differences between the low and high values are quite

significant.2




1The estimated rate of return coefficients are multiplied by 100 to obtain per-
 centage rates of return.

2 explicit F—test rejects the hypothesis that all                 four   groups are, equal: the
F—statistic     is    3.11 and the corresponding     critical value at the 0.05       level is
2.85.

          The annolous group with negative net income (equation 2.5) has a. par-
ticularly high rate of return (13.6 percent). As we explain below, this is con-

sistent with the combination of high economic income that appears to charac-

terize many members of this group and their nontaxable status in 1913.

          The constant terms of these individual equations are not exactly equal

and indicate that the superior performance of the higher income groups is more

true for longer holding periods than for shorter ones. However, equation 2.6

confirms the monotonic relation between income and the rate of return when the

constant term is constrained to be the same for all groups. Equation 2.1

repeats this with the negative net income group omitted. !vkreover, an explicit

test of the equality of the constant terms does not reject the hypothesis that

all four constant terms (for the groups with positive income) or even all five

constant terms are equal.

          Constraining the constant terms to be equal has relatively little

effect on the estimated rates of return. To show formally that the differences

ang the   rate of   return   coefficients for the four groups with positive income

are statistically significant, we reestiniate equation 2.1 with the rates of return
constrained to be equal and compare the sums of squared residuals. The
constrained estimate appears as equation 2.8. The F—statistic for testing the
constraint is 5.92 while the one percent critical value with 3 and 39 degrees
                                                                              of
freedom is 11.33. The evidence is thus very strong in indicating that there are
significant differences among the rates of return.
          The most direct evidence on differences in the rate of return is pre-
sented in equation 2.9 where the constant term is constrained to be zero.1 In

  each without a constant tern.

effect, any   differences   among   the   income classes in the timing   of   purchases and

sales is now included in the average rate of return. Now         the   rate of return

increases monotonically from 3.7 for investors with adjusted incomes below

$20,000 to 6.7 for investors with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000.

          The rates of return presented in the first nine equations of Table 2

are based on regressions that give equal weight to each calculated ratio of

sales value to initial cost (St/C1t). In principle, it would be desirable to

correct for heteroskedasticity by using generalized least squares. The indivi-

dual observations represent different numbers of underlying transactions; obser-

vations corresponding to a large number of transactions should lie closer to the

true regression line and therefore should be weighted more heavily. Similarly,

rates of return for longer holding periods provide more opportunity for annual

fluctuations to be averaged out and therefore should lie closer to the tn.ie

regression line. We have therefore reestimated many of the equations with a

weighted generalized least squares procedure to correct for heteroskedasti—

city. The basic estimates are essentially unchanged, regardless of whether we

weight observations according to the number of underlying transactions, the

holding period, or both.

          To save space, we present only two of these weighted estimates.

Equation 2.10 repeats the specification of equation 2.6 with each observation

weighted by the number of individual transactions. The results are very similar

to the unweighted estimates and confirm the nznotonic relation between the rate

of return and the level of income among individuals with positive incomes. The

same confirming estimates are found in equation 2.11 where each observation is

weighted by the total holding period represented by the underlying transactions,

i.e., the weight assigned to each transaction is the holding period for that

transaction   and   the observations are weighted by the sum of' the transaction
                                        —10-.


weights   corresponding to that observation.

           The higher rates of return earned by higher income groups is not an

artifact of a particular holding period but can be confirmed for a wide range of

holding periods. 'I.ble 3 presents some of these results. Equation 3.1 repeats

the basic results previously shown as equation 2.6. Excluding transactions of

less than six months simply adds 0.2 percent to the calculated rate of return in

each income class and does not modify the strong pattern of monotonically

increasing returns. For investments of more than five years, the relation bet-

ween income and the rate of return is slightly stronger.         Only when investments

that have been held for 20 years or nxre are excluded is the strict monotoriicity

lost but in this case (equation 3.5) the gap between the rate of return of the

lowest income group (li.i percent for those with net incomes between zero and

$20,000) and the rates of return of the higher income groups (an average of 7.9

percent) is even greater than when all holding periods are included.

                      the intercept term in the regression provides estimates of
            Eliminating

constant average rates of return for each income group. These estimates are
presented in equations 3.6   through   3.10, beginning   with a repetition of the


equation for the entire period. Eliminating short holding periods of six months
or a year has no effect at all on the estimated coefficients. For investments
of   five years or longer (equation 3.9) and for investments of less than 20 years

 (equation 3.10), the difference in the rates of return between the group with

 incomes below $20,000 and those with higher incomes is even greater.

            The only other evidence that we know on income class differences on

 rates of return is the very careful study by Biume      et   al. (19Th). They   also

 use tax return data but have additional information on the amount of dividends
 by conxpar' name that each individual reports. With this information, Friend et.
 al. calculate the rise during a twelve month period in the prices of the shares

corresponding     to these dividends. They report that in 1970 households with AGI

less than $25,000 had somewhat greater returns than those with higher AGI while

2. Biases in the Estimated Rates of Return
            The rates of return presented in       section 1 are not unbiased estimates
of the rates of return on Investors' entire portfolio of corporate stock. This
section discusses several possible sources of bias. We shall explain why we
believe   that the likely effect     of such biases is to cause an underestimate of
the    observed differences in rates of return among income classes. If this is

so, correcting the bias     would only strengthen our findings.
            The   nxsZ important source of bias is our use of tax return data. This
implies that we look only     at   the rates of return on the stocks that individuals
choose to sell. To understand the likely          "realization   bias" in the estimated
rates of return, it is important to distinguish two reasons why the return on
stock that is sold may differ       from the return on   entire portfolios. First, in
the absence of taxes, investors might tend to favor either "winners" or "losers"
in   their selling decisions. Optimal portfolio       behavior requires, ceteris pan—
bus,   selling winners to reduce their weight in portfolios. This tendency to

siake realized gains exceed the overall portfolio return is reinforced by such

faulty    conventional   wisdom as "hold a loser until you get your original invest-

ment back" and "you never lose money by taking        a profit." Conversely, conven-
tional rules like "cutting your losses quickly" and "backing           a winner" would

imply   that realized gains will be less than gains on stocks not sold. However,
none of these selling rules will bias the comparison of returns among different
income groups unless the selling rules differ among these income groups.
            It is particularly    important   therefore that our   system   of taxing capi-
tal gains   does provide a substantial reason for shareholders to favor selling

losers rather than winners and for this bias against selling stocks with large

profits to be strongest in high income groups. Since the capital gains tax is

due only when a gain is realized by selling the asset, the shareholders can

reduce the effective tax rate by postponing the sale       of   stock   on which there is

an accrued gain. The advantage of postponement is strengthened by the fact that

the unrealized gains that exist when a shareholder dies are subsequently ignored

for tax purposes.1 These tax rules provide an incentive to postpone the sale of

stock with gains and, when possible, to sell stocks with losses at the same time

that stocks with gains are sold. These incentives are greater the higher the

individual's marginal tax rate.2

            There is therefore a strong reason to believe that          realized   capital

gains represent a.   greater understatement of     the overall capital gains for high

income individuals than for lower income individuals.3 Correcting for this

realization bias would     therefore   raise the rate of return for high income groups

by more than    it raised the return for lower income groups. This would only
strengthen the finding reported in Th.bles 2 and 3.

            The tax rules do not discourage the realization of capital gains by

individuals with no other taxable income. Indeed, their incentive to realize


   1The individuals to whom the shares are bequeathed take their market value
    at the time of death as their "cost" for subsequent capital gains taxation.

   2For evidence that high tax rates do deter the ree.lization of capital gains,
    see   Feldatein and Yitzhaki (1978), Feldstein, Slemrod and Yitzhaki            (1980),
    Slemrod   and Feldstein (1978), and Yitzhaki (1979).

   3High income individuals also have an incentive to avoid the capital gains
    tax by giving appreciated stocks to charitable organizations. Such gifts
    not only avoid the capital gains tax but also earn the donor a deduction
    for the market value of his gift. In 1977, gifts of appreciated property
    accounted for approximately 70 percent of total charitable deductions among
    taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 but less than 5 percent of gifts among
    taxpayers   with,   incomes under $15,000.
                                            _114_


capital    gains     is especially strong if their nontaxable status is temporary.
This   strong incentive to realize gains probably accounts for the very high
reported rate of return in Thbles 2 and 3 for individuals with negative net
incomes.

         The existence of a group with large capital gains but negative net
income points to another source of bias in the estimated relation between
income and rates of return. An individual who realizes a large capital gain may

engage in tax shelter activities that reduce his income exclusive of those gains

or cause that net income to be negative. This implies that some individuals who

actually have high incomes will be classified in lower income groups and that

this downward misclassification is st likely among individuals with large

capital gains. If large capital gains are associated with higher than average

rates of return, th±s tax shelter misclassification tends to weaken the measured

association between income and the rate of return.

               In   addition to the realization bias and the income classification
bias, there may also be a bias in the reporting of capital gains. ¶L.xpayers may
not   report all of their gains honestly. If the extent of under—reporting is the
same at all income levels, there will be no bias in the estimated relation bet-
ween iriome and rates of return. It is inherently impossible to obtain infor—
ination   on   the extent or pattern of such under—reporting. It is worth noting,
however,   that the probability of an Internal Revenue Service audit rises with

the individual's income and that this increasing probability may encourage

greater honesty. However, since higher income individuals also have more to

gain by under—reporting, it is not possible to make any inference about whether

there is a bias in the estimated relation.

             A final problem of interpretation is that our evidence relates only to

capital gains while the total return to common stock investment includes divi-

dends as well. Because of differences in the taxation of dividends and of capi-

tal gains, lower income investors might choose stocks that offer higher divi-

dends. Such behavior would imply that the observed differences in capital gains

overstate the differences in the total return on equity. Although the extent of

such offsetting differences in dividend rates cannot be determined precisely,1

we have examined three types of evidence and found that both suggest that the bias

from this source is small or non—existent. The first piece of evidence on this

question is based on a special survey of income and wealth conducted by the

Federal    Reserve Board in 1962 and 1963.2        The survey   collected information on
the amount of income received from each source and on the value of each tThe of
wealth. The       sanle   was heavily weighted with high income individuals. We have
used these data to estimate the average dividend rate on the shares held by
investors    in   four   income classes that correspond approximately to the same real
incomes as the four income classes that we have used in Tables 1 through 3•2
             When individuals are classified by our estimate of adjusted gross
income,3 there      is virtually no   difference   in the ratio of dividend income to the
market value of stock among different        groups of investors    with 1962—63 incomes


   1The tax return data on which our study is based gives the amount of each
    taxpayer's dividends but not the value of the stock on which they are
       earned.

over   $10,000.1   More specifically, the dividend return was 3.6   percent   for indi-

viduals with incomes between $10,000 and $50,000 and 3.8 percent for individuals

in the $50,000 to     $100,000   income class and in the open—ended class above

$100,000. Individuals with positive adjusted gross incomes below $10,000

reported a dividend return of 2.1 percent while those with negative AGI's

reported a dividend return of 0.5 percent. There is clearly no suggestion that

higher income individuals accepted a lower dividend return in order to obtain

greater capital gains.

              When individuals are classified by an estimate of adjusted gross

income exclusive of capital gains on corporate stock (i.e., by an estimate of

the income measure that e used in the rate of return regression), the estimated

dividend yields show a clear positive relation to income: a 2.0 percent return

for those with positive net AGI below $10,000, 3.5 percent for net PGI between

$10,000 and $50,000, 3.6     percent   for net AGI between $50,000 and $100,000, and

14.1 percent for net AGI over $100,000. These data suggest that, if anything,

the pattern of dividend yields reinforces the disparities in capital gain yields

among income classes.

              The second source of data on dividend yields comes from a study by

Friend   and deCani (1966) that used a special sample of individual tax returns



   1Theaverage dividend rate in the income class is defined as Zjvjdj/Ejwvj
    where wj is the sampling weight for household j, dj is the dividend income
    of' household   J and vj is the value of the household's common stock at the
       end   of
              the previous period.   The summation is over households within a
       single income class. Note that this measure of the average dividend rate
       is equivalent to the weighted average of the individual household dividend
       rates, weighted by- the initial value of common stock as well as by the
       sampling weight.

for   1960. By- using the names of the companies for which dividends were

reported, Friend and decani were able to calculate the dividend return on stocks

that paid at least some dividend. They          reported   a small negative relation bet-

ween the dividend return and income, from 3.5        percent    for investors with incomes

under $10,000 and between $10,000 and $50,000, to 3.3 percent for investors with

incomes between $50,000 and $100,000, 3.1 percent for investors with incomes

between $100,000 and $200,000 and 2.1 percent for investors with 1960 incomes

over $200,000. These figures suggest that part of the positive association

between income and capital gains may be an offset to lower dividend yields.

However, the magnitude of the relation between dividends return and income is

far too small     to   account for all of our   estimated   differences in capital gains.

In    particular, table 2    shows a 2.8 percentage point     increase   in the capital

gains    return between the group   with incomes of    $100,000 to $200,000. These
correspond approximately to the Friend and deCani groups with dividend returns
of 3.5 percent and 3.3 percent, a yield difference of only 0.2 percent.1
             The third set of data are the      calculations of   Bluine et al. (197k)    of

dividend—value     ratios using essentially the same method as Friend and de Cani

(1966).     They present evidence on the dividend—value ratios at different points
in    the income distribution for six years      between 1958 and   1971.    For all   years,
the ratio for individuals in the top one percent of income is lower than for
individuals in the lowest half of the income distribution. The gap is largest
in 1971    when   the dividend—value ratios in the top group averaged 92 percent of
the mean dividend—value ratio while the dividend—value ratio in the bottom group


      1Friend and deCani also provide estimates of the ratio of realized capital
       gains to the total value of holding and show that this ratio increases with
       income. This "capital gain yield" is of course not comparable to our esti-
       mate of the annual rate of increase in the value of stock between their
       purchase date and their sale in 1973.
                                               —18-.




averaged 119 percent        of the mean. Applying these percentages to the mean 1971
dividend—value ratio of 3.01 implies that the dividend yield was 2.76 percent in

the top group and 3.68 percent in the bottom half of the income distribution.

The gap of less than one percentage point is not sufficient to offset the much

larger differences in rates of stock appreciation. This conclusion is also sup-.

ported    by the specific dividend—value ratios by income class for 1971 presented

by Blume et. a]., (1971): the value remained essentially constant at 0.021 or

0.022 in the four income classes beginning with $50,000, $100,000, $200,000, and

$500,000.       In the three income groups      from $10,000 to $50,000 the ratio varied

between    0.024   and   0.027.   The   maximum difference of 0.6 percent    per year is

again    very   small   relative to   the rates of price appreciation.1

              In   short, It   seems safe to conclude that the biases caused by dif-

ferences in realization, in income classification and in dividend yields cannot

explain    the estimated relation between capital gains        and income. The only

source    of bias   that cannot be eliminated is the      possibility that   honesty   and

completeness in the reporting           of capita] gains rises monotonically with income.


3.    Additional Evidence for 1962
              Although   the individual records for 1973     on which our analysis is
based    are a unique set of publicly available xnicroeconoinic data, a similar study

of capital gains was conducted by the Treasury some years ago on the basis of

tax returns for 1962. The individual records used in that            study are no longer
available but      the published report2 can be used to analyze the relation between

ratios: first, individuals do not report all of   their dividends; second, high
income individuals may own more stock that pays no dividends at al]. and there-

income and   the   rate of return. Indeed, our        interest in the subject of this
paper   was originally     stimulated by studying     the published information before        the

data   for 19T3   became   available.
            Our analysis of the published information for 1962 produced results
very similar to those reported in section 1. When we initially analyzed the
1962 data, we regarded the results as so striking and so contrary to commonly.
accepted beliefs that we were reluctant to publish them until we could check
them   with a second set of data. reover, there were some problems with the
1962 data that we could avoid by using the individual records for 19T3 and that
we   feared might have introduced biases that resulted in a spurious relation bet-
ween income and the rate of return. With the 19T3 data we were not only able to
avoid these problems but also to assess their importance in               the 1962 data by

reestimating      the results of section 1 with data constructed in the 'way we found
it for 1962; this analysis showed that what we bad feared were sources of               poten-

tial bias actually had little effect on the estimated rates of return.

             The publIshed information for 1962 provides the value of stock sold
and the original      cost (or basis) of those assets classified by income class

and    by holding period. The income measure used to define income classes was
total adjusted gross income and not the net adjusted income that we have used
for 19T3; AGI has the disadvantage of including the.             taxable portion of realized

capital    gains and   therefore introducing a spurious positive correlation between
measured    income and     the   value of the gains. The capital gains refer to all cor-

porate stock sold, not just to stock originally purchased on the open market; we

again    feared   that this 'would   cause   an upward bias in the estimated      rates of
return    for high income investors. Finally,         there    is no information on the

distribution of holding          periods   within the time   intervals;   we therefore have
                                           -20-



taken the midpoint of each closed interval and assumed 25 years for stock held

more than 20 years. As we noted in the previous paragraph, we have used the

individual records for 19T3 to evaluate the effect of these problems on the

results for 19T3 and found that their effect was quite small.

              Table 1 presents the estimated rates of return for each income class

and holding period.1 The estimated regression coefficients of Table 1 are

strikingly similar to the results presented in Table 2. The rate of return

fises monotonically from 3.2 percent for investors with incomes below $10,000 to

9.7 percent     for   investors with incomes over $100,000. The standard errors of

each of the estimates is small and the differences among them are clearly signi-
ficant both economically and statistically. The constant terms are all negative
(presumably because 1962 share prices were unusually depressed) but again rise
monotonically     from —ll.1i for the lowest income group to —3.2 for the highest

group. This implies that the higher income groups also did better in the timing

of   their purchases and    sales;   the estimated regression coefficients therefore
understate     the net differences among    the   income classes. This is demonstrated

by equation 5 in which a single constant term is estimated for all the classes;

the rates of return now rise from 3.0 percent in the lowest income group to 10.0

percent in the highest group.2



     1Note that the four income classes for 1962 are those that appear in the
      published report. The four income classes that we selected for 1973 were
      chosen to correspond roughly to these 1962 figures with an allowance for
      the difference between adjusted gross income and our net adjusted income.
      We have omitted the nontaxable returns for 1962 because it includes both the
      negative adjusted income individuals and individuals with low but positive
      income. There is no way to identify from the published data a 1962 group
      that    corresponds to our 1973 negative adjusted income individual.

        standard F test does not reject this constraint; the calculated F value
      is •91 while the 5 percent critical value for 3 and 72 degrees of freedom          is
      2.75.

            Equation 6 provides the most direct way of comparing average rates of
return since the constant term is eliminated. The relative effect of the

constant term was of course largest for the lowest income group.    In the current

equation we see that the net yield really averaged only 2.11 percent for this

group and then rose monotonicalJy to 9.5 percent in the highest income group.

            The remaining equations of Table 1 show that the same pattern of rates

of return are observed for various holding periods. For example, eliminating

stocks held less than one year (equation 7) raised the average return for all

income groups but did not change the difference between the highest and lowest

groups. Eliminating the open ended interval of nre than 20 years (equation 8)

raised the rates of return further for all groups but significantly increased

the yield difference between the lowest and the highest income classes.


i.   Explanations     and Implications

            The evidence that we have developed and presented in this paper indi-

cates that the realized rates of return on corporate stock sold in 1962 and 1973

varied systematically among income groups. In both years, higher income groups

experienced substantially greater rates of increase of share values than lower

income groups. This surprising finding cannot be explained by the use of

realized capital gains or by the other statistical biases in the calculated

rates of return.

            One possible explanation is that higher income groups enjoy greater

share price increases because they take systematically greater risks.1 Modern


   1Blume    et al.
                 (l971) report that tax return filers with larger AGI tended
to hold stock with greater nondiversifiable risk but do not provide specific
evidence on the extent of differences among income classes. They did, however,
present evidence that indicates very little portfolio diversification,
suggesting that the beta coefficient might not be the relevant measure of risk
 bearing.
                                           —23—




capital asset     pricing theory Implies that portfolios with greater nondiver—

sifiable risk (as measured by the beta coefficient) do have higher expected

rates of return in an efficient capital market. Because our data contains

information only on the realized capital gains, we cannot measure the riskiness

of the investors' portfolios and therefore cannot evaluate this explanation

directly. It would,      however,    require very substantial differences in beta coef-

ficients to explain the very large differences in observed rates of return.

           Although    some theories imply     that the beta coefficient is the only

factor   that influences   the yield on a      portfolio, a broader view suggests other
measures of risk that influence        expected asset yields. As     Malkiel and Cragg
(1980)   have   recently shown, expected stock returns are also correlated with the
sensitivity     of the firm' s   earnings to   the financial   performance of   the   aggregate
econonr and with the degree of uncertainty or          unpredictability of the firm's

earning. High income investors may        be   willing to accept such uncertainty in
order to obtain higher rates of return.
           Another possible explanation is that high income individuals are more
likely to have access to inside information that enables them to buy stocks
before the market recognizes their value. However, such "early" buying would be
reflected in a high constant term in the regressions (indicating an unusual gain
soon after purchase) rather than in the high regression coefficient that
indicates stocks that cumulatively grow faster year after year.
            Several people have suggested that the higher average returns may
reflect   the fact that higher income individuals generally have larger portfolios

and can therefore devote more time or resources to managing their investments.

An obvious counterargument to this is that lower income individuals could in
principle achieve the same investment management       resources   by investing in

mutual funds. The view that large individual portfolios have an advantage over

both small individual portfolios and mutual funds must therefore rest on the

combined effect of being big enough to justify significant portfolio management

resources while, unlike mutual funds, being small enough to be able to buy and

sell amounts of individual securities that are large relative to the portfolio

without altering the market price of those securities.

           Finally, it remains possible that our result is a statistical artifact

caused by relatively greater under—reporting of gains by lower income indivi-

duals or by some    source   of statistical bias that we bave not considered. Since

there is no independent basis for either conjecture, we believe that the impli-

cations of our finding of significant differences in rates of capital gain accu-

mulation deserve to be considered.

            If the observed differences in rates of return are more than a sta-

tistical   artifact but represent a permanent and stable feature of investments in
corporate stock, there are likely to be important implications for the rate of
saving,   the distribution of    wealth and the   debt and equity preferences of indi-

vidual investors.

            The differences in rates     of capital in imply that     the after—tax rate

of return to the highest income group is as high or higher than the after—tax

rate of return of lower income (and therefore lower tax bracket) individuals.

For example, if individuals in the highest tax bracket have a 7         percent pretax
rate of return (subject to a 20 percent capital gains tax) while individuals

with incomes under    $20,000 bave   a   percent pretax rate   of return (subject

to   a 10 percent capital gains tax), the after tax rates of return are 5.6
                                           —25—


percent and   36   percent.1 If individuals in different income classes

expect such differences in rates of return,       their savings rates might well
differ   in the same direction. Even if savings rates are the same,          the   dif-

ferences in rates of return would       imply very   substantial differences in

accumulated wealth; in 20 years, $100 grows to $203 at 3.6 percent but

nearly 50   percent larger ($297) at 5.6 percent.           Since the differences in

stock returns cannot apply to the returns earned In bank           accounts or xney
market mutual funds,     these   differences imply   that   higher income individuals

will   invest proportionately    more in stock.

            The   surprising nature of our findings     and the importance of these

results    (if they   are sustained by future research) for the process of capital

accumulation, Imply that     more analysis of the     nature and consequence of
interciass    differences in rates    of return deserves to be done.




   1The fact that capital gains are taxed only when they are realized implies
that the effective tax rates are lower and the after—tax yield differences are
greater.
