          The Incentive Effects of Private Pension Plans


                                ABSTRACT



         The proportion of workers covered by pensions has increased very

substantially over the past two or three decades, and in particular the number

of older workers with pensions continues to increase. During the same period,

and especially in the past decade, the labor force participation of older

workers has declined dramatically. These two trends rsay well be related. This

paper examines the incentive effects of' private pensions. We find that the pro-

visions of pension plans provide very substantial incentives to terminate work

at the current job after the age of early retirement and even greater incentives

to leave after the age of normal retirement. It is not unusual for the reduc-

tion in pension 'benefit accrual after these retirement ages to equal the equiva-

lent of a 30 percent reduction in wage earnings. In addition to a potentially

large impact on labor force participation of older workers, pension plan provi-

sions are likely to have important effects on labor mobility of younger workers.

                 THE INCENTIVE EFFECTS OF PSIVATE PENSION PLANS

         The proportion of workers covered by pensions has increased very

substantially over the past two or three decades, and in particular the number

of older workers with pensions continues to increase. During the same period,

and especially in the past decade, the labor force participation of older

workers has declined dramatically. The juxtaposition of these two trends

suggests the possibility that they may   be related. In this paper, we examine
the stipulations of private pension plans with a view to analyzing the incentive

effects created by their provisions. We find that the provisions of pension

plans provide very substantial incentives to terminate work at the current job

after the age of early retirement and even greater incentives to leave after

the age of normal retirement. While analysis of the plan provisions suggests a

potentially large effect of pension plans on labor force participation, the evi-

dence does not directly demonstrate that pension related work incentives did

indeed cause workers to leave the labor force earlier. Such conclusions must

rely on the association of individual retirement decisions with the provisions

of individual pension plans — an analysis that must await data as yet held from

public use. Nonetheless, examination of the structure of pension plans suggests

the likelihood of a very sizeable effect of plan provisions on labor force par—

ticipation. The analysis of plan provisions also allows inferences about the

cost in pension benefits of job change. In addition, the examination of plan

provisions allows consideration of the differential cost of pension plans for

men versus women. The wide diversity of plans and the corresponding wide diver-

sity of the pension related work incentives is a major theme of the Daper.

             In an earlier paper Kotlikoff and Wise (i98t) emphasized the apparent

inconsistency of pension accrual profiles with a spot nrket view of the labor

market. The evidence in this paper, particularly the analysis of post normal

retirement benefit accrual and supplemental benefit formulae, provides even

stronger demonstration of the inconsistency. In contrast to the earlier paper

which considered only a limited number of plans with earnings related benefit

formulae, this paper includes the entire universe of defined benefit pension

plans.


I. Background

             A. Vested Pension Benefit Accrual Profiles

             Information on the value of annual vested accrued pension benefits for

workers of different ages and with different amounts of service is useful for

displaying a variety of pension incentive effects. Vested pension benefit

accrual at age a, 1(a), equals the difference between pension wealth at age

a +   1,   Pw(a +   i),   and pension wealth at age a, Pw(a), accumulated to age

a + 1 at the nominal interest rate r, i.e.:

(1)          1(a) = Pw(a +    1) — Pw(a)(1 +   r).
Pension wealth at age a is defined as the expected value of vested pension

benefits discounted to age a. Intuitively Pw(a) can be thought of as the

worker's pension bank account. If 1(a) equals zero, the worker continuing
                                       -2-



employment with the plan sponsor at age a has exactly the same pension wealth at

age a + 1 as an identically situated worker. who terminates employment at age a.

Pension accrual is thus the increment to pension wealth in excess of the return

on the previously accumulated pension bank account. Throughout the paper we

express pension accrual increments as a fraction of the worker's wage, W(a).

Specifically P(a,t) denotes the ratio of 1(a) to W(a) for a worker age a with t

years of service.

         The appendix presents formulae for pension benefit accrual for a very

simple defined benefit pension plan, emphasizing the change in the formula at

ages of full or partial vesting, at early retirement age, and after normal

retirement. This analysis explains why nny pension age—accrual profiles show

sizeable discontinuities at vesting, and early and normal retirement. It is

useful here to provide a brief summary of the implications of these formulae.

The. discontinuities in age accrual profiles associated with vesting are fairly

obvious; in the case of cliff vesting (100 percent vesting occurring at a par-

ticular age) Pw(a) in (1) equals zero prior to the age of vesting and suddenly

becomes positive at the full vesting age. Hence 1(a) is zero prior to cliff

vesting and rises to a positive value at the cliff vesting age, a*; on the other

hand, I(a* +   i)   is smaller than I(a*) because it represents the difference in

two pension wealth numbers, rather than simply the value of one (Pw(a*)).

         Another discontinuity in 1(a) occurs, for nest plans, at early

retirement. This discontinuity occurs for plans that reduce early retirement

benefits using a formula that is less than actuarially fair, and the lower the

reduction the greater the decline in 1(a). To see this note that prior to the

early retirement age Pw(a) is not influenced by the early retirement reduction
                                      —3-



 rate since workers are assumed to start collecting their vested benefits at the

most lucrative date, which is almost invariably the age of early retirement;

taking benefits at early retirement generally provides a larger present value of

vested pension benefits accrued up to this age than opting to begin collecting

these accrued benefits later. This reflects the use by pension plans of reduc-

tion rates in computing early retirement benefits that are typically lower than

the actuarial rate. While Pw(a) and 1(a) are independent of the reduction rate

prior to early retirement, they are both functions of the reduction factor after

early retirement. The smaller the reduction factor, the closer Pw(a) will be to

w(a +   i),   holding other factors constant, and the smaller will be 1(a). This

is important since the reduction factors of most plans are fairly small pro-

viding substantially less than an actuarial reduction.

         A second, more fundamental reason for smaller increments after the

early retirement age involves discounting. Prior to early retirement an extra

dollar of benefits has a higher present value in the Pw(a + 1) formula than in

the Pw(a) formula because at age a + 1 the worker is one year closer to receipt

of these additional benefits than at age a. After the early retirement age

benefits are available immediately and, ignoring the worker's shortening life

span, an extra dollar of benefits at age a + 1 has the same present value as an

extra dollar at age a. Stated differently, after early retirement there is no

special advantage from raising benefits next year over this year because, like

additional benefits earned next year, additional benefits earned this year

become available immediately. This lack of discounting after benefits are

available raises Pw(a) relative to Pw(a +   1) which implies a smaller annual
pension accrual, 1(a), and smaller values of P(a,t).
                                      -4-



           A third factor leading to a drop in 1(a) at early retirement is the

shorter life span during which benefits will be collected if retirement from the

Olan is postponed. This factor does not enter into the calculus for 1(a) prior

to early retirement because, conditional on reaching early retirement, both

Pw(a + 1) and Pw(a) are based on the same potential lifespan of the worker.

           Each of these three factors also plays a role in the significant

decline in 1(a) at normal retirement. Host pension plans do not increase annual

benefits for workers electing to postpone receipt of pensions in years after

normal   retirement.   This implicit zero reduction rate means a smaller value of

increrental accrued benefits. The second factor involved in the drop in 1(a)

after early retirement is the change in discounting of Pw(a) relative to Pw(a +

i).   This feature continues after normal retirement as well because benefits

remain immediately available. Finally, beyond the normal retirement age there

is a more rapid reduction in expected lifespan and, therefore, in the expected

duration of benefit receipt if the worker postpones retiring. This feature also

lowers I(a),(See Appendix).

          While these three features help explain low and even negative values of

1(a) after normal retirement, other provisions produce sharp declines in 1(a) at

normal retirement. According to data in the 1979 BLS Level of Benefits Survey

23 percent of covered workers are enrolled in plans that do not credit service

at all after normal retirement. Another 30 percent of covered workers are in

plans that provide limited credit after nomal retirement, and the remaining

pension participants are in plans that credit all service during all years after

normal retirement. Plans that provide limited credit typically credit service

until the worker reaches a specified age, about age 70 on average.
                                            —5—



           Once plans stop crediting service they either (1) commence benefit

 payments immediately regardless of the recipient's work status, (2) defer

 pension benefits until the worker actually retires, or (3) defer payment until

 retirement, but actuarially increase the benefit. Of the participants in the

 plans that provide no or limited credit, 15 percent receive immediate payments,

 76 percent receive deferred payments with no actuarial increase, and the rest

 receive deferred payments with an actuarial increase.


           B. implication of Pension Accrual Discontinuities for Viewing Labor

                 Market   Equilibrium
           If    the labor market exhibits spot market equilibrium, 1(a) plus the

worker's non—pension compensation at age a, W(a), equals the worker's marginal

product at age a,

           (2)        M(a) = W(a) +     1(a).
Under the spot market assumption workers always receive M(a) regardless of the

firm or its pension plan. If 1(a) is smaller in one firm that another, W(a)

must be larger in the firm with the smaller value of 1(a) to insure equality of

total   annual compensation across firms. Since in a spot market equilibrium
workers can freely move from one firm to another and firms can freely fire any
worker demanding more than M(a), only accrued vested benefits will have any
economic value; if the value of this year's pension benefits reflected anything

other than those to which the worker had legal title, either the worker or the

employer would have an incentive to terminate the employment relationship.

Note that the terms in (i) incorporate the spot market free mobility assumption

in that workers are assumed to choose the most advantageous date to start

collecting previously accumulated benefits since "retiring" for purposes of
                                   —6-



collecting a pension from one firm does not preclude subsequent work in another

firm paying M(a).

        Obviously, if W(a) is a smooth function of age, and 1(a) exhibits sharp

discontinuities, M(a) must exhibit sharp discontinuities at these same ages to

satisfy (2). Casual empiricism suggests that W(a) changes smoothly with age, or

at least does not abruptly change precisely at ages when 1(a) exhibits sharp

changes. There is also no reason to believe that M(a) abruptly changes with age

to satisfy (2); hence the sizea'ole discontinuities reported here in the 1(a)

profile appear strikingly at odds with the spot market condition (2).




         C. Calculating Vested Benefit Accrual Profiles

         This study calculates accrual profiles for 23142 of the 21492 plans

identified by the BLS as useable.2 Throughout the paper we focus on the age

profiles of the ratios of 1(a) to W(a); i.e., we express the pension increments

at age a as a fraction of the wage at age a. We utilize the survey's weights in

presenting various average accrual profiles. The weights reflect the plan's

fraction of total pension participants. To construct accrual profiles for plans

which base their benefits on earnings we used a set of industry— and occupation—

specific cross section age earnings profiles estimated from CPS data.

Longitudinal age earnings profiles were obtained by assuming 6 percent overall

growth in wages and adding to this the wage growth by age estimated by the CPS

cross section data. Kotlikoff and Wise (l981) describe these estimates in

detail. In the analysis here we assume that wage earnings after age 65 remain

constant in nominal dollars.    Our actuarial calculations enTploy a 9 percent

nominal interest rate and use a unisex mortality table, which represents an
                                    —7-




 average of male and female mortality probabilities. Unlike the simple formulae

 in the appendix, our calculations take account of the worker's survival probabi-

lities prior to retirement as well as after retirement.

         The BLS Level of Benefits Survey contains highly detailed information

concerning the sampled pension plans' vesting provisions, requirements for early

and normal retirement, the specifics of their normal and supplemental benefit

formulae, and the crediting of service and payment of benefits for those working

beyond the normal retirement age.

         There is a very considerable amount of diversity in the particular

provisions of private plans which generate sizea'ole differences in vested

pension benefit accrual. Many seemingly minor features of a plan can have very

important effects on benefit accrual. FOr example, consider a stipulation that

service is credited for only 25 years in a plan that permits early retirement at

62. For a worker hired at age 30 the accrual at age 55 will decline sharply to

zero and remain at zero until the early retirement age. Without this ceiling on

credited service, accrual between ages 55 and 62 could be very sizeable; the

weighted average ratio of pension accrual to the wage is roughly 15 percent in

our sample of plans with age 62 early retirement. Other examples of very

important "details" of pension provisions are age and service requirements for

supplemental benefits, ceilings on the amount by which social security benefits

can be used to offset pension benefits, maximum values of pension benefits,

discontinuous changes by age in the rate of benefit reduction for early

retirement, and maximum ages for plan participation. Each of these features, as

well as numerous others not mentioned, can produce sharp discontinuities in 1(a)

at ages other than the ages of vesting, early retirement, and normal retirement.
                                     -8-




Our calculatior:s take into account each of the seemingly "minor" as well as

major pension provisions included in the data.

           The considerable variation in plan features within industry and

occupation and, consequently, accrual profiles raises several important issues

about the functioning of U.S. labor market. First, equally productive workers

are likely to face very different incentives to change jobs or retire because of

pension plans. Second, the heterogeneity in accrual profiles across plans

suggests that equally productive workers in the same industry and occupation,

but in different plans, may be receiving quite different amounts of total com-

pensation both on an annual and on a lifetime basis. Third, equally productive

workers of different sexes or ages who join the same pension plan in a firm at

the same time are likely to receive very different labor rerrnineration, even if

the quality and quantity of their labor supply is equivalent. Fourth, the

complex calculations required to compute the accrual of vested benefits and,

therefore, the compensation one is currently receiving, calls into question the

understanding of pension compensation both on the part of employers and

workers.


II. Pension Accrual Profiles for Percent of Earnings Plans

           Percent of earnings plans are discussed in this section and flat (non

earnings related) plans in the next. Variation in pension accrual profiles by

early and normal retirement ages is discussed first, followed by a discussion of

the wide variation among plans holding early and normal retirement ages fixed.

Next we consider the effect of social security offset provisions and also exa—

mine accrual profiles by industry and by occupation. Then the effects of alter-

native post—normal—retirement provision are discussed. Finally there is an
                                    -9-




analysis of the effects on accrual profiles of early and normal retirement

supplements. The cost in pension wealth of Job change is discussed in section

IV. Section V describes the differences in the pension cost of hiring women

versus men.

         A.   The Decline in Pension Wealth Accrual at Early and Normal

              Fetirement Ages

         Average accrual profiles for the percent of earnings plans with lO—year

cliff vesting are shown in table 1 by early and normal retirement ages. Three

of these average profiles corresponding to plans with the respective early and

normal retirement ages ——55—55, 55—65, 65—65——are graphed in figure 1. In this

and subsequent figures and tables, annual accrued pension benefits are expressed

as a ratio of the wage. The graph depicts the very substantial declines in the

rate of pension wealth accrual at several critical ages. The first is the age

of normal retirement, which equals the age of early retirement for plans with no

early retirement option. Second, there is also a sharp decline in the rate of

accrual at the age of early retirement, but this decline is substantially lower

than the decline at the normal retirement age.3 Third, there is a very substan-

tial decline between ages 6 and 66 in the average accrual rate no matter what

the ages of early and normal retirement.

         The actual declines in average accrual rates at these critical ages

indicated in table 1 are highlighted in table 2. The ages of early and normal

retirement are identical in columns 1, 1, 6, and 8 of the table with respective

retirement ages of 55, 60, 62, and 65. At these ages the accrual rates as a

percent of wages decline from .26 to 0, .27 to —.06, .25 to —.13, and .21 to

—.19 respectively. Thus, at these ages the total annual eonrpensation (wage plus

pension accrual) from working declines by 21 percent, 26 percent, 30 percent,

and 33 percent respectively. Surely then the incentive to continue work with

the current employer past these ages is very substantially reduced.

         In instances where early and normal retirement ages do not coincide,

there is also a very substantial decline in the ratio of pension accrual to the

wage at the age of normal retirement. For example, among plans   with early
retirement   at 55 and normal retirement at 60 the decline is from .14 to —.09.

There is also a decline at the age of early retirement for these plans, although

it is considerably less substantial than the decline at the age of normal

retirement. For example, of plans with early retirement at 55 and normal

retirement at 65 the decline at 55 is from .10 to .07, while at 65 the decline

is from •04 to —.15.

         Finally, in all cases there is a substantial decline in the rate of

pension accrual between ages 65 and 66. The effective reduction in compensation

ranges from 8 percent to 140 percent of the wage rate except for plans with early

and normal retirement at 60, in which case the decline is from —.12 to —.14.

Thus while the stipulations of plans vary tremendously, these plans, on average,

seem to provide a substantial inducement to retirement after age 65, no matter

what the inducement before this age.

         The figure and the table also show a large variation in average pension

accrual at 140, the age of cliff vesting. It is highest, on average, for plans

with early and normal retirement at 55 and lowest, on average, for plans with

early and normal retirement at 65. As mentioned, because the early retirement

reduction is typically less than actuarially fair, pension wealth is generally

greatest if benefits are taken at the age of early retirement. Thus the accrued
                                       -14-




weal-t,h at the age of vesting is usually calculated by   discounting   benefits from

the age of early retirement, assuming that the worker could begin to collect

benefits at that age. Figure 1, for example, shows a vesting spike of almost 25

percent of earnings for 55—55 plans, 7 percent of earnings for 55—65 plans, and

about 14   percent   of earnings for 65—65 plans.

           In summary, it seems apparent that continuation in the labor force

after the age of normal retirement and sometimes early retirement as well

typically involves a substantial reduction in compensation because of the very

large declines in the rate of pension wealth accrual. After the ge of 65,

there is typically a substantial loss in pension accrual, no matter what the

ages of early and normal retirement. And, the sharp changes in average pension

accrual at particular ages provides rather strong prima facia evidence against

annual spot market clearing; neither wages nor marginal products appear to

adjust at these critical ages to meet the spot market equilibrium condition

written in (1).


            8. Variation Among Plans

           Even among plans with the same early and normal retirement ages there

is wide variation in accrual rates at each age, particularly after the age of

early retirement. To demonstrate this fact, average accrual rates for the 513

plans of table 1 with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at 65,

together with median, maximum, minimum and upper and lower 5 percentile levels,

are shown in table 3. The lower 5 percentile points for any age group for

example is that accrual rate such that 5 percent of plans have accruals below

that level. The upper 5 percentile point is defined analogously. Consider the

accrual ratio at vesting. While the average vesting ratio for this smaple is

.071, the median is .021, the maximum is .383, and the minimum is 0. The ratio

at the lowest 5th percentile is 0, while it i .201 for the largest 5th

percentile. A similarly large dispersion in annual accrual ratios is indicated

for each of the ages 40 through 70. Weighted average accrual rates together

with upper and lower 5 percentile levels are graphed in figure 2. While the

average accrual rates between ages 55 and 6 are positive, for many plans the

rates by 65 are very negative. Thus it is important to base judgements about

the labor force participation incentive effects of pension plans not simply on

the basis of average accrual rates.

          Additional evidence of the variability of pension accrued profiles is

obtained by comparing profiles of particular plans. Figure 3 plots the

accrual profiles of four of the sample's 30 largest plans. Plan 1 exhibits a 29

percent vesting spike, a reduction of 30 percentage points in the accrual ratio

at age 55 and a further major reduction at age 65 from —.063 to —.351. In

contrast the vesting spike is only 14 percent for plan 2 in the figure. This

plan also exhibits no major reduction in the accrual ratio at early retirement

and only a minor reduction at normal retirement. Plan 3ts vesting spike is TrLlch

less than that of plan 1, but the drop off of the accrual ratio at age 55 is

very imich larger than that in plan 1. This plan also exhibits extremely sharp

changes in accrual ratios at ages 60, and 63. Plan 14 exhibits even greater

discontinuities in the accrual profile. Thus the plans' incentive effects on

labor force participation also vary widely.

         As described above, a substantial number of.plans have social security

offset provisions, under which pension benefits are reduced by an amount

 depending upon the recipients' social security benefits. The offset provisions

vary widely among plans. In some instances the offset is enough to completely

eliminate payment of pension benefits from the private pension plan. Private

pension benefit payments are typically substantially lower with than without the

offset provision. Accrual rates for percent of earning plans with lO—year cliff

vesting and early retirement at 55 are shown in table 4 for selected normal

retirement ages, with and without social security offset provisions. The

average profiles for offset and non—offset plans with early retirement at 55 and

normal retirement at 62 are graphed in figure 4. A noticeable difference

between the two groups of plans is the relatively large spike at vesting for

plans without the offset compared with the low rate of accrual at vesting for

plans with the social security offset. In addition, the accrual ratio at 55 is

larger for plans without the offset than for plans with it, and the drop in the

rate of accrual is substantially larger for plans without than for plans with

the offset. The accrual ratio for plans without an offset is .21 at 55 and

drops by almost 60 percent to .09 at 56. In contrast, the accrual rate for

plans with an offset is about i6 percent at 55 and drops by only about 26

percent to .12 at age 56. Both groups of plans show negative accrual rates

after the age of normal retirement, 62, and both groups of plans show nuch

larger negative accrual rates after 6. Table 14 indicates that the relative

accrual rates of the two groups for plans with different normal retirement ages

are similar to those shown in the figure.

         The table also shows that pension accrual at the age of vesting is

rather substantial for plans without a social security offset even among plans

with normal retirement at 65. The average accrual rate at vesting for all plans

with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at 65 is .071, as shown in

table 1 above. It can be seen in table    that that accrual is over 12 percent

for plans without a social security offset while it is less than 2 percent for

plans with a offset.


         D. Accrual Ratios by Industry and Occupation

              1. Industry

         Accrual profiles for selected industries are shown in table 5. For

purposes of comparison and for ease of exposition, profiles are presented only

for plans with early retirement at 55 although profiles for three normal

retirement ages, 55, 62, 65, are shown. The most apparent difference among

industries is in the proportion of plans with particular early and normal

retirement ages. For example, in retail trade and services almost all plans

have normal retirement at 65, with only a few plans with early retirement at 55

or 62. On the other hand, almost 62 percent of plans in transportation have

early and normal retirement at 55, with approximately 20 percent of plans

showing normal retirement at 62 and 20 percent at 65. In manufacturing, 66

percent of plans have normal retirement at 65, 28 percent at 62, and about 6

percent at 55.

         But among plans with the same early and normal retirement age, table 5

indicates little difference in average accrual profiles across industries.

Table 6 isolates accrual ratios at critical ages, in particular before and after

the age of early retirement and before and after the age of normal retirement.

Averages are only presented for cells with more than 10 plans. Two dashes

indicate that there were fewer than 10. The cell was left blank if the

corresponding age did not represent a critical age for the plan in question.

Only in manufacturing and transportation were there a substantial number of

plans with early and normal retirement at 55. In these two industries, the

accrual profiles look very similar. Three industries had a significant number

of plans with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at 62, and again

there seems to be little noticeable difference among the plans by industry. All

industries have plans with normal retirement at 65.   But   even in this case, the

profiles seem quite similar. The only possible exception seems to be retail

trade, where pension accrual relative to the wage rate is less generous than in

the other industry groups.

         Nonetheless, a typical worker apparently faces a much greater incentive

to leave the labor force early in some industries than in others. For example,

a large proportion of workers covered by pensions in transportation would

experience a 27 percent reduction in effective compensation by continuing to

work between 55 and 56. While at 55, pension accrual would be equivalent to

about 27 percent of wage rates for many workers in this industry, if the worker

continued in the labor force until age 66, his annual loss in pension wealth

would be equivalent to 30 percent of wage earnings at 66. A large proportion of

workers in manufacturing have plans with early retirement at 55 and normal

retirement at 65. In this case, the accrual at 55 averages about 9 percent of

the wage at 55 and declines only to about 7 percent of the wage by 65. But then the

accrual rate becomes negative, and if the worker were to continued in the labor

force between 65 and 66, the decline in pension accrual would amount to an

effective reduction in compensation of about 21 percent.

        Among plans with the same early and normal retirement ages, the pension
                                  -27-



accrual ratios do not differ noticeably by occupation. Accrual ratios for

professionals, clerical workers, and production workers are shown in table I for

plans with early retirement at age 55 and 3 normal retirement ages——55, 62, and

65. Plans in the 55—65 group are graphed 'by    occupation   in figure 5. It seems

clear from the table and the figure that given the age of normal retirement,

there appears to be no substantial differences in accrual ratios by occupational

group. Consider for example plans with normal retirement at age 55: at age

55, the accrual ratio is .29 for professionals, .25 for clerical workers, and

.25 for production workers. At age 66,   the   accrual ratio has dropped to —.30

for professionals, —.30 for clerical workers, and —.29 for production workers.

Similarly, close ratios are observed for the other two normal retirement ages.

For example, at age 62 the accrual ratios for plans with normal retirement at 62

are .10 for professionals, .10 for clerical workers, and .10 for production

workers. This is not to say that there are no differences in pension coverage

by occupational groups. It simply says that conditional on having a plan with

given early and normal retirement ages, the accrual ratios for the occupational

groups are very similar. The data in table 7 y, however, be concealing intra

industry variation in accrual profiles by occupation for given retirement ages.

        To address this potential ambiguity, accrual ratios for the same plans

treated in table 7 are presented in table 8 but only for manufacturing. But

here again there is very little difference in the accrual profiles by

occupation. Consider, for example, the drop in accrual ratios between age 55

and 66. For plans with normal retirement at age 55, the decline is .58 (.287

minus —.295) for professionals, .51 for clerical workers, and .50 for production

yorkers. Analogous declines are .29 for professionals, .30 for clerical

workers, and .35 for production workers, respectively, in plans with normal

retirement at 62. Only among plans with normal retirement at age 65 is there a

noticeable difference in the accrual ratios by occupation. In this case, the

drop between age 55 and age 66 is .29 for professionals, .25 for clerical

workers, but somewhat less than .1A for production workers. Thus we conclude

that differences in pension accrual ratios by occupation are primarily due to

different plan types or to differences in early and normal retirement, given the

general type of plan. Production workers, for example, are more likely to have

flat benefit plans than professionals.


         E. The Effect of Alternative Post—Normal—Petirernent Provisions on

             Pension Accrual

         Accrual ratios for percent of earnings plans with early retirement at 55

are shown in table 9 for selected normal retirement ages and for alternative

post—normal retirement provisions. The post—normal retirement provisions have

been grouped into five categories:

        (1) Full Credit, Deferred: plans providing full credit according to the

            standard formula for years worked past the age of normal retirement,

           but with benefits beginning only after retirement.

        (2) No Credit, Deferred: plans with no credit given for work after the

           the age of normal retirement and with benefits beginning only after

           retirement,

        (3) No Credit, Immediate Payout or Actuarial Increase: plans with no

           credit given for additional work after the age of normal retirement,

           but with benefits beginnning irmnediately or increased actuarially

           until benefits are taken.

        (14)   Limited   Credit, Deferred: plans with limited credit given for work

               after the age of normal retiremeht or with full credit for service

               post normal retirement up to a specified age or number of years;

               benefits are deferred in these plans until retirement.

           (5) Limited Credit, Imriediate Payout or Actuarial Increase: plans with

               provisions analogous to the third category above 'but   with   limited

               credit rather than no credit.

With the exception of plans of type (3), these provisions typically lead to very

negative accrual ratios after the age of normal retirement. Table 9 compares

accrual ratios across these 5 types of plans with varying post normal

retirement benefit porvisions. The table examines alternative normal retirement

ages, with early retirement occurring at 55. The figures in table 9 are

somewhat surprising, indicating quite negative accrual ratios for plans that

fullr credit post normal retirement service; indeed, in certain cases, these

negative accrual ratios are larger in absolute value than negative accrual

ratios of plans that provide no credit.

           To isolate the irrrpact of the choice of post retirement provisions,

accrual ratios for percent of earnings plans with early retirement at 55 and

selected normal retirement ages were calculated first assuming that all of the

plans had a full credit provision and second, assuming that all the plans had a

no credit provision. These results are shown in table 10. The table indicates

that the effect of crediting service after normal retirement depends importantly

on the age of normal retirement. For plans with a normal retirement age of 55

negative    accrual ratios are larger in absolute value under no crediting prior to

age 66 and smaller in absolute value thereafter.

         F. Early and Normal Retirement Supplements

         Approximately 11.14 percent of plans have early and 7.5 have normal

retirement supplements. The typical normal retirement supplement provides an

addition to otherwise calculated benefits if the individual postpones retirement

unti], the normal retirement age. The typical early retirement supplement

provides an addition to benefits if retirement occurs after the age of early

retirement. The average accrual rates for percent of earnings and flat plans

with supplements and with 10—year cliff vesting and early and normal retirement

at 55 and 65 respectively, are shown in table 11 'by type of supplement. There

are only two plans in the category with only normal retirement supplements, but

nonetheless the effect of the supplements can be seen in the first column of the

table. The accrual rate jumps from about 9 percent of the wage at age 614 to 60

percent of the wage at age 65 Thus the supplement apparently provides a

relatively strong incentive to remain with the firm until age 65, but thereafter

there is a sharp drop in the accrual rate to —18 percent. Accrual rates for

plans with early retirement supplements are shown in the second column of the

table. In this case there is a sharp increase in the accrual rate from .12 at

age 514 to .1414 at age 55, with a sharp drop thereafter. Again, the provision

seems to provide a substantial incentive to remain with the firm to the age of

early retirement, with a very substantial decline thereafter. Accrual rates for

plans with both types of supplement are shown in the last column of the table.

In this case there is a rather large spike at the age of early retirement, equal

to 62 percent of the wage in that year, with a smaller but still noticeable

spike at about the age of normal retirement.

of supplement are shown in table 12 for selected early and normal retirement

ages. The spikes in the accrual rates are highlighted with dashed lines.

Consider for example plans with early retirement at age 55. The spike created

by the early retirement supplement is from .22 to .39 for plans with normal

retirement at 55, from .12 to .50 for plans with normal retirement at 60, and

from .11 to .148 for plans with normal retirement at 65. Of the 56 plans with

normal retirement at age 60, the pension accrual rate at that age is on average

equivalent to 100 percent of the wage rate. Similar discontinuities in the

accrual ratios are evident for plans with other early and normal retirement

ages. For example, of plans with early and normal retirement at age 60, the

accrual rate at that age is equivalent to 614 percent of the annual wage for

persons aged 60. Thus these special supplements create very significant

one—time additions pension wealth and therefore provide potentially very

important incentives to remain with the firm until the age that the special

supplement is awarded. The special supplements also further dramatize the wide

variation in the incentive effects implicit in the provisions of private pension

plans.



III. Flat Benefit Plans

         Accrual ratios for flat benefit plans with selected early and normal

retirement are shown in table 13. This table can be compared to table 1 above

which presents comparable numbers for percent of earnings plans. The accrual

profiles for flat plans with early—normal retirement at ages 55—55, 55—60, 55—65

are shown graphically in figure 6. In general, the accrual profiles for the

flat benefit plans look quite similar to those for percent of earnings plans.

Eecall that we have assumed that the flat benefit increases with the rate of

inflation, assumed to be 6 percent annually in our calculations.

While it. is not possible to make comparisons for plans with each of the early

and normal retirement combinations because of the relatively small sample sizes

in some of them for flat benefit plans, for several early—normal retirement age

combinations, there are rather large numbers of plans of both types, e.g., the

combinations 55—60, 55—65, and 60—65. The average decline in the accrual ratio

between the age of early retirement to age 66 is .30 for percent of earnings

plans versus .39 for flat benefits plans in the case of the 55—60 retirement age

combination. It is .25 versus .16 for the 55—65 combination, and .26 versus .17'

for the 60—65 combination.

         Accrual ratios at several critical ages for plans with early retirement

at 55 and normal retirement at 65 are shown below for percent of earnings and

flat benefit plans:

The accrual rates for these plans are graphed in figure 7. The evidence seems

to indicate that the two types of plan provide rather similar .ncentive effects.

         The provisions of flat rate plans, like those of percent of' earnings

plans, also yield widely differing ratios, even among plans with the same early

and normal retirement ages. Indications of the dispersion of the accrual ratios

among flat plans with early and normal retirement at 55 and 65 respectively are

shown in table l4 and in figure 8. While the average accrual rate at age 55,

for example, is 7 percent, the minimum value is 0 and the maximum 24 percent.

Similarly at age 56, while the average is about 5 percent the maximum is 20

percent and the minimum about 0. At 65, the average is 5 percent, with a

maximum of almost 33 percent and a minimum of about —20 percent. At 66 after

the age of normal retirement, the average accrual rate is —9 percent, while the

minimum is —56 percent and the maximum 0. Thus the incentive for retirement

varies widely among flat, as well as percent of earnings plans.



IV. The Pension Cost of Job Change

          There are many ways to think about the effect of job change on pension

accrual and the potential incentive effects of pension provisions on the job

change decision. One approach is to consider the effect of job change on

accrued pension wealth at the age of retirement, say the age of plan normal

retirement. Another way is to consider the expected loss in future pension

wealth   from changing job as a proportion of expected future wages. We shall
consider variants of both measures.


          A. If Change to a No—Pension Job
          Consider   a person who starts a job at some age, say 31. Suppose that

at a given subsequent age the person could change to another job and obtain the

same future wages as on the current job. His decision, assume, is either to

stay on the current job until normal retirement, or to switch to the second job

and stay on that one until the age of normal retirement. But suppose that the

until the age of normal retirement. This loss relative to the present value of

expected future wages is shown in tables 15, i6, and 17. Table 15 assumes that

an individual begins employment with the first firm at age 31. Table 16 assumes

a starting age of 41, and table 17 a starting age of 51. The tables present

these loss ratios by plan normal retirement age, and loss ratios are calculated

through the age of normal retirement. To obtain a more concise picture of the

losses, they are shown for selected ages of job change in table 18. For plans

withnormal retirement at 65, the loss in pension wealth relative to expected

wages is relatively small, between 4 and 6 percent for all ages of job change,

with the exception of job change at age 59 when joining the firm at age 51. In

the latter case, the remaining working life of the individual is short and he is

not yet vested. Thus the loss in potential pension accrual is relatively large

compared to future earnings.   Among plans with earlier normal retirernent——55,

6o, or 62——the potential loss in future pension accrual is considerably larger,

typically on the order of 8 to 20 percent of future earnings. The loss if one

changes jobs just before normal retirement, however, is in some instances much

larger than this, as high as 30 to 50 percent. For example, if at age 31 one

enters a plan with normal retirement at age 60, the loss ratio if one changes

job at 59 is 31 percent. If the individual enters at 51 and leaves at 59, the

loss is almost 50 percent.

         The greater relative loss with earlier normal retirement is shown in

figure 9, which presents loss ratios versus age for normal retirement at 55 and

at 65, starting at age 31. The effect of starting age is shown graphically in

figure 10 for plans with   normal retirement   at 60.

         A limiting case of numbers like those presented in table 18 is the

present discounted value of expected pension benefits at the age of hire as a

proportion of expected wages at that time. These numbers of course indicate the

cost to the employer of pension benefits versus wages if a person stays with the

employer from the time of hire to the age of early or normal retirement. Such

ratios are presented in table 19 by age of initial employment and plan normal

retirement age. The ratios are presented first assuming that the individual

remains with the firm until the age of early retirement and then assuming that

the person remains until the age of normal retirement. It can he seen from the

table that the present discounted value of pension versus wage compensation is

small on average, ranging from about 2 percent to about 10 percent. The average

proportion of compensation in pension benefits is typically larger the later the

age of initial employment. For example, the ratio of pension benefits to wages

for plans with normal retirement at 62 is .0149 if one enters the firm at 31 and

stays to the age of normal retirement. The ratio is .062 if one enters at 141,

and .0914 if one enters at 51. It is important to understand that while these

ratios may appear relatively small, the pattern of pension accrual may still

have a very substantial effect on worker labor force participation, as

demonstrated above.

         And, possibly the most striking feature of these loss ratios, is the

wide variation among plans. To demonstrate the dispersion, the mean loss ratio

together with the minimum and maximum at each age, are shown in table 20 for

plans with normal retirement at 65 and for persons who enter the firm at age 31.

Up to age 55——which is the age of early retirement for a substantial proportion

of plans——the loss is close to zero for some plans and indeed is even negative

for some. For other plans, however, the loss is very high, ranging up to 26

percent of future earnings at age 5)4 After 55, the maximum loss is typically

over 30 percent, while the minimum is close to —20 percent at each age. Pension

accrual after the age of early retirement is negative in many instances. For a

member of such a plan, it would pay to leave this firm, taking early retirement

benefits, and join another firm, assuming that one could join the second firm

and obtain the same expected future wages.



         B.        annd Pension Wealth at Age of Normal Betirenient

         Pension wealth at the age of normal retirement may be reduced very

substantially by job change, as shown in Table 21.   A person who began work at

31 and changed to another job at l would have accrued, on average, only 72

percent of the pension wealth of a person who began at 31 and remained in the

same firm. If he changed jobs at 4l and again at 51, he would accrue only 43

percent of the pension wealth of a person with no job change. This percent

ranges from a low of 30 on average in transportation to 60 percent in

construction. Thus the loss in pension wealth with job change seems to provide a

potentially large incentive against job mobility.

         Because some plans place a limit on years of service that are credited

in calculating benefits, it may in some instances pay to change jobs and begin

to accrue benefits in a new plan. This leads to ratios that are greater than

one in a few instances. The minimum and maximum values, over all industries

arise in anomalous plans, and these should not be given much weight; but they do

suggest that there is substantial variation among plans in this respect, as well

as in other respects discussed above.

         C. Pension Accrual Ratios and Age of Initial Employment

         Pension accrual rates for percent of earnings plans with 10—year cliff

vesting are shown in tables 22 and 23 for persons beginning employment at ages

1i and 51 respectively. The tables are analogous to table 1 above, presenting

information by plan early and normal retirement ages. To provide an easier

comparison of the accrual rates by starting age, accrual rates for selected ages

are shown in table 2. The numbers are taken from table 1, table 22, and table

23. Accrual ratios for plans with early and normal retirement at 55       and   65

respectively   are graphed in figure   11.   The accrual rate at vesting is the most

important difference across initial employment ages. For example, as shown in

table 24, the accrual rate at vesting is          for persons beginning employment at

31, it is .62 for those beginning at age )41, and .92 for those beginning at age

51. The difference is simply due to the fact that the later the age of initial

employment, the nearer is the time of benefit receipt at the age of vesting.

The accrual rate at vesting increases with age of initial employment for each

early—normal retirement age category. Otherwise, the pattern of accrual rates

does not vary by starting age, except that the absolute value of the rates, both

positive and negative, is smaller as the age of initial employment increases.

Again, this is simply because potential benefits are lower with later starting

ages and, thus, potential losses after the age of early or normal retirement are

smaller. Notice that the accrual rate after the age of 6       is   negative in each

case. Plan provisions typically make the age of early and normal retirement

dependent upon age and years of service. Thus in practice, the ages of early

and normal retirement are typically somewhat higher for persons beginning

employment at age 51. But inno case is the age of normal retirement greater

V.   Pension Accrual Rates and Pension Cost by Sex

           Because women on average live longer than men, women would typically

receive pension benefits longer than otherwise equivalent men. The effect of

this difference in life expectancy on pension accrual and the value of pension

benefits is considered in this section. The weighted average of the accrued

benefits of women versus the accrued benefits of men by age are shown in table

25 for all plans in the sample. At the most common vesting age, 10 years, the

ratio is about 1.08 so that women's vested benefits are approximately 8 percent

higher than mens. The ratio increases gradually to abuut 1.10 at age 60 and

about 1.13 at 65. If otherwise identical men and women were to work until age

TO, the average ratio would be 1.17. The ratios do not vary significantly by

early and normal retirement age, and thus a breakdown by plan type is not

presented.

VI. Summary

           The ratios of pension benefit accrual to wage earnings are presented

for a wide range of pension plans. Typical plan provisions provide a strong

incentive for retirement after the age of plan normal retirement, and several

plan types provide a strong incentive for retirement after the age of early

retirement. A striking feature of the incentive effects of pension plans is

their wide variation among plans. For example, while the average plan may

provide reduced but still positive accrual after the age of early retirement,

for a large proportion of plans the accrual rate after this age is very

negative. Thus it would not be unusual for the reduction in pension benefit

accrual after the age of early retirement to be equivalent to a 30 percent

reduction in wage earnings. The accrual rate at the age of vesting can range

from as low as 2 percent of wage earnings in that year to as high as 100 percent

of wage earnings, depending upon the plan type and on the age of initial

employment. Thus for some employees, vesting could be a very important

determinant of labor force participation decisions. Special early and normal

retirement provisions may also add very substantially to accrued pension wealth

at particular ages and may thus encourage workers to remain with a firm until

these benefits are received. The accrual profiles under flat benefit plans seem

very similar to the accruals under percent of earnings plans, if one assumes

that the flat benefit is increased to keep pace with the rate of inflation.

Given early and normal retirement ages, there is little difference in plan

accrual profiles by industry or by occupation. Differences in pension benefits

by industry depend more on the type of plan than on variations among plans with

the same basic provisions. While the expected loss in pension benefits due to

job change is apparently relatively small in many instances, it is rather large

in others, and there is very wide variation among plans with the loss very high

in some cases and, indeed, in other cases a gain may be had by changing job. In

addition, accrued benefits at the age of retirement are typically very much

lower with job change than if a person remains on the same job. Because women

typically live longer than men, accrued pension benefits at any age are higher

for women than for men, about 13 percent on average at age 65, for example. In

short, the evidence suggests that the rapid increase in pension plan coverage

over the past two or three decades may well have contributed very substantially

to the reduction in the labor force participation of older workers during this

period. The plans may also have an important effect on labor mobility.

         The source of discontinuities in age accrual profiles is clarified by

considering a simple earnings—related defined benefit plan with "cliff vesting"

at 10 years of service. Vested accrued benefits are clearly zero prior to the

age at which the worker has ten years of credited service in the plan. Let

E(a,t) denote the ratio of 1(a) to W(a) for a worker age a with t years of

tenure, where 1(a) is defined in (i) in the text. Then R(a,t) is zero for t      9.

If a person age a with 9 years of service works an additional year, the ratio of

the increment to the wage, W(a), is


(Al)     R(a,9)
                    B(a,t)A(55) (1 +   d 10   (1 +
                                                     (55 -   (a +   i)
                              W(a)
In (Al), B(a,t) is the retirement benefit available to the worker who terminates

employment with the plan sponsor at age a after t years of service, but who

delays receipt of pension benefits until the plan's normal retirement age. The

normal and early retirement ages assumed for this stylized plan are 65 and 55

respectively. Terminating workers in this example are eligible for early

retirement benefits. Our hypothetical plan reduces benefits by d percent for

each year that early retirement preceeds normal retirement. The benefit

reduction rate, d is assumed to be less than the actuarial fair rate.

         The function A(55) is the actuarial discount factor that transforms

benef it flows initiating at age 55 into expected stocks of pension wealth at age

55. Expectations here are taken with respect to longevity. Thus A(55) is the

annuity value of a dollarts worth of pension benefits to be received each year

until death, beginning at age 55. For simplicity asume that the probability of

dying prior to age 55 is zero. Hence the present value at age a of A(55) is
                                                          —2—




A(a) = A(55) (1 +      rH            — a)
                                          for a                55. If pension benefits are determined as

a constant X times the product of final year's earnings and service, and there

is no offset for receipt of social security benefits, B(a,t) is simply:

(A2)        B(a,t) = XW(a)t,           and

(A3)        R(a,9) =    X(i      +   d)°     (i +
                                                                       -    (a   +   1))   A(s5)1o
                                                                                                     W(a±l)

            P(a,t), for t increasing pari—passus with age, is zero prior to t

equals 9 and jumps at t equals 9 to the value given in (A3). Cliff vesting thus

produces spikes in the accrual profile such as that in Figure 1 at 10 years of

service. Between the age at cliff vesting and age 55 pension wealth, Pw(a), is

given by:




                                                                                 i)

and the increment to pension wealth 1(a) divided by the wage W(a) is given by

                                                                     - (a +                             t ÷ 1

Equations (A3) and (AS) suggest a drop in F(a,t) as a increases to a + 1 con-

current with an increase in t from 9 to 10. Equation (AS) will be positive if

the bracketed term exceeds zero. This will be the case if the percentage

increase in the wage plus the percentage increase in years employed (l/t) is

greater than zero. Assuming the term in brackets is positive and is roughly

constant, B(a,t) will increase exponentially due to the exponential decline in

the discount factor, (1 +

            If the value of d is considerably less than actuarially fair, a

discontinuity in B(a,t) occurs at the early retirement age, 55. At ages 55

and 6 we have:
                                              —3—



(A6)     Pw(55)   = Aw(55)(l     +   dY°     A(55)t, and

(A')     Pw(56) = Aw(56)(1 +         a)9    A(56)(t +      1).

Hence,

                                                          [w(56) t + 1 A(56) (1 + a)

         Assuming wage growth at 54           is    close to that at 55 and A(56) approxi-

mately equals A(55), then R(55,t) primarily differs               from   R(51t,t —    1) because

the first terms in the bracket in (7) is now railtiplied by                (1 + a)    while the

second term, —1, is multiplied by (i +              r).   Since r exceeds d by       assumption,
R(55,t) can easily be less than R(5)4,t —i). Indeed, this change in the func-

tional form of R(a,t) can produce sharp drops in accrual rates at the early

retirement age for a host of pension plans and a range of realistic economic

assumptions.

         It is important to realize that the early retirement reduction, lower

wages, and one less year of tenure yield lower benefits at 55 than at 56.                       The

early retirement reduction reduces benefits at the rate d. But if benefits

were taken at 55 they could accrue interest at the rate r. Thus by foregoing

the early retirement option of receiving benefits at 55, a cost is incurred

that depends on the difference r — d.              If this loss is not offset by the

increase due to wage growth and 1 year of additional tenure, there will be a

drop in the benefit accrual rate between 55 and 56.

         The same considerations pertain to benefit increments between 56 and

6. Recall that we have assumed a less than fair early retirement reduction
so that benefits accrued before 55            are valued based on the assumption that bene-

fits are received starting at the age that yields maximum                      pension      wealth. The

optimum time to receive benefits accrued between 55 and 56 is 56, between 56 and

57 is 51, and so forth. But to gain benefits from working another year, it is

necessary to forego the option of immediately taking acrued benefits at an

advantageous reduction rate.

          Between ages 6 and 65, R(a,t) equals:

In   contrast to the H(a,t) formula in (A5) that applies to the period between

cliff vesting and early retirement, (A9) indicates that the actuarial reduction

factor d, rather than the interest rate r, imparts an upward tilt in the P(a,t)

profile between early and normal retirement, as long as the term in brackets is

positive. In (A9) as in (A5) and (A8) the accrual rate, B(a,t), is an

increasing function of the rate of nominal wage growth. Larger nominal interest

rates reduce acrual rates at all ages, with a negative interaction with age

prior to early retirement.

          While the expression (AS) is unlikely to be negative, large differences bet-

ween wage growth and the interest rate r can yield negative increments in pension

wealth after the early retirement age. To a first approximation, the bracketed term

in equation (A9) will be positive if AW/W +                lit > r — d, where W/W is the per-
centage increase in wages, and l/t is the percentage increase in tenure. It is

easy to see, however, that low wage growth and high interest rates will yield

negative increments.

         Pension accrual after normal retirement can be significantly negative.

Assume that our hypothetical plan neither credits service after normal retirement nor

provides an actuarial increase in benefits for postponing benefit receipt beyond the

normal retirement age. In this case R(a,t) after normal retirement is given by:

(Ala)    R(a,t) =   Xt* A(a) IA(a
                                    + 1) —
                                             (   1 +   r)l
                               LA(a)                    j
Where t equals the worker's service prior to age 65. Note that for the following

reasonable parameter values:


           =   .02, t = 30, A(a) = 15,   r =     .04, and    A(a + 1)   l4, R(a,t) =   —.96,
a quite substantial negative accrual ratio.

         While the preceeding formulae are suggestive of the general shape of accrual

rate profiles, there are few earnings—based plans with features as simple as the one

considered here. In addition to more complicated rules for plan participation and

vesting that often involve age as well as service requirements, there are a variety

of methods of computing earnings bases, including career averages, and averages of

earnings, possibly highest earnings, over a specified period or number of years.

eduction rates for early retirement are often a specified function of age, if

not length of service. Some plans allow no further accrual after a given number of

years of service. Roughly thirty percent of defined benefit participants belong

to plans that are integrated with social security, and the form of "integration"

can have an important effect on the pattern of benefit accrual. Other plans, in

particular, those with social security offset formulae, provide supplemental

benefits for early retirees prior to their receipt of social security benefits.

In addition to these    earnings—related plans, a significant number of plans
                                   -6-



covering over forty percent of defined benefit participants calculate benefits

independent of the participant's earnings. Finally, there are plans that spe-

cify iinimun and nEximu benefit levels.
