Housing Bubbles

                                              ABSTRACT

Housing markets experience substantial price volatility, short term price change momentum and mean
reversion of prices over the long run. Together these features, particularly at their most extreme, produce
the classic shape of an asset bubble. In this paper, we review the stylized facts of housing bubbles
and discuss theories that can potentially explain events like the boom-bust cycles of the 2000s. One
set of theories assumes rationality and uses idiosyncratic features of the housing market, such as intensive
search and short selling constraints, to explain the stylized facts. Cheap credit provides a particularly
common rationalization for price booms, but temporary periods of low interest rates will not explain
massive price swings in simple rational models. An incorrectly under-priced default option is needed
to explain the formation of rational bubbles. Many non-rational explanations for real estate bubbles
exist, but the most promising theories emphasize some form of trend-chasing, which in turn reflects
boundedly rational learning.

   I.      Introduction


Between 2000 and 2012, America experienced a great housing convulsion that had all the classic
attributes of a real estate bubble. Housing prices rose dramatically and then fell, leaving
average real housing prices in 2012 no higher than they were in 2000. Price growth, between
2000 and 2006, was much higher in some places than in others, and the places with the biggest
price growth experienced the largest declines. Surprisingly, some of the biggest booms
occurred in places like Phoenix and Las Vegas which appear to have few short-run limits on new
construction (Nathanson and Zwick, 2014, Gao, 2014, Davidoff, 2013).

During the years of biggest boom—2003, 2004 and 2005—when the change in real housing
price growth is regressed on the one year lag of price growth across metropolitan areas, the
coefficient is greater than one. Price growth seemed to build upon itself. This phenomenon
represents the more general tendency of price growth to show strong positive serial correlation at
one year frequencies (Case and Shiller, 1989). There was also a clear pattern of spatial
correlation, where a boom that started on the coast seems to have spread to neighboring in-land
metropolitan areas (Ferreira and Gyourko, 2012).

The U.S. housing cycle that occurred between 2000 and 2012 is extreme but hardly unique.
Other countries, such as Ireland and Spain, also experienced housing bubbles and crashes over
those years. While Japan’s housing market remained stable after 2000, Japan had experienced
its own massive real estate cycle in the 1980s and early 1990s. American history is replete with
examples of real estate booms and busts, from the days of the early Republic to the American
convulsion of the early 1980s. In summarizing these events, Glaeser (2013) argues that while
these events may clearly look like bubbles ex post, even at their height, prices could be
reconciled with standard models of real estate evaluation.

In Section II of this essay, we begin with a simple user-cost model of housing value that we refer
to as the linear asset pricing model or LAPM, following Head, Lloyd-Ellis and Sun (2014). This
approach runs deep within real estate and housing economics, but it differs from the general
equilibrium approach preferred by macroeconomists and discussed by Davis and van
Nieuwerburgh in this volume. We begin with a simple model, rather than stylized facts, because
a model is helpful when discussing which stylized facts are anomalous. In any user-cost model
that descends from Poterba (1984), prices equal the expected value of the exogenous flow of
discounted future benefits from home-owning.

The LAPM approach is not only rational, but it abstracts away from critical institutional features
of the housing such as search and heterogeneity. Section II also discusses important institutional
features of the housing market that differ from other assets including the extremely difficulty of
short-sales, the extreme heterogeneity of the asset, the dominant role of amateur investors, and
limited information about current asset values. These differences do limit the widespread


                                                2
applicability of the user cost or LAPM formula, but it remains a useful benchmark with which to
examine housing price fluctuations.

Section III discusses stylized facts about housing markets. We begin by noting the spatial
heterogeneity of the recent boom and bust, the strong short term positive serial correlation of
prices and the even stronger long term negative price change serial correlation. The short term
positive serial correlation is difficult to square with the LAPM, but negative serial correlation
over longer time horizons is more readily reconcilable with rationality if housing supply
responses are delayed. We also discuss the movements in the quantities of housing, which can
refer both to the volume of housing produced and the volume of housing sold. We end this
subsection with a discussion of real estate bubbles in U.S. history that draws heavily from
Glaeser (2013).

Section IV turns to rationalizing the seemingly irrational: economic approaches to understanding
these gigantic fluctuations which maintain individual rationality assumptions. Models of search
by heterogeneous consumers, such as Novy-Marx (2009), Head, Lloyd-Ellis and Sun (2014) and
Guren (2014) can slow the diffusion of shocks to the housing demand and thereby generate
momentum in prices over shorter time periods. Heterogeneous demand can also generate price
volatility, if there are exogenous shocks to supply. We discuss the possible role of rational
learning, but conclude that fully Bayesian updating has little power on its own to explain the
stylized facts.

Our final attempt to explain the events with rational models is to discuss the possible role of
credit. Mian and Sufi (2014) have compellingly made the case that subprime lending did push
up prices in many areas. While lower interest rates will have only a modest impact on prices in
the standard LAPM, assuming that individuals anticipate the mean reversion of interest rates
(Cox, Ingersoll and Ross, 1985), an underpriced default option will allow rational bubbles to
occur more readily. One natural explanation for charging borrowers too little for the risk of
default is the existence of agency problems either within financial institutions or between
mortgage originators and the eventual owners of securitized mortgages. We do not formally
model the financial institution’s structure, but assume that for some rational reason the agents of
lenders are pushing cash out the door too quickly and cheaply. Naturally, overly cheap credit
might also reflect over-optimism on the part of lending institutions or some other form of limited
rationality.

Typically, rational bubbles in housing require a violation of the standard transversality condition:
with such bubbles, the discounted infinite horizon expected value of the home is strictly positive.
Moreover, rational bubbles are particularly difficult to deliver with even moderately elastic
supply (Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz, 2008). If default risk is underpriced, then rational bubbles
can occur even with moderately elastic supply and without violating any transversality condition.




                                                 3
In Section V, we present a collection of less rational models of housing bubbles. We begin with
models in which beliefs are exogenous including Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz (2008), Piazzesi and
Schneider (2009) and Nathanson and Zwick (2013). These models are useful for exploring the
ways in which institutional features of the housing market interact with irrationality. For
example, Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz (2008) and Nathanson and Zwick (2013) both consider land
availability; Piazzesi and Schneider (2009) consider search dynamics. While this line of work is
potentially useful in generating ancillary predictions about housing bubbles (e.g. they are most
common in areas where land supply limited in the long run), they cannot explain the ultimate
source of beliefs about house prices.

We then turn to a second major class of models: extrapolation. In one class of extrapolative
models, the belief formation process is ad hoc but assumed for a small class of traders. In a
second class, the belief formation process follows from imperfect learning about a stochastic
growth rate. In a sense, the first class assumes massive irrationality for the few while the second
class assumes modest irrationality for the many. It may be that the first is more appropriate in
standard financial markets where a small number of well-financed traders can drive markets,
while the second class is more appropriate in housing markets.

A third class of models discusses other forms of limited rationality, including limited memory,
basing models on short runs of data, rule-of-thumb buying strategies, and price estimates based
on natural geographic comparisons. This discussion serves mainly to highlight the fact that once
perfect rationality is dropped, an essentially infinite array of assumptions is possible. This is
Tolstoy’s Corollary: there is only one correct answer to an optimization problem but there are an
uncountable number of wrong answers. We end by discussing social learning and the possible
role of entrepreneurs, like real estate brokers, who attempt to persuade buyers that housing prices
can only go up.

Finally, in Section VI, we discuss public policy implications of real estate bubbles. Two facts
seem clear: real estate fluctuations exist and they have displayed a remarkable ability to wreak
havoc on financial systems. While it may be impossible or infeasible to prick bubbles while
they expand, it may still be possible to undertake protective actions to ensure that the bursting of
the bubble will not cause as much damage in the future. There may also be social benefits from
reconsidering those policies that encourage individuals to borrow heavily to invest in real estate.
Section VII concludes.



   II.     The Linear Asset Pricing Model and the Idiosyncrasies of Housing



In Section III, we will present the core stylized facts about the housing market that need to be
addressed by models of housing bubbles. For these facts to help inform a survey of housing

                                                 4
bubbles, we must start with some clarifying discussion and algebra. Bubbles are typically
defined as periods in which asset prices “run well above or below the intrinsic value” (Fama,
1965). In the real estate context fundamentals can either mean the value based on the flow of
rents, as in the “user cost” model and its LAPM variant, or the flow of well-being associated
with living in a particular spot.

Housing markets are different from other asset markets. There exist real estate linked assets,
includes Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or Collateralized Mortgage Securities, that trade
in large markets, but more typically, housing is bought and sold in small, decentralized
transactions. This fact is obviously true in the enormous market for single family housing, but it
is also true in the realm of commercial restate as well. The dollar amounts of each sale may be
larger, but ultimately the purchase of Rockefeller Center is just as idiosyncratic as the purchase
of that Tudor home on the corner, if not more so.

The Linear Asset Pricing Model or User Cost Model

Nonetheless, the benchmark model of housing prices, often called the “user cost” model,
assumes that there is a single price of housing that is paid by all buyers, who are typically home
owners. 2 This price follows from an inter-temporal no arbitrage condition. The value of owning
                                                                                  𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 )
a home equals the benefits today plus the asset value tomorrow, or 𝑅𝑡 +                      = 𝑃𝑡 , where 𝑃𝑡
                                                                                    1+𝑟
                                                                1
reflects price, 𝑅𝑡 represents net benefits of owning and 1+𝑟 represents a constant discount factor.
The “fundamental” value then equals 𝐸�∑∞     𝑗=0(1 + 𝑟)
                                                        −𝑗
                                                           𝑅𝑡+𝑗 �. Empirically the values of 𝑅𝑡+𝑗
are either associated with observed market rents (Himmelberg, Mayer and Sinai, 2005) or the
benefits of living in a particular area including amenities and income (Glaeser, Gyourko,
Morales and Nathanson, 2014, Head, Lloyd-Ellis and Sun, 2014). These raw series can provide
testable implications for the observed series of prices.

One important aspect of this approach is that it avoids any consideration of risk-aversion and
portfolio composition. These issues are particularly important to the financial economists and
macroeconomists who study housing, and they are addressed in the chapter by Davis and van
Nieuwerburgh in this volume.

Shiller (1981) provides a famous, non-parametric approach to testing for excess variance by
noting that since ∑∞𝑗=0(1 + 𝑟)
                               −𝑗
                                  𝑅𝑡+𝑗 = 𝐸�∑∞  𝑗=0(1 + 𝑟)
                                                           −𝑗
                                                               𝑅𝑡+𝑗 � + 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 and since the error
should be independent of the expectation, the variance of the fundamental must be greater than
the variance of the price series. Of course, this is not true in the U.S. stock market, and it is not
true in housing markets either. This calculation is somewhat compromised by time varying
discount factors, which we will address later.

 Haughwout, Lee, Tracy and de Klaauw (2011) remind us that during the boom many of the buyers of single family
homes were actually investors.

                                                      5
For work on housing markets, it is somewhat more common to assume a particular stochastic
process for the fundamental, 𝑅𝑡 ¸ and to work with the formula implied by that quantity. We
briefly consider the implications of four stochastic processes: 𝑅𝑡 = (1 + 𝑔𝑅 )𝑅𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡𝑅
                                                     𝐷
(constant growth, i.i.d. error), 𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡−1+𝜖𝑡𝐷 + 𝜃𝜖𝑡−1   (no growth, moving average error),
                                      𝐷
𝑅𝑡 = 𝛿𝑅𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝛿)𝑅 + 𝜖𝑡𝐷 + 𝜃𝜖𝑡−1      (mean reverting, moving average error, e.g. ARMA(1,1,))
                         𝐷                                     𝑔
and 𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡−1 +𝑔𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡 , where 𝑔𝑡 = 𝜆𝑔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑔 + 𝜖𝑡 (stochastic growth rate). The
moving average process can create some persistence in price changes, but much less than the
persistence in rent changes. The mean reverting process can create robust amounts of price mean
reversion, but very small amounts of price momentum. The stochastic growth rate process can
predict both mean reversion and at least modest momentum. That process can also yield
relative high levels of price variance.

The simplest, non-stochastic process is to assume a constant growth rate for 𝑅𝑡 so that 𝑅𝑡 = (1 +
𝑔𝑅 )𝑅𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡𝑅 , where 𝜖𝑡𝑅 is an independently and idiosyncratically distributed (i.i.d.) noise term.
                                        (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡
In that case, the LAPM price becomes              . One implication of this formula is that small
                                         𝑟−𝑔𝑅
differences in 𝑔𝑅 can generate extreme differences in prices, especially when interest rates are
low as Himmelberg, Mayer and Sinai (2006) emphasized. Since the LAPM version of the user
cost model can imply extremely high price-rent ratios with seemingly reasonable parameter
estimates, it can also make bubbles seem rational. The use of the LAPM in 2006 to justify the
high prices at the peak of cycle suggests just how difficult it can be to identify a bubble while it
is happening.

Shiller’s (1981) insight was that even if it is hard to tell with price levels are compatible with a
LAPM price, the model also yields predictions about price change variances and covariances that
can be rejected by the data. The constant growth rate with i.i.d. error assumption implies that
                                                   1+𝑟
the standard deviation of price changes equals 𝑟−𝑔 , or the price-rent ratio, times the standard
                                                        𝑅
deviation of 𝜖𝑡𝑅 , which is also the standard deviation of changes in the rent. In other words, the
ratio of standard deviation of price changes to the standard deviation of rent changes equals the
price-rent ratio. That fact holds true for all time intervals, because the shocks are i.i.d.
Moreover, this simple random walk with drift predicts neither positive serial correlation in short
term price changes (momentum) nor negative serial correlation in long term price changes (mean
reversion).

For the next two illustrative processes, we assume that 𝑔𝑅 = 0. Given this simplification, we
next complicate the shocks with a moving average component, and assume that 𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡−1 +𝜖𝑡𝐷 +
  𝐷                                                                   (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡 +𝜃𝜖𝑡𝐷
𝜃𝜖𝑡−1 , where 𝜖𝑡𝐷 is i.i.d. and 𝜃 ≤ 1. The implied LAPM price is                      .       The ratio of the
                                                                           𝑟
                                                                                          1   (1+𝑟+𝜃)2 +𝜃2 𝑟 2
standard deviation of price changes to the standard deviation of rent changes is 𝑟 �                             .
                                                                                                   1+𝜃2
                                           𝜃
The serial correlation of rent changes is 1+𝜃2, and the implied serial correlation in price changes

                                                    6
      (1+𝑟+𝜃)𝑟𝜃                                            𝑟𝜃
is (1+𝑟+𝜃)2 +𝜃2 𝑟2 , which must be less than 1+𝜃2. This implies that the serial correlation of prices
must be less the interest rate times the serial correlation in prices. If 𝑟 = .1, then an increase in
the value of 𝜃 from 0 to 1 causes the serial correlation of rents to increase from 0 to .5, but the
serial correlation of housing prices will rise only from 0 to .0475. Very large amounts of serial
correlation in rents are associated with quite modest amounts of serial correlation in price
changes.

This moving average process does little to generate mean reversion at lower frequencies. To
                                                                             𝐷
allow for this possibility, we assume that 𝑅𝑡 = 𝛿𝑅𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝛿)𝑅 + 𝜖𝑡𝐷 + 𝜃𝜖𝑡−1  = 𝑅 + 𝜖𝑡𝐷 +
                                                                                 (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡       (1+𝑅)(1−𝛿)𝑅      𝜃𝜖𝐷
∑∞    𝑖        𝐷
 𝑖=0 𝛿 (𝜃 + 𝛿)𝜖𝑡−1−𝑖 . The pricing formula becomes 𝑃𝑡 =                                    +                      𝑡
                                                                                                             + 1+𝑟−𝛿 .
                                                                                  1+𝑟−𝛿         𝑟(1+𝑟−𝛿)
Generating mean reversion at longer frequencies is feasible with this type of auto-regressive
process, but generating substantial momentum is even more difficult than in the in the simpler
moving average process discussed above. A shock from last period can increase price growth
                           (1+𝑟)(1−𝛿)
today, as long as 𝜃 >           𝑟
                                           .    This will hold if 𝛿 = 1, which is the random walk case
discussed above, but with higher levels of mean reversion even one period momentum becomes
less and less plausible, and it is still impossible to get price change momentum that is nearly as
big as rent change momentum.

Last, we consider stochastic growth rates. We assume that 𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡−1 +𝑔𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡𝐷 , where 𝑔𝑡 =
                       𝑔
𝜆𝑔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑔 + 𝜖𝑡 . The growth rate is persistent in the short term but ultimately reverts
                                                                            𝑖 𝑔
to the area level norm. These assumptions also imply that 𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔 + ∑∞  𝑖=0 𝜆 𝜖𝑡−𝑖 , which
                                                 (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡        (1+𝑟)2 (1−𝜆)𝑔      (1+𝑟)𝜆𝑔
implies a pricing formula of 𝑃𝑡 =                          +                    + 𝑟(1+𝑟−𝜆)𝑡 .      The ratio of the
                                                   𝑟              𝑟 2 (1+𝑟−𝜆)
standard deviation of price changes to the standard deviation of rent changes is again roughly
similar to the ratio of price-to-rent ratios. The one period autocorrelation of rental shocks is
      𝜆                    𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝜖𝑡𝐷 )
𝜑(1−𝜆2 )+1
          , where 𝜑 =            𝑔

                                       .       The one period auto-covariance of price changes equals
�1−𝜆2 +𝑟�(1+𝑟)2 𝜆
𝑟(1+𝑟−𝜆)2 (1−𝜆2 )
                    𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝜖𝑡𝐺 ) which is distinctly positive. The long-stickiness of growth rates in
fundamentals provides the best chance of hitting high degrees of serial correlation in housing
prices.

We have required the LAPM, so far, to only concern fundamentals, but as with most asset
                                                                                     1
pricing equations, the one period indifference condition 𝑅𝑡 + 1+𝑟 𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 ) = 𝑃𝑡 admits “rational
                           1
bubbles” where 𝑅𝑡 + 1+𝑟 𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 + 𝐵𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑡+1 ) = 𝑃𝑡 + 𝐵𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑡 . The key requirement is that
 1
1+𝑟
      𝐸(𝐵𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑡+1 ) = 𝐵𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑡 . Such a bubble would violate the standard transversality
condition requiring that discounted value of future housing prices to converge to zero as t goes to
infinity. The bubble’s discounted value at all time periods will always equal its value today.



                                                                  7
In their most plausible formulation rational bubbles are stochastic, so for example, the bubble
                                                                                    1+𝑟
will burst in each period with probability v. In this case, the bubble multiplies by 1−𝑣 during
each period that it doesn’t burst. While this formulation is mathematically conceivable, it
requires buyers to expect that with some probability housing will become extraordinarily
expensive within some reasonable probability.     If, for example, a Las Vegas house in 2006
was valued at $300,000 and one-half of that was a rational bubble: the market dropped by over
50 percent after the bust. Moreover, assume that buyers thought that there was a 50 percent
chance that the bubble would burst in each year and that r=.05. If the bubble didn’t burst, the
home would have been worth $465,000 in 2007 (with probably .5), $811,500 in 2008) (with
probably .25) and $1.54 million in 2009 (with probably .125).

Is such price growth remotely plausible and is it compatible with other features of housing
markets? Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz (2008) argue that such price growth is incompatible with
even moderately elastic supply. Presumably, builders in Las Vegas in 2009 would do anything
to build houses that can be sold for such high prices. Moreover, this $1.54 million dollar house
would have to find buyers, at least some of which need down-payments. Would it be possible
for price differences between similar regions to widen so extraordinarily and persist in
expectation? As we will discuss later, we find this rational bubble formulation far more
plausible if it occurs in a setting where lenders are providing borrowers with an under-priced
default option.



What is Special about Housing?

While the LAPM model treats housing essentially as a standard security, this assumption is badly
at odds with reality. Housing is idiosyncratic and traded individually. Search for housing can be
a lengthy process. We now discuss how the salient aspects of the housing market make housing
somewhat different from other securities.

This dispersed, idiosyncratic market means that there is no such thing as the current price of
housing, in the same way as there is a current price of General Electric stock. Moreover, across
the United States, and even across the larger metropolitan areas, the heterogeneity of markets is
enormous. Between 2004 and 2006, FHFA price data show the value of homes in Phoenix
increasing by over 50 percent. In nearby Albuquerque, New Mexico, prices rose only 17
percent over the same time period. In Fort Collins, Colorado, real prices actually fell during
those two years.

Abel and Deitz (2010) visually split American housing markets into four groups based on their
experiences from 2000 to 2008. Many had booms and busts and many avoided both booms and
busts. A smaller number experienced booms without busts, like Casper, Wyoming. Even fewer
areas, most notably Detroit, Michigan, experienced busts without booms. Cyclical activity also

                                                 8
differs substantially across countries, and ideally, housing models could also explain this
heterogeneity. 3

The fragmented housing market may help explain why post-boom drops are so much slower in
housing markets than in other asset classes. The history of the U.S. Stock market is punctuated
by particular days of infamy during which shares tumbled, such as October 24, 1929 (Black
Tuesday), October 19, 1987 (Black Monday) and October 15, 2008. There is no comparable
date in which housing prices plummet. During the last two general housing market slumps, it
took several years for prices to hit bottom.

This slow adjustment process may also reflect transaction costs in housing, which slow sales and
even price adjustments, or the markets’ domination by “amateurs.” Ordinary home buyers and
sellers may have less up-to-date information than professional stock traders. These amateurs
may also suffer more from “loss aversion” (as in Genesove and Mayer, 2001), which makes
sellers unwilling to cut their asking prices even in the face of a market collapse. 4 This loss
aversion might also explain why market volumes drop dramatically during busts. Scheinkman
and Xiong (2003) connect the high levels of trading during financial booms to heterogeneous
beliefs, and that also seems likely to be relevant in housing markets. 5

The market fragmentation of housing also helps explain why housing market “facts” tend to be
cross-sectional as much as time series. For example, the mean reversion of housing prices is
often illustrated by cross-sectional graph, such as Figures 1 and 2, showing the strong correlation
between the degree of price growth during a boom period and the degree of price decline during
the bust. Indeed, the tendencies of local real estate markets towards excess variance, high
frequency momentum and lower frequency mean reversion, show up even controlling for
national market trends.

The localization of markets also explains why housing economists rely on two distinct no
arbitrage conditions to measure “appropriate” housing values. In the temporal user cost model,
the flow benefit of owning a house at time t, plus the discounted value of the home at time t+1,
must equal the cost of buying the house at time t (𝑃𝑡 ) plus other costs such as taxes, effort
involved in maintenance. The alternative, spatial no arbitrage condition is that the cost of living
in Place A must equal the cost of living in Place B plus whatever extra benefits accrue to living
in Place A relative to Place B, as in the Alonso-Muth-Mills model. Both equations are
complicated by idiosyncrasies of mortgage borrowing, risk aversion, and transaction costs, but
they provides useful starting points for thinking about asset prices and real estate bubbles.

  Differential housing supply elasticities across countries may explain some of these differences (Caldera and
Johansson, 2013).

  Hong, Scheinkman and Xiong (2006) also connect bubbles and volume, but their analysis also relies on lock-up
constraints, such as those that faced internet entrepreneurs.

                                                        9
Implementing this simple inter-temporal user-cost formula is challenged by the difficult of
observing most of the key parameters. Prices may be seen the econometrician, but little else can
be directly observed. While the benefit of owning stocks for ordinary stockholders yields only
dividend yields and price appreciation, the primary benefit of owning a home is that you get to
live in the home and that may yield different benefits for different people. Moreover, ownership
carries other costs. Some of these costs are directly observable, like property taxes, while others,
such as the sweat of home care, are not. Limited observability of costs and benefits means that
the no arbitrage condition in housing will always be far less precise than equivalent conditions in
other asset markets.

The most straightforward means of quantifying the benefits of owning is to use rents. If owning
and renting were otherwise identical, then the benefits of owning should be equal to the benefits
of renting. Yet there are three reasons why identifying the flow value of owning housing with
the prevalent rental rates is problematic: the homes aren’t the same, the neighborhoods aren’t the
same and the unobserved costs aren’t the same. Glaeser and Gyourko (2009) document that the
observable differences between rental and owner-occupied structures are enormous: 64 percent
of owner-occupied units are single-family detached as opposed to 18 percent of rental units.
Owner-occupied units are also less likely to be located in central cities and more likely to be in
neighborhoods that are rated as excellent by their residents. Finally, Goodman (2005) uses the
2003 American Time Use Survey and documents the significantly large amounts of time spent
on home and yard maintenance by owners, but it is hard to quantify the costs of that effort. 6

An alternative approach is to eschew rental data as being non-representative, and instead focus
on measuring the benefits of locating in one metropolitan area rather than another following
Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982). Local earnings and amenities are the typical sources of local
benefits, but amenities are difficult to completely capture and the earnings of the marginal
homebuyer are also not directly observed. Finally, since this approach is inherently
comparative, it can only answer whether the fluctuation in price in one area seem reasonable
relative to the fluctuations in price in some other place.

Housing is also different from stocks and bonds because housing is the democratic asset, owned
by over 60 percent of American households. Policies and preferences come together to ensure
that homeownership is dispersed among millions of Americans rather than concentrated in the
hands of professional investors who rent them out. For these households, especially those with
long horizons, housing looks more like a consumption good than a financial asset. Some caution
therefore is needed while applying models typically used with stock market to the housing
market, especially since we are all born short housing. Of course, some parts of the real estate
market—like commercial properties, undeveloped land, and rental residential houses—are
owned by investors calculating discounted future cash flows, and residential housing resembles a
financial asset more in areas with these other types of properties (Nathanson and Zwick, 2014).

The widespread nature of housing ownership also creates policy-related issues relative to
housing booms that are less present with other asset classes. Historically, housing risk was held
by homeowners and by savings institutions. When a boom crashed, millions of ordinary people
were worse off and the banking system was imperiled. The widespread nature of the pain and
the potentially disastrous consequences of a banking system meltdown make serious policy
response far more likely than when there is a bust in some smaller asset class.   Few policy-
makers argued that indebted investors in internet stocks had no obligation to repay their creditors
in 2002, while many advocated against foreclosing on distressed home buyers in 2008.

Short-selling housing is hard and that contributes to the difficulty of arbitraging housing markets.
It was hard for smart money to bet against booms, like Las Vegas in 2005. Short-sales are made
particular difficult because of a lack of asset interchangeability (Nathanson and Zwick, 2014).
Normally, a short is achieved by borrowing an asset from someone else, selling that asset and
then promising to buy it back. Enormous variation in characteristics across houses makes such a
home short sale process almost impossible. Short-selling collateralized debt obligations or Real
Estate Investment Trusts is considerably easier but these assets are quite different than ordinary
homes.

Glaeser and Gyourko (2009) point out that other, even simpler modes of arbitrage, such as
delaying eventual purchases, are difficult to exercise because delaying a sure purchase introduces
large amounts of risk in the portfolio of any average household. The limits of arbitrage in asset
markets typically increase the possibility that prices will deviate from fundamentals (Shleifer and
Vishny, 1997). The extreme limits of arbitrage in housing may make those deviations even
larger.

A final peculiarity of housing markets is that the endogenous supply of new housing is so
obvious that it cannot be ignored, while asset pricing economists routinely treat the supply of
assets as being fixed. America built over nine million new housing units between 2002 and
2006. In 2005 alone, Las Vegas permitted almost 40,000 new housing units and Phoenix
permitted over 60,000. Hall (2003) emphasized that there is also a supply of internet start-ups
which surely should have influenced the willingness to pay for shares of existing companies in
2000, but many models of speculation treat the supply of assets as fixed.

During historic housing booms, price growth has typically been tempered in areas with long-run
elastic supply. Between 1996 and 2006, nominal price growth was three times higher in areas
where housing supply is inelastic than in areas where housing supply is elastic (Glaeser,
Gyourko and Saiz, 2008). Yet many elastic cities experience large price increases as well during
housing booms. For instance, Las Vegas and Phoenix, and cities in Florida and inland
California—places with very elastic housing supply—witnessed many of the largest price
increases in the nation between 2000 and 2006 (Nathanson and Zwick, 2014).




                                                11
In our own research, we have taken different but complementary approaches to explaining these
elastic price booms. 7 Nathanson and Zwick (2014) argue that this phenomenon occurs in areas
where housing supply is elastic today but will become inelastic soon. An example would be a
growing city approaching a long-run development barrier. Investors speculate in the land
markets about what the city will look in the future where new construction is difficult. This
speculation leads to a boom and bust in the housing market, while the undeveloped land
facilitates construction during the boom.

Glaeser (2013) takes a different approach and argues that ignoring the impact of elastic supply is
a pervasive error made by real estate speculators in the U.S. throughout the century. In many of
these episodes, it took time for housing supply to come on line. When speculators don’t realize
supply is adjusting gradually, price booms occur that are followed by busts.

These theories differ in their predictions for what precipitates the bust. According to Nathanson
and Zwick (2014), the bust occurs when optimistic land speculators learn that their rosy beliefs
were incorrect. In Glaeser’s (2013) argument, the bust happens when supply is finally able to
adjust. The recent elastic booms fit the former theory better. Construction was high throughout
the boom in these cities and not just at the end. Furthermore, consumer demand started to
weaken in 2006 (Mian and Sufi, 2010), suggesting that belief revisions about household demand
coincided with the beginning of the bust. Glaeser’s (2013) mechanism better captures some
historic episodes, such as the New York skyscraper boom of the 1920s, where construction was
difficult to supply quickly due to new technologies.

Our theories both depart from standard theories of rationality but in different ways. Glaeser
(2013) assumes that all market participants make the same common error of under-forecasting
future supply. This type of mistake has been suggested in other markets as well (Hoberg and
Phillips, 2010; Greenwood and Hanson, 2013). In many U.S. cities, ignoring new local supply is
largely irrelevant—the number of new homes is sufficiently small, and a general decision to
ignore the supply-side is reasonable. More generally, given that economists believe that
teaching economics has some value added, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that most
Americans are not innately gifted at grasping the workings of supply and demand.

In contrast, Nathanson and Zwick (2014) assume only that a few well-capitalized investors are
very optimistic. This aspect is a feature because it involves a smaller aggregate deviation from
rationality. But it also poses problems, because homeowners must disagree with the optimistic
valuations of houses and buy them anyway. It is certainly possible that homebuyers desperately
wanted to move to Las Vegas in the 2000s at any price and bought housing expecting a capital
loss. Nathanson and Zwick (2014) show that short-selling of homebuilders that held large land
portfolios increased during the boom, consistent with the existence of pessimists. But pessimistic
homebuyers don’t comprise the common way of looking at the housing market.

7
    Gao (2014) and Sockin and Xiong (2014) also study this phenomenon.

       III.    Empirical Regularities of Housing Dynamics


At this point we turn to the empirical regularities of real estate dynamics. In some cases, these
figures are intrinsically interesting, but in many cases, we are interested primarily in whether
these facts are compatible with the simple LAPM or User Cost Model. We are interested
primarily in facts that seem somewhat anomalous, and hence particularly worthy of future
research. We chose t present facts after first discussing the benchmark LAPM or User Cost
model precisely because facts can only be anomalous unless they conflict with the predictions of
a basic model.

We divide this discussion into four sub-categories. First, we discuss excess variance in price
movements relative to fundamentals. Since Shiller (1981) excess variance has been the biggest
puzzle in asset markets more generally and it is also a significant puzzle in housing. We then
discuss short-term momentum and longer term mean reversion of housing. We then turn to facts
about quantities, rather than prices, by which we mean sales, vacancies and the amount of new
construction. Finally, we end with a brief review of the longer history of real estate movements.
This last discussion draws heavily on Glaeser (2013).

Excess Variance

Real estate is subject to fluctuations that are larger than seem to be justified by fundamentals—
just like other asset markets (e.g. Shiller, 1981). If these fluctuations are not caused by
underlying fundamentals, then they fit the popular notion of bubbles—price movements not
caused by fundamentals. But this excess volatility is not uniform across time periods. Housing
can be quite steady for many years, but there are period when housing prices move far more
dramatically in ways that are quite hard to square with fundamentals.

How big is the standard deviation of price changes for metropolitan area housing markets?
Glaeser, Gyourko, Morales and Nathanson (2014) report that the standard deviation of one-year
price changes in the U.S. ranges from $2,000 in the Sunbelt to $13,300 in coastal cities over the
1990-2004 period. Five year price volatility ranges from $5,400 in the Sunbelt to $48,000 in
coastal cities. Using the entire sample of cities for which FHFA data is available, we estimate a
standard deviation of price changes over the 1980-2004 period of slightly under $10,000.

Are these numbers large or small? If they are benchmarked against changing rent values, they
seem slightly large during the early time period. The standard deviation of rent changes using
the REIS data suggests a standard deviation of about $623 of annual rent changes. Thus over the
1980-2004, the standard deviation of price changes is about 16 times higher than the standard
deviation of rent changes. But this difference is not wildly out of line with the price-rent ratio
over the same period so the price variance doesn’t seem all that excessive.

                                               13
The same picture emerges when we compare price changes with the changes predicted by
changes in income. Glaeser et al. (2014) compare price changes with those predicted by
volatility in income, at least as measure by the average income of buyers found using the HMDA
data. The volatility of prices over the 1990-2004 is roughly similar to that predicted by income
volatility. If BEA data on personal income across the entire metropolitan area is used instead of
the income of new buyers alone, then the price volatility does appear to be significantly too high
in coastal metropolitan areas. Head, Lloyd-Ellis and Sun (2014) similarly find variances that are
in line with those predicted by a simple housing model. 8

The real excess variance appears during periods, like that between 2001 and 2010 when prices
temporarily explode (Wheaton and Nechayev, 2008). During this period rents were relatively
constant, and incomes didn’t move much. Yet the standard deviation of price changes is over
$20,000. This is an extraordinary amount of variation across metropolitan areas that doesn’t
appear to be related to any obvious changes in fundamentals. Figure 3 shows the path of rents
and prices in New York and San Francisco, were it is obvious the rents had peaked and were
falling before the housing price boom crested.

As such, the data does not suggest that housing prices display the same ubiquitous excess
variance found in other asset classes. Instead, housing prices experience brief moments of
extreme variance that punctuate longer periods of general stability. For example, the 1991-1996
period was an era of extraordinary price stability across America’s metropolitan areas.
Therefore, the puzzle is not to explain constant price variation, but rather periods when prices
briefly explode and then tumble.



The Shape of a Bubble: Short Run Momentum and Long Run Mean Reversion

For most observers, bubbles mean more than just excess asset price variance. Few people would
describe as a bubble the movements of a price series: 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑃�𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡 , where 𝑃𝑡 it the realized price,
𝑃�𝑡 represents the price based on fundamentals and 𝜇𝑡 reflects idiosyncratic white noise,
independently drawn each day or every week. Such a price series would be manic indeed, but
not sustained, and manic high frequency movements would have little impact on investment and
probably not much on financial systems either.

In the popular influenced by classic descriptions such as Kindleberger (1978), bubbles have a
defined shape. They begin with an early uptick, perhaps representing real good news or a little
bit of early froth. That surge escalates, and during this growth period of the bubble, price growth
escalates and the path of prices is convex. Ultimately, the bubble ends either in a violent crash
on in a slow deflation.
8
  Other approaches find somewhat more excess volatility. Gelain and Lansing (2013) find excess volatility in price-
rent ratios relative to “a simple Lucas-type asset pricing model.” Ambrose, Eichholtz and Lindenthal (2013) find
excess price volatility over a 355 period in the Netherlands relative to fundamentals.

                                                        14
Just like other markets, housing price changes display positive serial correlation at higher one-
year frequencies and mean reversion at lower frequencies like five year periods (Cutler, Poterba
and Summers, 1991, Glaeser, Gyourko, Morales and Nathanson, 2014). In normal periods, this
momentum and mean reversion just seem like the normal course of affairs. During a great
housing price event, such as the period between 2000 and 2012 for the U.S., or the 1980s in
Japan, the momentum and mean reversion define the shape of a bubble.

Over the 1980-2004 period, the one period serial correlation of prices ranges from .75 in coastal
metropolises to .6 in the Sunbelt, when we allow city-specific trends. The raw coefficient when
price prices are regressed on lagged price changes across the entire sample from 1980 to 2012 is
about .63 with or without city-specific trends. Head, Lloyd-Ellis and Sun (2014) report an even
larger coefficient of .75.

These figures are remarkably high relative to the serial correlation of either rent or income
changes. Both of these numbers are approximately .25. In the benchmark dynamic urban
model of Glaeser et al. (2014), that serial correlation in fundamentals implies a price correlation
that is essentially zero. The search model of Head, Lloyd-Ellis and Sun (2014) generates
significant positive serial correlation in price but still far below the serial correlation seen in the
data.

The positive serial correlation in one year price changes is particularly high during booms. Table
1 shows the price correlation when price growth is regressed on lagged price growth year by
year. As Figure 4 also shows, the coefficient is over one at the height of the boom. This
tendency of price growth to spiral is one of the most salient aspects of booms and one of the
most difficult facts to reconcile with simple models of housing price formation.

While housing prices show momentum at high frequencies they mean revert at lower
frequencies. Over five year periods, the correlation of price changes on lagged price changes
ranges from -.24 in the Sunbelt to -.57 in Coastal metropolises. Figures 1 and 2 show the
extremely strong five year mean reversion over the last decade.

This mean reversion is reasonably compatible with rational models, even if the magnitude of
changes during this particular period is not. The dynamic urban model of Glaeser et al. (2014)
essentially predicts mean reverting prices similar to those seen in the data. This price mean
reversion is predicted both by mean reverting income processes and by new construction.



Quantities vs. Prices

There are also significant facts about quantities of housing that dynamic models need to explain.
Quantities both have a purely physical component—the number of houses being produced—and
a market related component – the number of housing on the market at a given point in time.


                                                  15
Housing supply related experts tend to focus on the former numbers. Experts on search and
market dynamics focus on the latter number.

The volatility of construction is significant, especially in the Sunbelt. The standard deviation of
annual permits in Sunbelt metropolitan areas is over 5000 units. In coastal metropolitan areas,
the standard deviation falls to under 2000 units. While these numbers are significant, they do not
appear to be particularly high relatively to the number predicted by reasonable estimates of
housing supply functions and the volatility of local income changes.

Permitting behavior shows remarkable persistence at one year periods as well. The serial
correlation of permits over one year periods is significant over .5. Again, this is compatible with
the predictions of a simple rational model. If the costs of building increase with the amount of
building, then it is sensible for booms to persist over multiple years.

For five year permitting periods there is substantial mean reversion, which appears less
compatible with a rational model. In a sense, this seems to reflect a pattern where periods of
overbuilding are followed by periods of under building. Perhaps this represents an example of
excessive exuberance in construction.

Head et al. (2014) also document that housing sales data shows significant persistence in the
data. This is compatible with their model at one year frequencies, but there is too much sales
persistence in the data, relative to their model, at longer frequencies.

Another particularly important stylized fact is the well-known relationship between sales
volatility and price over the cycle. Markets are extremely active during booms and then dry up
during busts. Some authors have interpreted this as evidence for nominal loss aversion on the
part of sellers (Genesove and Mayer, 2001).



Bubbles in History

Given the rich history of real estate bubbles, it is useful to distinguish between two different
classes of events: real estate fluctuations that are driven partially, at least initially, by new
information coming from outside the real estate market itself and real estate fluctuations that
appear to be driven primarily, sometimes almost exclusively, by events without the local housing
market. Before 1980, real estate movements seem to have been typically associated with major
uncertainty about external events.

The Chicago land boom of the 1830s, used by Shiller (2005) and others as an example of
speculative mania, had a clear origin: the announcement that the state would fund a canal that
would link the Great Lakes system with the Mississippi River system via the Chicago river.
High cotton prices drove the Alabama boom of 1819 and high wheat prices helped justify Iowa
land prices in 1910. In both cases, land buyers would eventually be burned, but price

                                                16
movements have justifications beyond merely the extrapolation of price movements within the
housing market itself. We aren’t suggesting that these buyers were rational or that prices were
themselves justified by fundamentals, but simply that these movements reflected more than
buying based on past price movements.

By contrast, it is harder to see what external event could have motivated many of the price
booms during the 2002-2006 period. The leading candidate is the proliferation of subprime
technologies that expanded credit to low income borrowers. This demand shock is not as clear as
historic ones that involved the founding of cities. But Mian and Sufi (2009) present evidence that
less credit-worthy neighborhoods saw greater price increases during the boom. Investors may
have had uncertainty about the long-run effects on housing demand of this credit expansion
(Nathanson and Zwick, 2014).

Bubbles driven by exuberance about some external event can presumably take on any shape
whatsoever, so long as prices eventually fall. A new announcement may spur an immediately
price jump which persists temporarily and then collapses, or the initial announcement may lead
to ongoing price increases. An internally-drive bubble must, however, display the positive serial
correlation in price growth-- the momentum that has come to almost define housing bubbles.
The price growth itself is the news and the event that generates even more price growth. At the
extreme, this creates the Alpine convex price pattern seen in places like Phoenix during the
boom.

In this view, then all bubbles are defined by large variance of price changes, relative to
fundamentals and eventual mean reversion. Internally-driven bubbles must also display positive
serial correlation of price changes at higher frequencies. High levels of variance, positive serial
correlation of price changes at high frequencies and mean reversion at low frequencies are all
well-known features of housing markets (Cutler, Poterba and Summers, 1991, Glaeser et al,
2014). It is more debatable whether these features reflect the workings of bubbles or changes in
fundamentals such as interest rates.



       IV. Rationalizing the Seemingly Irrational: Search, Heterogeneity and Agency
       Problems in Credit Markets



We now turn to the economic approaches that have been used to help understand housing price
movements that do not seem to be in line with the simple version of the LAPM discussed above.
In this section, we discuss explanations that assume rational buyers. In the next section, we
focus on less rational theories. We split these rational theories into three groups: “search,

Search, Learning and Momentum

We have already emphasized that housing markets were, in reality, highly decentralized markets
with a great deal of heterogeneity. Search is a major feature of this market and there is no way
that buyers or sellers can simply observe the current price of housing. Decentralization
therefore is related to the level of information in the housing market, and those authors who
suggest that features like momentum can represent learning are either implicitly or explicitly
relying on the decentralization of the market. Several authors such as Wheaton (1990) and
Krainer (2001) have shown that search and learning can help explain key features of housing
price dynamics. Han and Strange (this volume) survey the literature on search models in
housing.

We will turn to limited information later, but even with perfect information decentralized
markets, especially when combined with some price stickiness, can lead to staggered price
responses to shocks which can create momentum in realized average prices. In Head, Lloyd-
Ellis and Sun (2013), individuals enter into the housing market and choose whether to search for
a home or just to rent. Some homeowners decide whether to sell or rent their houses. An
increase in local area income causes an influx into the city. This influx causes a conversion of
vacant homes to rental units, because matching renters is far easier than matching owners, and it
also cause a gradual build-up in the number of would-be buyers, not all of whom are
immediately matched with houses to buy.

This build-up of buyers causes market tightness to increase over time. The rising number of
buyers to sellers causes prices to increase even further. Eventually, new construction brings
prices back down. This paper does an admirable job of fitting a number of features of the
housing market, including patterns of sales and vacancies. But most notably it manages to
predict price momentum due to increasingly tight markets because of unmatched buyers.

Yet this model does not really predict bubbles. It predicts that a positive shock might take
several periods to work its way through the system, but not that the price movement might be
many times greater than the price movement implied by fundamentals. As such, this type of
search model seems like can clearly be part of the explanation for the structure of housing
bubbles, especially their price momentum, but not for the bubbles themselves.

Guren (2014) provides an alternative search model that can also generate sticky adjustments to
shocks. Guren (2014) assumes that sellers change their prices only every other period—there is
an ad hoc stickiness in the model. As a result, only one-half of sellers change their prices during
each period and the other half keeps their prices fixed. Sellers who price high, relative to the
market, don’t attract many searchers to their homes. This means that sellers are slow to react to
upward demand shocks, because quick leaps to the equilibrium prices will make it hard to sell


                                                18
the property. The slow equilibration process can lead to momentum, even if there is perfect
information about the state of demand.

There are limitations to the power of this type of argument. First, it is a better argument for
upside momentum than downside momentum. Pricing high leads to slow foot traffic of buyers,
but pricing low does not, which means that there is no real force stopping sellers from adjusting
prices downward quickly. 9 Second, there is nothing in this argument that can lead to excess
volatility, without some outside force such as exogenous beliefs. However, once there is an
external forcing process creating excess volatility, as in Piazzesi and Schneider (2011), then a
decentralized market can exacerbate the impact of that outside force.

In these models, search primarily refers to matching the idiosyncratic features of the house with
the tastes of idiosyncratic buyers, not learning about market fundamentals. Yet it is surely true
that buyers and sellers also gradually learn about market fundamental through the search process.
Even if they observe listed prices before the search process begins, search enables them to assess
unit quality more thoroughly. Time spent on the market also acquaints buyers with actual sales
prices for units that they have observed. This represents a form of learning about the state of the
market.

There is ample evidence of ignorance and learning within housing markets. Clapp, Dolde and
Titiroglu (1995) provide evidence on the existence of various forms of rational learning. Levitt
and Syverson (2008) illustrate that home sellers appear to be somewhat uninformed about the
state of the market. Yet while incorrect beliefs certainly have the power to move markets in
many ways, it is unclear if rational learning can really generate particularly large movements in
housing prices.

Rational learning suggests that buyers have formed some Bayesian estimate of the state of
fundamentals and that estimate changes over time as new evidence trickles into the market.
Generally, rational ignorance leads to less variance, not more, because individuals recognize how
little they know. Shiller’s (1981) variance bounds test essentially lives off this point. Moreover,
standard learning models still won’t have predictable errors, so regular momentum or mean
reversion in beliefs is incompatible with standard Bayesian learning.
                                                                                                       𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 )
To make this point precise, return to the standard user cost argument in which 𝑅𝑡 +                               = 𝑃𝑡 ,
                                                                                                        1+𝑟
and to focus on learning assume that r=0 and 𝑅𝑡 = 0, so in this case, 𝐸𝑡 (𝑃𝑡+1 ) = 𝑃𝑡 . It is
impossible for anything known at time t to regularly predict the updating between t and t+1, so
𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑃𝑡+1 − 𝐸𝑡 (𝑃𝑡+1 ), 𝑃𝑡 − 𝑃𝑡−1 ) must equal zero. This fact implies that highly rational learning
on its own will not help us to understand momentum or mean reversion. Learning by individuals

  Novy-Marx (2009) provides a more symmetric amplification mechanism that operates through bargaining and the
flow of entrants. This stimulating paper treats the flow of buyers as the primitive, rather than rents or the value of
living in the locale. As such it is hard to determine how these results relate to the excess variance that we are
discussing here.

who are rational but ignorant seems unlikely to generate – on its own – any of the three salient
features of price dynamics that we have discussed above.

This claim does not mean to suggest that semi-rational learning, employing rules of thumb (as in
Shiller, 1999) or extrapolating, will not help explain housing price patterns. This seems quite
likely, but we will address these issues later as we turn to less rational models.

Changes in Credit Conditions

Perhaps the most popular “rational” model of housing price changes is that they reflect changing
credit market conditions. Yet the common view that housing crisis was caused by subprime
mortgages and a global lending glut has difficulty making sense of the heterogeneity across the
U.S. Credit markets are national or global, so if easy credit was the cause, then why did
Houston experience almost no boom and bust while the cycle in Las Vegas was particularly
dramatic? These differences are also incompatible with a common, credit-caused demand
shock interacting with heterogeneous supply (Davidoff, 2013). The heterogeneity across
countries is also heard to explain if the boom is solely the result of a massive flood of global
lending.

Certainly, there is considerable evidence that easier credit did induce buying among subprime
households in the years before 2007 (e.g. Mian and Sufi, 2009) and lower interest rates are
generally associated with higher housing prices (e.g. Poterba, 1984). The rise of subprime
lending certainly the boom establishes little about causality because the lending itself may be a
reflection of overoptimistic beliefs which are causing both phenomena. 10 Mian and Sufi’s
(2009) contribution is a tight focus on causal inference which has considerably increased our
confidence that subprime lending boosted prices, yet even in their work, subprime lending seems
to only explain a modest fraction of the rise of housing prices.

Moreover, it is far from clear whether volatile interest rates can create massive housing price
fluctuations in a purely rational model, or at least a model without bubbles. We explore rational
bubbles with overly cheap credit in the next subsection. Here we briefly discuss the impact of
credit market changes in the standard LAPM.
                                                               (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡
One standard version of the LAPM implies that 𝑃𝑡 =                       . , or price equals the 1+r times the
                                                                𝑟−𝑔𝑅
flow value of housing divided by the difference between the interest rate and the growth rate of
fundamentals. This formula would seem to imply an extremely tight relationship between prices
and interest rates, especially in a high growth environment. This formula was used during the
boom to justify extremely high prices.


10
  A similar argument can be made about the correlation between investors buying homes and the boom (e.g.
Haughwout et al., 2011). The investors seem more likely to be a reflection of market enthusiasm than to be an
independent cause of rising prices.

                                                        20
But while this formula is correct in a static interest rate environment, it is not correct in a world
in which interest rates are dynamic. For if interest rates mean revert, then buyers during periods
when interest rates are low should expect to sell when interest rates are higher are vice versa.
Rational expectations about the changing value of interest rates should cause buyers to be less
responsive to changes in interest rates than a naïve application of this formula would suggest.

Unfortunately, dynamic interest rate models do not yield easy closed form solutions for housing
prices, but Glaeser, Gottlieb and Gyourko (2013) simulate rational prices in a world in which
interest rates followed a mean-reverting Cox-Ingersoll-Ross diffusion process. They find that
the implied semi-elasticity of prices with respect to interest rates (the derivative of log prices
with respect to a change in the interest rate) can drop by as much as two-thirds when the mean
reversion of interest rates is taken into account. So while the naïve model predicts a relationship
between interest rates and prices that is large enough to explain much of the price increase
between 2001 and 2006, a forward-looking model cannot. Moreover, the relationship between
interest rates and prices implied by the forward looking model does a better job of fitting the
historical relationship between prices and rates over the long run.

There are at least three other theoretical forces that tend to reduce the connection between
interest rates and housing prices. Elastic supply will tend to reduce any connection between
demand side forces, like credit conditions, and prices. The ability to refinance in the future will
similarly make current conditions less important. Finally, if buyers discount the future using
their own internal discount factor, rather than the market rate of interest, then that market rate of
interest is predicted to have a smaller impact on price.

A final issue is the exactly timing of interest rate changes over the period from 2003 to 2010.
Prices continued to rise despite the slight rise in interest rates after 2004. Prices fell dramatically
despite declining interest rates after 2007. The observed price changes can still be explained as
reflecting changing credit market conditions, since interest rates do not reflect the probability of
actually getting a loan.

We do not mean to suggest that credit conditions are irrelevant in housing markets or in
explaining bubbles, but simply that the relationship is not the simple one suggested by the
LAPM. The LAPM is based on assumptions of rationality yet applying such a static model to a
dynamic interest rate process assumes buyers are myopic, not rational. To provide an
intellectually coherent framework, we must more fully embrace bounded rationality, and we will
turn to that shortly.

Interest rates are only one aspect of credit markets. Mortgage approvals and down payment
requirements may also shape housing price increases, and foreclosures may exacerbate housing
price decreases. The simplest model for understanding why such credit conditions matter is to
assume a variant of the LAPM with individual heterogeneity to allow for a downward sloping
demand curve for housing. In such a model, the value of 𝑅𝑡 differs by consumer and is denoted


                                                  21
                                                                            (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡 (𝑖)
𝑅𝑡 (𝑖), and consumers continue are willing to spend as much as                 𝑟−𝑔𝑅
                                                                                          . The consumers with
the highest valuations will be inframarginal consumers and we assume that there is a distribution
𝐺(𝑅𝑡 ) of these valuations across the set of feasible buyers. If 𝑁𝑆 denotes the number of homes
being sold, and 𝑁𝐷 denotes the number of potential buyers of whom only a fraction 𝜃 can
manage financing, then (1 − 𝐺(𝑅𝑡∗ ))𝜃𝑁𝐷 = 𝑁𝑆 ., where 𝑅𝑡∗ reflects the valuation of the marginal
buyer.

In this model, an increase in the availability of credit, captured by the parameter 𝜃, will act to
                                                                                      (1−𝑟)(1−𝐺(𝑅𝑡∗ ))
increase aggregate demand. The derivative of price with respect to 𝜃 is                   (𝑟−𝑔𝑅 )𝜃𝑔(𝑅𝑡∗ )
                                                                                                            , and the
                                               1−𝐺(𝑅𝑡∗ )
elasticity of price with respect to 𝜃 equals   𝑅𝑡∗ 𝑔(𝑅𝑡∗ )
                                                             , which his exactly the same as the elasticity of
price with respect to the number of potential buyers. In principle, this type of calculation can
justify a robust relationship between approval rates and prices, just as the LAPM seems to justify
a robust relationship between interest rates and prices, but some of the same issues arise. We
are assuming a permanent change in approval rates, but periods of easy credit tend to be
followed by periods of tight credit.

If approval rates rise temporarily, then buyers should expect future approval rates to fall. Buyers
should anticipate this future drop, and this should cause buyers who expect to resell to become
less sensitive to current credit availability. Mean reversion should likewise occur for down
payment requirements and this will also dampen the connection between prices and credit market
conditions. A fully specified dynamic model linking time-varying approval rates to housing
prices has not yet been written but it would be a worthy addition to the literature.

We have implicitly assumed mortgage approval is unrelated to the individual’s valuation of the
house, and that those who are denied credit are a random subsample of the buying population.
That need not be the case. Individuals with financing may be richer and willing to pay more, or
conversely, individuals who were initially denied financing might be particularly eager to buy
housing, perhaps because they are more risk-taking. One way to understand the striking
findings of Mian and Sufi (2009) on the connection between subprime mortgage affordability
increased prices is that more lenient lending made it possible for high risk, but highly optimistic,
buyers to enter the market.

Stein (1995) provides an alternative mechanism through which credit markets influence price
fluctuations. If individuals are largely credit constrained, then a price movement upwards
creates significant capital gains for existing owners which then enables them to purchase even
larger houses. By contrast, a price drop will mean that these buyers are essentially locked into
their existing homes and cannot buy elsewhere (Ferreira, Gyourko and Tracy, 2010). There is a
housing price multiplier because past housing price appreciation is providing the cash to fuel
future housing price purchases.


                                                       22
While this subsection has focused primarily on the credit market causes of the price boom, there
is also a significant literature connecting credit markets with the price bust and the adverse
consequences of that bust. Perhaps the most common idea is that housing busts generate
defaults and defaults then have adverse consequences of the health of the housing market.
Palmer (2013) documents compellingly that the wave of defaults that followed the 2007 bust
were the result of falling prices, not the composition of buyers who received credit immediately
before the bust.

Campbell, Giglio and Pathak (2011) document both that forced sales, such as default, receive
lower prices but that they also seem to lower the prices of nearby homes. Fisher, Lambie-
Hanson and Willen (2013) find that the negative effect of condominium foreclosures on their
neighbors seems localized to the particular address. Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (forthcoming) found
that housing prices dropped more after 2007 in states that made it easier for lenders to foreclose
on housing.

Why would defaults cause housing prices to drop? Guren and McQuade (2013) highlight three
effects: distressed sellers tend to be more impatient and sell for less, buyers will become more
choosy because they have more of a chance of interacting with a distressed seller and
homeowners who default are themselves priced out of the market. Taken altogether, they
estimate that foreclosures may have exacerbated the price decline by as much as fifty percent.

Credit institutions may also impact the consequences of housing market downtowns. Somewhat
obviously, the impact that housing busts have on financial institutions is due primarily to the fact
that these institutions are providing credit for real estate investors, sometimes directly and
sometimes by holding real estate related securities, such as collateralized mortgage obligations.
More subtly, housing prices appear to have a substantial wealth effect and falling housing prices
have led to substantial reductions is consumer spending and associated economic activity (Mian,
Rao and Sufi, 2013).

The compelling work of Mian and Sufi (2014) documents a wealth effect of housing that seems
far stronger than the wealth effect of stock prices. Case, Quigley and Shiller (2005) found a
similar result. One explanation for this phenomenon is that stocks are owned by wealthier
people who are not credit constrained, while homes are owned by people who often are credit
constrained. Relaxing a credit constraint can easily have a far more powerful effect on spending
than making an unconstrained individual wealthier, which may in turn explain why housing
booms and busts appear to exert an outsized influence on the larger economy.

We now turn to rational bubble models in which credit market conditions can engender the
possibility of dramatic price swings.

Agency, Underpriced Default Options and Rational Bubbles



                                                23
We have already discussed the two difficulties facing models of rational bubbles in real estate:
the standard violation of the transversality condition and the less standard problem of predicting
an essentially unbounded supply of new housing. These difficulties become far less severe if
home buyers are charged too little for the possibility of defaulting on their mortgage.

We know more formally model the mortgage process so that buyers initially pay only a fraction
“d” of the purchase price of the house. At the end of the period, they either sell the house and
repay the mortgage or default, and we assume that default carries a cost of “z”, to capture the fact
that many individuals fail to default even when that default would seem to be in their own
interest.

     (1) 𝑅𝑡 = 𝑑𝑃𝑡 − 𝛽𝐸𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑃𝑡+1 − (1 + 𝑟)(1 − 𝑑)𝑃𝑡 , −𝑧),


where 𝑟 is the market discount rate, possible adjusted to address default risk. It is natural to
                          1
assume that 𝛽 ≤ 1+𝑟, since home-buyers presumably always have the ability to earn the market
rate by savings (or by just not borrowing money) but they can’t always borrow freely, and hence
they may value future dollars at a rate above the market rate. To clarify issues, we assume that
there is no uncertainty in 𝑅𝑡 , so in the absence of bubbles, prices will remain fixed so 𝑃 =
           𝑅
𝑑(1−𝛽)+𝛽(1−𝑑)𝑟
                       , which is the flow value divided by a weighted average of effective discount
rates. The weights depend on the extent to which the loans are self financed.

                                                                      𝑑
In this case, a deterministic bubble would satisfy: 𝐵𝑡+1 = �𝛽 + (1 + 𝑟)(1 − 𝑑)� 𝐵𝑡 , which

creates the same challenges involving the transversality condition and infinite housing supply.
While deterministic bubbles don’t seem to be feasible, stochastic bubbles can exist if they lead to
default in negative states of the world. We consider a bubble with a value of 𝐵𝑡 that takes on a
value at t+1 of 𝐵𝑡+1 with probability 1 − 𝜈 and 0 otherwise. We simplify by assuming that
                   𝑅
𝑃𝐹 = 𝑑(1−𝛽)+𝛽(1−𝑑)𝑟 is the fundamental value in all cases so that the price with the bubble equals
𝑃𝐹 + 𝐵𝑡 . We assume further that if the bubble bursts, the homebuyer defaults. The technical
condition for this to be optimal is that𝑃𝐹 (𝑑(1 + 𝑟) − 𝑟) + 𝑧 < 𝐵𝑡 .  The equilibrium
condition for a stochastic bubble is that


               (𝑑+(1−𝑣)𝛽(𝑟−𝑑(1+𝑟))𝑃𝐹 −𝑅+𝜈𝛽𝑧+�𝑑+(1−𝑣)𝛽(1+𝑟)(1−𝑑)�𝐵𝑡
     (2)                               (1−𝑣)𝛽
                                                                     = 𝐵𝑡+1


In the extreme case where 𝑃𝐹 = 𝑅 = 𝑧 = 0, so the bubble alone remains, this converts to
     𝑑+(1−𝑣)(1−𝑑)(1+𝑟)𝛽
𝐵𝑡         (1−𝑣)𝛽
                              = 𝐵𝑡+1. The bubble’s value increases but only if it fails to burst, i.e. with
probability1 − 𝜈, hence the discounted value at time t+j equals 𝐵𝑡 (𝑑 + (1 − 𝑑)(1 − 𝑣)(1 +

                                                        24
𝑟)𝛽)𝑡+𝑗 .    If (1 − 𝑣)(1 + 𝑟)𝛽 = 1, so that the interest rates are set so that the discounted
                                                                            𝐵
                                                                𝑡
expected value of a loan of one dollar is equal to one, then (1−𝑣)𝛽 = 𝐵𝑡+1 or so 𝐵𝑡 = 𝛽 𝑗 𝐸(𝐵𝑡+𝑗 )
bubble maintains its expected value.

The standard transversality condition is that 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑗→∞ 𝛽 𝑗 𝐸�𝐵𝑡+𝑗 � = 0, and so this structure
violates this condition. As the transversality condition holds for the fundamental part of the
housing value, violating the transversality condition implies that people expect that in the long
run, the bubble component alone will determine the home’s value. Diba and Grossman (1988)
argue that such explosive behavior implies that rational bubbles are impossible, especially when
assets can be supplied into the market. Santos and Woodford (1997) similarly suggest that the
conditions that admit bubbles are “fragile.” 11 Influenced by these papers, we also believe that
rational bubbles seem implausible when they imply extraordinarily future high housing values. 12

Bubbles become far more plausible if lender under-price default risk. If interest rates are set too
low, so that 1 > 𝑑 + (1 − 𝑑)(1 − 𝑣)(1 + 𝑟)𝛽 , then lenders aren’t fully compensated for the
threat of default. In this case, the expected value of the bubble decreases over time and the
transversality condition is not violated. Housing prices will rise with the bubble, but the rises
may be less extreme. Still, there is a non-zero probably that housing prices will become
extremely high, and this should predict an enormous supply response.

There are conceivably ways of salvaging the model with endogenous supply. Perhaps, builders
are sufficiently risk averse and it takes enough to build so that anticipating the possibility of a
burst necessarily leads to limited production. This would be most plausible if 𝜈 is high so that
the probability of default is quite high. Still, the fact remains that construction was extremely
high in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Miami during the recent boom, which makes the case for this
type of rational bubble model more difficult to make.

Moreover, since fully priced risk would require the bubble to rise quickly enough to violate the
transversality condition, this finite price bubble requires the underpricing of risk. This
underpricing does seem to be a regular feature of booms, but why does it occur? One
explanation is that lenders are irrational, for some reason, but that violates the spirit of this
section which is to explain real estate bubbles with rational models.

The alternative explanation, which has been offered by many observers, is that there is an agency
problem within the lending sector (Diamond and Rajan, 2009, Green, 2008), perhaps because of
Federal deposit insurance (Demsetz, Saidenberg and Strahan, 1997). In principle, this could
11
   These arguments are different than the alternative view that bubbles cannot exist because they will be arbitraged
away. Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003) make a compelling case that this is unlikely in financial markets and the
power of arbitrage is even weaker in housing.
12
   Kivedal (2013) finds evidence for the existence of a bubble in the housing market between 2000 and 2013, but
concludes that it is more likely to be irrational than rational. Giglio, Maggiori, and Stroebel (2014) reject infinitely-
lived bubbles in the UK and Singapore by comparing very long-run housing rental contracts to infinite ownership
rights..

occur within banks themselves even if those banks have no deposit insurance and hold mortgages
on their own balance sheets, The CEO hires agents to make loans at an appropriate interest rates.
Their compensation is increasing with the number of loans or the average interest rate paid, but
limited liability precludes severe punishment in the state of the world when the bubble bursts.
The result is that agents compete and the market rate of interest charges too little for default risk.
Pavlov and Wachter (2006) argue that if some bankers are under-pricing default risk,
competition may push all bankers to under-price default risk.

The larger debate over agency risk in lending concerns the creation of mortgage-backed
securities. In this version of the hypothesis, mortgage originators have little incentive to screen
for risk because they pass those risks downstream to the eventual security holder who has little
ability to appropriately learn the truth. The presence of mortgage insurers, such as Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, further decreases the incentive to price appropriately for risk. Puranandam
(2011), for example, finds that banks that originated loans primarily to distribute them to
downstream investors generated “excessively poor quality mortgages.” Piskorski, Seru and Vig
(2010) find a link between securitization and default, which Adelino, Gerardi and Willen (2010)
hotly dispute.

Of course, this type of model still raises questions. If the risk comes from a systemic bubble,
rather than idiosyncratic risk, then investors should be able to understand that they are
subsidizing the home buyers. The nature of the rational bubble is that its features are widely
known and homebuyers supposedly understand the risks perfectly. If they understand the risks,
then so should the ultimate investors. Agency problems typically occur when there is local
information that can’t be observed by the principal, but there is nothing local about a system-
wide bubble.

Perhaps the best explanation for why systemic risk might be subsidized is that the government is
bearing the tail risk. If the public sector is bearing the tail risk for political reasons, then this
still could lead to underpriced default risk which encourages the emergence of rational bubbles.
Nonetheless, this theory would still have to explain why private mortgage insurers led the way
into the subprime lending that would be at most risk from a bubble bursting.

A slightly different alternative to this purely qualitative rational bubble model is to use the
options pricing model of Krainer, LeRoy and O (2009) and ask, as in Glaeser (2013), how much
housing prices would increase if borrowers were given a non-priced default option. The model
requires a switch to continuous time, so we must assume that the flow value of the house equals
r(t), where r follows a geometric Brownian motion. The drift is 𝑔𝑅 ; the variance is 𝜎 2 .
Individuals discount at a rate, but pay in interest on their mortgage each period or r times the
outstanding debt or 𝑟(1 − 𝑑)𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒, where 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 refers to the initial purchase price. The
borrowers is only paying the interest on the mortgage. We assume costless default and the
purchase price of the house will then satisfy


                                                 26

                          𝜎2
default option; the second term reflects the value of the house without any possibility of
defaulting. By calibrating the model, Glaeser (2013) estimates of just how much an unpriced
default option could contribute to higher housing prices during historic booms. This approach
assumes that the market rate and the private discount rate are the same and then calculates the
value of the first term in the expression. Typically, this represents less than 17 percent of the
price for more recent price swings, which is surely an overestimate since it assumes that interest
rates incorporated none of the cost of potential default.

This calculation again illustrates that if credit markets are responsible for the extreme volatility
of housing bubbles, then it seems more likely they do so by making conditions ripe for bubbles.
This view suggests that there is not an automatic link between housing prices and easy credit, but
rather that easy credit is a necessary – but not sufficient—cause of extreme price volatility.



       V. A Menagerie of Modest Madness: Bounded Rationality and Housing Markets



We now turn to less than rational models that have also been used to investigate real estate
fluctuation and typically those models involve buyers who hold excessively optimistic beliefs
about future housing price growth. The Case and Shiller surveys of recent buyers suggest that
such beliefs certainly exist. For example, Case and Shiller (2003) reports that buyers in Orange
County, California, in 1988 expected prices to rise by 14.3 percent per year over the next ten
years and in 2003, they expected prices to rise by 13.1 percent annually over the next ten years.
Case, Shiller and Thompson (2012) report that expected price growth over the next ten years
from buyers in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, fell from 10.6 percent in 2004 to 3.1 percent
in 2012.

These striking survey results need a grain of salt, for they are surely muddled by innumeracy and
wishful thinking. Yet, even if the numbers appear excessive, they surely capture an important
reality. Many buyers during booms seem to have expectations that are wildly optimistic and
often at odds with the views of economists and the experience of longer-term price trends.

We begin this section with exogenous belief models, in which individuals for some reason have
beliefs that are unduly optimistic. As models in which beliefs are entirely flexible and
determined outside of the model have the potential to “explain” any housing event, they are not
particularly compelling as theories without some added ingredient. Exogenous belief models are
typically used to illustrate some other point about housing markets, such as the role of search or


                                                        27
endogenous housing supply. The second class of models that we consider are extrapolative
beliefs, and we consider both a naïve version where extrapolation is merely assumed and a more
sophisticated version in which extrapolation emerges out of cognitive limitations. We then turn
to the broad class of models with cognitive limitations that involve shorter time horizons and
simple models of housing price formation. We end with a discussion of social learning.



Exogenous and Heterogeneous Beliefs: Search, Endogenous Housing Supply and Land
Acquisition

The simplest way to get a bubble is just to assume that individuals are unduly optimistic. Since
𝑃𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡 + 𝛽𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 ), we can justify almost any price process imaginable by assuming
differential values for 𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 ). Similarly, if pricing values a growth formula like 𝑃𝑡 =
    𝑅𝑡
             , then exogenous changes in the belief about future rent growth will natural cause
1−(1+𝑔𝑅 )𝛽
fluctuation in the price and anything is possible. Since anything is possible, the exogenous
optimism model on its essentially fails as social science, for it cannot be rejected by the data, and
a model that cannot be rejected cannot be tested. Essentially, in the move from perfect
rationality to exogenous beliefs we have moved from a theory with predictions that are too
narrow to a theory that has predictions that are too broad. If we believe that beliefs are not
perfectly rational, and we want to test that hypothesis, then we must assume a particular structure
for beliefs that can be tested.

While the assumption of exogenous beliefs cannot be tested on its own, it does provide testable
implications when nested in a larger model. Two examples of this structure are Glaeser,
Gyourko and Saiz (2008), and Nathanson and Zwick (2014).       Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz
(2008) assume that bubbles are generated by random increases in buyers’ valuation of homes.
They examine how this exogenous shift in demand interacts with supply.

During a boom, holding the degree of irrational surge constant, please with more inelastic supply
will have greater increases in price and lower increases in quantity. This claim merely makes the
point that the logic of Economics 101 continues to operate even if the demand curve is being
shifted by irrationality. This point follows Becker (1962). After the bubble, the impact of
supply elasticity is ambiguous. If supply is extremely inelastic, then the bubble will have had no
impact on quantity during the boom and hence little impact on prices after the boom is over. This
may reflect the reality of northern California or Massachusetts. In extremely elastic places,
bubbles cause explosions in home building, but the elasticity of housing supply itself mutes the
impact of overbuilding ex post, as long as the area continues to build at all.

Nathanson and Zwick (2014) also explore exogenous belief shifts, but their focus is on
heterogeneity. They assume that individual investors have different prior beliefs about the value
of real estate in a different area. They rule out the possibility that beliefs will converge through a

                                                   28
learning process. Optimists buy up all the land and the rental housing. But owner-occupied
housing stays dispersed among residents of all beliefs because some residents prefer owning over
renting, and they have diminishing marginal utility of housing. Optimistic beliefs influence
house prices most in areas with ample land or rental housing. Prices are less prone to bursts of
extreme optimism in housing markets that only have owner-occupied housing and no
undeveloped land.

This observation explains why many elastic areas, which are those with undeveloped land, have
such large house price booms. Nathanson and Zwick (2014) show that land price increases
capture nearly 100% of the dispersion in house price increases across metro areas. Furthermore,
several U.S. public homebuilders acted like speculators by taking large positions in the land
market between 2001 and 2006, and then suffering large capital losses. Short-selling of
homebuilder stock rose dramatically during this period, providing evidence of pessimists who
disagreed with the homebuilders’ high valuations of land.



Extrapolative Beliefs

Perhaps, the most popular alternative to rationality in housing markets (and perhaps finance as
well) is extrapolation, occasionally called momentum trading, or backwards looking investors.
Clapp and Tirtiroglu (1994) is an early example of this assumption in housing economics. In the
real estate context, Glaeser (2013) refers to extrapolators as Gordonians because of their blind
use of the Gordon growth formula. The principle is simply that investors use a formula like
       (1+𝑟)𝑅𝑡
𝑃𝑡 =             , and they use the recent growth rate in past prices to infer the growth rate in
        𝑟−𝑔𝑅
fundamentals. There are two ways of generating this type of behavior. One option is to assume
that these erroneous beliefs arrive exogenously in a small share of the population. A second
option is to derive these beliefs as the result of primitives.

The choice between these two options is somewhat connection to the decision about whether to
assume that the extrapolative bias is ubiquitous or particular to a few odd eggs. Finance has a
tradition going back to DeLong, Shleifer, Summers and Waldman (1990) of assuming that
irrationality is limited to a small share of the market and then what impact this irrationality
would have on market-wide prices. The appeal of this approach is that irrationality can be
assumed for only a few, preserving the possibility that most of us are rational.

Barberis, Greenwood, Jin and Shleifer (2013) document how a small number of extrapolative
buyers can move prices in financial markets. Piazzesi and Schneider (2009) provide an elegant
example of this tradition transplanted into housing markets, which makes the point that if there is
only a modest share of the stock renters with extrapolative beliefs that small share of the stock
can become a large share of the flow of new home purchases, since the flow of purchases is only
a small share of the stock.

                                                      29
Guren (2014) follows a similar tack of examining the impact of a minority of backward looking
investors (i.e. extrapolators) in his model of search and slightly sticky prices. He finds that his
model also exacerbates the power of a small amount of irrationality, allowing it to propagate
throughout the system. In particular, small numbers of extrapolators create significant positive
serial correlation in housing prices.

While Piazzesi and Scheider (2009) do persuasively show that a small number of optimistic
buyers can make a boom, we think that 2002-2006 boom is best seen as a far more widespread
burst of optimism. We agree that boom-level prices may not have reflected the majority opinion,
and surely did not reflect the views of a sizable minority of housing market skeptics. Yet
millions of Americans thought that these high prices made enough sense to purchase houses.
Perhaps these homebuyers were extrapolating recent price increases, or perhaps they were
passive and not evaluating house prices carefully because of long horizons. The available survey
data (Case, Shiller, and Thompson, 2012) suggests that optimistic beliefs were ubiquitous among
buyers during the boom period, although that comes with the usual caveats on survey data.

A moderate deviation from strict rationality can either take the form of large deviations from
rationality for a small number of people or small deviations from rationality for much larger
groups. While some economists may be comfortable just assuming that large numbers of home
buyers follow ad hoc extrapolative beliefs, we prefer assuming smaller deviations from
rationality since these deviations must apply to such a large number of home buyers.

One means of micro-founding extrapolative beliefs is to assume that investors are unsure about
the growth rate in the fundamental. We illustrate our point with a spectacularly simple model in
which 𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡−1 + 𝑔𝑅 . The correct pricing formula that satisfies 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡 + 𝛽𝑃𝑡+1. The correct
                              𝑅𝑡     𝛽𝐸𝑡 (𝑔𝑅 )
pricing formula is that 𝑃𝑡 = 1−𝛽 +   (1−𝛽)2
                                              .

What will a rational individual infer from a change in prices? Presumably the price change
reflects both the change in 𝑅𝑡 and the change in 𝐸𝑡 (𝑔𝑅 ). We can assume that the price at time 0
               𝑅 0
reflected only 1−𝛽 , because there was no information about the growth rate. At time t+1, a new
set of buyers emerged who observed the value of 𝑅1 and observed past prices which in turn
                                                                         𝑅 1     𝛽(𝑅1 −𝑅0 )
enabled them to uncovered the value of 𝑔𝑅 .       The new price would be 1−𝛽 +    (1−𝛽)2
                                                                                           , reflecting
both the change in the level of demand and the change in the assessment of the growth rate.

Now consider the price at time t+2. If these buyers were sophisticated, they would look at
prices at time zero and time one, and correctly infer both the current level of demand and the
growth rate 𝑔𝑅 which equals (1 − 𝛽)2 (𝑃1 − 𝑃0 ). The correct pricing formula would be
      𝑅2
𝑃2 = 1−𝛽 + 𝛽(𝑃1 − 𝑃0 ) = 𝑃1 + (1 − 𝛽)(𝑃1 − 𝑃0 ).         There would be momentum, but only
because there is a persistent growth rate. The prices would not be growing up any faster than
that fixed growth rate.

                                                   30
However, assume that these buyers were less sophisticated and they thought that the change in
prices only reflected a change in the level of demand. They inferred the growth rate from the
change in past prices, assuming that past price changes do not reflect any change in beliefs about
past growth rates. In essence, these buyers are cursed in the phrase of Eyster and Rabin (2005),
which means that individuals mistakenly believe that “other player’s actions depend less on their
types than they actually do.”

Eyster and Rabin’s (2005) idea is that it is difficult to fully infer the motives of others, and as a
result we don’t always make sense of market outcomes. For example, to avoid the winner’s
curse, bidders must understand that if others bid less, then they must have worse signals about
the value of the good being sold. Individuals will take bets when they shouldn’t, because they
don’t recognize that an individual who offers to bet with them is implicitly signaling some
private information.

In housing markets, a failure to understand past sales behavior may mean that buyers don’t
recognize that past price increases already reflect expectations about future price increases. We
                                                                                     𝑅1 −𝑅0
formalize this idea by assuming that individuals at time t, believe that 𝑃1 − 𝑃0 =            instead
                                                                                      1−𝛽
   𝑅 −𝑅
     1  0
of (1−𝛽)2 . This is essentially what happens when individuals plug past price growth in the

                                                                                         2    𝑅
standard capitalization formula. Their willingness to pay in period 2 then equals 𝑃2 = 1−𝛽 +
𝛽(𝑃1 −𝑃0 )                    𝛽2
  1−𝛽
             = 𝑃1 + �1 − 𝛽 + 1−𝛽� (𝑃1 − 𝑃0 ).   The level of momentum has increased, perhaps
dramatically, because the growth rate is being inferred from the change in prices, which
themselves already included changing expectations about the growth rate.

Glaeser and Nathanson (2014) are developing a more sophisticated version of this approach in
which growth rates are stochastic, and past prices are informative about the current rate of
fundamental growth. The critical weakness again that delivers extrapolation, and hence positive
serial correlation, is that homebuyers believe that past price movements reflect changes in
fundamentals rather than changes in beliefs about the growth rate.



Cognitive Limitations: Natural Expectations, Spatial Benchmarking and Rule of Thumb
Spending

That particular model is part of a general class of models of cognitive limitations many of which
have the potential to add to our understanding of real estate fluctuations. Shiller (1999) reviews
many of the standard behavioral tics which may influence housing markets. The intellectual
challenge is that there are so many potential, plausible cognitive limitations that it is hard to
naturally focus on any particular one. We will discuss several types of cognitive limitation here,



                                                 31
and the extrapolation discussed above can also be seen as one example of cognitive limitation:
the inability to think through how other people think.

Fuster, Laibson and Mendel (2010) offer one particular form of cognitive limitation that they
title natural expectations. Natural expectations models require agents to make predictions using
only an excessively parsimonious model. For example, if the true 𝑅𝑡 process was described as
𝑅𝑡 − 𝑅𝑡−1 = Β1 (𝑅𝑡−1 − 𝑅𝑡−2 ) − Β2 (𝑅𝑡−2 − 𝑅𝑡−3 ) + 𝜖𝑡 , then the agents might attempt to
estimate the regression by fitting only 𝑅𝑡 − 𝑅𝑡−1 = Β �1 (𝑅𝑡−1 − 𝑅𝑡−2 ) + 𝜖𝑡 . This obviously has
the capacity to create mistakes, but does it naturally generate excess volatility or strong one
period price momentum.
                                                   1
Applying the usual pricing formula (𝑃𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡 + 1+𝑟 𝐸(𝑃𝑡+1 )) implies that homebuyers with
                                                (1+𝑟)3 𝑅𝑡 −(1+𝑟)�(1+𝑟)Β1 −𝑟Β2 �𝑅𝑡−1 −(1+𝑟)2 Β2 𝑅𝑡−2
rational expectations would be willing to pay                𝑟(1+𝑟)(1+𝑟−Β1 )−𝑟Β2
                                                                                                      .
                                                          (1+𝑟)2 𝑅𝑡 −(1+𝑟)Β
                                                                          � 1 𝑅𝑡−1
Homebuyers with natural expectations would set 𝑃𝑡 =                   �1)
                                                                                 .
                                                                𝑟(1+𝑟−Β




In Table 2, we simulate the impact of these beliefs assuming that Β1 = Β    �1 = .9, Β2 = .8 and that
Β1 = Β �1 = .5 Β2 = .3. The interest rate is .04 and the standard deviation of the shock is $1,000.
We do not believe that these parameter choices are realistic. They are instead chosen to
illustrate what is necessary for natural expectations to deliver high degrees of momentum and
excess volatility. The medium persistence case still has considerable more momentum than
either income or rents. In that case, the volatility is slightly increase by moving from rational to
natural expectations. There is considerably more mean reversion with natural expectations,
because the buyers do not realize that positive shocks today will lead to negative shocks in two
periods. However, this does not generate significant price momentum. Since even the natural
expectations agents recognize that a shock today will become a shock tomorrow, this positive
effect is built immediately into prices and this means that there is little extra momentum created
by this cognitive limitation.

In the truly extreme case of massive short run persistence and massive medium run mean
reversion, we do indeed get momentum in prices with natural expectations, but not with rational
expectation. The rational expectations understand that a positive shock today will be offset soon
and as a result price move far less. The natural expectations agents have much more severe price
movements and significant momentum. This momentum turns into mean reversion when the
true nature of the process inserts itself. Of course, these natural expectations agents are making
mistakes on a massive scale with some degree of regularity, which may be difficult for many
economists to accept. We find this exercise interesting, but believe that the assumptions needed
for natural expectations to fit the housing price data are just too extreme.



                                                 32
One particularly important use of natural expectations, however, is that they may explain why
homebuyers so often appear to miss the power of supply to bring prices back down to earth. If it
always takes time to build new housing units, then making predictions based on short time
periods will always mean missing the power of supply. This will mean that natural expectations
will typically lead to a demand-side analysis only and lead buyers to fail to predict that supply
will eventually cause prices to converge.

To illustrate this point, we assume that 𝑅𝑡 = 𝜃𝑡 − 𝛼𝑁𝑡 , where 𝜃𝑡 is the exogenous demand shock
and 𝑁𝑡 reflects the supply of new housing. We assume that 𝜃𝑡+1 − 𝜃𝑡 = 𝛿 + 𝜌(𝜃𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡−1 −
𝛿) + 𝜀𝑡+1 , so the true process is indeed a one period moving average. We allow a two period
production process 𝐸𝑡 (𝑃𝑡+2 ) = 𝑐0 + 𝑐1 𝐼𝑡+1 and 𝑁𝑡+1 = 𝑁𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 . This means that the production
decision that determines the stock at t+2 is made with the information available as of time t.

We consider three possibilities. First, it is possible that both the home buyers and the home
builders are completely rational. This is the case shown in the first column of Table 3. In this
case there is modest volatility, significant mean reversion and little price momentum. Buyers
anticipate all the future changes, but it remains true that new building causes initial shocks to
disappear over time.

In all cases, we allow the homeowners to correctly understand the dynamics of demand, but not
to fully understand the dynamics of supply. In both of our semi-rational cases, we assume that
home buyers believe that supply is fixed. In columns (2) and (3), buyers believe that supply is
fixed at the current rate of supply. In columns (4) and (5), buyers believe that supply will be
fixed at the level supplied next period. We also have two possibilities for the degree of
rationality about home builders. In columns (2) and (4), home builders choose 𝐼𝑡+1 assuming
that 𝐼𝑡+1 = 𝐼𝑡+2 . In columns (3) and (5), builders are completely rational.

In all cases, these near rational assumptions fail to deliver any price momentum. The failure to
anticipate supply responses just does not deliver a reason for price growth to follow price
growth. There is momentum in the demand fundamentals, but the natural expectations buyers
build that into their period t prices. However, the buyers limited ability to anticipate supply
does exacerbate price volatility and price mean reversion. The price volatility is higher because
they do not anticipate the fact that rents will be declining over time as new supply enters into the
market. Mean reversion is higher because price rise more initially, but then come back down to
earth quickly.

Somewhat surprisingly to us, this semi-rationality reduces the volatility of construction changes.
As prices move around a great deal, construction moves less. A second less studied form of
cognitive limitation is spatial benchmarking. This rule of thumb takes the spatial equilibrium
logic of the Alonso-Muth-Mills model and the Rosen-Roback model and applies it to prices,
rather than rents. This type of logic was used historically to convince investors in the wisdom of



                                                 33
Los Angeles real estate prices during the boom of the 1880s, and it is compatible with the
Ferreira and Gyourko (2012) evidence on the spatial spread of the boom during the last decade.

This logic will be particularly problematic if there are supply differences that differ across areas.
To consider an extreme example, assume that in city A (Los Angeles) the supply is fixed, and
𝑅𝑡+𝑗 = 𝑒 𝑔𝑗 𝑅𝑡 so the benefits are deterministically growing. Applying the pricing formula
       ∞                                                                                  𝑅
𝑃𝑡 = ∫𝑗=0 𝑒 −𝑟𝑗 𝑅𝑡+𝑗 𝑑𝑗. implies that prices in city A should equal 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑟−𝑔
                                                                           𝑡
                                                                             .

Assume that at a point in time city B yields benefits 𝑅𝑡 − 𝛿. Naïve spatial extrapolation would
                                                            𝑅𝑡 −𝛿
then imply that the price in city B should equal             𝑟−𝑔
                                                                    and this would indeed be rational if prices in
city B were also increasing at the rate g. One reason why the formula might be radically wrong
is that the growth rates differ in the two areas. In that case, static comparisons lead to incorrect
pricing.

The error could instead by endogenous, even if growth rates were similar as long as supply
conditions were different. To illustrate this case, assume that 𝑅𝑡 is fixed at 𝑅𝐴 in city A and that
                                                                       𝑅𝐴
there is no new supply, and as such prices should equal                     . In city B, supply is flexible and
                                                                        𝑟
𝑅𝑡 = 𝜃𝐵 − 𝛼𝑁𝑡 . At time zero, 𝜃𝐵 − 𝛼𝑁0 = 𝑅𝐴 so initially the two places yield comparable
returns. We assume a supply curve so that cost equal 𝑐0 + 𝑐1 𝑁̇ which must also equal the price.
                                                                   𝐴                𝑅
To ensure that there is always some construction, we assume that 1−𝛽 > 𝑐0 .

                                                                  𝜃 −𝛼𝑁                             𝑟(𝑟+𝑐1 )
The rational pricing and growth equations in city B satisfy 𝑁̇ = � 𝐵 𝑟 0 − 𝑐0 � 𝑐                                 𝑒 −𝑐1 𝑡 ,
                                                                                                   1 𝑟(𝑟+𝑐1 )+𝛼

                𝑟              1 𝑟(𝑟+𝑐1 )+𝛼
differ because of excess supply and initially prices should reflect this expected convergence.

If individuals in City B persist in using the pricing formula that is appropriate for city A, so that
             𝜃 −𝛼𝑁𝑡              1 𝜃 −𝛼𝑁𝑡
prices equal 𝐵       , then 𝑁̇ = � 𝐵        − 𝑐0 �, which will initially be larger than under rational
                    𝑟                   𝑐1       𝑟
pricing. This will lead to overbuilding in the short run, and eventually prices that will lie below
their level under rational pricing.

A third way in which prices may diverge from rationality is that buyers follow other prescribed
rules of thumb. Some options that have been discussed are always spending as much as they can
afford, given current interest rates. If the marginal homebuyer has an income of Y dollars, and
is able to get a no down payment mortgage, then the maximum willingness to pay is some fixed
fraction times Y divided by the interest rate. This rule of thumb suggests a high elasticity of
price with respect to interest rates, but one that is no different than in the standard model. It also
suggests that the price of housing will be decoupled from the benefits of housing, which does run
counter to centuries of economic thinking. Money illusion can also contribute to “housing


                                                            34
frenzies” if buyers overestimate the future costs of real interest payments when inflation is high,
and will then bid more for housing as inflation drops (Brunnermeier and Juilliard, 2008).

One added possibility is that individuals hop from one type of belief formation to another. For
example, they may sometimes be rational but become adaptive during periods of sustained
growth. Alternatively, they may just ignore future price appreciation much of the time during
periods when such appreciation seems unlikely or is just salient. During those periods, prices
track rents, but if an event makes the prospect housing price appreciation salient, then buyers
start making potentially biased forecasts about future housing price growth.



Social Learning and the Entrepreneurs of Error

The previous section focused on learning from past prices movements, but there are many other
influences that shape individuals beliefs about housing prices. Perhaps the most pervasive and
important source of information that humans rely upon are the statements of people around us.
Most of the time these social influences are relatively benign, but in some cases, these influences
may reflect private motives at odds with the individuals’ own best motives.

The early literature on manias emphasized the rational causes of imitation. Froot, Scharftein
and Stein (1992), for example, emphasized the strong incentives of investors with short horizons
to focus on the same sources of information. Bikchandani, Hirschleifer and Welch (1998) and
Banerjee (1992) both present models of information cascades, where individuals rationally
imitate one another. DeCoster and Strange (2012) apply this logic to developers, who imitate
one another because they assume that their peers have made their decisions based on valuable
information about the state of the world. The result can be a glut of overbuilding.

These forces will only become more powerful if the urge to imitate exceeds the purely rational.
One natural version of this is to again assume a type of “Cursed” behavior, where individuals
underestimate the social causes of the behavior of others. In this case, each new buyer infers
that the mass of preceding buyers is acting on private information, rather than just following the
leader. In this case, each new buyer believes that the actions of the herd contain an extraordinary
rich amount of information, whereas in reality, the mob might just be following the leader of a
single person. This type of incorrect inference will tend to make herd behavior extreme powerful
and manias extremely common.

While DeCoster and Strange emphasize builders’ decisions, this same logic could relate to
buying homes in a particular locale, such as Las Vegas in 2005. According to this view, the
large numbers of Las Vegas buyers provides evidence to new buyers that Las Vegas is an
excellent investment. This logic then encourages an even larger rush of buyers.




                                                35
The literature has expanded beyond imitating actions to following advice. One notable paper in
this genre is Hong, Scheinkman and Xiong (2008), which argues that interested advisors may
play an important role in encouraging the role of bubbles. According to this view, there are
individuals who have an interest in selling stock or real estate. These advisors provide
misleading information to buyers who then act on these incorrect messages. Real estate agents
do have the motive to encourage buyers to bid and are typically given plenty of time in which to
make that case.

Naturally, these models assume a degree of irrationality—individuals still listen to advisors who
are patently self-interested. Yet this attention to the opinions of others may itself be an entirely
sensible rule of thumb. Most of the time, advice is given disinterestedly (i.e. one’s spouse or
mother advises that you wear a coat because it is raining) and it is best not to waste too much
effort trying to understand the motives behind the advice. Perhaps, we follow the advice that we
are given because that is a relatively sensible strategy most of the time.

We are not ruling out any number of possible models with cognitive limitations, but this research
agenda is sufficiently early that we suspect that concentrating on a small number of alternatives
to complete rationality is sensible. We suspect that there is an agenda around extrapolative
beliefs involving theoretical research, normal empirics and lab work that will be highly
productive. A better understanding of why the implications of elastic supply seem to be so
often ignored also seems relevant. Finally, for exploring some elements of housing institutions
or policies, it will remain sensible to take the easy if hard to defend approach of just assuming
exogenous beliefs.



   VI.     Public Policy and Bubbles



Real estate bubbles relate to public policy both positively and normatively. On the positive side,
many observers have argued that government policies, including the low interest rates, the
Community Reinvestment Act and support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, caused the bubble
and its bust (e.g. Wallison, 2009). We have already argued that it is hard to see any simple
connection between easy credit and the housing bubble, which leads us to be cautious about
accepting the view that such policies obviously caused the boom. It remains, of course, possible
that these policies exacerbated the bubble and its financial implications, but it seems hard to
blame the government for the fluctuation. Moreover, the history of real estate bubbles suggests
that they have often occurred when government intervention is minimal (Glaeser, 2013).

We turn to the normative, public policy implications of housing bubbles, for different parts of the
public sector. Most obviously, macroeconomic institutions, such as the Federal Reserve Board,
debate whether to engage in policies explicitly aimed at reducing the volatility of asset bubbles,

                                                 36
including real estate bubbles. Bank and credit regulators have oversight over institutions that are
deeply impacted by real estate fluctuations. How does the existence of real estate bubbles
impact optimal banking regulations? The federal government engages in a series of housing
market policies, including the home mortgage interest deduction. Should these policies be
changed in light of recent real estate volatility? Finally, local land use regulations are largely
responsible for shaping housing supply. These regulations also interact with housing bubbles
(Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz, 2008).

We have no intention of resolving these policies issues now, but we note them primarily as
enduringly important topics. The Federal Reserve Board has historically abstained from taking
steps to deflate asset bubbles. For example, in 2005, Janet Yellen articulated the current
orthodoxy that monetary policy should not be used to deflate a housing bubble. She asked “if the
bubble were to deflate on its own, would the effect on the economy be exceedingly large” and
refuted that claim. More importantly, she argued that monetary policy is not “the best tool to
use to deflate a house-price bubble.”

History has not been kind to her first argument against intervention. The real estate bust did
have widespread adverse consequences and the threat of future housing busts seems quite real.
To be fair, many housing economists (including at least one of us) were at least as mistaken as
she was. Still, after learning the Great Recession, future policy-makers should never be so
confident that a housing downturn won’t have serious consequences.

But what awareness of the risks means for macroeconomic policy-making is far less clear.
Yellen’s point that monetary policy is not a good way to “deflate a house-price bubble” is just as
tenable today as it was in 2005. Moreover, since housing price booms can reflect real forces, as
well as bubbles, it may be foolish to constantly attempt to run counter to rising prices. The
policy conclusion is uncertain, but that provides a far clear implication that more research is
needed on macroeconomic stabilization policy when real estate volatility is large.

The volatility of real estate prices also impacts financial market regulation. The Lehman
Brothers bankruptcy was closely connected with its exposure to real estate related subprime
mortgage risk. Indeed, the securitization of mortgages has been blamed both for helping to
create the bubble but also for ensuring that the pain of the downturn is more widely experienced.
Yet the spreading of that risk may have reduced the adverse consequences of the bubble for the
banking system itself, since fewer mortgages were being held directly on the books of lending
institutions.

The obvious implication of centuries of real estate booms and busts is that real estate is not a
riskless asset. Regular mean reversion means that high prices today may well mean low prices
tomorrow. Presumably, these facts should inform banking regulation if the goal of such
regulation is to reduce the risk of financial distress within the sector.



                                                37
One suggested reform is that regulators should anticipate mean reversion when assessing asset
values for capital requirements. If prices have risen by 75 percent over the past five years, then
historical experience suggests that a 25 percent drop over the next five years is not unreasonable.
One proposal is to value real estate related capital based on its future expected value.

Yet there are many reasons to be cautious about changes of this kind. Real estate is not the only
asset that displays mean reversion (Cutler, Poterba and Summers, 1991), but if real estate is the
only asset that is subject to such treatment then this may distort the movement of capital.
Whatever formula is used to assess long run value will surely be subject to gaming by lending
institutions and political influence by policy-makers seeking their own pet objectives. Again,
the only conclusion that can be definitively drawn now is the need for further investigation.

The Federal government has explicit policies that promote homeownership typically by
subsidizing lending. The home mortgage interest deduction implicitly subsidizes home
borrowing. While borrowing for business investments may also be deductible, typically the
returns to those investments are taxed. By contrast, the government does not tax the implicit
rental income earned by a homeowner. The government sponsored enterprises, Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae, as well as the Federal Housing Administration, have also all encouraged home
borrowing by providing a guarantee against default.

The presence of real estate bubbles matters deeply for the wisdom of encouraging leveraged bets
on real estate through public policy. If real estate was a safe, boring asset that rarely
experienced major fluctuations, then encouraging home owning could be seen as a safe means of
encouraging asset accumulation. However, high levels of volatility mean that government
policies that support leveraged borrowing can have the unfortunate impact of creating a class of
homeowners who are massively indebted because they borrowed to buy housing that has lost its
value.

To a certain extent, this downside risk is offset by the fact that the cost of living for these
homeowners has dropped. Owning itself is something of a hedge since we are all born short
housing (Sinai and Souleles, 2007). Yet there is also a covariance between local housing prices
and local labor markets which helps explain why the downturn was associated with so many
foreclosures. Those foreclosures provide a tangible example of the risks associated with
encouraging leveraged real estate investments particularly for lower income Americans.

The supporters of pro-home borrowing policies will often point out the large shore of housing in
the portfolios of many Americans, as if this proves that subsidizing homeownership is the natural
path towards encouraging asset accumulation. Yet since many of these policies make it easier
to borrow with low down payments, they also reduce the incentive to save before buying. There
is a severe need for a more serious literature about the portfolio implications for ordinary
Americans of encouraging home borrowing, especially in light of significant house value
volatility.


                                                38
The final relevant policy area relating to real estate bubbles concerns the land use policies of
local government. Housing supply is determined, at least in part, by regulations at the local
level. Housing supply then in turn influences the nature and duration of real estate bubbles. The
first order correlation is that these events do appear to be more extreme in more restricted areas,
both in places that currently cannot build (Glaeser, Gyourko and Saiz, 2008) and in places where
investors anticipate future regulatory constraints that make supply difficult (Nathanson and
Zwick, 2014).

Does it therefore follow that in a world with real estate bubbles it is even more valuable to
reduce the barriers to new building? Not necessarily. Even if we were confident that fewer
restrictions on building might make bubbles less common or less extreme, we could not conclude
that reducing land use restrictions would reduce the social costs of bubbles. For one of those
costs is overbuilding and overbuilding will be more severe in places where land use is more
restricted. It seems doubtful, for example, that the price boom between 2001 and 2006 caused
any serious over-building in San Francisco or the suburbs of Boston, because so little new
housing was built and prices remained significantly above construction costs even after the bust.
There restrictions may have caused price swings to be more severe but they also limited the
hangover from excess building supply. The social cost of overbuilding will be most severe in
areas in which supply is elastic and bubbles still occur.

Overall, this policy section has provided no clear policy directives and that is precisely the point.
The policy implications of real estate bubbles are far from clear. Economists have not spent all
that much time researching this issue, partially because of our unwillingness to accept the
existence of bubbles. Yet the hair-raising events of 2000-2012 make it plain that real estate can
experience enormous convulsions, whether we choose to use the word “bubble” or not. Surely,
economists must press on to deliver a better apparatus for understanding the consequences of
different housing and banking policies in a world where real estate can be very volatile.



   VII.    Conclusion


This paper has argued that real estate experiences impressive booms and busts, which can
reasonably be referred to as bubbles. Generally prices moves too much to be fully explained by
changes in either rents or observable fundamentals. Housing prices display substantial
momentum at high frequencies, and they mean revert at lower frequencies. These general
features were greatly exacerbated during the great boom and bust of the 2000 to 2012 period.
Moreover, real estate convulsions have appeared regularly throughout U.S. and world history
often with dire consequences.

The economics of real estate bubbles is still in its infancy, for until 2005, the dominant economic
view was that such bubbles do not exist. This orthodoxy paralleled the general assumption in

                                                 39
financial economics, at least until the dot com bust of 2000. It seems silly now to believe that
housing price changes are orderly and driven entirely by obvious changes in fundamentals
operating through a standard model.

Moving ahead there are two broad classes of models that have and will continue to shed light on
these great housing convulsions. The first class essentially attempts to explain these housing
market features with essentially rational actors. We have discussed two variants of these models.
First, several papers examine housing dynamics through the lens of a search model. These
models can generate substantially more momentum than standard models, because it takes time
for shocks to work their way through the system. To date, these models generally do not
deliver large amounts of excess volatility, just momentum and mean reversion, but those are
themselves significant contributions and it remains possible that future models of learning and
search will also generate significant excess volatility, although there are reasons to doubt that
this will occur.

A second form of rational model stresses that if agency problems lead to interest rates that charge
too little for default risk then rational bubbles can occur without violating any transversality
conditions.       These models still tend to predict that prices will become enormously high with
positive probability. This implication is difficult to square with elastic housing supply, which
suggests that these events are far more plausible in highly constrained areas. These rational
bubble models do not imply that cheap credit will always cause a real estate bubble, but they do
suggest that cheap credit is a necessary condition.

The second class of models drops the assumption of perfect rationality. We have discussed
several different types of these models, including models in which beliefs were just assumed to
be fixed and heterogeneous. While that assumption is useful for highlighting cross-sectional
aspects of the housing markets, we suspect that productive veins of behavioral real estate
research going forward will focus on extrapolative beliefs and simple forms of limited cognition.
We sketched a path towards grounding extrapolation as the result of cognitive limitations of the
form discussed by Eyster and Rabin (2005). It also seems possible that cognitive limitations
may lie behind buyers’ apparent tendency to repeatedly ignore the power of housing supply to
determine prices.

Understanding the causes of real estate bubbles seems particularly critical, because these events
clearly have large social consequences. We cannot plausibly hope that these asset price
fluctuations will vanish, but it is at least possible that we can reduce their costs through better
public policy-making. Unfortunately, we are still far from having enough knowledge to
confidently recommend any particular policy actions.
