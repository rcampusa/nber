           Taxation and the Stock 1arket Valuation of Capital Gains
                 and Dividends: Theory and Empirical Results



                                      1BSTRACT



             Dividends seem to be more heavily taxed than capital gains. Why

then do corporations pay dividends rather than repurchasing shares or re-

taining earnings? Either corporations are not acting in the interests of

shareholders, or else shareholders desire dividends sufficiently for nontax

reasons to offset the tax effect.

             In this paper, we measure the relative valuation of dividends and

capital gains in the stock market, using a variant of the capital asset

pricing model. We find that dividends are not valued differently system-

atically from capital gains. This finding is consistent with share price

maximization    by firms but inconsistent with the fact that most shareholders
pay   a   heavier tax on dividends.

            We also show that the relative value of dividends provides an

indirect measure of a marginal Tobin's q. The measured value of dividends

relative to capital gains tends to be higher during prosperous periods, as

is consistent with this interpretation. We hope that this time series on a

marginal Tobin's q will prove to be useful in forecasting the rate of in-

vestment.

              CAPITAL GAINS AND DIVIDENDS: T!ORY AND E}.ICAL RESULTS



                           Roger H. Gordon and David F. Bradford




       -    Given   the much more favorable tax treatment of capital gains than
 of    dividends,    why do U.S. corporations pay dividends when most shareholders
 ought      to prefer stock repurchase?           This is a question   that has long puzzled
those      who have tried to use    economic theory to predict the effect of taxes
on the financial and other decisions of corporations. If investors evaluated

securities      the way they "ought to," fir-rn managers attempting to madni.ze
shareholder wealth should—-because of              the tax   rules--be led   to   avoid dividends.
Yet U.S. individual income taxpayers reported an aggregate of $ 25 billion
dollars in dividends received i 1976 , a figure that may be compared with
an   estimated      aggregate   corporation profit (after interest payments and corporate
taxes)      of $63   billion.
            If economic theory fails by         such a margin to predict the effect of

existing taxes on individual            and   firm behavior, the confidence one can have

in predictions derived on the same basis about alternative rules is


seriously eroded. The research reported on here suggests that the explanation of the


paradox of dividends is not to be found in non-maximizing behavior                   on the
part    of those controlling      the   financial policies of firms.         Our conclusion
                                                                                       2.




is that the focus of attention, as far as this issue is                concerned,    is best

directed      toward explaining the preferences of the shareholding population,

and our modelling         of this side of    the   market   for corporate securities suggests

that   here too the outcomes may be less at variance with mad.mizing behavior
than usually thought, even tald.ng into account only tax              considerations.

         We approach      this question by developing and estimating a model of the

relative value of dividends and capital gains in the U.S. stock market.

The theory of portfolio choice we apply to the demand side of that market is

an adaptation of the standard capital asset pricing model, particularly as. modified

by Brennan L19701. Importantly if not solely for tax reasons, we expect to

find in the taxpayer population a distribution of preferences between returns

in   the form   of   dividends   and returns in the     form of capital gains (increase
in asset price) Given their financial policies, corporations' shares will
differ in the division of their yields             between the two forms, and these
differences     will be   taken into account along with        the   risk properties of the
shares   in the portfolio decisions of investors.

         As we show in the       formal   derivation, asset market equilibrium will

generate a single rate of exchange between dividends and capital gains.

Nhile the capital gain equivalent to a dollar of dividends, which we denote

by      a ,   cannot be observed directly, it         can be inferred from market data.
Estimating a is the principal objective of cur                empirical work.

         According to     the theory the market a will be a weighted average of
individual     shareholder a's, that is, of individual valuations of dividends

in terms of capital gains. Thus if, as is usually assumed, dividends are

always   taxed not less heavily than capital gains, and are             usually     taxed more
heavily, tax     considerations    alone would imply a value of a less than one.
                                                                                 3.


A   finding otherwise should cause us to reassess the tax consequences at the
shareholder level and to look for other reasons for valuing dividends.
         On the supply side of the market for corporate shares, the theory
of the firm implies that in equilibrium the two forms of returns to share-
holders should be equally valued, that is,    equal to one. Since we expect
the   exchange market for   shares to adjust very quickly      to changing conditions,

but firm policies to change slowly, this implies only a tendency for the value

of a toward    unity.

         Our estimates of a   indicate   a cyclical pattern around one. Such a

pattern is consistent with the view that the values of dividends and capital

gains tend toward equality. That is, our empirical results do not cause

us to question the usefulness of shareholder wealth xna.dnd.zation in predicting

outcomes in the U.S. corporate sector. As         note in the next section,

accepting this model allows us to draw conclusions from our estimates about

the time path of the value in the stock market of an incremental dollar of

real investment. In particular if corporate dividend policies are believed

to adjust sufficiently rapidly to changing circumstances, Bradford-Gordon
a      can be taken as an estimate of a marginal Tobin's q. Potential uses              of
this are discussed in the concluding section of the paper.

         Since the empirical results are consistent with the theory of the firm

they are inconsistent with    the view that dividends and capital gains are

valued purely for their net of tax cash flow consequences, assuming            dividends
are   relatively heavily taxed. Perhaps what is involved is an irrational
preference for dividends, as has been suggested by Black L 1976            •    Other
rational grounds seem worth investigating, such        as   the possibility, explored
by Battacharya L19791, that     dividends serve a signalling function. concerning

the future profitability of the firm.      We do not   pursue    this investigation
                                                                      4.




here, although we do note in the next section a frequently neglected class

of shareholders for which dividends are less heavily taxed than capital gains.

       The next section, Section I, presents certain institutional and

theoretical background relevant to the interpretation of the empirical

analysis. Section II describes the model of equilibrium share valuation, the

estimation of which is the subject of Section III. Section IV contai.ns the

results of estimation and the paper concludes w.th a brief summing up and

commentary in Section V.

I.     Institutional and Theoretical Background

         In this section we first   briefly review   the concepts of dividends and

capital gains, and the tax treatment thereof, as these bear on the evaluation

by   demanders of common stock.1 We then summarize the implications          of the

theory   of the firm for the behavior of suppliers of conmion stock.
          Dividends, Capital Gains,   and   Their Tax Consequences
          The term "capital gain" as used in TJ.S.    tax law   is related to a
transaction     of sale or exc.hangeof a "capital asset," as defined in the law.

We use the term to refer simply to the increa.se in market value of an asset

over    a specified   ti period. It is thus unrelated       to transactions. The
equivalence between capital gains and dividends (which are cash distributions
from a corporation to its shareholders)2 is, however, dependent on transactions.
The crucial point is that, in the absence of taxes and         transactions costs, it
is   possible to produce precisely the same consequences by dividends and by

share repurchase by the corporation. Both operations can be used to transfer

funds out of the corporation. By entering the market to sell, shareholders

can obtain the same cash flow in the repurchase case as would be provided

by dividends.    By entering the market to buy, recipients of dividends who

prefer an increased ownership interest can reproduce the effect of declining

to sell shares to the corporation in a disbursement of corporate funds by
share   repurchase. The ownership claim remaining in the shareholder after either
transaction is the same. It is important to understand the equivalence of
the two, since it explains the econost's conviction that the value of the
corporation should be the same after disbursement of a given amount of funds
by either form)
         Because there are transactions costs and because       the tax   consequences
are very different, the expectation that future disbursements of          corporate

funds will take one or the other form       should have   a bearing on its current value.
                                                                                         6.


The relevant tax rules provide in the case of individual (rather than
corporate) shareholders (a) the first              $100   ($200 for   married couples   filing
jointly)      of dividends are   excluded from      income tax;   (b)    further dividends are

taxed   as "ordinary" income (like interest receipts); (c) accruing capital

gains induce no current tax           liability,   (d) the taxation of capital gains

"realized" by sale depends upon the period over which the asset has been held,

with short term gains         taxed   as ordinary income, but     with   only 40 percent of

long term gains      (asset   held a year or more) subjected to tax          as   ordinary

income.4       These features imply that taxpayers with           high marginal
rates   of tax on ordinary income and little use for current cash flow
should strongly prefer accruing capital gains to dividend yield For taxpayers
with zero or low marginal tax rates, transactions costs might be expected to
play   a more important role, with those wishing a steady flow of cash                favoring
dividends.      In general one might      expect   the preferences of wealthy, highly

taxed, individual     shareholders      for capital gains to be the dominant inIluence

on individual valuation of corporate shares.

            For shareholders other than individuals,an attitude ranging from

neutrality between capital gains and dividends to a preference for dividends

is implied by tax     considerations.6        Obviously, for tax exempt shareholders,

such   as   pension fuis, tax     consequences     are irrelevant, and matters of

transactions costs and                institutional features such as the rules limiting

a university's cash draw on its endowment to "income" (often defined to

exclude capital gains) may be the principal determinant of preferences. For

shareholders that are themselves taxable corporations tax                 considerations     are

in favor of dividends. This is because 85             percent (100 percent in the case
of a sufficient ownership interest) of dividends received are excluded from

corporation income tax. This implies a tax rate in the typical case
                                                                                     7.

of   .15   x .46   or 6.9 percent. Realized capital gains, on the other hand,             are
taxed      at a flat 28 percent.7     While    the   advantages of deferral of tax   liability
and the f1ed.bility to choose the timing of cash flow, associated with
capital gains, apply to corporate as well as individual shareholders, still
                               should be expected typically to prefer
taxable corporation shareholders

dividends. Thus implications of tax rules for the preferences of
potential shareholders between capital gains and dividends are not as
unambiguously in favor of capital gains as is commonly believed. It appears
possible that investors favoring dividends could be sufficiently influential
to induce a temporary equilibrium value of a in excess of one.8
           Implications of the Theory of the Firm for Dividend Policy
           We turn next to the question of how the decisions of an individual
firm will be related toits perception of the value of a implicit in the
stock market. Specifically we consider three margins of choice: (1) that
between retentions and          dividends,    (2) that between real investment and other
uses    of corporate funds, and       (3) that between issuing (or     retiring) debt

or equity. In addressing these issues we assume the objective of the firm is

to xnadjnize     the   value of its shares.9


         follows that dividend policy will be set to bring about equality
           It

between a and the increase in per share market value consequent upon an
extra dollar of retentions. If the market valued a flow of retentions at
less than a per dollar, the value of the shares could be increased by
converting      the flow   of   retentions to a flow of dividends, while     dividends

would   be reduced if the market valued retentions at more than              a
                                                                                8.




         Ifthe firm xnakes use of retained funds to mad.rnize shareholder
                                                                          wealth,
 the stock market valuation of an incremental dollar of
                                                         real investment must
 also be a (as long as real investment is
                                            among the best uses of retentions).
Therefore, on the assumption that firms      are    setting dividend policy
optimally,        represents a marginal   Tobin'   s q (the market value of an extra
unit   of capital relative to cost))0 Because it is a marginal        rather   than
an average value (market value of the firm relative to replacement cost) as
usually calculated, it ought to be more useful in analyzing firm investment
behavior and financial structure)
        We have concluded so far that when the dividend payout rate is optimal
a equals the value of a dollar of retentions, which also normally equals
the value of a dollar of real investment. However the firm cannot be in
long term equilibrium if a is different from one. A value of a greater

than one implies the opportunity for
                                          profitable arbitrage between equity issue
and the uses of
                       new fund to retire debt (or purchase the debt of other
firms) or to undertake real investment. If a is less than one the advantage

shifts to   debt finance, ji.th the funds used to retire equity claims.12
                                                                                             9.


  II. Taxes, portfolio choice, and the relative valuation of dividends and
       capital gains.
           As has been    suggested in the      section, the relative valuation
                                                preceding

  of dividends and capital gains in the market will be the net consequence of
  the portfolio choices of many separate wealth-holders, here collectively
  labeled   uhouseholds.hI To study this we modify the standard analysis                of
  portfolio     choice to incorporate preferences between the two forms of returns.
 Thus, while we assume as           that the household seeks to allocate its
                                    usual

 wealth    among   the available securities in the market to niad.mize a function
      ••   2)   of the mean   .i.   and   the variance .2 of the one-period real
 return    on the portfolio, we       take   explicit coguizance of the fact that the
 return in question is a weighted sum of dividends and capital                gains.

           Individual   Portfolio Opt imality Conditions

       Let dit denote the dividends received on a dollar's worth of the
i'th asset during period t , and      the increase in its market value
over the period. The real after tax dollar value of the return on a share
of equity in firm i to household h in period t is a weighted sum
of rt and dit           , less the rate of     inflation, ff   ,   over   the period:

(1)     Rt =                  d.t -
wherethe a 's capture tax and possibly other preference and signalling
elements. Letting fh represent this household's utility function of
portfolio mean and variance and for the moment suppressing the time subscript,
we can describe the household's problem as

about the risk premium on diZferent assets expressed in capital gains

equivalents.              For example, the relative weight,                     ,   placed on dividends
depends upon household preferences and circumstances. The optimizing portfolio,

indexed h ,           is dependent         upon the household, as is, therefore, the zero-

covariance asset. In fact, even the expectations concerning the means and

covariances of            the returns might           vary   by    household. Since we        have no hope

of    gaining this         detailed information for                each   household, we I?rast make some

 satisfy    (15). t1hen           the returns are joint normally distributed, as has

 implicitly been assumed in motivating (2),                               will be    normally distributed.

          Now use equation (14) to replace                          r in (15) by properties of the
                                    13
portfolio and zero-covariance asset:

                        Cov(r.1111
                               ,r )
 where
              j             Var(r)


The unobserved parameters in this equation are a,                                    ,   and       .   The

entire derivation was for a given date. At other dates, the equation will

have a similar form, but the parameters may all                          be different.
We then have (17) as              a specification:




 (17)     r.t +   a it - zt                   Bit(rmt +         a dt -         +
                                                                                     it
This is    the first specification to be estimated in section IV,
          Note that in this specification, a does not vary with i .                                    According
to   the derivation, all firms will                    face the same      relative   value in the market
for     their dividends and capital gains, in spite of the fact that their

 shareholders may have very different characteristics. This result is

contrary     to that in Elton and                Gruber (1970).
                                                                                                                         15.

 In addition, it follows from                        equation       (6) that ç2h    =
                                                                                       -f1/f2 . This implies
 that    the     weight given to each ah in                         deriving     a is not only proportional
 to the      size of that investor's portfolio but only inversely proportional to

 the    marginal degree of risk                     aversion of that investor. In particular,

 were any investor risk neutral, his ah would receive infinite weight.


             Refinements of the Estimating Equation

           As has been noted in the derivation, specification (16) is
                                                                                                            implied
 when    both dividends            and inflation are nonstochastjc.                       As we shall employ             monthly
 observations in the estimations, the assumption that dividends are 1own for the period
 ahead does not seem extreme, but it is less plausible that the inflation rate can
 be   forecast .th confidence. If only dividends are                                 nonstochastic,             then the
 aggregation of individual                     equilibri.im         conditions produces a somewhat less
 neat   specification. The right hand side of (9) now becomes                                                       h              h

          If we assume a is equal to one for all households, not a bad

This    differs from (18) in that the capital gains are measured in real terms,

and the zero beta rate, as estimated, is a real return rather than a ncnnal

return. Equation (22) is also estimated in section IV.

Since   equations (23) and (18) have the same structure, equation (23) would also
imply the estimation specifications (20) and (21), with                           and            suitably
redefined.

It   seems very plausible that                 is small    relative    to Var(r_Tt), so the only

real difference between equations (22) and                 (24)    is the addition of       a   firm

specific   constant term. This equation with '=0 is also-estimated    in section                             IV.

       The derivation above made use of two strong assumptions: 1) there is

no restriction on short sales and 2) expectations of households are identical.

How sensitive is the specification to these assumptions?
        Assume shor.t sales            are not possible,    as    an extreme   alternative. It is
not even clear that the constraint will be binding for many investors. When
a risk—free asset exists and all households have the same a h,                       they all will      hold
                                                                                                 18.




 a proportional        share of    the   market portfolio. A household's optimal portfolio
will    be a continuous function of all, so we expect that a1'                 will have to
vary substantially from the "average" value                  if   th household's desired
holding of any security is to be negative. If the a do vary that
substantially, it can then be shown that portfolio equi.librimn for household h
requires

with    an inequality only when the short sales constraint                is binding. Let us
rewrite       (25) as (26), where e > 0

Were we to use equation (26) rather than equation (9) in the                   previous
derivation, the only difference would be that there would                   be an additional

term e. =            ,.,hh eh           on the left hand side. However,       this term   is just

exists.

 III.    Estimation procedure.
          In the previous section,        we derived a series of specifications, for

which    equation     (17) is representative. In this section, we first discuss

 further      specific assumptions   which must be       made before the equation can be
 estimated. We then describe the data and the estimation procedure.
                 Further specification assumptions
          In equation (17), the unobserved parameters are a                       and
Assumptions dealing with       each      of these will be described in turn.

a it     Our derivation implies that a should not vary across assets but could
vary across ti.me, as the tax law and the wealth distribution change, as well
as the size of any transactions costs and the importance of institutional
constraints       favoring dividends. To capture this smooth evolution of a over
time, we normally assume that at is piecewise                  linear in t with     break
points    every five years. For purposes of comparison with               related work by
Black    and    Scholes (1974) and Litzenberger and Iamaswazny (1979) (hereafter B-S
and    L-R),    we also estimate a specification in which a            is constant over time
(except    that for comparability with L-R we constrain a to equal one               prior
to the 'normal" taxation of dividends in 1936).

         In    L-R,      is implicitly set equal to a +        a rt where rft is an
observed interest rate on short term high grade bonds. But because of inflation

risk or default risk (when the series is for nongovernment bonds), the real

yield on these assets is not variance free. Presumably the stochastic movement

in these assets is positively correlated with               that of   the market portfolio,

as both respond inversely to inflationary shocks. Therefore the zero beta

rate    ought to be less than a rf          ,   and   to a larger degree when the inflation
                                                                                             21.




 rate is high       on the assuition that the variance in the inflation rate is

 high when the in.fJ.ation rate is high. Therefore, we set                   = a +
                                                                                  br1 'there
 we    expect b <         .       Since the   relation between      and r   may change over
 time,     we also let "a" be a piecewise linear function of time.

  it           We assume that      the       firm may drift smoothly over time, so treat
                                              for a

the        $          for each firm as a piecewise linear function of time, with break

 everyfive years. The coefficients of this linear function are estimated
 simultaneously with the others. In contrast, in B-sand L-R, as has been
 standardin papers estimating a capital asset pricing model,       is estimated
 from the previous five years or so of data, using the regression:
 r. + d.t - rft j(rm + -                 d
                                       +a +
                                               rft)Then     is used as an independent
                                                          sit'
 variable in the final regression for the other coefficients. There are
 at least three problems with this approach.
            First, the specification of the regression for                assumes a =     1 and
       =        .   Neither is a maintained assumption in         equation (17). Since   the
purpose of the paper is to estimate a             it equal to one at an
                                                      , assuing
earlier step creates an internal inconsistency in the model. Simultaneous
estimation of the parameters eliminates this inconsistency.
       Second, the estimate of      in the previous work refers to the average
    during the previous five years. Since        drifts over time, and people
at the time likely observed this drift through daily observation or through
specific IQiowledge about changes in the characteristics of the firm, the
estimated     will have measurement error beyond that appearing in the
standard       error of       .   L-R    attempt to correct for the latter measurement
error only. Conventional procedures for estimating capital asset pricing

models have not worried about the first. This measurement error will                 cause
bias in all coefficients.
                                                                                          22.




           In   this paper we estimate          si.multaneously with the   other   coefficient s,
  so   avoid problems with   bias   due to measurement    error.    Also, we allow for the
  drift in the value of         over time   in   a piecewise linear fashion. This

  procedure implies that the estimate of               for a year depends on subsequent
  as well as earlier data. We assume that individuals at the time }ciew much

  more   about the firm than   we can infer from monthly price

  bothered   by this implication. In effect, we assume rational expectations--
  that   individuals know the parameters of the system, though not the stochastic

  element.

           Third,   the requirement that         be estimated on prior data results in the

 loss of Live years of data from the sample, with clear             efficiency costs.

 proxy if the dividend was a recurring dividend, else zero was used as a proxy.
 If dividends tend to be increasing in dollar terms, then both of these
 prod.es tend systematically to. underestimate actual dividends. Such systematic
 errors will create biases in the coefficients. Also, L—R assume that the
 investor always         Iaows   in which month a periodic dividend will be paid, an
 assumption not imposed here.

NYSE   securities in most of the peci.fjcatjons.    However, in one                   specification
we try to improve on this. If we had              the   average rate of return on each
type of security, denominated in the
                                                 capital gains equivalent, then the market
return would be the value weighted

         A in L-R, but in contrast to many other recent papers, we use the

firm as unit of      observation rather than      specially   constructed portfolios
of securities. The justification in B-S for using portfolios rather than
individual      securities is apparently 1) to xnini.nze measurement error in

      We used the inflation rate derived from the consumer price index,             as

reported      in Ibbotson and Sinquefield Ll977.

      The dividend yield is also available monthly on the CRSP tape. When

dividends are stochastic, however, we need expected, not actual, dividends.

We therefore create an instrument for dt, and use it even in the

speci.ficatinns    where d1t is assumed to be nonstochastic, to nni.mize possible
specification error.


        In    creating the instrument, we divide the sample into four subsamples.
The classification of each observation depends on whether in the past year
the firm had paid no dividends, one dividend, two dividends, or more than
two dividends. Within each subsample, we regress actual dividend yield on the

recent dollar dividends (corrected for stock splits) each            divided   by the

There is no unique optimal parameter set as the equation stands. However, if
we make the arbitrary restrictions   = 1 and g =

         Estimation   technique
         For ease of exposition, we first discuss estimation of the simplest
specification:
    rt = (r +a dt             -   a   -
                                          brf)    + a +

                                                                     ad + it               E(


         This   specification is nonlinear           in   the parameters

We use nonlinear least squares (equivalent to ma.d.riuiii likeliho
                                                                                      ,   a,     a, arid b.
                                                                                               under the
assution     that the errors are distributed normally). This                          presents     the

izrmiediate problem that a large number of parameters                   are   involved. The

procedure we follow    is    to estimate 1)           S     conditional on initial estimates

of a ,    a, and b (a = b = 1,            a0), using separate least squares                    regressions
for each firm;     2) a ,    a, and b conditional on these                            using a pooled

regression, and    then   return to step 1) with             the     new estimates of a, a , arid
b   and continue to iterate between steps 1) and 2) until convergence.

         That the point     of convergence unuxnizes the sum of                  squared residuals

is iimnediate. In the first           order conditions       for this niini.nization, the

function   is z.ni.zed with respect              to each parameter      conditional on           the other
                                                                                  24.




parameters.      In   the procedure described   above,  of parameters is
                                                         the set

 subdivided into two groups, and the function is minimized with respect to
each   group conditional on the va]es of the other group. When             the function
is being    jointly minimized,    the entire set of first     order   conditions must be
 satisfied. It shou.ld      be noted that the procedure used in L-R and B-S involves

 stopping   this iterative    procedure after one iteration rather than iterating

until   convergence.
         One   complication is               errors of
                                 that the standard                 the parameters are

not the standard errors reported by either regression.  For the simplest
model, where a did not depend on time, we report the madmum likelihood
standard errors, as approd.mated by the square root of the diagonal elements
in the inverse of the second derivative matrix of the log likeliho function
with respect to the parameters. Since these estimates, as reported below,
differed only slightly from the      standard   errors for the second regression,
we report only the latter in the rest of our results.
         Allowing     each of the parameters to be piecewise linear in time presents

no   further complications. When it and/or                are estimated, as in equation
(27), the only modification is that both          it and it are estimated in
the first regression, while a and                 are estimated in the second
regression. Asming heteroskedasticity in the residuals across firms causes
a few modifications. Since the residuals in each first stage regression for

       rexnai.n homoskedastic and independent across regressions, this step is
unchanged.     The variance   of the residual for each firm is estimated from the
residuals    in each of   these regressions. The     estimates of the variances
are then used in constructing weighted least squares estimates for the second
stage regression. The coefficients, and         now variance estimates,are iterated

until convergence.

IV. Coefficient estimates
         The first step in the estimation process was to construct a forecasted
value for dividends. As described before, the overall sample was divided
into four subzanxples, based on the number of dividend payments during the
previous year. The resulting estimates for the four subsa.mples are reported
in Table 1. The coefficients are all reasonably plausible.
        These equations were then used to create forecasts for the dividend
yield. As a result, the first year of data was dropped from later samples,
as it was needed to construct fitted dividends. After dropping in
addition observations with .ssing data and firms with too few observations
to allow estimation of sit' 6JJi,15O observations were left. Initial
estimation was done on this sample.
        The first specification estimated corresponds to equation (17) with
a    t=a   and      = a + b
                               rft .   This   specification is similar to that estimated
in L—R, though they assuid b = a and performed only one iteration, as
described above. We estimate a to be .82, which is statistically significantly
less than one, and corresponds to the estimate in L-R of .76 . However,
b is estimated to be less than zero and substantially 1es than a . This
puts into question the use of rf as an approd.mation to the risk-free rate.
The problem, however, could well be the importance of firm specific             intercepts,
as   rationalized above,   which are captured    here in the estimates of a and b

        The standard   error   estimates are   found   in coluirs 2 and   3.   Here we find that
the OLS standard errors, while they are systematic          underestimates because they
ignore that      is being estimated simultaneously, still are       reasonably     close

to   the maximum likelihood estimates.

           In    all    other      specifications estimated, we aJ.lowed           a   to be a piecewise
 linear function of time.                  The estimates for a at the
                                                                                breakpoints   for all the
 other    specifications are reported in Table 3.                      The implied value of a         for
 any other date is calctJ.ated by taking an appropriately
                                                                                weighted average of
 the estimated values of a at the two                        nearest   dates, e.g. the value in
 December 1953         in    the first      specification      is .6 (1.28) +   •1t. (.96).   The
 reported standard errors are                    those   from the second stage OLS     regression.
           The time      pattern         of a , though varying somewhat among the different

 specifications, consistently follows the economic cycles very closely. It is

 lowest during         the   great depression through the end of World War U and                    is
 almost    as   low during         the    great recession of     the early 70's. During the          boom
years     of   the 20 ' s    and    the   50'   s through the iv±d-60's, it was       above one virtually
throughout,            it is
                         very high in 1978, suggesting a

 favorable forecast for the future.

misleading,       since      the estimates will be very sensitive to the period chosen.

B-S estimate a and its
                                         variance essentially by taking the mean and           variance
of   annual     estimates of a .             It is apparent from these resu1t why the               standard
error   of their estimate was so large.

       If one accepts the coefficients as they
                                               stand, they imply that dividends
are not systematically wervaJ.ued. In fact
                                             they are often overvalued.
That a         tends   to return to one, where dividends and                capital   gains are equally
valued, following shocks is consistent with
                                                                 share price maximizing behavior
by the firm.        This     result       also   implies, however, that in the weighted average
of investor preferences dividends and
                                                          capital gains are equally valued. Tax
considerations         alone seem to lead us to expect that dividends would be less

valued.        Our empirical finding might be               explained either by nontax advantages
                                                                                    27.




of dividends to individuals (e.g. lower transactions costs or signalling

implications),or by a sufficiently high relative weight placed on the
preferences of institutional and corporate shareholders who would prefer
dividends.

          The cyclical pattern of the results is consistent with the marginal
Tobin's q interpretation of a            a represents the value in the
                                        , where
market of an additional dollar of real investment in the firm. We find this
value to be sharply procycical as would be expected.           Of particular
interest in this connection is the very low       value   of a during
                                                                   depression,
                                                                         the

when corporate investment at the margin was apparently almost valueless.
Since a can in principle be measured arbitrarily close            to the present,

this  suggests that the estimates could well prove to be a valuable forecaster
for the investment rate.
          Let us now   examine the   specifications individually. The estimates of
equation     (17), the equation most sin.1ar to those in previous studies, provides

a basis for comparison. The implied estimates for             =
                                                                   at + ft for
selected dates are reported in Table 1.4., column 1. As estimates of the risk

free rate, they are not very plausible, fluctuating often between extreme
        19
values.    Our several justifications for including a firm specific intercept
may   provide a rationalization £ or this.

        When we use real rather than nominal capital gains, corresponding to

equation (22), the value of the log likelihood function falls substantially.

The derivation of this specification required the additional assumption that

a =     1    for all h .    We   already noted that this assumption is poor for

corporate    holders of equity. The poorer statistical performance o± this
specification also suggests that this assumption may not be a good one. The
                                                                                             28.




estimates for r               in Table 4 from this   specification   are nortnafly lover

than the previous ones in absolute value, as they ought to be, representing

a real rather than a nominal interest rate. However, they are really no

more plausible, again justifying including firm specific constants.

           We therefore next estimated equation (21), where           time    varying firm

specific intercepts are estimated simultaneously (though rf is omitted).

Here we allow for the possibility of stochastic inflation and dividends,

or    short    sales   constraints. The estimates of a          while changing rather
little, seem to change most in those periods when our earlier estimates
for r          were   least convincing. In those periods, we would expect the
factors     justifying the firm specific intercepts to be most important.

           When we reesti.mate equation (21) using real rather than nominal capital

gains, as reported in column 4 of Table 3, we again find that the log-

likelihood falls substantially. The data reject the simplifying assumption
      =   1.
           In the next specification, equation (27), we try to improve on our

approximation to the return on the          market   portfolio by    adding   the corporate

bond yield and the inflation rate, with estimated weights, to the market

yield. The       implied      changes in our estimates of a ,   reported in Table 3,
column 5, are minimal. The weights on these additional factors, reported in

Table     4, are .11    and    .17 respectively. Each coefficient ought to represent
the market value of that type of security relative to equity multiplied by
the "a     " weight    appropriate for that security, translating the actual returns
into the equivalent capital gains returns. tjnder this interpretation, the
coefficient of the corporate bond rate is quite plausible. While currently,
the   market value of debt is over half the market value of equity, during most

of the sample period the value of debt was relatively much smaller. Were
                                                                                               29.


  the average value for the period .15,20      the implied value of "a" for bonds
  would be .73,    a   plausible value. While we have little evidence on the
  relative value of real estate, the estimated coefficient for the inflation
  rate does not seem grossly out of line.
         In our final speci.t'jcatjon, equation (20), we no longer assume that
 the uncertainty in inflation or dividends is small relative to that on
                                                                        capital
 gains. Specifically, we estimate separate weights for market dividends
 and for ixi.vidua1 firm dividends. The latter, which correspond to our
 previous    estimates, cluster more tightly
                                                   arow one throughout the sample
 period   though   they   continue to have the same cyclical time
                                                                          pattern.    We
 argued   in   section   i that these coefficients might    be interpreted as estimates

                                             additional real investment. These final
 estimates     of a give a very plausible estimate for the time
                                                                          pattern    of this

          The estimates for a ,      reported    in Table 4, are   less   congruent
with the predictions of the
                                    theory. According to our derivation,
                                                                                a /a
represents var(r)/var(r)+           3m. ,   an interpretation difficult to reconcile

with the estimates. However, the estimates seem to fluctuate
                                                                            around plausible
values, rather than being
                                consistently implausible. Since surely          our measure
of the   market   rate of return    is subject   to error, when we allow a* to be
estimated separately, its coefficient will be biased Upwards during

the true market yield is lower.

          To explore further this explanation for the fluctuations in a*, we

introduced the corporate bond rate and the inflation rate as components of

little, ar did not improve systematically. This suggests that there are

other important factors omitted from our measure        of   the market rate of

return.

          While we tez to favor this last specification, fortunately our

estimates    of the general time   pattern   of a seem quite insensitive to the

specification issues considered. Estimates derived from any of the

specifications   have the same economic implications, a comforting result if
we are to use the estimates for      forecasting   purposes.

V.    Conclusions

        In this paper we have presented estimates of the relative value in

the U.S. stock market of dividends and capital gains. We have concluded

that over the sample period (1926 to 1978) the capital gain regarded by

the   market as   equivalent to a dollar of dividends, denoted by a   ,   has
Thflowed   a cyclical path around one. The pattern of movement has roughly
paralleled that of the business cycle.
     The estimates are based on a modification of the capital asset pricing
model. Successive estimates are presented, relaxing a priori restrictions.
We are able to incorporate stochastic dividends and inflation and to allow
for deviation between the returns on the stock market and that on the
portfolio of all assets. In each case the empirical results are consistent
with expectations. In particular, the most refined version has not only by
far the highest value of the likelihood function, but also the most plausible
path of a
      We interpret the tendency of a to one as consistent with a view
of the firm as mad.zing share value in making decisions about dividend
policy, real investment and financial structure. An implication of this
view is that a is an estimate of the value in the market of incremental
real investment. The empirical results on the time pattern of a are
consistent with this implication.
     While the estimated value of a is consistent with maximizing behavior
by the firm, it is less clearly consistent with mad.mizing behavior by
investors. The market value of a is shon by the theory to be a weighted
average of stockholder a's. The tax treatment of the two forms of returns
                                                                                         32.


implies that individuals should have a 's less than one, and since the
greater part of coimuon          stock is held by individuals one would expect          the
market equilibrium to be below one as long as a significant number of                    firms

continue      to pay dividends.
           We note, though, that the presence in the market of tax exempt holders
such as pension funds, and taxable corporations for                are less
                                                                  iich dividends

heavily taxed that capital gains, clouds this conclusion. As we show, the
weight      attached to shareholders' a's is inversely related to their risk
aversion.       Hence it      is not out of the question, though certainly not
established,         that   an a of one is consistent with mad.mi.zation generally,

taking      into account only tax issues.
           However, it is less easy to reconcile the observed variation in a with
this   view. Our preferred estimate of a              ranges   from .04 to 1.37, and      the
range even in the non-depression years is .70 to 1.37. This degree of

variation seems difficult to explain on the basis of differences in the

distribution of tax          circumstances   in the investing population.

           Naturally, even as public     finance    economists, we must     acknowledge    that

taxes niay     not   explain everything. The       determinants   of   ithivi.dual   investors'

valuation      of dividends is but one of the questions remaining open, and we
hope to follow up on some of these in further work. We see three related
avenues for such work.
           The first is a closer look at the relationship between tax rules and
a      .     Over   the sample period, the individual income tax evolved from a
minor impost        affecting   few individuals to a mass tax     with high rates.
                                                                            33.


 The    tax treatment   of dividends, capital gains, corporate retained earnings,
 and    retirement   savings also varied substantially. These changes
                                                                       ought to
 have   made   a mark on a•
         Second, the theory developed here implies a response of the dividend
 and other financial policies of individual firms to changes in a .
                                                                     Roughly
 speaking, high values of a should cail forth a shift from debt to equity
 and decreases in payout rates, and
                                    low values should have the oppositeeffect.
To deal properly with this relationship wili require a careful treatment of
the underlying reason for a change in a (e.g., change in tax rules vs.
change in general outlook for profits), and of the deternants of the lag
structure of responses (due, for example, to the difficulty of observing a).
      The third idea of further work is the relationship between a and
the    rate of corporate real investment.      Closely related to the investigation
of the response o±      financial            investigation will build on
                                    structure, this
the implication of optimal firm behavior that
                                               a should be a measure of the
value in the market of a dollar of additional investment, a marginal Tobin' s
q . Since the data are available almost irediately, a can be estimated
very close to the present. This suggests that an estimated a may prove
useful in forecasting the investment rate.

                                         FOOTNOTES




         'The tax rules described below are those currently in effect. They
are representative in a qualitative sense of the rules that were in effect
over the recent decades of the sample period of the empirical work, although
there have been important changes in the treatment of capital gains in the
individual income tax. The important fact about the early decades of the
sample is that the income tax affected very few people.


       2For simplicity we neglect here distributions of property other than
cash. Stock dividends are treated as a simple redefinition of the units of
omership, although          in fact they do have some implications for the
corporation' s     books.



         By   buying for cash equity claims of other       corporations, a corporation

can   accomplish   much the    same effect as repurchasing its on shares.     Because

of   the rules for taxation of intercorporate dividends (discussed in        the text),

this continues to be roughly true even in the presence of taxes.


         Under some circumstances capital gains are subject to a special

"alternative sinimum tax," dth but         trivial consequences   for the effective

marginal rate. More important is the fact that if an asset is held to the

owner's death capital gain to that date goes free of income tax.


         To   analyze fully the tax     treatment    of capital gains it is necessary to take

account of future tax consequences via changes in "basis" of the shares omed

by the taxpayer. For details see Bradford [l98O.
                                                                                          39.




         6This does not encompass     irtitua1 funds, which serve as conduits for
                shareho.ders.
         7The 28' percent   rate is an alternative tax. Since the corporation
 income tax is assessed on a graduated schedule, it will be advantageous for
 the firm to treat capital gains as ordinary income when total taxable profits
 are   low enough. Note also that under       rare    conditions corporate capital gains
 are subject to an additional      "minimum tax."


                we shall see below the influence of an agent on        the market a is
 negatively associated with his risk aversion. Arguably, large institutional
 investors, with relatively high a 's are also relatively risk neutral.
         9
             We are inclined to this even though, as King L 197'7J shows, mad.riization
 of market value will not.in general be the preferred objective of all or
 even the majority of stockholders. Without claiming to make the point
precisely, we conjecture that the deviation of firm behavior from that implied
by wealth maximization will be small in a large system such as               the U.S.

economy.      As we have noted, our empirical results seem consistent with this view.

          Note that nnich the same effect as stock repurchase can be accomplished
by the   take-over of other corporations in a
                                                purchase involving cash, or even
by the simple purchase of stock in the
                                              market, taking advantage of the 85
percent dividend received deduction.
                                             If such repurchase of equity is ruled
out, however, as in     Bradford   (1977),   then a    may   remain below   one even in
equilibrium.

                  That (16) follows directly from (14) and rational expectations seems

  to have been overlooked in the finance literature, e.g. Faina [1968J
         14
            When we measured the covariance in the residuals at
                                                                              any date among
  firms     in the same industry, and among firms in different industries, we found
  that     the size of the covari.ance was normally about ten per cent of the
  variance of the residual, implying              little   bias in the reported standard errors.
                    a simple      case,   assume N firms    per portfàlio and I    portfolios
  at   each of T dates. Assume that the residuals all have variance
                                                                                       2,

  ile residuals for firms in the same portfolio at any date have covariance

  p    .   Assume one independent variable for notational simplicity whose
                                                                                       average
  squared value is x2 ,            regardless    of firm or date. For any portfolio, where

  the average of the independent variables for the component firms becomes the

 new independent var.able, assume its average squared value to be p x2

 where 0 < p < 1       due to the averaging out of individual variation           among firms
 in    a portfolio. By solving             explicitly for the variance of the coefficient
 estimate u.nder each procedure, one
                                                 can show after some messy algebra that
 the variance of the estimate on
                                              portfolio data is
                             2 (ru)       —

 it    was very stable over time.

               An alternative rationalization for this specification, suggested to
 us    by Stephen Ross,      involves assimiing three underlying stochastic factors,
 f1,        f3 which jointly determine the return on all types of securities,
            and

 that is R. = V. f + Y.., f,, + V• f
