                                               ABSTRACT

The standard measures of flows and stocks of FDI view FDI as a financial flow and its accumulation
as a stock, but most uses of FDI data require measures of employment, payrolls, capital inputs, and
output from FDI. Judging by data for the United States, the flow and stock data provide rough approximations
to country distributions of FDI sources and destinations, but are poor approximations to industry distributions
of FDI and to changes over time in country and industry distributions. One important reason for the
poor match between the two types of measures is that more and more of production is the output from
intangible and financial assets, the location of which is determined by the firm itself, and not easily
subject to outside verification. That development is combined with the increasing use of holding companies
and chains of ownership to reduce tax burdens on the firms without necessarily altering the physical
location of inputs or production. These developments have drawn the attention of tax authorities and
led to some proposals that would reduce firms ability to manipulate the location of assets and profits.
However, these maneuvers also lead to ambiguities in the meaning of economic measures, such as
the balance of payments and national product. The effects on economic measurements, which may
influence many types of economic policy, have been submerged in the concern for tax revenues.

Introduction

        The measurement of foreign direct investment serves two broad purposes. One, the

traditional one, views foreign direct investment as a financial flow. For the source countries, it is

one of the ways in which they allocate their savings. For the recipient countries, it is one of the

ways in which their capital formation or the acquisition of other assets is financed. The stocks of

direct investment, often calculated by cumulating the flows over time, are, for the source

countries, one of the forms in which they hold assets abroad. For the recipient countries, they are

a measure of foreigners’ claims on their capital, the income on which, like the interest on foreign

borrowing, is a burden on their current accounts. Markusen (2002) described the formal

economics literature of the late 1970s, and could have similarly included the earlier theoretical

literature, as dealing with direct investment and multinationals”…if they were treated at all…as

just part of the theory of portfolio capital flows…Much data existed on direct investment stocks

and flows, but very little existed on what the multinational firms actually produced and traded”

(Pp. xi and xii).

        The other purpose of the measurement of direct investment is to measure the activities of

multinational firms, the determinants of these activities and their effects on the home countries

and host countries involved. For most economists and most policy makers now, the role of direct

investment in the flow of financial capital is a minor part of what FDI does. The major

importance of FDI is as a vehicle for the transmission of ideas, technological knowledge,

organizational knowledge, and business knowledge. This transmission takes place through FDI

operations: production, employment, capital investment, and R&D. Economists study FDI, for



                                                                                                      1
example, to answer questions about “…the relationship between trade and affiliate production,

the effects of trade versus investment liberalization on factor prices, and the location of

production” and “…how the pattern of affiliate production in the world economy should relate to

country characteristics “ (Markusen, p. xiv). Policy makers are mainly interested in how FDI,

both inward and outward, affects their economies’ growth and the composition of their

production. There is no summary measure that serves as a proxy for all of these aspects of

multinational firms, but the flow and stock numbers do not represent any of them.

Markusen concludes that “…viewing multinationals and direct investment as part of capital

theory was largely a mistake. The sourcing of finances for direct investments are often

geographically disjoint from the actual parent country…” (ibid., p. xii).

       This interest in the effects of multinational firms on their home and host country

economies leads to a need for entirely different measures of foreign direct investment, measures

of FDI production, or input and output. The studies of the impacts of multinational firms on

individual home and host countries summarized in Lipsey (2004) and other surveys mostly rely

for their measures of multinationals’ activities on data for production, sales, employment, R&D,

and plant and equipment, of both parent firms and their foreign affiliates. That is particularly the

case for studies based on microdata for individual plants and firms. However, the scope of these

studies is limited by the fact that few countries collect operations data on their own firms’

foreign activities. More countries, but still a minority, collect data on foreign firms’ operations

within their borders distinguished from those of domestically-owned firms. For that reason,

investigators who want to draw conclusions about these issues are often led to fall back on the

almost universally available stock and flow data, despite their deficiencies. It is therefore




                                                                                                      2
important in assessing this literature to know how well the stock and flow data represent the

operations data.

Flows and Stocks of Foreign Direct Investment

        The only measures of foreign direct investment that are available for almost every

country in the world, and for many countries over long periods, are the outward and inward

flows of FDI from the balance of payments and the related estimates of outward and inward

stocks of FDI. These are published by UNCTAD in the World Investment Reports and by the

International Monetary Fund in the Balance of Payments Yearbooks. One of the last holdouts,

Bermuda, began reporting according to the framework of IMF (1993) in 1996, although it

continues to treat the “international exempt sector” as non-resident in its balance of payments

and GDP accounts, where IMF (1993) calls for treatment of the sector as resident (Bermuda,

Department of Statistics, 2006). Because the stock and flow data are so widely available, users

are grateful for them, and they are probably used in more scholarly papers and news reports than

any other measures.

        The early calculations of stocks of U.S. direct investment abroad by country of location,

such as Lewis (1938), measured total investment by the total book values of holdings, distributed

geographically, as far as possible, “…according to the actual location of the properties

represented…” (p. 577). The location was presumably that of the land, mines, factories,

warehouses, and retail operations that made up these book values. Although that principle is

carried over to the latest IMF definitions, it is not clear that it is effectively carried out in a world

in which much production is intangible, and even for production of tangible products, important

parts of the assets that enter production are intangible. The latest IMF rules on location say that

“An enterprise is said to have a center of economic interest and be a resident unit of a




                                                                                                        3
country…when the company is engaged in a significant amount of production of goods and

services there or when the enterprise owns land or buildings located there. The enterprise must

maintain at least one production establishment in the country…” (IMF, 1993, p.22). The

location of the investment is based on the legal location of the enterprise, except for the

requirement that there must be some ownership of tangible assets there or some amount of

production of goods or services.

        The disconnection between the published data for the direction of flows and location of

stocks of FDI and inputs into and output from FDI operations are highlighted by recent reported

trends. After stressing the important role of Hong Kong as an outward direct investor, the largest

among developing countries, UNCTAD (2004) reported that more than half of the outward stock

was accounted for by four tax havens, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Panama, and the

Cayman Islands (p. 26). These were clearly not the ultimate destinations of these investments or

the locations of much production resulting from them, if there was any. Luxembourg was

reported to be the world’s largest outward investor and the largest FDI recipient in 2002,

accounting for 19 percent of world inflows and 24 percent of world outflows, although its share

of EU GDP was only 0.2 percent (UNCTAD,2003, p. 69) “…because it offers favorable

conditions for holding companies and for corporate HQ, such as certain tax exemptions…”

(ibid.). The bulk of production associated with these flows must have taken place somewhere

else.

FDI Stocks and Factor Inputs

        The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which produces

both the direct investment flow and stock data and the data on the activity of U.S. firms and their

foreign affiliates, has pointed to the rising share of U.S. direct investment abroad that is




                                                                                                  4
conducted through holding companies. Affiliates classified as holding companies accounted for

more than a third of the U.S. outward investment stock in 2004, a large rise from their 9 percent

share in 1982 (Koncz and Yorgason, 2006, p. 24). The holding company share fell to 30 percent

in 2005 as a result of large earnings repatriations induced by the American Jobs Creation Act of

2004, but the decline was almost certainly temporary. That means that the location of production

associated with about a third of the total U.S. outward stock is unknown in these data. Not only

the location, but the industry composition of that third is also unknown, except in the nominal

sense that it passed through holding companies. For several important host countries, more than

half of the U.S. outward investment stock was in holding companies in 2004. These include

Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, within Europe, and Argentina and United

Kingdom Islands in the Caribbean, in the Western Hemisphere (U.S. Bureau of Economic

Analysis, 2005, p. 161).

       The rise in the role of holding companies means that much of the flow of resources that

the data are supposed to represent is concealed, with respect to the geographical destination and

the industry of use. Even if that ambiguity were removed, it would still be unclear as to how

well the flows of direct investment reflect any additions to or subtractions from the resources that

the host country has for its use. Particularly when the flows are between parent firms and their

wholly-owned affiliates, they may be simply a rearrangement of intangible or financial assets for

tax purposes, without any change in their function or control or in the location of the firms’

production. To the extent that intangible or financial assets do not have any tangible physical

location, it is not obvious what is learned about flows of capital by observing changes in their

nominal or legal location.




                                                                                                    5
       One test of the data on stocks of direct investment is how well they approximate the

country, or industry, or country by industry distribution of production from direct investment

enterprises. Unfortunately, there is no measure of production that is completely immune to

manipulation for tax purposes. However, employment and fixed assets are major inputs into

production that are relatively observable and therefore less subject to manipulation than

intangible or financial assets.

       If the location of stocks of investment represented the location of production well, the

geographical distribution of employment should match that of investment reasonably well,

except to the extent that capital intensities in production differ across countries. Fixed assets are

a smaller input into production in most industries, but are also an unlikely candidate for

manipulation.

       An earlier study of data for United States outward FDI, based on 1989 stocks and

employment, found that the country distribution of U.S. outward stocks was fairly well

correlated with that of employment, with a simple correlation coefficient of .88, implying that

the investment stock explained about 80 percent of the distribution of employment. The degree

of explanation was better in manufacturing than in other industries, for which only about two

thirds of the distribution was explained by the stock. The country distribution of changes in the

investment stock, on the other hand, explained much

less of the change in the employment distribution between 1966 and 1989, 16 percent for

manufacturing and only 10 percent in other industries.

       For the country distribution of foreign-owned production and factor inputs in the United

States, the story was similar. The inward investment stock provides a reasonably good

approximation for the distribution of foreign-owned production and inputs by source country in




                                                                                                    6
1990, better in manufacturing than in other industries. However, it provides a poor

approximation to changes from 1980 to 1990 in the source-country distribution of production

and inputs (UNCTAD, 2001, Appendix D).

       As mentioned above, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has recently emphasized the

growing importance of holding companies in U.S. direct investment abroad, a trend that might be

expected to reduce the connection between investment stock measures and production or factor

input. No benchmark survey results have yet been published since those for 1999, so we may

have missed recent developments, but the relation between investment stocks and inputs in 1994

and 1999 and changes from 1994 to 1999 were as shown in Table 1.

       The cross-country relationships of investment positions to factor inputs were all weaker

in 1999 than in 1994. The changes in the country distribution of the outward investment stock

explained less than a third of relative changes in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), and

only 10 percent of absolute changes, virtually none of the changes in employment, and less than

10-12 percent of changes in a combination of employment and fixed capital that roughly

represents production from factors unambiguously located in each country.


                                                                                                      7
       We cannot examine changes in industry composition in the same way as changes in

country distribution because of the shift in industry classification systems from the US SIC to

NAICS in 1997. However, the relationship between the investment position and each input can

be estimated for each year separately. The data for both 1994 and 1999 show that the industry

distribution of the investment stock is completely unrelated to the distribution of nonbank

employment, fixed capital, and a combination of the two inputs, as a proxy for production (Table

2). In no case is as much as 5 percent of the cross-industry variance explained.

               PPE (Nonbank)                                         0.0404       0.0267
               Employment & PPE (Nonbank)1                           0.0477       0.0234

               Source: BEA (1998) and (2004)



       For 1999, we can ask how well the outward investment stock explains the country-by-

industry distribution of employment and physical capital. About 60 percent of the variance in

the country-by-industry distribution of US affiliates’ employment and plant and equipment

stocks is explained by the distribution of the investment stock. That is a smaller share than for

the country distribution alone, but a much larger share than for the industry distribution alone.

       In general, it appears that the U.S. outward investment stock in 1994 and 1999 was fairly

well correlated across countries with the aggregate PP&E and aggregate employment of U.S.

multinationals, but poorly correlated across industries. Changes in the stock of outward FDI

were poorly correlated with changes in both employment and physical capital across countries.



                                                                                                        8
       On the inward side, the country distribution of the U.S. inward investment stock is

closely correlated with the source country distribution of employment and PP&E., with adjusted

RSQs of over 95 percent in 1997 and over 90 percent in 2002 (Table 3). That might mean that

little foreign direct investment in the United States is made through intermediate countries.

       For all industries combined, the country distribution of changes in FDI stocks was useless

for explaining relative changes in the distribution of employment and fixed assets, but much

better as a guide to absolute changes. When the comparison is confined to nonbank industries,

the changes in inward investment stocks are more closely related to relative changes in at least

fixed capital inputs. They provide a mediocre approximation to each of the two factor input

measures, but a better one to the combination of the two.

        The relation of the industry distribution of the U.S. inward investment stock to the

industry distribution of foreign-owned firms’ employment and physical capital stock in the

United States is much weaker (Table 4). The industry distribution of the inward stock explained

only about a quarter of the distribution of PP&E and less than 10 percent of the distribution of

employment in 1997, and much less of both inputs in 2002. The industry distribution of changes



                                                                                                    9
in the investment stock did a little better, explaining more than half of the percentage changes in

the fixed capital stock of affiliates and more than a quarter of changes in employment. The

degree of explanation of absolute changes in employment and physical capital stock was

considerably smaller.

       It would be desirable to perform similar calculations for other countries’ distributions of

FDI production or input against country and industry distributions of FDI stocks, but the data are

very thin and often not comparable in coverage. The most complete data are those for Germany,

published regularly in Deutsche Bundesbank (2006) and earlier issues, which go back to 1989.

Table 5 shows the relationships for 1995 and 2004, and for the change between those dates. We

do not show the calculations for the earlier period because many of the countries that later

became important destinations for German FDI were closed to it in the early period.

       As is true for the United States, the country distribution of the outward FDI stock is a

fairly good representation of the distribution of employment in both years, with some decline in

the accuracy of the representation. The relative change in country investment levels explained

about 60 percent of relative changes in employment, but the absolute growth in investment in a

country explained none of the absolute increase in employment.

       The industry distribution of German outward FDI is a poorer representation of the

industry distribution of employment than was the case for the country distribution, and the

correlation between the two measures deteriorated substantially from 1995 to 2004 (Table 6).

The change in investment in relative terms did reflect most of the relative change in employment,

but the change in absolute terms did not.

        For inward FDI in Germany, the distribution of employment among countries of origin

was extremely well measured by the country-of-origin distribution of investment stocks in both

1995 and 2004, with the RSQs over .90 in both years and only a slight decline in the RSQ

between the two years (Table 7). The distribution of employment change in relative or

percentage terms was less well predicted by the investment changes; less than half of the

distribution of absolute employment changes was explained by investment stock changes. The

distribution across industries of employment in foreign-owned firms was poorly explained by the

industry distribution of the inward investment stock, especially in 2004 (Table 8). Neither

absolute nor relative changes in the distribution of employment were well correlated with the

changes in the industry distribution of investment.

       A comparison for inward FDI in France, based on data in OECD (2001) and (2004),

shows that the country distribution of the inward investment stock explains about 85 percent of

the country distribution of employment in 1998. However, the industry distribution of the

investment stock explained less than 30 percent of a very aggregated industry distribution of

employment.

       On the whole, it appears that while the country distribution of outward and inward FDI

stocks roughly approximates those of inputs into outward and inward FDI production, the

industry distribution does not. And changes in the country and industry distributions of outward

and inward FDI stocks explain little of changes in the country or industry distributions of

production of affiliates abroad or foreign affiliates in a host country, and are therefore unreliable

guides to such changes.

Tax Havens and the Measurement of FDI Production

       The European Union has held some discussions about the possibility of introducing a

standard way of allocating corporate tax bases among countries for companies that operate in

more than one country. The motivation for the proposals is, of course, taxation rather than

measurement, but the issues that arise for taxation involve some of the same questions about the



                                                                                                   12
location of multinational firm activity. They involve the difference between measures of the

actual location of production and the location shown by company accounts, tax returns, and

reports on the location of FDI. A recent study of German firms ( Fuest, Hemmelgarn, and Ramb,

2006), using the Deutsche Bundesbank’s data on foreign direct investment and matched data for

the domestic operations of German firms, calculated the effects of imposing a system of formula

apportionment of profits across countries in place of the reported country location of profits. The

study concluded that under such a uniform system, “…countries with special tax incentives for

MNCs …would lose tax base ….because, under the current S.A. (separate accounting) system,

these countries attract a share of the EU wide tax base which is higher than their share in real

economic activity…” Some examples of the change in each country’s share of the EU tax base

under formula allocation are shown in Table 9.

        Under the formula apportionment described in the paper, countries that had attracted FDI

stocks, but not FDI production, by favorable tax treatment would lose large parts of their shares

of EU-15 profits. Ireland would lose almost 40 percent, Netherlands,

two thirds, and Sweden, 45 percent. High tax countries would gain share, 7 percent for

Germany, and almost 20 percent for Great Britain.

        Although the type of formula apportionment proposed does not undo, or compensate for,

all the effects of tax avoidance maneuvers, it does reveal that because German firms allocate

their profits to minimize their tax bills, their accounts do not give a realistic picture of the

location of their production. Since company accounts are the ultimate basis for FDI data, the

misrepresentation of location in those accounts leads to a similar distortion of the estimates of

the location of FDI activity and of aggregate production.

        What in the accounts of multinational firms produces these large differences between the

location of FDI represented by FDI stocks and flows and the location of FDI activity represented

by employment and capital assets in FDI affiliates? The main factor appears to be that firms

operating internationally shift assets and sales nominally to low-tax countries to minimize taxes.

I refer to these shifts as nominal because they are bookkeeping transactions that have no

counterpart in movements of production.

        The nature of these transactions is obscured in most countries’ accounts because they are

mixed in with more genuine movements of real resources, and hard to distinguish from them.

However, certain small tax havens have so little real productive activity taking place within their

borders that the tax-avoiding transactions can be observed clearly. These small tax havens may

not account for most of the world’s tax avoidance activity, but they can reveal the way in which




                                                                                                    14
it takes place and the kind of effect it has on the measurement of the location of multinational

firms’ production.

        There has been a substantial literature on the operations of tax havens, mostly involving

their impact on home country tax revenue rather than their impact on the measurement of the

location of production. Hines (2005) reviews some of this literature on the effect of low tax rates

in attracting inward FDI, some of which involves production, but much of which involves only

the shifting of income to reduce tax bills. The 30 tax havens he lists accounted in 1999 for 0.7

percent of the world’s population, and 2.1 percent of world GDP , but for 4.8 percent of the net

property, plant, and equipment and 3.7 percent of the employment of US firms’ foreign affiliates.

The shares of fixed capital and employment probably represent the effect of low tax rates in

attracting FDI production, and are not of concern with respect to the measurement of the location

of production. However, these same foreign affiliates accounted for 15.7 percent of the gross

foreign assets of US affiliates , 13.4 percent of sales, and “…a staggering 30 percent of total

foreign income…” (ibid., p. 78). “Much of the tax haven income consists of financial flows from

other foreign affiliates that parents own indirectly through their tax haven affiliates. Clearly,

American firms locate considerable financial assets in foreign tax havens, and their reported

profitability in tax havens greatly exceeds any measure of their physical presence there” (ibid.).

Desai, Foley, and Hines (2003) explain this contrast as “…the ability of multinational firms to

adjust the reported location of their taxable profits” (p. 68), but the result is also a change in the

reported location of production.

        The ability of firms to shift the reported location of financial and intangible assets, sales,

and profits by paper transactions internal to the firm makes the location of the firm’s production

ambiguous. That is particularly the case in banking and other financial services where the




                                                                                                     15
product is intangible, but the problem exists in other industries where the product is tangible, but

has an intangible element, such as a patent or a trademark that can be assigned by the firm to a

low-tax location, or where part of the revenue consists of profits earned from financial holdings

of the same firm’s affiliates in other countries.

       An example of the shifting of intangible assets that was reported in the press, that cannot

be verified from published data, but illustrates the possibilities, was the reported allocation of

intellectual property by Microsoft to an Irish subsidiary. According to the press report, the

subsidiary collected licensing fees from Microsoft sales to many other countries (“Microsoft

Slashes Taxes With Aid From Irish Unit,” Wall Street Journal, November 7, 2005, p. 1). The

subsidiary had “…a thin roster of employees…” and the software had mostly been developed

outside Ireland, but the subsidiary “…controls more than $16 billion in Microsoft assets” (ibid.).

       Whatever the precise mechanism, the move seemed to be a success. The subsidiary, with

few employees and little in the way of facilities, reported over 3 billion Euros in pretax profits

for fiscal 2004. Another U.S. company’s affiliate, with only one employee, reported earnings of

475 million Euros (“Microsoft Unit is No. 1 Earner In Ireland,” Wall Street Journal, December

20, 2005). In 2006, the Microsoft subsidiary was reported to have applied to reorganize in such

a way as to avoid the necessity for filing “…detailed public statements of their accounts”

(“Microsoft Reorganizes Irish Units to Reduce Disclosure of Assets,” Wall Street Journal, March

11-12, 2006).

       The shifting of intangible assets need not be confined to software. One news article

referred to “…patents on drugs, ownership of corporate logos, techniques for manufacturing

processes, and other intellectual assets…” and quoted a tax lawyer as calling such moves routine

“…international tax planning 101.” He added that “… most of the assets that are going to be




                                                                                                     16
relocated as part of a global repositioning are intellectual assets… that is where most of the profit

is. When you buy a pair of sneakers for $250, it’s the swoosh symbol, not the rubber, you pay

for.” (“Key Company Assets Moving Offshore,” New York Times, Nov. 22, 2002).

       The allocation of assets within US multinationals is illustrated by Table 10, showing the

ratios of total assets to measures of labor input, employment and payroll, of US-owned affiliates

in the world as a whole outside the United States, and in certain countries, particularly some of

those known as tax havens. Affiliates in “Other Western Hemisphere,” essentially islands in the

Caribbean, own enormous assets relative to their labor input, measured by employment or labor

compensation. The average assets per employee in US affiliates around the world in 2004 was

$873,000 but the ratios in Ireland, Netherlands, and Switzerland were all over $3.3 million.

Assets per employee in affiliates in “Other Western Hemisphere” were almost $12 million,

higher in some of the individual countries in that group, such as Bermuda (almost $73 million)

and UK Islands in the Caribbean (over $30 million).

       Differences in assets per employee could represent simply differences in industry

composition, because some industries, especially financial institutions, are particularly capital

intensive, whatever their ownership or their geographical location. In the data on US affiliates

abroad, it is possible to check whether the same wide geographical differences in assets per

employee exist within the financial sector.

       In the case of Depository Institutions, the world average assets per employee in US

affiliates in 1999 were a little over $10 million, while affiliates in “Other Western Hemisphere”

owned assets per employee of $117 million, more than ten times the world average (Table 11).

        For affiliates in Finance (except depository institutions), and Insurance, world average

assets per employee of affiliates in 2004 were about $11 million, but they were twice to three

times the world average in Netherlands and Switzerland (Table 12). In Bermuda and UK Islands

in the Caribbean, affiliate assets per worker were almost four to ten times the world average in

1999, and in 2004, affiliates in Bermuda had assets per worker15 times the average. Thus, the

allocation of assets to tax havens is not simply a consequence of the composition of

concentration of investment in the finance sector, but takes place within that sector as well.

        The point of these calculations is not that labor and tangible capital are the only inputs

that produce the output of these affiliates. The output may be produced mostly by intangible or

financial assets, but the geographical location of these assets, and therefore of the production, is

ambiguous. Do we wish to say that the location of output has changed because, for example,

firms have chosen to place their holdings of their affiliates’ stock in their Irish subsidiaries? Do

we wish to say that the location of output has changed because firms have chosen to place

ownership of their patents or corporate logos, which they use all around the world, in Ireland or

in some Caribbean Island?

        What kinds of assets were involved in these shifts to low tax countries? They were not

property, plant and equipment, as can be seen in Table 13. Worldwide, US affiliates’ total assets

were about ten times PP&E in 2004, but they were twenty to forty-five times as large as PP&E in

Ireland, Netherlands, and Switzerland, and 50 times as large in Other Western Hemisphere.

Most of the affiliate assets, especially in the low-tax countries, are intangible or financial assets.

Since it is hard to define the location of these assets, one could say that only statistical

convention places the output from them in these affiliates’ host countries.

       One outcome of the placement of assets is shown in Table 14, which displays the “profit-

type return” of nonbank majority-owned affiliates in various countries relative to the

compensation of employees in 1999 and 2004. The “profit –type return” is defined by the BEA

as measuring “…profits before income taxes…” excluding “… nonoperating items (such as

special charges and capital gains and losses) and income from equity, investments” (U.S. Bureau

of Economic Analysis, 2004, p. M-19). The worldwide average in 2004 was .79, a little over

three quarters of labor compensation, but for Ireland profit-type return was almost 5 times

employee compensation. For countries in “Other Western Hemisphere” as a group, profit-type

returns were 13 times employee compensation, and for some of the individual island countries,

they were as high as 40 or 70 times employee compensation. In these countries, the affiliates

managed to produce profits virtually without labor and without tangible capital, and all of these

differences would probably be larger if income from equity were added.

       Is this what we want to define and measure as the location of production?

“Residence” and the Location of Production

       The keys to the disconnection between the location of multinationals’ production and the

apparent location of investment in affiliates and the location of affiliate production are the

concept of residence in the balance of payments and the extent to which intangible assets, with

no clearly definable physical location, and financial assets, for which the location is a matter of

bookkeeping, have become important inputs into production.

       The problems with the definition of residence are old ones for the calculation of the

balance of payments. The Review Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics (1965)

suggested that “balance of payments data are peculiarly elusive” because “The basic criterion for

a balance of payments transaction is that it is between a domestic and a foreign ‘resident’…The

application of this set of concepts to concrete situations may involve subtle distinctions, and it is

often difficult to determine residence even when all the facts are known” (pp. 16-17).

        The residence of an enterprise requires (IMF, 1993, p. 22) “…a significant amount of

production of goods and/or services there…” or ownership of land or buildings. The location of

production of some goods is fairly easily defined and observed, but the location of the production

of services is not, if the services are produced by intangible assets. The same is true to some

extent of goods, if both tangible and intangible assets are used in production. Whether the

intangible assets are financial assets, including shares in related affiliates in other countries, or

patents or corporate logos or production techniques, their location is decided by the owners, and

can be attributed to an affiliate in any country the parent firm finds desirable. The output from

that asset appears to come from residents of that country. If the firm finds it convenient, it can

shift the nominal location of that production, affecting exports and imports and national product,

without any change in the labor or physical inputs to that production. Production that has taken

place in a home country for home country consumption can be made to appear to take place

abroad and be imported into the home country, without any change in the location of any real

inputs. (For an example, see “Behind Big Wall Street Failure: An Unregulated Bermuda Unit,”

Wall Street Journal, July 3, 2006, p. A1. “Refco Capital Markets was incorporated in

Bermuda…it employed no one at all at its headquarters address in Bermuda. New York-based

employees ran the unit”).

        This issue of where production takes place, or the “attribution of assets” has attracted

attention mainly in the taxation literature. Recently, the OECD has undertaken various meetings

and publications on ways to avoid “…double taxation and non-taxation situations.” (OECD,

2006, p. 2). The interest in “non-taxation” or “less than single taxation” (p. 10) is relatively new.




                                                                                                        25
The issue was traditionally the avoidance of double taxation, which the OECD traces back to

“League of Nations drafts of 1927,…).

       In its latest publication on the subject, the OECD authors begin their section on

“Attribution of Assets” with the statement that “…it is necessary to hypothesize the PE

(Permanent Establishment) as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise…The factual position

is that no one part of an enterprise owns assets; they belong to the enterprise as a whole. It is

therefore necessary under the first step of the authorized OECD approach to find a means of

attributing economic ownership.” (p. 15). They reject the alternative that would “…allow

taxpayers to simply nominate which part of the enterprise economically owns the assets” because

it would “…provide an incentive for taxpayers to attribute economic ownership of taxes in ways

that would lead to inappropriate allocations of profit…” They report a consensus that assets

“…are to be attributed to the part of the enterprise which performs the significant people

functions relevant to the determination of economic ownership of assets.”

Concluding Remarks

       While the consequences of shifts of assets and profits for tax revenues have been the

subject of considerable discussion (see, for example, OECD, 1993), the consequences for

economic measurement are rarely mentioned. Some of the consequences for measurement of

trade in services are discussed in Lipsey (2006). The effects extend to the measurement of trade

in goods, because goods trade often incorporates returns to the intangible assets owned by

producing multinational firms, and the intangible assets can, on paper, be moved freely. The

effects extend also more broadly to the measurement of national product and, within countries, to

measurements of regional output.




                                                                                                    26
       The ownership-based current account for the United States, explained in Landefeld,

Whichard, and Lowe (1993), the latest version of which appears in US Bureau of Economic

Analysis (2007), partly solves the problem for an alternative balance of payments measure by

locating production according to the ownership of the productive resources or of the firm in

which production takes place, rather than the geographical location of the resources. In this way,

they net out the effects of transfers of assets and profits among units of the firm. However, these

accounts are not intended as substitutes for the standard accounts but only as supplementary

information. And being aimed at an ownership measure, rather than a measure of the geography

of production, such as national product, they allocate some part of affiliate production to the

country of the parent rather than the country in which the production takes place.

       The measurement difficulty goes beyond the distortions from tax-avoiding strategies.

The underlying problem is that as production comes to depend more and more on intangible,

particularly intellectual, assets, the location of production loses much of its meaning, because

these assets have no clear geographical location. They may be located within a firm, by

ownership, but if the firm is multinational, that ownership has no definite geographical

implication. The tangible inputs to production can be associated with geographical locations, but

not the intangible inputs, except in some arbitrary fashion.

       The same issue arises for measures of regional production within a country. Some of the

approximations used in the last 80 years of regional estimates for the United States are briefly

described in Lipsey (2006), but none of them seem very satisfactory.

       For purposes where a geographical measure of production is desired, one possible

alternative to accepting the firm’s allocation of assets might be to attribute intangible and

financial assets to the home, or main, location of a multinational firm (itself not always a clear




                                                                                                     27
concept), or even to the location of its owners, rather than to the location chosen by the firm.

Another possibility, along the lines of the OECD’s suggestion that assets should be attributed to

the parts of the firm that perform the relevant “significant people functions,” might be to allocate

them by in proportion to payroll, as representing something like employment weighted by skill.

       Such attributions would upset long traditions of both corporate and national accounting.

In the meantime, changes in the nature of productive assets, in combination with tax planning,

are eating away at the meaning of standard measures of the location of production.
