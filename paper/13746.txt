Preference Heterogeneity and Insurance Markets: Explaining a Puzzle of Insurance
David M. Cutler, Amy Finkelstein, and Kathleen McGarry
NBER Working Paper No. 13746
January 2008
JEL No. G22,I11

                                              ABSTRACT

Standard theories of insurance, dating from Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976), stress the role of adverse
selection in explaining the decision to purchase insurance. In these models, higher risk people buy
full or near-full insurance, while lower risk people buy less complete coverage, if they buy at all. While
this prediction appears to hold in some real world insurance markets, in many others, it is the lower
risk individuals who have more insurance coverage. If the standard model is extended to allow individuals
to vary in their risk tolerance as well as their risk type, this could explain why the relationship between
insurance coverage and risk occurrence can be of any sign, even if the standard asymmetric information
effects also exist. We present empirical evidence in five difference insurance markets in the United
States that is consistent with this potential role for risk tolerance. Specifically, we show that individuals
who engage in risky behavior or who do not engage in risk reducing behavior are systematically less
likely to hold life insurance, acute private health insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, and
Medigap. Moreover, we show that the sign of this preference effect differs across markets, tending
to induce lower risk individuals to purchase insurance in some of these markets, but higher risk individuals
to purchase insurance in others. These findings suggest that preference heterogeneity may be important
in explaining the differential patterns of insurance coverage in various insurance markets.

1. Introduction

    The textbook approach to insurance markets emphasizes the role of private information about risk in

determining who purchases insurance. In the classic adverse selection model of Rothschild and Stiglitz

(1976), individuals with higher expected claims buy more insurance than those with lower expected claims,

who may be out of the market entirely. This basic prediction of asymmetric information models of a

“positive correlation” between insurance coverage and accident occurrence has been shown to be robust to a

variety of extensions to the standard framework (Chiappori and Salanie 2000, Chiappori et al. 2006).

    Evidence of this positive correlation has been found in several insurance markets, particularly acute

health insurance and annuities.1 Yet it many other insurance markets, those with more insurance appear to

have the same or lower occurrences of the insured risk than those with less insurance. This phenomenon of

“advantageous selection” has been documented in both large insurance markets such as life insurance

(Cawley and Philipson 1999, McCarthy and Mitchell 2003) and Medigap insurance (Hurd and McGarry

1997, Ettner 1997, Fang et al. 2006), and in extremely thin markets such as long-term care insurance

(Finkelstein and McGarry 2006) and reverse mortgages (Davidoff and Welke 2005). Moreover advantageous

selection has been detected in an insurance market despite evidence that, as in the standard asymmetric

information models, individuals also have private information about their risk type that is positively

correlated with insurance demand (Finkelstein and McGarry, 2006). This discrepancy between theory and

reality is even more striking given that moral hazard would tend to increase the risk occurrence of those with

more insurance relative to those with less.

    A potential explanation for this puzzle is that individuals may vary in their tolerance for risk in addition

to their riskiness. When individuals are heterogeneous in their preferences as well as their risk type, the

relationship between insurance coverage and risk occurrence can be of any sign (e.g. Fang et al., 2006,

Finkelstein and McGarry 2006, Chiappori et al., 2007, Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf, 2007, Jullien et al.,

1
 Cutler and Zeckhauser (2000) review a large literature that tends to find a positive correlation between insurance
coverage and risk occurrence in health insurance, although important exceptions such as Cardon and Hendel (2001)
exist. Evidence of the positive correlation in annuities has been documented in the U.S. (Mitchell et al., 199), the U.K.
(Finkelstein and Poterba 2002, 2004, and 2006) and in Japan (McCarthy and Mitchell 2003).


                                                                                                                            2
2007). For example, individuals with lower tolerance for risk may not only demand more insurance but may

also invest in activities that lower their expected claims. Such preference effects could offset standard

asymmetric information effects to produce an advantageously selected equilibrium in which those with lower

expected claims demand more insurance; as a result, the insurance market may exhibit over-insurance

relative to the first best, rather than the under-insurance of classic, uni-dimensional adverse selection models

(de Meza and Webb 2001).

    When risk type is endogenous to risk tolerance, the correlation between preferences for insurance and

expected claims need not be the same across markets. A risk averse person might invest in annuities and as

well as engage in behaviors that decrease mortality; thus, for annuity purchasers there would be a positive

correlation between insurance holdings and the insured risk of living a long time. The same person might

also buy life insurance, however, leading to a negative correlation between the mortality risk that life

insurance insures and life insurance holdings. Whether this potential countervailing preference effect

materializes in practice, and whether it is large enough to offset the standard asymmetric information effects,

is an empirical question.2

    The existing evidence is consistent with a potentially important role for preference heterogeneity in

understanding insurance market equilibria. A growing empirical literature has found evidence of substantial

preference heterogeneity in insurance demand. Examples include automobile insurance (Cohen and Einav

2007), long-term care insurance (Finkelstein and McGarry 2006), reverse mortgages (Davidoff and Welke

2005), Medigap (Fang, Keane and Silverman 2006), and annuities (Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf 2007).

These papers raise the possibility that heterogeneity in preferences may be as or more important than

heterogeneity in risk in explaining insurance demand. They also suggest that the correlation between

preferences for insurance and expected claims is not the same across markets. For example, in both annuities

and auto insurance there is evidence that those with greater preferences for insurance have higher expected


2
  For example, it is not a priori clear that more risk averse individuals will invest more in activities that lower their
expected claims. Preventive activity has a first order effect on the mean of the risk distribution; more risk averse
individuals care about reducing the variance of this distribution, which may be positively or negatively correlated with
the mean (see e.g. Dionne and Eeckhoudt, 1985 and Jullien et al., 1999).


                                                                                                                            3
insurance claims, which would reinforce the standard asymmetric information effect (Einav, Finkelstein and

Schrimpf, 2007; Cohen and Einav, 2007). However, in Medigap, long-term care insurance and reverse

mortgages, those with higher preferences for insurance appear to have lower expected claims, creating

offsetting advantageous selection (Fang et al, 2006, Finkelstein and McGarry 2006, Davidoff and Welke

2005). These findings raise the possibility that differences in the relationship between preferences and

expected claims may help explain the observed differences in whether the market appears advantageously or

adversely selected.

    In this paper, we examine the relation between risky behaviors, insurance purchases, and risk occurrence

in five different insurance markets: life insurance, acute health insurance, annuities, long-term care

insurance, and Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap). The analysis is highly complementary to the

studies of individual insurance markets discussed above. Indeed, the same data source was used in earlier

studies of long term care insurance (Finkelstein McGarry 2006) and Medigap (Fang et al. 2006), although we

examine a different set of preference measures. Our main contribution is to show results across several

different insurance markets using a common data set and empirical framework.

1. Data and empirical framework

    Our analysis uses individual-level data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We use the sample

of people aged 51 to 61 in 1992 to examine the holding of term life insurance and private acute health

insurance among prime-age individuals. We use a second HRS cohort, the Asset and Health Dynamics

(AHEAD) sample, to examine Medigap insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuities among people

aged 65 to 90 in 1995. We use the panel nature of these data to track mortality and nursing home outcomes

for individuals in both panels through 2002. Table 1 presents key summary statistics for each sample.3 The

average age in our 1992 HRS sample is 56 and in the 1995 AHEAD sample it is 79.

    Our basic test is to examine how measures of risk tolerance are related to the occurrence of risk,

and to whether the individual has insurance. Risk tolerance is not easily measured. We proxy for

3
 We use individual sample weights when calculating the means. The regressions presented later in the paper are
unweighted.


                                                                                                                 4
risk tolerance using five measures of behaviors that likely capture individual risk aversion:

smoking; drinking; job-based mortality risk; receipt of preventive health care; and use of seat belts.

While each of these variables will reflect factors in addition to risk tolerance, results that are

consistent across the variables suggest that risk tolerance is an important part of their variability.

    We show results from two main types of analysis, designed to examine, respectively, the relationship

between risk tolerance and insurance demand, and between risk toleranceand risk occurrence. We therefore

estimate the following two equations by OLS:

    1(insurance) i = β 0 + β 1 Behaviori + X i Γ + ε i                                           (1)

     Riskoccurencei = α 0 + α 1 Behaviori + X i Π + η i                                          (2)

In these equations 1(insurance) i is an indicator variable for whether the individual has a particular type of

insurance, Riskoccurencei is a measure of the occurrence of the risk the insurance in question would cover,

Behaviori is one of our measures of risk tolerance, and X represents covariates. We describe each in more

detail in turn.

1.1 Insurance and risk occurrence measures

    We measure life insurance by whether the individual has term life insurance in the 1992 HRS;

approximately 50 percent of the sample has this insurance.4 The risk occurrence measure for life insurance is

whether the individual dies between 1992 and 2002; 13 percent die.

    We measure acute private health insurance in the 1992 HRS by whether the individual has private health

insurance through a current or former employer, a spouse’s employer, or the non-group market; we exclude

individuals who report coverage through a government program (e.g. Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPUS or

CHAMPVA) from the analysis of the acute health insurance market. About 86 percent of the sample has

acute private health insurance; of this 86, the vast majority (82 percent) have employment-related coverage.

The corresponding risk occurrence measure is whether the individual reports any hospital use in the previous

4
  Another 21 percent own whole life insurance but no term policy. We focus on term life insurance which is a pure
insurance vehicle, rather than whole life insurance which combines an insurance vehicle with a savings instrument.


                                                                                                                     5
two years; 9 percent of the sample does. Hospital use is a strong predictor of medical expenses, which is the

actual insured risk but which we do not directly observe in the data.

    Our third measure of insurance, from the AHEAD, is whether an individual has an annuity in 1995.

Approximately 7% of the 1995 AHEAD sample has an annuity.5 The corresponding risk occurrence measure

is the opposite of that for life insurance, specifically whether the individual survives from 1995 to 2002; 62

percent of the sample survives.

    Fourth, we measure whether the individual has Medicare supplemental coverage (termed Medigap) in the

1995 AHEAD. Medigap policies cover many of the expenses not insured by Medicare, including coinsurance

and deductibles.6 We define an individual as having Medigap if he has a (non-government provided) health

insurance policy in addition to Medicare.7 Nearly 70 percent of the sample has Medigap coverage. Our

corresponding risk occurrence measure is the medical expenses reported in 1995 arising from hospital and

doctor visits that could have been covered by a Medigap policy; the mean is $911.8

    Finally, we define an individual has having long term care insurance in the 1995 AHEAD if they answer

a question about this coverage affirmatively.9 About 10 percent have long term care insurance. The

corresponding risk occurrence measure is whether the individual goes into a nursing home between 1995 and

2002; about one-quarter of the sample does.

1.2 Behavior measures

5
  Holding an annuity is defined as an affirmative answer to a question in the survey asking if he has annuity income
from a source other than Social Security or a Defined Benefit Pension. Because our sample for this analysis consists of
those aged 65 or older, we do not believe that many will start receiving annuity payments at a later date.
6
  During the period of time covered by our data, some Medigap policies also provided prescription drug coverage.
7
  The question asks, “Not counting long-term care insurance or [Medicare, Medicaid, government health insurance] do
you have any health insurance that pays any part of hospital or doctor bills? (Sometimes this is called a Medi-Gap
policy).”
8
  The HRS reports the number of doctor and hospital visits an individual experienced since the previous interview
(approximately 2 years). To translate these numbers into an estimate of expenditures not covered by Medicare we
assume an uncovered (by Medicare) expenditure of $100 for the first and second doctor visit in a two year period (i.e.
the annual Medicare part B deductible in 1995) and $20 for each additional visit (i.e. the 20% part B coinsurance). We
also assume a cost of $716 for each hospital visit (ie.. the Medicare Part A deductible in 1995). No attempt is made to
account for hospital stays beyond 60 days at which a copayment kicks in; this is a very rare event in our sample. We do
not attempt to measure other potentially covered expenses such as prescription drugs. We do not also impute total
spending for acute health insurance as it would require more detailed information than is available about medical care
utilization.
9
  The question in the 1995 wave of AHEAD is “Aside from the government programs, do you now have any insurance
which specifically pays any part of long-term care, such as, personal or medical care in the home or in a nursing home?


                                                                                                                      6
     We have five behavior measures that we observe in both the HRS and AHEAD samples. Three are

measures of risky behavior: (1) whether the individual currently smokes (2) whether the individual has a

drinking problem (defined as three or more drinks per day), and (3) the mortality rate per 100,000 employees

in the individual’s industry-occupation cell (for the HRS) or occupation cell (for the AHEAD).10 On

average, in our 1992 sample of near-elderly, 27 percent of people smoke, 5 percent have a drinking problem,

and the average mortality risk by industry-occupation cell is 4 fatalities per 100,000 employees. Smoking

rates are lower in the elderly (7.6 percent of the sample), reflecting the strong difference in mortality by

smoking status at older ages.

     We also construct two measures of active steps individuals can take to reduce mortality and healthy risk:

(1) the fraction of gender-appropriate preventive health activity undertaken,11 and (2) whether the individual

reports always wearing a seat belt. For our 1995 AHEAD sample, we observe these measures

contemporaneously in 1995. Unfortunately, for the 1992 HRS sample, these measures are first available in

1996. Our analysis of the preventive health behaviors and seat belt use for the 1992 insurance variables

therefore suffers from potential sample selection bias; to observe this behavior the individual must survive

until 1996. On average in the 1992 HRS sample, individuals undertake 60 percent of gender-appropriate

health activities, and 80 report always wearing a seat belt. For the 1995 AHEAD sample, the figures are 65

percent and 83 percent.

     We examine both the simple, unconditional bivariate relationship between each of these behaviors and

either insurance coverage or risk occurrence. We also report results in which we control for covariates (X)

designed to capture the risk classification used by insurers. Conditioning on the characteristics used in

pricing insurance is crucial for papers testing the predictions of standard adverse selection models, as these



10
    The mortality rates are from Viscusi (2003), who uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal
Occupational Injuries. We define industry-occupation cells (or occupation alone) based on current job (if any),
including self employment. If the individual is not currently employed we use the most recent job or, if this variable is
missing, the most significant prior attachment. If the individual has never held a job (or all of these measures are
missing) the measure of industry-occupation mortality risk is missing.
 11
    These activities are: whether the individual had a flu shot; had a blood test for cholesterol; checked her breasts for
lumps monthly; had a mammogram or breast x-ray; had a Pap smear; had a prostate screen. See Finkelstein and
McGarry (2006) for a study using these variables in this manner.


                                                                                                                             7
predictions are about how people behave conditional on the menu of contracts they face (Chiappori and

Salanie, 2000). However, when examining the influence of preferences on insurance demand and risk type,

the unconditional relationships may be of greater interest, since we are primarily interested in how

preferences mediate the insurance – risk occurrence relationship through their impact on both risky behavior

and insurance valuation. We thus emphasize the unconditional relationships although we present the

conditional relationships as well for completeness and for comparability with the existing literature.

Appendix A describes the risk classification controls in detail.

2. Results

2.1 Insurance demand and risky behavior

     Table 2 examines the relationship between the various behaviors and each of the five insurance products.

It reports the results from estimating equation (1) both with (even columns) and without (odd columns)

conditioning variables. The results are remarkably consistent across behavior measures and across insurance

types. Individuals who engage in more risky behavior are systematically less likely to have each type of

insurance; the results are not sensitive to whether or not we control for risk classification.

     The relationships between risky behavior and insurance coverage are particularly strong for preventive

health activity and seat belt use – which are positively and statistically significantly correlated with having

each insurance product – and for the mortality rate of the individual’s industry-occupation cell – which is

negatively and statistically significantly correlated with each type of insurance coverage. Similar patterns are

present – but are somewhat less robust – for smoking and drinking. Smokers are statistically significantly

less likely to have life insurance, annuities, Medigap, and private health insurance, but there is no discernable

relationship between smoking and long-term care insurance. Individuals who drink are almost always less

likely to have each type of insurance, but the results are rarely statistically significant.12

     Our interpretation of these findings is that more risk averse individuals both invest in more risk reducing

(less risky) behavior and value insurance more. Consistent with this, we find suggestive evidence of a

12
  Both smoking and drinking are thought to be addictive and altering one’s behavior along these dimensions is likely to
be more difficult that deciding to wear a seat belt or get a flu shot. They may therefore be less representative of current
preferences than other variables.


                                                                                                                          8
negative relationship between risk aversion and risky behavior. As a proxy for risk aversion, we use the

respondents’ answers to questions concerning their willingness to engage in various hypothetical income

gambles.13 This variable is available only for the 1992 HRS sample. Based on the answers, we form four

ordinal categorical variables of decreasing risk aversion and examine their relationship with risky behavior.

About 65 percent of the sample falls in the most risk averse category; the remainder are roughly evenly split

across the other three risk aversion categories.

     Table 3 reports our results concerning the relationship between various risky behaviors and these ordinal

measures of risk aversion. Overall, the evidence suggests that those who are in the least risk averse category

are more likely to engage in various risky behaviors (or less likely to engage in risk reducing behaviors) than

those in the most risk averse category, although the differences are statistically significant only for the risky

behaviors measures, and not for the risk reducing behaviors.14

2.2 Risky behavior and risk occurrence

     Table 4 examines the relationship between risky behavior and risky outcomes, equation (2) above. As in

Table 2, we report both unconditional and conditional estimates, and focus on the unconditional estimates.

     The first two panels examine the relationship between more risky (less risk reducing) behaviors and

mortality in the life insurance sample (Panel A) and the annuity sample (Panel B). The results show a broad

pattern that more risky behavior (smoking, drinking, and higher mortality occupations and industries) is

associated with (usually statistically significantly) higher mortality, and that investment in risk reducing

behavior (preventive health activity or seat belt wearing) is associated with (usually statistically significant)

lower mortality. These findings suggest that preferences for insurance – and their differential relationship

with risk in life insurance and annuities – may be able to explain the different patterns observed in these two



13
   The survey questions as respondents if they would be willing to trade a good job with a steady income equal to their
current family income for a new job with a “50-50 chance it will double your (family) income and a 50-50 chance that it
will cut your (family) income by a third.” A second question increases or decreases the possible gain / loss in income
depending on the response to the initial question. These responses can be used to group people into four risk-tolerance
categories.
14
   Using additional assumptions (e.g. that the utility function exhibits constant relative risk aversion) and data, Barksy et
al. (1997) construct measures of average risk tolerance for the four categories and find even more pronounced
relationships between risk aversion and risky behaviors than what we report using the ordinal measures.


                                                                                                                           9
markets of the relative risk profile of those with more insurance. Individuals who engage in less risky (more

risk reducing) behavior demand both more life insurance and more annuities (Table 2) and have higher

mortality (Table 4). From the insurance company perspective, this makes them lower expected cost for life

insurance (less likely to die and make a claim), thus offsetting the standard adverse selection pattern, but

higher expected cost for annuities (less likely to die and stop making claims), thus reinforcing the standard

adverse selection pattern.

    Life insurance is one of the largest private insurance markets in the world. Previous work has

demonstrated that the market does not exhibit higher ownership rates among higher risk individuals, as

standard adverse selection or moral hazard models would predict (Cawley and Philipson 1999, McCarthy and

Mitchell 2003). Nor does variability in financial exposure explain ownership patterns (Bernheim et al. 2003a

2003b). Our empirical results suggest that heterogeneity in risk tolerance may be able to provide a sensible

explanation for the observed patterns of coverage. Specifically, we find that individuals who engage in more

risky behavior are both higher mortality risk and less likely to purchase insurance.

    Panel C examines at the relationship between behaviors and subsequent use of nursing homes. Although

there is no systematic relationship between risky behaviors and nursing home use, we find that individuals

who engage in more risk reducing behavior – be it preventive health activity or seat belt use – are less likely

to go into a nursing home between 1995 and 2002. This finding was previously documented by Finkelstein

and McGarry (2006) over a different time period, who argue that the link between more risk reducing

behavior, demand for insurance, and expected claims may explain why the insured do not, on average, have

higher nursing home use than the uninsured.

    Panel D looks at the relationship between the various behaviors and the risk Medigap insures of medical

expenditures not covered by Medicare. The results are mixed; some risky behaviors are correlated with

lower medical expenditures while others are correlated with higher medical expenditures; the same

ambiguity is present for the risk reducing behaviors. The results are similar if we use the number of doctor

visits or the number of nights spent in a hospital as the dependent variable (not shown). Some of these

behaviors therefore act to offset the standard asymmetric information effects, while others serve to reinforce


                                                                                                                10
them. Fang et al. (2006) have documented additional sources of advantageous selection in Medigap. In

particular, those with higher cognitive ability are both more likely to purchase Medigap and have lower

expected claims.

     Finally, Panel E looks at the relationship between the various behaviors and whether the individual

has any hospital use, which is an important component of the costs that acute private health

insurance would cover. The results are similar if we use the number of doctor visits or the number of

nights spent in a hospital as the dependent variable (not shown). Again the results are mixed; some risky

behaviors are correlated with lower utilization while others are correlated with higher utilization.

3. Interpretation and Conclusions

     Our analysis yields two main findings. First, in all five markets, we find that individuals who engage in

what are commonly thought of as risky behaviors (smoking, drinking, or prior employment in jobs with

higher mortality rates) or who do not take measures to thought to reduce risk (preventive health activities or

wearing of a seat belt) are systematically less likely to hold each of these insurance products.15 Second, we

find that these same individuals tend to have higher expected claims for life insurance and long term care

insurance, but lower expected claims for annuities; for Medigap and acute health insurance, there is no

systematic relationship between the behavior measures and expected claims.

     These results can help to explain the puzzle of insurance we started with: why is adverse selection not

more common? In annuity markets, there is clear evidence of adverse selection: people who live longer are

more likely to buy insurance. The standard adverse selection model is one explanation for this, but so is

variation in risk tolerance; people who have less risky behaviors live longer and are more likely to buy

annuities. In life insurance, our results suggest that differential risk tolerance can help explain why people

with lower mortality rates have more insurance. Similarly, in the case of long-term care insurance, people

who use more preventive care or are more likely to wear seat belts buy insurance more readily but also stay

15
   Here we use the term “risk” to denote the chance of what is generally considered to be an undesirable event for the
individual (namely, worse health or death). Of course, in the context of insurance purchasing, the “risk” depends on
what is being insured. For example, from the insurance company’s perspective a high mortality individual will be “high
risk” as a life insurance consumer but “low risk” as an annuity buyer.


                                                                                                                   11
out of nursing homes. For acute health insurance, the lack of any systematic offsetting effect of risk

tolerance may explain why the preponderance of studies have found that this market is, on net, adversely

selected. In the case of Medigap, other sources of advantageous selection than risk tolerance appear to be

necessary to understand why this market is on net advantageously selected; indeed, Fang, Keane and

Silverman (2006) have documented that those with higher cognitive ability are both more likely to purchase

Medigap and have lower expected claims.

    Overall, our findings suggest that preferences for insurance – and their impact on risk occurrence and

insurance purchase – may help explain the different patterns of selection observed in different insurance

markets. These preference effects thus provide a potential unifying explanation for the differential patterns in

insurance coverage across different markets.

    Our results have a number of implications. Most importantly, they suggest that in considering the nature

of market inefficiencies created by private information in insurance markets, the possibility of over-insurance

from advantageous selection should be considered in addition to the under-insurance concern of classic, uni-

dimensional adverse selection models. The implications of this for welfare have received some attention (de

Meza and Webb 2001) and are a fruitful subject for future research.

Number of observations varies across variables due to missing values. The number of observations is unweighted.
Individuals specific weights for 1992 and 1995 are used. The measure of any health insurance excludes those who are
covered by a government programs (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA). Medigap includes any health
insurance policy that supplements Medicare, it may be provided through a current or former employer (or spouse’s
employer) or privately purchased. Term life insurance includes those policies provided by an employer as well as
those purchased privately.

Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions. Dependent variable is given in panel headings. First row gives coefficient on right hand side variable listed at the
top of the column. All right hand side variables are measured in the year insurance is measured (1992 or 1995 as indicated) except for preventive health activity and
seat belt use for 1992 insurance coverage where they are measured in 1996. Additional controls consist of variables used by the insurance company to assess risk.
They vary by insurance market. For life insurance and long-term care insurance we use an array of health measures, age, smoking status, and sex. For annuities we use
age, spouse’s age and sex. For Medigap coverage we use age. See Appendix A for a complete listing of control variables. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
are in parentheses. ***, **, * denotes statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels respectively

which are measured in 1996; all right hand side variables in Panels C, D and E are measured in 1995. Additional controls consist of variables used by the insurance
company to assess risk. They vary by insurance market. For life insurance we use an array of health measures, age, smoking status, and sex. For annuities we use age,
spouse’s age and sex. See Appendix A for further information. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are in parentheses. ***, **, * denotes statistical significance
at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels respectively.

  costs not covered my medicare are proxied by $100 for the first and second doctor visit in a two year period and $20 for each additional visit + $716 (medicare
deductible in 1995) for each hospital visit. No attempt is made to account for stays beyond 60 days at which the copayment kicks in. ($179 for days 61-90) 8 people

Appendix A: Definitions of risk classification controls

In this appendix we provide a detailed description of the controls for risk that we use in each insurance
market. We base our decisions of which factors to include by inspection of the information insurers
collect and use in pricing premiums. We discuss, in turn, our controls in each market. We also verified
that our results are not sensitive to the addition or subtraction of many variables.

Life insurance classification risk: In the life insurance market the degree of underwriting
depends on the size of the policy and the age of the applicant. In cases in which there is
underwriting, the insured often undergoes an exam and / or receives a blood test. We include
dummy variables indicating low (below 20) and high (above 30) body mass index. We also
include indicators of difficulty with a series of activities of daily living (walking, getting in and
out of bed, bathing, dressing and eating and the total number of such limitations), high blood
pressure, diabetes or high blood sugar, whether the individual takes medication for diabetes, had
cancer (other than skin cancer) , lung disease, heart disease or a heart attack, takes medication for
heart disease, had a stroke, psychiatric problems, arthritis, asthma, kidney or bladder problems,
high cholesterol, or a bone fracture. As a measure of cognitive function we include the number of
words recalled immediately after having a list read and the number recalled after delay. We
include indicators of whether the individual is married, smokes, dummy variables for individual
ages, gender, male, number of limitations with respect to activities of daily living and an
indicator of their depressive state based on CESD scores as recommended by Mehta et al.
(2002).

Acute health insurance risk classification: Because health insurance is obtained primarily
through an employer, and there is no underwriting for employer provided coverage, we do not
conduct any analysis using control variables.

Annuity classification risk: In the United States, insurers providing annuities condition solely on
age and sex. We use a complete set of dummy variables, one for each possible age, sex of the
annuitant, and because many annuities are joint and survivor annuities (with benefits continuing
as long as either spouse is alive), we also include dummy variables for the age of the spouse.

LTCINS risk: Applications for long-term care insurance policies collect a large amount of
information on health status. We have indicators for nearly all such variables. Our controls
include, dummy variables for age and spouse’s age, whether the respondent is married, or male,
and dummy variables indicating low (below 20) and high (above 30) body mass index. We also
include indicators of difficulty with a series of activities of daily living (walking, bathing,
dressing, eating and toileting, and the total number of such limitations), indicators of use of
equipment to help with tasks (a wheelchair, walker, crutches, oxygen, or cane), difficulties with
grocery shopping or medication, the number of limitations with respect to instrumental activities
of daily living, whether the individual regularly takes prescription drugs, has been injured in a
fall, is incontinent, has kidney trouble, congestive heart failure, heart disease, high blood
pressure, diabetes, or takes medication for diabetes. Whether he has been diagnosed with cancer,
high blood pressure, arthritis, lung disease, currently smokes, has had a hip fracture, has
difficulty taking medication, has had a heart attack, takes heart medication, has had a stroke, has
psychiatric problems, is cognitively impaired or depressed (Mehta et al., 2002).

Medigap risk: There is no underwriting if a medigap policy is purchased at age 65. We control
solely for age.
