Equity Market Liberalizations as Country IPOs

                                           ABSTRACT

Equity market liberalizations are like IPOs, but they are IPOs of a country's stock market rather than
of individual firms. Both are endogenous events whose benefits are limited by poor investor
protection, agency costs, and information asymmetries. As for stock prices following an IPO, there

are legitimate concerns about the efficiency in the period following the liberalization of the stock
market returns of countries that liberalize their equity markets. Equity markets of liberalizing

countries experience extremely strong performance immediately after the liberalization, but then go
through a period of poor performance. This pattern of stock returns is more dramatic for countries
with poorer financial development before the liberalization.

           Equity market liberalizations make shares of common stock of local firms

available to a new class of investors, foreign investors. Initial public offerings (IPOs)

make shares in existing firms available to a new class of investors, the general public.

Equity market liberalizations and IPOs are therefore similar events in that they increase

the pool of investors who can invest in firms. We show in this paper that viewing equity

market liberalizations as country IPOs helps understand equity market liberalizations

better and raises important issues that future research should examine.

           Much of the focus of the literature on equity market liberalizations has been to

show that they increase stock prices and reduce the cost of capital.1 The literature on

IPOs has also shown that there is a substantial stock price increase when firms go public.

However, this literature has further been concerned with whether the market for IPO

stocks is efficient. There is a large controversial literature examining why firms

underperform broad stock market indices following IPOs.2 We show that countries that

liberalize their equity markets have dramatic positive returns in the year following the

liberalization, but these dramatic returns are followed by poor returns. This pattern of

returns raises the question of whether stock prices overreact to equity market

liberalizations. Further, the IPO literature has also tried to answer why some firms go

public while others do not. It has shown that firms go public because their owners benefit

from them doing so, but market conditions affect which firms go public and at times

market conditions are not receptive to IPOs. The literature on equity market

liberalizations has mostly ignored the issue of why some countries liberalize their equity

markets and others do not. We argue that equity market liberalizations do not necessarily

benefit the controlling shareholders of large firms in emerging markets, so that we would

expect some countries to abstain from liberalizing their equity market if controlling

shareholders of large firms have an important impact on the decision to liberalize.

Further, the benefits from equity market liberalizations are limited because investors are

poorly protected in emerging markets. This poor investor protection limits the extent to

which local firms can issue new equity to take advantage of the increase in the pool of

investors for their stock.

        The analogy between equity market liberalizations and IPOs has obvious

limitations. An IPO involves the issuance of shares that had no public market. As a result,

the IPO literature has studied extensively how the issue takes place and how it is priced.

Much of the IPO literature in the U.S. attempts to understand why the owners of firms

that go public leave money on the table at the time of the IPO through the underpricing of

the shares sold at that time. Equity market liberalizations have taken place without new

shares being sold by firms, and if new shares are sold, they might be secondary offerings

by firms whose shares are already traded. Liberalizations taking place through the

creation of a country fund involve an IPO, but this IPO typically does not involve the

issue of new shares by the firms of the liberalizing country. However, as for IPOs,

emerging market liberalizations enable firms to undertake offerings that otherwise they

would not have been able to undertake. Further, emerging market liberalizations make it

possible for private or public firms in the process of being privatized to go public when

they might not have been able to do so otherwise. When secondary offerings take place as

part of the emerging market liberalization or subsequently as a result of it, these offerings




                                             3
cannot be underpriced in the same way as IPO offerings because a market for the shares

already exists. As a result, the literature that deals with the pricing of the shares when

they are sold at the IPO has little relevance for emerging market liberalizations.

       The literature on equity market liberalizations has emphasized the risk-sharing

benefit of equity market liberalizations. As foreign investors invest in the stocks of

liberalizing countries, the risk of these stocks is shared among more investors. As local

investors bear less of the risk of local stocks, the risk premium on these stocks falls, their

price increases, and the country’s cost of capital is reduced. The literature has also been

concerned about whether equity market liberalizations increase stock return volatility, but

they do not seem to do so in a way that would justify concern. Given the clear benefits

and less decisive costs of equity market liberalizations, countries should be eager to

liberalize their equity markets, but few have done so fully. Further, Bekaert and Harvey

(2000) show that the cost of equity capital falls by roughly 100 basis points following

equity market liberalizations. In economic terms, the effect is therefore rather limited.

The risk-sharing benefit theory cannot explain why the number of countries that liberalize

their equity markets over the last twenty years is relatively small, why the impact of

equity liberalizations on the cost of capital has been so limited, and why long-run stock

returns of liberalizing countries behaved the way they did. We show that viewing equity

market liberalizations as country IPOs can help resolve these issues.

       The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we show the long-run behavior of

stock prices around liberalizations. In Section 2, we present an analysis of emerging

equity market liberalizations that, drawing on the comparison between IPOs and




                                              4
liberalizations, stresses the implications of emerging market corporate governance and

investor rights for equity market liberalizations. We conclude in Section 3.



1. Equity market liberalizations and stock prices.

    The existing literature makes the case that equity market liberalizations decrease the

cost of capital in two ways. First, Henry (2000a) shows that stock prices in liberalizing

countries increase sharply in the months preceding the liberalization date. This date is

when a liberalization event takes place rather than when investors discover that it will

happen, so that in an efficient market, the stock price impact of the liberalization should

be impounded in prices before the liberalization date. The results of Henry (2000a) are

consistent with investors applying a lower discount rate to future expected cash flows

after liberalization. Second, Bekaert and Harvey (2000) show that the dividend yield falls

after liberalization. If some assumptions are met, the dividend yield is a good proxy for

the cost of capital. Both studies conduct various tests to try to make sure that the

liberalization effect they identify is not due to confounding factors.

    We extend the analysis of the stock-price impact of liberalizations and investigate

whether there are similarities in long-run returns between countries that liberalize their

equity markets and IPO firms.3 In Figure 1, we show the equally-weighted average

cumulative buy-and-hold returns in excess of the risk-free rate of liberalizing countries

3
  Existing studies do not agree on equity market liberalization dates for a number of countries. Further,
these studies include different countries among the liberalized countries. Rather than attempting to sort out
the exact liberalization dates, we study the behavior of stock prices around the liberalization dates used by
Bekaert and Harvey (2000) and Henry (2000a), and exclude Japan and New Zealand to focus on emerging
markets. Other liberalization dates are provided by Kim and Singal (2000) and Levine and Zervos (1996).
Appendix A lists the liberalizations dates and the countries we use. An alternative approach would be to
use the dates of depository receipts offerings, which can be viewed as liberalizing events (see Karolyi
(2002)). The dates we use precede depository receipts offerings from firms in the countries we consider.
Foerster and Karolyi (2000) show that firms have poor returns after depository receipt offerings and
Errunza and Miller (2000) show that such offerings reduce the offering firm’s cost of capital.

from five years before the liberalization month until five years after the liberalization.

This is not a feasible investment strategy since investors did not know which country

would liberalize and which would not, but it provides an assessment of stock market

performance over the 11-year period surrounding the liberalization. The stock indices we

use are the S&P Emerging Markets Data Base (EMDB) Total Return Indices (U.S. dollar

denominated) from December 1975 to September 2000. These indices are not available

for all countries for the period we are looking at. Since we are looking for an estimate of

what an investor would have received in excess of the risk-free rate had she invested in a

liberalizing country starting five years before the liberalization, we only use the countries

for which data is available five years before the liberalization in the figure.4

        Investing in markets that liberalize pays off. The average cumulative buy-and-

hold excess return is 491% using the Bekaert and Harvey (2000) liberalization dates and

546% using the Henry (2000a) liberalization dates. This strong performance of

liberalizing countries supports the hypothesis that there is a risk-sharing benefit, but with

this hypothesis, we would expect the stock price gains to be incorporated as of the time of

the liberalization date. In Figure 1, returns are spectacular after the liberalization month.

The general pattern of cumulative returns is similar across countries. For instance, there

is no country whose omission from the sample would significantly affect Figure 1. At the

same time, however, the magnitude of the cumulative returns varies sharply across

countries – but the magnitude of cumulative returns varies also strongly across IPOs.

    The large returns of liberalizing countries after the liberalization date seem

incompatible with the workings of efficient markets since it would be possible for

4
  Our approach is exactly the same as the approach used by Ritter (1991) to estimate buy-and-hold returns
of IPO firms. When returns stop being available for a country, we average cumulative excess returns across
the remaining countries in the index.


                                                    6
investors to buy stocks in the liberalizing country immediately after the liberalization date

and benefit from the subsequent increase in prices. It is necessary to be cautious,

however, in interpreting these large returns because, at most, we have 20 liberalizing

countries and the event windows over which returns are calculated overlap among these

countries. With traditional event studies, the expectation is that when the number of

events with non-overlapping windows becomes large, idiosyncratic effects not associated

with the event wash out and the resulting event return captures the impact of the event on

stock prices. Here, the number of events is small, countries that liberalized may have

experienced similar economic shocks, and the clustering may be endogenous. It is also

well-known that emerging market returns have fat tails which complicate statistical

inference. Further, it is possible that it took time for the markets to learn the implications

of equity market liberalizations, so that they initially under-reacted to liberalization

events, but they may not do so in the future because investors now understand better the

implications of equity market liberalizations. Finally, one should be concerned about the

following bias. Except for Chile, the countries in our sample did not reverse their

liberalization in the short run.5 If markets were unconvinced that the liberalization would

last, so that initially investors believed there was a large probability that the liberalization

would be reversed, then stock prices would have reflected only partially the impact of the

liberalization initially and would have incorporated the benefits of the liberalization fully

only as investors became convinced that the liberalization would last.6



5
  In 1991 the Chilean central bank imposed a one-year unremunerated reserve requirement on foreign
funds. Between 1991 and 1997 the coverage of the requirement was extended to cover most forms of
foreign funding, with the exception of foreign direct investment. The rate of this requirement was 30% in
May 1992, and was lowered to 10% in June 1998 (Adams, et. al. 1998).
6
  Perotti and van Oijen (2001) discuss a similar concern in relation to the initiation of country privatization
programs where stock prices increased in value sharply after the initiation. Laeven and Perotti (2001)


                                                      7
    The striking returns of emerging markets around the liberalization date make it

surprising that so few countries have opened their equity markets to foreign investors.

Using the 2001 World Development Indicators CD from the World Bank, 36 emerging

countries with a population that exceeds 3 million with equity market data had not

liberalized their equity market by 1999, in contrast to 20 emerging countries that had

liberalized their equity market.

    Another way to look at the data is to compute the yearly average return on an equally-

weighted portfolio of countries starting five years before the liberalization year and

ending five years after the liberalization year. Using the Bekaert and Harvey (2000)

dates, we find that the liberalizing countries in our sample earn 13.44% per calendar year

before the liberalization year, 67.60% the year of the liberalization, 20.96% per year in

the two years after the liberalization, but -4.29% per year in years +3 through +5. 1993

was a year with considerable inflows into emerging markets. Seven countries have 1993

in the last three years of the five-year post-liberalization window. If we take out 1993, the

average annual return per calendar year in years +3 through +5 is -12.39%.

    We examined returns for liberalizing countries in a number of ways, but the general

pattern shown in Figure 1 holds up. The evidence of high returns in the years

immediately following the equity market liberalization is stronger than the evidence of

subsequent underperformance. Movements in global markets or emerging markets cannot

explain the pattern. The evidence of underperformance does not seem robust when the

Henry (2000a) dates are used. This could be due to the fact that the Bekaert and Harvey

(2000) dates seem more closely associated with an upward shift in flows from foreign


model how a policy change such as a privatization program can gain credibility over time and show that as
it does so financial development increases.


                                                   8
investors, but the result indicates that the choice of liberalization may matter for

assessments of long-run performance.7 We estimated for each country a regression of the

monthly excess return on a constant, the excess return of the world market (using the

Datastream world index), the excess return of the emerging markets index (EMBD

composite index), a dummy variable corresponding to the event window used by Henry

(2000a), which goes from month -7 before the liberalization date to the liberalization

month, and a dummy variable for each one of the first five twelve-month periods starting

the month immediately after the liberalization. The coefficient on each dummy variable is

the average monthly return for the period over which the dummy variable takes a value of

one. The emerging market index return is available from January 1985, so that our

regressions start then. The average across countries of the dummy variable corresponding

to the first twelve-month period following the Bekaert and Harvey (2000) liberalization

dates is 4.23%. In contrast, the average for the fifth twelve-month period is -1.7%, so that

liberalizing countries outperform on average by more than 50% in the first twelve-month

period and underperform on average by more than 20% in the fifth twelve-month period.

These averages of the dummy variables are significantly different from zero at the 5%

level.

      A similar pattern of spectacular returns followed by disappointing returns is observed

for stocks that undergo an initial public offering (IPO). There has been much debate on

the statistical significance of the poor performance of IPO firms. Alternate estimation

methods lead to different results. It will be even harder to reach a consensus on the long-

run performance of liberalizing countries because there are few such countries and a

number of liberalization dates are close to each other. Both for equity market

    See Bekaert, Harvey, and Lumsdaine (2002).


                                                 9
liberalizations and for IPO stocks, there are good reasons to think that some of the

corrective market mechanisms that limit valuation departures from fundamentals are

more impeded than they are for well-established stocks. When an investor believes that a

stock is overvalued, she can attempt to profit from her knowledge by selling the stock

short. We know that short-selling is often difficult for IPO stocks; it is also typically

difficult for emerging markets stocks because of regulatory restrictions, limited liquidity,

and lack of supporting institutions. It would therefore not be surprising if, following an

equity market liberalization, prices would be driven up by the most optimistic investors,

with a correction eventually taking place.

       We examined whether stock returns depend on a proxy for the liquidity of the

stock market before liberalization. In a less liquid market, optimistic investors would

affect prices more when they trade. When the sample is split, the subsample sizes are

more reasonable when we use the Bekaert and Harvey (2000) dates. Using turnover in the

year before liberalization as a measure of liquidity, we find that countries with turnover

below the median turnover of the liberalizing countries have much stronger returns

around the time of the liberalization but poorer returns afterwards. In the calendar year of

the liberalization, countries with low turnover earn more than twice what the countries

with high turnover earn. However, in the calendar years +3 through +5 following

liberalization, the average annual return of the countries with low turnover before

liberalization is -8.73% and the average annual return of the other countries is -0.35%.

Low turnover markets seem more prone to what appears to be a pattern of overreaction.

Figure 2 shows the returns of liberalizing countries for the period of minus seven months

before the liberalization date to the liberalization month and for each of the first five




                                             10
twelve-month periods afterwards. We also reproduce the return from having invested in

the emerging market total return index during these years.



2. The IPO model of liberalizations.

    Why would a country liberalize its equity market? There are three important reasons

why the owners of a private firm would want to take it public: they want to cash out, they

require external funding to finance the firm’s growth opportunities, or they want to have

more equity in the firm’s capital structure.8 For these arguments to explain why firms in

emerging markets want the country to liberalize its equity market, it has to be that the

controlling shareholders of the large corporations in a country have a decisive say in

whether the equity market is liberalized. This need not be so. Some IMF programs led to

greater opening of equity markets. The country might also want to liberalize so that it has

a larger market for the shares of privatized firms or for other reasons.9 However, we

focus here on the motivations of large controlling shareholders. In most countries, one

would expect these shareholders to have an important say on the extent to which the

equity market is open to foreign investors.

    To understand why firms in an emerging country might push for liberalization, it is

important to understand that in such a country, firms are closely held. They have a large

shareholder or group of shareholders, often a family, with a controlling stake. The

average fraction of shares held by controlling shareholders in our sample of liberalizing

countries is 53.61% using the sample drawn from Bekaert and Harvey (2000).10 It is most


8
  See Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998).
9
  See Boutchkova and Megginson (2000) for evidence on the importance of privatized firms in emerging
markets.
10
   We use the data from Dahlquist, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (2003). See Appendix B.


                                                  11
likely that before liberalization, ownership was even more concentrated. Consider a

typical firm in such a country. By selling a significant fraction of the shares they own,

controlling shareholders would take the risk of losing control. If the equity market of that

country opens up, foreign investors could own at most 46.39% of the shares of that firm

if the controlling shareholders do not sell some of the shares they own, which limits the

extent to which risk-sharing can take place.

        For firms to push for liberalization, their controlling shareholders must benefit

from it. When are these controlling shareholders likely to favor liberalization? They can

benefit from liberalization in many ways, but three benefits stand out, two of which are

also the main possible benefits of an IPO for the owners of the firm going public. First,

liberalization may provide the controlling shareholders with an exit if they want to reduce

their stake in their firm.11 Foreign shareholders or a foreign firm could buy their stake.

Second, liberalization enables them to raise capital from foreign investors. After

liberalization, a firm can have its equity listed on a foreign exchange. This makes it

possible, for instance, for the firm to start an ADR program, have an NYSE listing, or

raise equity in the U.S. A foreign listing can also help the firm raise capital through debt

issues, bank borrowing and private placements. By raising equity capital, the firm can

finance new investment or reduce its leverage. Third, an equity market liberalization

makes it possible for firms in emerging markets to rent the institutions of more developed

countries. Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2003) show that a listing in the U.S. increases firm



11
  No paper we know of analyses the impact of the equity market liberalization events of Henry (2000a) or
Bekaert and Harvey (2000) on corporate governance and ownership. However, Doidge (2002) investigates
how ownership changes after a firm from an emerging market starts an ADR program. He finds that 24 out
of 101 firms had a change in control and in 18 of these 24 firms the new controlling shareholder was
foreign.


                                                   12
value because, by subjecting the firm to some U.S. laws and regulations, a listing helps

make a credible commitment to protect the rights of minority shareholders.

         Though the risk-sharing theory of equity market liberalizations implies that these

liberalizations necessarily improve welfare, controlling shareholders may be affected

adversely by liberalization. Suppose a firm can raise all the funds it requires through

banks in the local market, perhaps because of political connections, and the controlling

shareholders of the firm have no intention of reducing their stake because doing so would

endanger the extent to which they can extract private benefits from control of the firm. In

this case, equity market liberalization could help competing firms that are less well

established or politically connected in the country by giving them access to outside

capital. Perhaps more importantly, following a liberalization, foreign investors will

monitor local firms and any actions detrimental to minority shareholders that otherwise

might have remained hidden could be exposed by outsiders. This monitoring by foreign

investors could therefore make it harder for controlling investors to extract private

benefits from the firms they control. Consequently, if a country’s largest firms do not

have unmet financing needs and if the controlling shareholders of these firms are not

looking for an exit, these controlling shareholders are unlikely to push for an equity

market liberalization and may actually oppose such a liberalization strongly.12

         For controlling shareholders of major firms who are not looking for an exit to

want the equity market liberalized, it has to be that these firms have growth opportunities

that cannot be financed. If that is the case, liberalization takes place when the local

market’s ability to provide funding to established companies becomes insufficient to


12
  It could be that controlling shareholders are in favor of an equity market liberalization, but that it does
not take place because the politicians respond to other constituencies.


                                                       13
meet the needs of these companies. The local market could fail in financing local

companies because these companies experienced an increase in growth opportunities,

because the local market became less able to fund these companies due to internal

problems (for instance, a banking crisis), or because controlling shareholders of local

firms cannot credibly commit to protect the rights of minority shareholders through the

use of local institutions.

        For local companies to be able to get funding abroad after not having been able to

do so in their home country, they have to draw the attention of foreign investors to the

country. This is much like an IPO. For foreign investors to be interested, they have to

hear a good story that draws their attention. This suggests that a country is unlikely to

liberalize its equity market when its financial system is performing poorly and can no

longer fund local firms as well as it did in the past. One would expect instead an equity

market liberalization to take place when the country and local firms have improved

growth prospects that require additional financing, when foreign investors think that this

is the case, or when emerging markets are expected to do well and nothing in the country

indicates that its prospects are weaker. However, this means that equity market

liberalizations will take place when higher growth is expected. Though Henry (2000b)

shows that there is an increase in investment following a liberalization and Bekaert,

Harvey, and Lundblad (2002) show that growth increases, the changes they uncover may

therefore equally cause the liberalization as being caused by it. Further, because of the

difficulties in selling stocks short in liberalizing countries and the limited liquidity of

their stock markets, it is plausible that the most optimistic foreign investors might drive

prices higher than warranted by fundamentals. Such overreaction would eventually be




                                            14
offset by poor stock returns. We saw that the empirical evidence is consistent with such a

scenario. The possibility of such a scenario should make us leery of drawing strong

conclusions from the data about expected returns following liberalizations.

       For an IPO to succeed, there has to be a demand for the firm’s shares by public

investors. That demand will determine how many shares can be sold at the IPO. For an

equity market liberalization to succeed, there has to be a demand for the existing or newly

issued shares from firms in the liberalizing country by foreign investors. The success of

the liberalization is determined by the extent to which foreign investors buy these shares,

but while IPO shares are bought at the IPO price, shares from firms of the liberalizing

country are bought at the price at which they trade in that country. Several factors limit

the demand for these shares by foreign investors. Some of these factors are similar to

those that limit the demand for shares in IPOs, but others are not. In particular, equity

market liberalizations do not remove all barriers to holding local equity for foreign

investors. Many of the remaining barriers cannot be eliminated by decrees. Countries

with weak enforcement of investor rights and poor financial development are necessarily

hazardous for foreign investors. Such countries lack transparency, have legal systems that

can be manipulated by residents, have expropriation risks, and so on. As a result of these

risks for foreign investors, it is still the case after a liberalization that foreign investors

can be at a disadvantage relative to domestic investors. Further, while a government

decree can reduce barriers to international investment that lead to a home bias on the part

of investors, it cannot overcome the behavioral considerations that lead investors to

prefer domestic stocks.




                                              15
       Second, the literature on IPOs emphasizes that the owners of the private firm

know more about the firm than potential investors (the information asymmetry problem)

and have some ability to take actions after the IPO that benefit them at the expense of the

new shareholders (the agency problem). To protect themselves against being taken

advantage of, investors are only willing to buy at a lower price than if there were no

information asymmetry and agency problems. The owners of the private firm are less

likely to take advantage of the public investors if they keep their ownership stake high,

because they would then be taking advantage of themselves since they would reduce the

value of their stake. This explains why IPO firms typically have concentrated ownership

after the IPO. Rational investors would be unlikely to buy the shares of a firm going

public where it is known that all the insiders are selling their shares in the IPO. The same

issue arises with equity market liberalizations.

       Similarly to periods when sentiment is favorable to IPO firms, there are periods

when sentiment is favorable to emerging markets, making it more advantageous for

countries to liberalize their equity markets, and periods when there is little benefit from

making shares available to foreign investors because these investors are reducing their

allocation to these markets.

       If local firms want to sell equity abroad and if local shareholders want to sell to

foreign investors, the more they do so, the more costly it will be for them in terms of the

impact on local share prices. Usually, in the case of firms in emerging markets, investors

are typically poorly protected. This makes it easier for controlling shareholders to take

advantage of minority shareholders. In these countries, concentrated ownership is a

mechanism used to control the agency costs of controlling shareholders in that controlling




                                             16
shareholders who hold a larger stake in their firm find it more expensive to extract private

benefits from control.13 Suppose controlling shareholders own a fraction w of the firm’s

cash flows. When these shareholders extract from the firm $1 of private benefits, they

would get $w of that $1 in any case. If it costs the firm $x to extract $1 of private

benefits, controlling shareholders pay $wx to get $(1 - w). The greater w, the lower the

net benefit to shareholders from extracting private benefits from the firm. As the fraction

of cash flows owned by controlling shareholders falls because of new equity issued, the

price of shares falls because the incentives of controlling shareholders to extract private

benefits increase. Even though controlling shareholders can take actions to limit this

effect, they cannot eliminate it. Consequently, the ability of firms to take advantage of an

equity market liberalization is limited by the extent to which investor protection in the

local market makes it optimal for cash flow ownership by controlling shareholders to be

high. As investor protection improves, firms in a country become better able to take

advantage of their ability to raise capital from foreign investors.



3. Conclusion.

       In this paper, we argue that viewing equity market liberalizations as country IPOs

provides the basis for a more useful model of equity market liberalizations than the

simple risk-sharing model. Viewing equity market liberalizations as country IPOs forces

us to take into account the endogeneity of equity market liberalizations and to

acknowledge that the short-run impact of equity market liberalizations does not provide a

complete picture of how liberalizations affect countries. Perhaps even more importantly,

                                              17
how much a country benefits from an equity market liberalization depends on the extent

to which firms can take advantage of the liberalization.

   In the long run, the ability of firms to benefit from an equity market liberalization

depends on corporate governance and on the protection of investor rights. Because of the

limited financial development and investor protection in liberalizing countries, stock

prices may overreact following an equity market liberalization and risk-sharing can only

be limited. For countries to gain more from equity market liberalizations, they have to

improve their financial development and the degree to which they protect investors. With

greater financial development, stock prices are less likely to overreact to purchases or

sales by foreign investors. With greater investment protection, shares will be more

diffusively owned and foreigners will be less at a disadvantage, which will enable foreign

investors to participate more in local markets.
