Wages, Minimum Wages, and Price Pass-Through: The Case of McDonald's Restaurants

                                        ABSTRACT

We use price and wage data from McDonald's restaurants to provide evidence on wage increases,
labor-saving technology introduction, and price pass-through by a large low-wage employer
facing a flurry of minimum wage hikes from 2016-2020. We estimate an elasticity of hourly
wage rates with respect to minimum wages of 0.7. In 40% of instances where minimum wages
increase, McDonald's restaurants' wages are near the effective minimum wage level both before
and after its increase; however, we also uncover a tendency among a large subset of restaurants
to preserve their pay 'premium' above the minimum wage level. We find no association between
the adoption of labor-saving touch screen ordering technology and minimum wage hikes. Our
data imply that McDonald's restaurants pass through the higher costs of minimum wage
increases in the form of higher prices of the Big Mac sandwich. We find a 0.2 price elasticity
with respect to wage increases, which implies an elasticity of prices with respect to minimum
wages of about 0.14. Based on a listing of all US McDonald's restaurants from 2010 to 2020, we
also find no effects of minimum wages on McDonald's restaurant entry and exit.

1. Introduction


        Minimum wage legislation aims at raising real incomes of low-wage workers, most of
whom are employed in the retail and hospitality industries. In this paper, we offer evidence on
minimum wages from a new data set we have collected covering almost all of the US restaurants in
the McDonald's chain.
        The pay levels in McDonald's restaurants, the largest U.S. franchise chain, are powerfully
affected by minimum wage legislation.1 McDonald's restaurants are highly standardized in terms
of technology and working conditions, which facilitates the cross-area and cross-time comparisons
involved in the study of minimum wage effects.2
        We first use our rich, highly consistent national-coverage data to study the structure of
wage increases in response to minimum wage hikes. The flurry of minimum wage increases at the
state and local level in the last few years provides us with a natural workshop for studying their
effects. Based on information on the hourly wage rates of McDonald's Basic Crew from about 10
thousand restaurants observed annually from 2016 to 2020, we estimate an elasticity of hourly
wage rates with respect to minimum wages of about 0.7. Surprisingly, this elasticity is the same for
restaurants for which minimum wage increases were binding and those that were not. Underneath
this elasticity, there are heterogeneous wage responses: In almost 40% of instances when minimum
wages increase, McDonald's restaurants' wages are near the effective minimum wage level both
before and after its increase. Such wage paths are consistent with the simple neoclassical model of
labor markets. However, in a similarly large group of instances, restaurants increase their pay more
than required by the increase in minimum wages. We document a tendency among these
restaurants to preserve their pay `premium' above the (increasing) minimum wage level. This
suggests cross-employer pay norms are important even in entry-level low-skilled jobs; future
research is needed to understand the source of these norms.



1
  In 2016 almost half of McDonald's Basic Crew wage rates in the US were equal to the effective local
minimum wage level, i.e., at the maximum of the federal, the state, and the local minimum wage.
2
  It is plausible that McDonald's restaurants react to higher labor costs in part by adjusting the quality of
service or the cleanliness of the restaurants. However, such adjustments are limited by the nature of the
detailed operating manual, which is designed to minimize costs to the brand name. In addition, the highly
regimented operation of McDonald's restaurants allows for little variation in the labor share.



                                                       1
       We then study whether employers substitute capital for labor when the price of low-skill
labor increases due to minimum wage hikes. To provide insight into this issue within the fast food
industry, we study a recently developed labor-saving technology in McDonald's restaurants: the
introduction of touch-screen ordering kiosks. These were available in one fifth of McDonald's
restaurants in 2017, but were available in close to three-fourths by 2019. Our data do not indicate
that the introduction of this technology was related to minimum wage increases. This evidence is
not consistent with technology introduction being a channel for negative employment effects of
minimum wages.
       Next, we measure the ability of McDonald's restaurants to pass through the higher costs of
labor induced by changes in minimum wages during 2016 to 2020 onto their customers in the form
of higher prices of the Big Mac sandwich. We use minimum wages increases as instrumental
variable and find a 0.2 price elasticity with respect to wage increases. Together with the 0.7 (first-
stage) elasticity of wage rates with respect to minimum wages, this implies a reduced-form
elasticity of prices with respect to minimum wages of about 0.14. We uncover a full or near-full
price pass-through of minimum-wage-induced higher costs of labor and find no evidence that this
pass-through elasticity varies with exposure to minimum wage increases or across varying degrees
of product market competition.
       Finally, we employ a listing of all US McDonald's restaurants from 2010 to 2020 to
estimate the effects of minimum wages on McDonald's restaurant entry and exit. We find no
effects on either entry or exit based on various identification strategies. This implies that our
analyses of wage effects and price pass-through are not influenced by the composition of the
restaurants in our sample.
       Unlike Card and Krueger's (1994, 1995) seminal work, we do not offer evidence on
employment effects of the minimum wage. Our findings do not rule out employment effects, but
our evidence on wage increases, technology introduction, and price pass-through is consistent with
studies that find no or small minimum-wage employment effects in the fast food industry.

2. US McDonald's in Our Data


        During 2010-2020, there were about 14 thousand McDonald's restaurants in the US
according to our first data source--the annual geo-coded listing of all McDonald's restaurants,
which includes information on restaurant type (freestanding vs. part of a mall or Walmart).3 We
rely on this listing in our restaurant entry/exit analysis and we also use it as the population for our
2016-2020 annual telephone survey of McDonald's restaurants, our second data source. In the
survey, we collect prices of the Big Mac sandwich (including sales tax and excluding temporary
promotions) and wage rates of the Basic Crew (for day shift entry-level crew members aged 18 or
older who finished initial training), which we will refer to as McWages. In 2016, the survey
collected information from 80% of all US McDonald's restaurants and coved 2,255 US counties
with 97% of the US population. The restaurant coverage rate gradually declined from 80% in 2016
to 71% in 2020, but the data cover at least 90% of US counties with a McDonald's in every year of
the survey thanks to a generally high response rate. Across the five survey years, there are 52,281
restaurant-year observations.4 In Ashenfelter and Jurajda (2020), we introduce the survey in more
detail and use repeat interviews to estimate the annual reliability ratio of McWages and Big Mac
prices to be at least 0.9. and 0.7, respectively.5 Finally, we supplement the survey with the 2018
complete list of McDonald's franchises with owner identity6 to classify restaurants as franchised or
company-owned (10% are), and to calculate local-market indices of ownership concentration.
        The structure of the McWage survey data is stable with about 10% of restaurants being
company-owned in each year of the survey, 86% being free-standing restaurants, 13% being
located along highways or parkways, and with 4% of the interviews being answered by a Basic
Crew member (as opposed to a manager). This stability corresponds to the high response rates of
our survey and the low 1.0% entry and exit rate averages measured from the 2010-2020 listing of
McDonald's restaurants (see Appendix Tab A.1 and Fig. A.1).
        The period from 2010 to 2020 saw a flurry of minimum wage increases across the US.
Most of the three hundred increases in state or local minimum wage levels during this period

  The database was obtained from AggData, a market research company.

  Of these, only 720 observations come from stores that are observed only once.

  The reliability ratio corresponding to annual wage changes is also about 0.9.

occurred during 2016-2020, the period for which we have collected wage and price data.7 There are
42 cities with McDonald's restaurants covered by our data that have a local minimum wage
ordinance in place by 2020. The simple cross-state average of effective state minimum wages
increases from $7.43 in 2010 to $9.20 in 2020. The average effective local minimum wage across
the locations with McDonald's that by 2020 have a local minimum wage ordinance increases from
$7.90 in 2010 to $13.90 in 2020. Despite this growth in minimum wages, the share of McWages
that are censored at the local effective minimum wage declines (by 3 to 5 percentage points
annually from 45% in 2016 to 30% in 2020).
       To what extent do restaurant characteristics explain differences in McWages and Big Mac
Prices across restaurants? The answer is, not much. In columns (1) to (4) of Table 1, we use least
squares regressions to measure the explanatory power of restaurant characteristics, McWages, and
state sales tax levels for the cross-restaurant variation in prices of the Big Mac. Freestanding
restaurants, i.e., those that are not part of a mall or a Walmart, have prices that are about 1-2%
lower, both across and within states, as documented in the first two columns of Table 1, which is
based on 2018, a mid-year of our survey. The results based on other years are similar. Prices co-
move across locations in tandem with local sales taxes (including state sales taxes and measured as
shares, i.e., 8% expressed as 0.08). In recent years, touch-screen ordering has been gradually
introduced in most McDonald's restaurants (see Appendix Table A.1). Our survey asks about the
presence of touch-screen ordering starting in 2017. In Table 1, we find a precisely estimated zero
price coefficient corresponding to this new technology in 2018 (estimates from other years are
nearly identical). In the absence of state fixed effects, we can explain only about 5% of the
variation in Big Mac prices across restaurants in column (1). There is clearly much unexplained
cross-restaurant variation in prices. Even conditioning on McWages and on over two thousand
county fixed effects does not increase the (adjusted) R2 of the price regression above 0.5.8




7
  For the purposes of our analysis, we consider Washington, D.C., which has more McDonald's than
Vermont or North Dakota, as a US state. Our information on state and local minimum wages comes
primarily from the Department of Labor and the Berkeley Labor Center. We have updated the most recent
local minimum wage ordinances ourselves.
8
  The US-wide price variation is similar in franchised and in company-owned restaurants. The McDonald's
chain therefore does not apply uniform pricing, unlike grocery chains (DellaVigna and Gentzkow, 2019).

       In columns (5) and (6) of Table 1, we ask whether restaurant characteristics explain
variation in McWages using a Tobit specification with variable censoring thresholds corresponding
to the effective (state, county, or city) minimum wage levels. Consistent with Krueger's (1991)
early work, company-owned restaurants pay higher wage rates than franchised restaurants. Touch-
screen ordering is not associated with wage differences across restaurants. Overall, restaurant
characteristics explain little of the overall variation as confirmed by the Tobit sigma (estimated
standard error of the residuals) in Table 1, which decreases by less than. 01 when restaurant
characteristics are added to either specification. Avoiding the censoring issue and using only




                                                  5
observations that are strictly above the effective minimum wage level, the adjusted R2 of a linear
regression corresponding to the specification presented in column (5) of Table 1 is 0.02.9
        What is the labor cost share in McDonald's restaurants? Our understanding of McDonald's
production technology is based on the McDonald's extensive operations manual and on the
company's global warranty of producing identical products using standardized technology.
Aaronson et al. (2018) assume that these fast food restaurants operate a Leontief production
function where inputs are used in fixed proportion (without substitution) and average variable costs
equal marginal costs. Approximating the relationship between prices and wages, the cross-sectional
regression of ln(BigMacPrice) on ln(McWage) in column (3) of Table 1 would suggest a 30% share
of labor costs in Big Mac prices.10 Consistent with this estimate, Dube et al. (2010) suggest that the
labor share in operating costs in the US restaurant sector is about 30%.11


3. Theory and Empirical Literature


        Our analysis is related to four distinct parts of the minimum wage literature, which reflects
alternative assumptions about the type of labor market and product market competition faced by
employers who react to higher labor costs due to minimum wage legislation. Although Card and
Krueger (1994) did not find evidence of any spillover of minimum wage increases on other wages,
subsequent work has documented that minimum wage hikes are often associated with a positive
spillover (or "ripple effect") on wages above the new minimum. The research measuring such
ripple effects (e.g., Cenzig et al., 2019) often refers to models featuring labor market frictions,
where such wage spillovers may reflect the value of outside options or within-firm pay norms
(Flinn 2006). Our McWage evidence, which focuses on highly comparable jobs, speaks to across-

9
  In 2020, 84% of the surveyed restaurants operate only through drive-through and delivery service due to
the Covid-19 pandemic. In specifications corresponding to Table 1, we find precisely estimated zero
coefficients of these operation restrictions on prices as well as wages when conditioning on state fixed
effects. This conclusion is not affected by instrumenting for the presence of operation restrictions using
county-level Covid-19 deaths until the end of September 2020.
10
   When we additionally condition on the effective minimum wage level (state and local), the minimum
wage coefficients correspond to about half of the McWage coefficient from column (3) of Table 1.
11
   Under the additive input costs assumption, Parsley and Wei (2007) use international (city-level) price data
on the Big Mac and all of its inputs (ingredients, rents, energy, and labor) to find that labor is by far the most
important non-tradable cost, with minimal cost shares of energy and rent.



                                                        6
firm comparisons (pay norms) for workers providing a specific skill input under fixed hedonic job
properties. It thus limits the applicability of some of the mechanisms for spillovers considered in
the literature (e.g., Phelan, 2019).
        The research studying the susceptibility of low-wage employment to technological
substitution typically employs the task-based empirical framework. In a recent study, Aaronson and
Phelan (2019) rely on minimum wage increases for plausibly exogenous variation in labor costs
and find that the potential for technological substitution of low-skill labor is limited to cognitively
routine tasks, i.e., it may not apply to manually routine jobs.12 The advantage of our setting is that
we have a direct measure of the introduction of a labor-saving technology in the form of touch-
screen ordering (kiosks) in fast-food restaurants, which are facing a flurry of minimum wage hikes.
We thus ask whether the timing of the technology introduction corresponds to increases in labor
costs. Our analysis is narrow in that it focuses on one company, but it offers highly consistent
comparisons across the geographical distribution of minimum wage increases.
        The literature focusing on the price pass-through of minimum wages considers imperfect
product as well as labor markets. Under monopsonistic competition in local labor markets, firms
face an upward sloping labor supply curve (Manning, 2003). A small increase in minimum wages
raises employment, and hence output and lowers prices, while a large increase in minimum wages
cuts employment and output, and increases prices, similar to the case of fully competitive markets.
An important insight for our analysis is that with constant returns to scale, firms adjust prices in
response to minimum wage hikes in proportion to the cost share of minimum-wage labor (e.g.,
Leung, in press). If both labor and product markets are competitive, firms can pass through up to
the full increase in costs (Fullerton and Metcalf, 2002). More generally, demand elasticity and
demand convexity are (potentially location-specific) determinants of the pass-through (Weyl and
Fabinger, 2013). Pless and van Benthem (2019) argue that under specific conditions, a pass-
through rate above unity suggests the existence of market power.
        There is a growing empirical literature on the price pass-through effects of minimum
wages.13 Much of the recent work in this area relies on food CPI indices measured at the regional

12
   There is closely related evidence from outside of the US. For example, Hau et al. (2020) find that in
privately-owned Chinese firms minimum wage hikes accelerate input substitution from labor to capital.
13
   Card and Krueger (1994) is an early study focusing on the fast food industry. Much research studies the
cost pass-through rate in retail: Ashenfelter et al. (1998) estimate the rate for a single retail chain. Recent



                                                        7
(e.g., MSA) level (Aaronson, 2001; Aaronson and French, 2007; Aaronson et al., 2008). The study
of Basker and Khan (2016) is closely related to our analysis in that it uses 1993-2014 McDonald's
Quarter-Pounder prices from about 300 US cities to uncover a 0.09 price elasticity. To learn about
the degree of pass-through, Basker and Khan estimate the effect of the minimum wage on all
limited-service restaurant wage bills across cities, find it to be about twice the size of the price
pass-through elasticity, and argue that if the labor share of costs is about 50%, restaurants are fully
passing through their cost increases to consumer prices. Similarly, Allegretto and Reich (2018)
imply a near-full price pass-through of higher labor costs in internet-based restaurants in San Jose,
CA. The simplest explanation for these full price pass-through findings is that both fast-food
product and labor markets are competitive. Two recent analyses that also support the presence of
significant price pass-through are able to exploit confidential restaurant-level payroll data from a
restaurant chain: Hirsch, Kaufman, and Zelenska (2015) and Brummund (2017) use information on
80 and 515 restaurants covering 2 and 13 states, respectively. Their results are consistent with no
significant employment or hours effects of minimum wage hikes even in restaurants relatively
strongly affected by minimum wage increases in terms of their wage costs.
        Our approach offers several advantages over the existing literature on price pass-through.
First, unlike studies based on food-away-from-home CPI indices, where substitution of restaurants
by consumers as well as food and service quality adjustment and tipping adjustments within
restaurants are plausible responses to price increases, our approach is based on observing prices of
an identical product in a setting with no tipping.14 Second, our geographic coverage as well as the
number of minimum wage changes we study are substantially higher compared to the recent work
on price pass-through of US minimum wages. We employ extensive variation in minimum wages
both at the state and local level, and are also able to focus on cross-state-border comparisons
(similar to Allegretto and Reich, 2018). Third, unlike all of the minimum-wage pass-through
literature, we observe store-level wage rates, which allows us to assess the wage impact of
minimum wage increases. McDonald's restaurants rely heavily on its Basic Crew and these
workers are likely to be affected by minimum wage legislation. Our analysis is facilitated by the

studies focus on the minimum wage price effects for identical products in US retail. Renkin et al. (in press)
and Leung (in press) use bar-code scanner price data from US retail stores to reach conflicting conclusions.
Renkin et al. (in press) imply full price pass through, similar to previous wholesale and retail studies.
14
   Similar to the existing research using prices of specific fast-food items (e.g., Basker and Khan, 2016), we
assume that the Big Mac price is representative of the overall price level in a store.



                                                       8
fixed technology of production and thus constant labor cost share of McDonald's restaurants so
that, unlike the existing literature, we do not estimate establishment-specific labor cost shares and
can instead assume that labor's share in variable (marginal) costs is constant across restaurants.
Fourth, information about owners of franchises and the geo-coded nature of our data allows us to
measure the degree of franchise ownership concentration for various highly detailed geographical
definitions of product markets. Our goal is thus to explore pass-through under varying degrees of
product market power approximated by ownership concentration in order to contribute to the work
on the impact of competition on pass-through summarized in Genakos and Pagliero (2019).
        Finally, our analysis of the effects of minimum wage increases on McDonald's restaurant
entry and exit extends the evidence offered in two recent studies: Aaronson et al. (2018) explore
five state-level minimum wage increases and suggest these hikes increased both entry and exit of
fast food restaurants. Luca and Luca (2017) rely on minimum wage hikes in cities located in the
San Francisco Bay area and find that higher minimum wages lead to higher probability of closure
(exit) for restaurants with lower customer ratings, but that they have no effect on the exit rate of
top-rated restaurants and no discernible effect on entry. Our analysis covers the entire US and relies
on over three hundred changes in effective minimum wages. On the other hand, it focuses on a fast
food chain characterized by low entry and exit rates (see Section 2).


4. Minimum Wages and McWages


        To quantify how minimum wage increases affect McWages (and to build the first step of
our price pass-through analysis), we estimate the McWage elasticity with respect to minimum
wages from our 2016-2020 data based on a linear equation conditioning on restaurant and year
fixed effects:15


        ln(McWageit) =  +  ln(MWit) + i + t + it ,                                                (1)



15
  The data allow us to estimate the elasticity of hourly wages with respect to minimum wages, not the
elasticity of the wage bill. With prices increasing and sales declining, adjustments in hours worked could
result in a wage-bill elasticity that would be lower than the wage-rate elasticity. However, Okrent and
Alston (2012) suggest that demand for restaurant output is relatively price inelastic and Brummund (2017)
finds no hours adjustments in response to minimum wage, reducing these concerns.



                                                     9
where MWit stands for the effective minimum wage (federal, state, or local) faced by a McDonald's
restaurant i in year t, and where i and t represent restaurant and year fixed effects, respectively.
Next, we aggregated equation (1) to the county level with county fixed effects, relying on counties
with at least five observations. Using restaurant-level data in column (1) of Table 2, we uncover a
0.7 elasticity; the estimate based on county-level data in column (2) is similar. In the Appendix
Table A.2, we present these specifications separately for restaurants facing minimum wage changes
driven by local (city or county) minimum wage ordinances and for the majority of the data exposed
to (at most) state-level minimum-wage increases. The local-variation based coefficient is somewhat
smaller compared to the elasticity based on state-level variation.

        It is natural to ask about heterogeneity in the wage effect of minimum wage hikes with
respect to how binding minimum wage increases are (see, e.g., Ashenfelter and Card, 1981). In
columns (3) and (4) of Table 2, we therefore estimate specifications where we additionally control
for an indicator `Affected by MW Increase', which is equal to 1 when a given restaurant had to
increase its wages in order to meet the new minimum wage level. The indicator stays at zero for
restaurants that face no minimum wage increase or those that, as of the previous year, were already
paying wages above the current increased minimum wage level.16 We interact the minimum wage

16
  We cannot determine the value of the `Affected' indicator for restaurants not observed in consecutive
years and also for restaurants observed in 2016 in locations that experienced an increase in minimum wages



                                                    10
with this indicator to ask whether wages react to minimum wage hikes differently in restaurants for
which minimum wage hikes are binding. The estimates suggest no such interactions; we find no
statistically significant differences in wage increases driven by minimum wage hikes across the
`Affected' dimension irrespective of whether we employ restaurant- or county-level data.17
        That minimum wage hikes increase wages similarly below and above the new minimum
wage level is strong evidence of spillovers effects. In our case, these spillovers are not due to
within-firm pay norms; they correspond to standardized jobs with fixed physical productivity and
hedonic job conditions. Below, we investigate the structure of the wage reaction to minimum
wages in more detail.
        In the 2016-2020 McDonald's survey, we observe 15,601 instances when a given restaurant
is observed both before and after a minimum wage increase, corresponding to 6,585 distinct
restaurants experiencing at least one minimum wage hike at the state or local level. We focus on
the evolution of pay gaps between McWages and effective minimum wages across these instances.
In 39% of minimum-wage-increase instances (in 6,094 instances), restaurants pay wages within 10
cents of the minimum wage both before and after its increase, i.e., they keep their wage rates at
about the minimum wage level.
        In another 13% of the instances of minimum wage increases (2,008 cases), we observe
restaurants that paid a `premium' of more than 10 cents above the old minimum wage increase their
wages to pay within 10 cents of the new minimum wage. And in 11% of minimum-wage-hike
instances (1,733 cases), restaurants do not change their pay, which is at least 10 cents above the
new minimum wage level. Hence, in 63% of instances of minimum wage increases, the wage
adjustment paths are consistent with simple neoclassical predictions: these firms only increase their
wage rates when the failure to do so would make them out of compliance with the minimum wage
law.
        This leaves 37% of instances (5,766 cases), where restaurants follow pay paths that are
broadly inconsistent with neoclassical predictions. In 12% of all minimum-pay-hike instances,
restaurants that were at the old minimum wage level increased their pay to more than 10 cents

between 2015 and 2016. 75% of restaurants `Affected' in 2017 pay within 5% of the new minimum wage
level. Assuming that restaurants that pay McWages within 5% of an increased 2016 minimum wage were
`Affected' does not qualitatively affect the estimates. We aggregate data to the county level separately for
the `affected' and the `non-affected' restaurants and use only data cells based on at least 5 observations.
17
   We find similar results when we separately estimate these specifications for restaurants affected by state-
level variation in minimum wages and those affected by local-level variation, see Appendix Table A.2.



                                                      11
above the new minimum wage. The strongest departure from neoclassical theory is then displayed
in the 25% of instances (3,946 cases) where restaurants stay more than 10 cents above both the old
and the new minimum wage level and increase their wages (by more than 10 cents). We now focus
on this group of instances, where pay level increases by almost $1 on average, in more detail.
       Overall, of McDonald's restaurants that face at least one minimum wage hike, 36% have at
least once followed such a `non-neoclassical' wage path. This corresponds to 25% of all wage-
adjustment paths. What predicts whether we observe a given restaurant behaving in this `non-
neoclassical' fashion at least once? Regressing an indicator for at least once following the strongly
`non-neoclassical' wage adjustment path on county fixed effects, an indicator for being company-
owned, and a count of how many times a given restaurant had to face minimum wage increases in
our sample, we find that both of the (precisely estimated) slope coefficients equal 0.08. That is,
company-owned restaurants are 8% more likely to at least once behave in a non-neoclassical way,
and observing a restaurant one more time facing a minimum wage increase has the same effect.
Within counties, we often see both `non-neoclassical' and `neoclassical' paths: Across the county-
year data cells with minimum wage increases where at least 10 restaurants are observed, the share
of restaurants following the `non-neoclassical' path goes from 6% at the 25th percentile to 45% at
the 75th percentile. Thus, counties vary dramatically in the extent to which they contain non-
neoclassical wage setters.
       Using the 3,946 `non-neoclassical' wage adjustment paths and regressing the `after' pay
gap (relative to the new minimum wage level) on the `before' gap, results in a coefficient of 0.89
(with standard error of 0.017) with an R2 of 0.5. There is therefore a strong tendency to keep the
pay gap (relative to the changing minimum wage level) constant. Appendix Figure A.3 supports
this notion visually. The upper panel shows comparisons of the `before' and `after' pay gaps
against the minimum wage level by states where state-wide minimum wages have gone up, while
the lower graph shows this comparison based on minimum wage increases corresponding to local
(city or county) minimum wage ordinances. Much of the data lies on the superimposed 45-degree
line in all states; furthermore, most of the departures from the tendency to keep the gap constant are
in the positive direction, i.e. restaurants increase their pay gap as minimum wages increase.
       In sum, we find that when minimum wages increase, in a majority of instances, restaurants
adjust their pay in line with simple neoclassical theory. However, a large group of restaurants
deviates from these predictions; there is a tendency to keep the pay `premium' against the evolving
minimum wage fixed. Evidence of such minimum-wage `ripple' effects corresponding to jobs with


                                                  12
fixed productivity and hedonic job conditions extends the work on minimum wage spillovers (e.g.,
Cengiz, et al., 2019) and suggests across-employer pay norms may be important even for low-wage
workers in standardized jobs. One possibility is that restaurants that pay wages substantially above
the minimum wage level face lower levels of employee churn (and thus lower their costs of
training). Alternatively, the non-neoclassical wage adjustment paths may be driven by local-market
outside options. Exploring these potential explanations is outside the scope of our data, but an
important topic for further research.



5. Minimum Wages and Labor-Saving Technology


        McDonald's restaurants could respond to higher costs of labor by substituting technology
for labor. A prime example of labor-saving technology adoption is the rapid introduction of touch-
screen ordering kiosks, which save Basic Crew labor in the ordering process as they minimize
crew-customer interaction prior to food delivery. According to our survey, touch-screen ordering
availability increases from 20% of restaurants in 2017 to 73% in 2020. In Section 2, Table 1, we
show that in a cross-sectional comparison, the presence of touch-screen ordering is not related to
Big Mac prices or McWages. Our goal here is to use a difference-in-differences strategy to ask
whether minimum wage increases affected the adoption of this technology, which would be
consistent with restaurants substituting technology for more expensive labor. We thus estimate a
version of equation (1) where the dependent variable is an indicator equal to 1 in the year when a
given restaurant introduced touch-screen ordering.
        The estimate presented in the first column of Table 3 suggests that higher minimum wages
are negatively linked to the timing of touch-screen introductions, which is the opposite of the labor-
capital substitution prediction.18 In column (3), we obtain a similar coefficient when we estimate
the same specification using data aggregated to the county-level in counties with at least 5 annual
observations. In the Appendix Table A.3 we show that the negative estimate is coming from state-


18
  In 2017, the touch-screen indicator is available for only about half of the sample. The regressions in
columns (1) and (3) are based on all observations in the 2017-2020 panel when a given restaurant does not
have touch-screen ordering and on the first year when touch-screen ordering is introduced; in effect, we
censor restaurant observations at the moment of exit from the state `no touch screens' as touch screens are
not removed in response to minimum wages. However, the results are not sensitive to using the entire panel.

wage ordinances.19

        Annual variation in minimum wages and in touch-screen ordering during four years may
offer an imperfect reflection of the long-term technology-investment considerations implied by
minimum wage increases. We thus also estimate equation (1) using a decade-wide comparison. We
assume that there were no touch-screen ordering kiosks installed in McDonald's restaurants in
2010. Instead of using annual variation during 2017-2020, we then employ the single longest
difference available in our data based on stores observed in both 2010 and 2020.20 We obtain
precisely estimated zero coefficients in columns (2) and (4).21 We conclude that the evidence is not
consistent with higher costs of labor due to minimum wages affecting touch-screen ordering
introduction.



6. Minimum Wage Price Pass-Through



19
   When we estimate these specifications separately for company-owned and franchised restaurants, two
groups of restaurants that share a similar aggregate evolution of touch-screen adoption in our survey, we
find that the negative effect comes from the latter sub-sample, while we obtain a statistically imprecise
positive coefficient for company-owned stores.
20
   We observe restaurants operating in 2010 in our 2010-2020 panel of McDonald's locations.
21
   Using 2015 instead of 2010 results in almost identical estimates. We also find no statistically or
economically significant interactions with the `Affected' indicator. When we control for Covid-19 operation
restrictions in 2020 and their interaction with minimum wages, we again find no significant effects.



                                                    14
           In the third step of our analysis, we provide insight into the minimum-wage price pass-
through by taking advantage of the 2016-2020 data on prices and wages from each restaurant. We
quantify the relationship between wage variation driven by minimum wage increases and prices,
i.e., we estimate a two-stage least squares regression of prices on wages where wages are
instrumented using minimum wages. The first stage of our system, corresponding to equation (1),
was presented in Table 2. The second stage is given by the following equation:


           ln(BigMacPriceit) =  +  ln(McWageit) + i + t + it ,                                (2)


           where ln(BigMacPrice)it stands for the logarithm of the price of the Big Mac sandwich in a
McDonald's restaurant i in year t, and where we again control for both year and restaurant fixed
effects. In columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, we present these 2SLS specifications corresponding to
equation (2) estimated from restaurant- and county-level data, respectively.

           The elasticity of prices with respect to wage increases driven by minimum wage hikes is

statistically significant differences in wage increases driven by minimum wage hikes across the
`Affected' dimension. Here, we find no such interaction in the relationship between prices and
wage increases driven by minimum wages.
       The `structural' ln(McWage) coefficient in Table 4 suggests a labor cost share of about 0.2,
which, together with the first-stage wage elasticity with respect to minimum wages of about 0.7,
implies a price pass-through of 0.14. This is indeed born out in Table 5, where we present the
central object of the minimum-wage price pass-through literature--the reduced-form relationship
between prices and minimum wages:


       ln(BigMacPriceit) =  +  ln(MWit) + i + t + it .                                       (3)

       That restaurants, which already paid a wage rate above the newly increased minimum wage
level, increase their wages similarly to restaurants that were paying below the new minimum wage
level in the previous year is consistent with the lack of an interaction with being `Affected'
estimated in Table 5. The estimates based on restaurant-level data are again highly similar to those
based on county aggregates. When we estimated the specifications shown in Tables 4 and 5
separately for restaurants facing local minimum wage changes and for the majority of the data




                                                  16
exposed to, at most, state-level minimum-wage increases, we obtained similar, statistically
indistinguishable results (see Appendix Tables A.4 and A.5).
       Our estimated price pass-through elasticity is higher than the 0.1 elasticity typically found
in previous studies discussed in Section 3. Taking the 0.2 coefficient from Table 4 as the value of
the labor cost share implies (by indirect least squares logic) a full price pass through. Under the
higher 30% labor costs share estimate of Dube et al. (2010), if labor costs increases were to be
passed through fully into prices, one would expect prices to increase by 3% for every 10% increase
in minimum wages times the minimum wage elasticity of the wage bill. In our case, 30% of the
0.68 `first stage' minimum wage elasticity of McWages equals 0.2. Our reduced-form price pass-
through coefficient of 0.14 would thus imply a 70 % pass-through. Overall, we conclude that our
evidence is consistent with near-full price pass through of minimum wages in McDonald's
restaurants.
       One way to measure the purchasing power of McWages is to express them in the number of
Big Macs an hour of Basic Crew work can buy. This is a measure of the "real wage". The precisely
estimated elasticity of Big Macs per hour of work with respect to minimum wages (which is simply
the difference between the elasticity of the McWage and the Big Mac Prince with respect to the
minimum wage) is 0.54, which is less than the 0.68 McWage elasticity (shown in Table 2). Our
evidence thus provides support for the notion that real income increases of low-wage workers
brought about by minimum wages hikes may be lower than expected (MaCurdy, 2015).
       In the final step of our price pass-through analysis, we explore heterogeneity in pass-
through related to the degree of product market competition approximated by local ownership
concentration. Figure A.2 in the Appendix visualizes the extent of variation across counties
(covered by our McWage survey) in the 2018 degree of franchise ownership concentration as
summarized by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Since counties with only a few restaurants
may imply a single owner, where we employ the HHI variation, we only use counties (product
markets) with over 5 McDonald's. We do not observe changes in ownership concentration over
time and assume that the market-level ownership structure is stable; hence, the HHI levels are
absorbed by the estimated fixed effects. Instead of exploring the interaction with the `Affected'
indicator, we estimate equations (1) and (2) with HHI-index interactions. We find no evidence of




                                                  17
any first- or second-stage interactions with ownership concentration.23 The estimates are shown in
the Appendix Table A.6, which also lists specifications estimated separately for restaurants affected
by state- and local-level minimum wage variation.24




7. Minimum Wages and Restaurant Entry and Exit


        In the final step of our inquiry, we ask whether our main analysis is affected by
compositional effects linked to minimum wage increases. We employ a listing of all McDonald's
restaurants from 2010 to 2020 to provide evidence on the effects of minimum wages on
McDonald's restaurant entry and exit.
        Restaurants that are unable to pass through cost increases induced by minimum wage hikes
onto their customers may no longer be profitable and may have to close down. It is also plausible
that the higher purchasing power of customers generated by minimum wage increases supports
demand for McDonald's products and leads to new restaurants opening. If minimum wages
affected the composition of McDonald's restaurants in operation, this would have implications for
analyses based on such selected samples. To assess whether minimum wage increases affect
McDonald's restaurant closure, we estimate a specification relating the probability of restaurant
exit to minimum wages at the county level, conditioning on county and year fixed effects:25


        Exitit =  +  ln(MWit) + i + t + it        .                                        (4)


Here, Exitit represents the exit rate in county i in year t and MWit again stands for the corresponding
effective minimum wage level. Next, we compute the entry regression by replacing the exit rate
with an entry rate, Entryit,26


23
   These results are robust to excluding company-owned restaurants. We present results based on counties,
but obtain similar effects when using markets defined as 25 km radius areas around each restaurant.
24
   When we estimate our specifications separately for markets (counties) in the highest/lowest tercile of
county population and of market-level number of competitors (proxied by the number of Burger King, KFC
and Wendy's restaurants), we again obtain statistically indistinguishable results.
25
   The results are not sensitive to using city fixed effects for locations with local minimum wage ordinances
to the extent that these do not correspond to counties.
26
   We infer these rates from the presence of a restaurant in the annual listing from the fall of each year.



                                                      18
            Since our 2010-2020 panel offers substantially more variation than our 2016-2020
    McDonald's survey, we present separate estimates for the restaurants affected at most by state-wide
    increases in minimum wages and for restaurants facing increases in local (city or county) minimum
    wages. We also explore another identification strategy, following Dube et al. (2010).27
            The estimates presented in Table 6 suggest no statistically significant effects of minimum
    wages on entry or exit. The exit coefficient in column (1) corresponds to a precisely estimated zero
    effect; the 0.013 entry coefficient in column (5), while statistically indistinguishable from zero, is
    no longer small.28 These results are insensitive to specification changes. We estimated these
    specifications separately for restaurants located in areas (cities or counties) that, within our sample,
    introduced or increased a local minimum wage. This allowed us to ask whether minimum wage
    effects in these locations are different from the majority of the data that is covered only by
    (potential) increases in state-wide minimum wages. We obtained quantitatively as well as
    qualitatively indistinguishable results based on the two types of minimum-wage variation.

            We also obtain similar estimates based on county-level aggregates when we employ the
    identification strategy of Dube et al. (2010), i.e., when we study gaps in entry or exit rates and in


    27
       This strategy did not lead to precisely estimated coefficients when applied to the 2016-20 data. To
    illustrate these imprecise estimates, we include them in the last two columns of Table A.5.
    28
       The standard deviation of ln(MW) in the entry/exit panel is 0.14. At a 0.013 slope, changing the minimum
    wage by one standard deviation would increase the entry rate by 0.002, about one-fifth of its average.



                                                        19
minimum wages within pairs of contiguous counties straddling a common state border. The
identifying assumption corresponding to the Dube et al. (2010) strategy is that minimum wage
differences within the county pairs are uncorrelated with the corresponding differences in residual
entry/exit rates.
        It is possible that any effects are only visible with a significant delay, especially given the
low average entry and exit rates of McDonald's restaurants. The short nature of our panel does not
allow us to explore the dynamics of the minimum wage effect in detail, but when we use longer
differences (of two to five years) within our decade-long panel of entry and exit, we never find
statistically significant effects, none of the coefficients are larger than those presented in Table 6,
and most of the specifications result in precisely estimated zeros. Finally, we also obtain precisely
estimated zero coefficients when using the longest comparison offered by our panel, i.e., when
relying only on the decade-long gap between the earliest and the latest entry or exit rates available.
This suggests longer-term effects are not present either.29
        Overall, our evidence, which is based on a broader geographical coverage and more
extensive minimum wage variation compared to Card and Krueger (1994), Aaronson et al. (2018)
and Luca and Luca (2017), but which corresponds to restaurants that display generally low churn
rates, suggests there are no effects of minimum wages (including those introduced at the local
level) on McDonald's restaurant closure or entry. This finding is consistent with much of the recent
literature suggesting no or small employment effects of minimum wages (e.g., Cenzig et al., 2019)
and implies that our analyses presented above are not affected by compositional effects.30




29
   Using the 2016-2020 wage data, we also interacted the minimum wage with the `Affected' indicator (see
Section 4) and found no evidence of such interactions affecting entry/exit. Similarly, we have uncovered no
support for any ownership concentration interactions of the minimum wage effects on entry or exit of
restaurants. We have additionally implemented an estimator based on matching a city with a local minimum
wage increase to a similar city (without such increase) within a state or to the nearest similar city. These
results also imply no effect on either entry or exit.
30
   To the extent that we find positive entry effects and zero exit effects, these are consistent with reallocation
towards major franchise chains from smaller firms in line with the evidence in Dustmann et al. (2020).

8. Conclusions


       Minimum wages powerfully affect service occupations. In 2016, almost half of McDonald's
Basic Crew was paid the effective minimum wage. We find a 0.68 elasticity of McWages with
respect to minimum wages and document that McDonald's restaurants increase wages in response
to minimum wage hikes similarly regardless of whether minimum wage increases are binding at the
restaurant level. In response to minimum wage hikes, a large group of restaurants keep their wage
`premium' above the minimum wage constant. Evidence on such minimum-wage `ripple' effects
corresponding to jobs with fixed productivity and hedonic job conditions extends the work on
minimum wage spillovers and suggests across-employer pay norms related to employee churn,
something that Lester (1960) and Kaufman (2010) have emphasized in the institutional literature.
       We also find that McDonald's restaurants do not introduce touch-screen ordering, a
potential labor-saving technology, in response to increases in labor costs driven by minimum wage
hikes. Moreover, we find restaurants are able to pass nearly all of such labor cost increases onto
their customers in the form of higher Big Mac prices. As a result, our evidence indicates that the
elasticity of Big Macs per hour of Basic Crew work (a real wage measure) is 0.54, which is
substantial, but about one-fifth lower than the 0.68 McWage elasticity.
       Strong price pass-through is consistent with our finding of no effect of higher labor costs
due to minimum wages on restaurant closures and with the evidence that higher minimum wages
do not speed up the introduction of labor-saving technology. We cannot reject non-zero
employment elasticities, but our McDonald's evidence, based on highly consistent comparisons
across time and space, is in line with the growing literature suggesting that recent minimum wage
increases did not affect employment in the non-tradable sector, including restaurants and retail, a
sector that employs the majority of minimum wage workers in the US.
       Finally, we uncover similar minimum wage effects when using variation in minimum
wages driven by state-wide minimum wage increases and when relying on variation brought about
by local (city or county) minimum wage increases. Our evidence thus suggests that cities may be
able to tailor minimum wage policy to local economic conditions.
