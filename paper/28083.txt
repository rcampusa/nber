                                           ABSTRACT

We report on the state of the labor market midway through the COVID recession, focusing
particularly on measuring market tightness. As we show using a simple model, tightness is crucial
for understanding the relative importance of labor supply or demand side factors in job creation.
In tight markets, worker search effort has a relatively larger impact on job creation, while
employer profitability looms larger in slack markets. We measure tightness combining job seeker
information from the CPS and vacancy postings from Burning Glass Technologies. To parse the
former, we develop a taxonomy of the non-employed that identifies job seekers and excludes the
large number of those on temporary layoff who are waiting to be recalled. With this taxonomy,
we find that effective tightness has declined about 50% since the onset of the epidemic to levels
last seen in 2016, when labor markets generally appeared to be tight. Disaggregating market
tightness, we find mismatch has surprisingly declined in the COVID recession. Further, while
markets still appear to be tight relative to other recessionary periods, this could change quickly if
the large group of those who lost their jobs but are not currently searching for a range of COVID-
related reasons reenter the search market.

1    Introduction
In April 2020, the U.S. economy lost 20 million jobs and, each week, millions of workers filed
new unemployment insurance claims. As we showed in (Forsythe et al. [2020]), the future looked
especially bleak with a broad-based collapse in job vacancies across virtually all sectors, occupations,
and geographies. Surprisingly, by June, nearly half of the lost jobs had returned and job vacancies
had recovered to 80% of their pre-pandemic levels. However, the recovery in the labor market has
stagnated since then, recovering little ground between June and November.
    In this paper, we document how the labor market has evolved in 2020. We show that the
rapid employment movements between March and June were dominated by temporary layoffs and
recalls. Most individuals on temporary layoff were waiting to be recalled and did not actively search
for new employment. This trend--likely combined with virus-related concerns--served to depress
aggregate job search activity. The COVID recession is therefore exceptional in that it saw negative
shocks to both labor demand and supply. In this paper, we explore the theoretical and empirical
implications of the combined supply and demand shocks, to better understand the current crisis
and our path to recovery.
    First, we build a simple model to help us understand how labor supply and demand shocks
impact job creation. Our frictional labor market, in the tradition of the Diamond-Mortensen-
Pissarides model, allows worker search effort and profitability per worker to impact aggregate
employment through vacancy creation. We derive a simple expression for how each component
influences job growth on the margin. This expression depends crucially on labor market tightness
­ the ratio of job openings to job seekers. When markets are slack, increases in profitability have
a relatively strong impact on job growth, while search effort becomes increasingly important in
tighter markets. Search effort induces firms to create vacancies because their bargaining power
improves when more potential workers are searching and because increased search allows a wider
pool of applicants and thus improves quality of hires. Intuitively, when markets are tight and
firms compete over a small set of applicants, additional search will have a stronger effect on both
bargaining and quality. Therefore, in tighter markets, the impact of search effort on profitability
increases, while in slacker markets other factors driving profitability, such as aggregate demand,
become relatively more important. Our model then has implications for policy making over the
business cycle since some policies affect profitability (such as hiring credits or stimulus measures
to support product demand) while others may have a more direct effect on search effort (such as
unemployment insurance extensions).
    We next turn to measure market tightness under the conditions of the COVID recession. In
spring 2020, headline unemployment numbers were dominated by people who reported they were
waiting to be recalled by their previous employer. Since many of these individuals were likely not
seeking to fill new vacancies, they did not contribute to a slackening of the labor market. We
therefore need to measure search unemployment in a way that adjusts for the unusual composition
of the non-employed population. To do so, we develop a taxonomy using the detailed questions
on search behavior in the Current Population Survey (CPS). We assign non-employed individuals

                                                   2
into a "Waiting Room," consisting of those who are expecting to be recalled and are not actively
searching for work, an "Open Market", consisting of the searching unemployed, and NILF, the
group that is neither waiting nor searching. We validate our measures by examining the path of
April job separators over the early months of the crisis, taking advantage of the longitudinal link
in the CPS.
       We use this "FKLW taxonomy" to evaluate the COVID recession midway into the crisis.
       First, reinforcing what we have said above, the early part of the COVID recession was dominated
by movement in and out of the Waiting Room. This has been the defining event of spring 2020.
In contrast, movement into the Open Market in April, a month which saw more than 20 million
people leave their jobs, was negligible. However, the Open Market has grown steadily ever since,
overtaking the Waiting Room by July and growing to 2.5 times larger than the Waiting Room by
November. The Waiting Room partially emptied via movements to employment, which were most
likely recalls. The Open Market filled via small movements from people who were previously in
the Waiting Room or in NILF combined with a tendency to persist in the Open Market from one
month to the next. That is, people in the Open Market have seen much less movement back into
employment compared to those in the Waiting Room.
       With the Open Market moving to center stage, it becomes increasingly important to understand
how the economy is functioning at forming new employment matches. This process will be key for
moving back to full employment once the pandemic is over. Our second set of facts are devoted
to understanding labor market tightness. To measure vacancies we use job postings collected by
Burning Glass Technologies (BGT).1 Using headline unemployment numbers, we find that tightness
fell by 75% between January and April 2020, to levels not seen since early in the recovery from
the Great Recession. This level of slack suggests that there are many people competing for each
job opening. However, as we have seen, unemployment during the early months of the COVID
crisis was dominated by people who were not actively searching for work. We introduce a new
measure of effective labor market tightness that considers vacancies per Open Market searcher.
This alternative measure also indicates a substantial fall in tightness (a 50% drop between January
and April), but only back to levels last seen in 2016. Further, we show that our effective tightness
measure generates a much better behaved Beveridge Curve than the headline numbers suggest.
       Third, we explore heterogeneity in the characteristics of job vacancies relative to the Open
Market. Mismatch can generate an additional friction elevating unemployment and causing markets
to take longer to clear. Mismatch due to recessionary reallocation is generally a concern [S
                                                                                           ¸ ahin
et al., 2014] and some expect the COVID crisis to to be an especially large reallocation shock
[Barrero et al., 2020]. We exploit the richness of the BGT vacancy data to explore mismatch
across occupations, industries, and education levels. We are surprised to find that mismatch has, if
anything, decreased over the COVID recession. Thus, while both the non-college and college labor
markets have become less tight, tightness in the market for college labor has dropped more. This
   1
    See Hershbein and Kahn [2018] for the first use of BGT and a discussion of representativeness of the data. We
also provide analyses using vacancies measured in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and find very similar
results.

has lead tightness to converge across markets.
      The relative decline in tightness in college labor market is driven by a decline in the fraction
of Job ads that require a college degree. This decline is in turn largely driven by a change in
requirements within firms, not a change in the industry mix of ads. Within firms, it is primarily
due to a shift towards occupations that tend to require less education. Indeed, tightness has
declined by more in professional occupations, whose markets are typically quite tight, resulting
again in compression. Reduced variance in tightness across markets is a sign commonly taken as
declining mismatch [S
                    ¸ ahin et al., 2014].
      Returning to our model, the observed drop in tightness in 2020 means that policies targeting
profitability will be more important for job creation than they were before the crisis. However,
the drop in effective tightness places us back to levels observed just a few years ago when markets
were already fairly tight. In addition, because we find declining mismatch, we do not believe
effective tightness in the aggregate suffers from increased mis-measurement due to heterogeneity
across markets. Thus, there may also be a role for search effort to impact job creation at present,
relative to previous recessions.
      However, going forward, there are several warning signs indicating that slack might build up in
the next few months. First, we continue to observe elevated weekly initial unemployment insurance
claims; each week there are still more new claimants than observed during most weeks in the
Great Recession. Second, the size of the Waiting Room is still substantial as we write. And,
unemployment durations for both the Waiting Room and the Open Market are rising. The longer
individuals wait on temporary layoff, the more likely it is that their layoff will become permanent.
Third, the NILF category also contains an excess population that likely represents discouraged
workers or those who cannot search for work during the epidemic. For instance, people could be
worried for their own health or face restrictions due to increased childcare responsibilities. There
is thus potential for a rapid build up in the Open Market from the Waiting Room and NILF. All
of this proceeds while COVID cases are rising for the third time across the United States. The
situation in the labor market continues to be precarious.
      Our paper contributes to a new literature examining the COVID economy. Our first paper
on the subject (Forsythe et al. [2020]) took advantage of real-time job vacancy data collected by
BGT to show that the economic collapse in Spring 2020 was broad-based and unlikely driven by
individual state policies but rather was the response to the global pandemic and halting of activity
in response to fears of the virus. Since then, several researchers using a wide range of datasets
have corroborated these results and provided additional context for the COVID crisis (for instance
Bartik et al. [2020]; Cajner et al. [2020]; Goolsbee and Syverson [2020]; Gupta et al. [2020]; Cortes
and Forsythe [2020a]). In this paper, we continue to take advantage of the richness in BGT to
provide a thorough understanding of market tightness early in the COVID recovery.
      Several researchers have noted the rising importance of temporary layoffs and recalls, (e.g.,
Kudlyak and Wolcott [2020]; Hall and Kudlyak [2020], Blandin and Bick [2020]).2 We contribute

to this literature by providing a taxonomy of the non-employed that allows us to distinguish those
actively seeking new employment. By creating a new measure of effective labor market search,
we show our taxonomy is consequential for understanding tightness--declining by much less than
headline unemployment would suggest--and this is crucial to understanding the state of the re-
covery.3 Hall and Kudlyak [2020] also present recent estimates of tightness that go in the same
direction as ours, though their methods are considerably different, inferring it solely from hires and
openings in JOLTS.
    A central point of departure for our analysis will be that search effort has declined in this
recession, which occurred simultaneously with a quite large expansion in unemployment insurance
(UI) benefits in the CARES Act. While much of the classic analysis had looked at how UI affects
search incentives, with a goal towards aligning search effort to get people back into jobs, e.g.
Hopenhayn and Nicolini [1997] or Chetty [2008], the set of trade-offs in the pandemic is clearly
different because full employment is not necessarily optimal but the income insurance motive is still
as important.4 Several papers embed these trade-offs to discuss an optimal UI policy response (e.g.
Mitman and Rabinovich [2020] and Fang et al. [2020]) while others aim to understand how workers'
search effort responds to the CARES Act incentives [Petrosky-Nadeau, 2020; Boar and Mongey,
2020; Altonji et al., 2020; Marinescu and Zhao, 2020]. These papers tend to find little-to-no effect.
This is important context in which to interpret our work, both empirical and theoretical. While we
will look at the way in which non-employed workers match with new employers, we do not analyze
what the socially optimal level of search during the COVID pandemic is.
    Finally, our work on mismatch early in the recovery relates back to the discussion of mismatch
following the Great Recession, which took center stage as people worried that house lock and struc-
tural change were elevating the unemployment rate and prolonging the Great Recession. Careful
work documented the role of misalignment between vacancies and searchers in labor markets var-
iously defined, e.g. [Elsby et al., 2011; S
                                          ¸ ahin et al., 2014]. In the current crisis, the shock was
potentially even more asymmetric, and there is evidence of job reallocation, e.g. Barrero et al.
[2020]. To our knowledge, we are the first to measure mismatch during the early COVID recovery
and we surprisingly see that mismatch across education and occupation groups has declined in
recent months--contrary to the pattern in the Great Recession documented by S
                                                                            ¸ ahin et al. [2014].
Monitoring mismatch will continue to be important to understand the labor market during and
following the COVID recession.
    The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present a brief overview of some of the main
trends in the labor market during the COVID recession. Section 3 then develops our argument why
tightness is a crucial statistic to understand vacancy creation and employment growth. Section 4
simulations suggest that a large wave of temporary layoffs such as that observed in March/April can support a rapid
initial recovery while at the same time depress vacancy postings later in the recovery, thus prolonging the slump.
    3
      In related work, Gallant et al. [2020] use a version of our taxonomy to calibrate a matching model and project
the evolution of the labor market over the next year. Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese [2020] rely on a factor model
and the statistical dependence across labor force groups observed in the past for the same purpose.

      Cortes and Forsythe [2020b] show the CARES Act dramatically reduced the widening of income inequality in
the COVID crisis. See also Bitler et al. [forthcoming].

discusses our approach to classifying CPS respondents by whether or not they are searching for
work. Section 5 then combines the Open Market measure developed in the preceding section with
BGT data on job postings to measure market tightness over time. This section also presents our
evidence on mismatch and discusses our results in light of the model developed in Section 3. The
last section concludes.


2    Motivating Trends
Figure 1 illustrates how four key indicators of the labor market evolved during the COVID recession,
with details on the data construction in the Data Appendix. The earliest signs of the collapse were
evident in initial Unemployment Insurance claims (top left), which began to rise dramatically in
mid-March, peaking in early April at over 6 million claims per week. At no point during the Great
Recession, did initial claims reach 1 million in a single week.

Notes: Weekly initial unemployment insurance claims (top left) are obtained from FRED (the ICNSA series). Job
postings (top right), obtained from Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) are the weekly flow of new postings in their
database. Employment (left) and unemployment (right) are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly
employment situation. Employment is measured in the payroll survey (CES) and unemployment is measured from
the household survey (CPS). Measures are unadjusted for seasonality.



    Job vacancy postings, collected in real time by Burning Glass Technologies (top right) began
to decline rapidly in mid-March and bottomed out at a 40% decline in new weekly job postings in
the week of April 26th.


                                                                                 6
      Collected at a monthly frequency, the official numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) were slow to reflect the crisis because the bulk of job losses occurred just after the survey's
March reference week. By April, the BLS statistics showed employment falling by 20 million jobs
(bottom left) and unemployment soaring to over 14% (bottom right).
      After the initial collapse in March and April, all data series indicate a rapid partial recovery;
nearly half of the employment losses were recovered by June, and vacancy postings reverted to 80%
of their pre-pandemic level. Since then however, the recovery has slowed or even come to a halt.
In November, initial UI claims hovered around 800,000 per week, employment remained 7 million
jobs below February levels, and the unemployment rate was two-thirds higher than in February.
Job postings have sustained no progress since early summer. Thus, after a brief, yet pronounced
initial rebound, the momentum of the recovery has slowed significantly.
      A remarkable feature of the COVID Recession was the rise in temporary layoffs. This can be
seen in both employer and worker data. From the Current Population Survey (CPS), we observe
whether the unemployed themselves believe they will be recalled by their employer. Figure 2 plots
the share of unemployed who report being on temporary layoff (blue line). The share averaged 13%
prior to 2020 and exhibited little movement in either of the preceding recessions. In fact, going
back to 1967 (not shown), temporary layoffs have never exceeded 25% of unemployment. However,
in April 2020 the share spiked to nearly 80%. Since then, the share has declined. While it remains
elevated by historical standards, the majority of unemployed are now permanent.5

with temporary layoffs spiking to over 80% of layoffs in March and April, but falling back to below 40% by May.

rary unemployment with much less of an increase in search unemployment. This trend may have
contributed to another unusual feature of the COVID recession: contrary to typical recessions, job
search activity declined during the COVID downturn. While the CPS informs on the number of
non-employed job seekers, it does not tell us about the intensity of search effort among the unem-
ployed or about search among the employed. In Figure 3, we show how Google searches for "job"
evolved during the early weeks of the COVID Recession (blue line). These Google searches serve
as a proxy for overall search, aggregating search among the employed and the non-employed and
accounting for their search effort.6 At its trough in the week beginning April 1, search volume fell
by more than 1/3 even though the stock of non-employed had risen by 20 million. In contrast,
during the first few months of the Great Recession (red line), aggregate search increased modestly.
It then increased markedly roughly 1 year into the NBER-defined recession when weekly initial
claims reached their Great Recession peak.7
   6
     See also Baker and Fradkin [2017] for the use of google trends data to measure job search. To adjust for seasonality,
we plot the rate of change in search activity relative to the average in the same week of the 3 years prior. One might
worry this is affected by the rising use of Google for job search prior to the Great Recession, however, this trend
would tend to diminish the rise from 2008-2009 because early in the recession the comparison period would have been
lower than later in the period, biasing the slope downward.
   7
     Weekly initial unemployment insurance claims were especially elevated 12 to 14 months after the official start of
the recession, peaking in January 2009.



                                                            8
       The unusual decline in search activity may be driven by a range of COVID-related factors,
including childcare needs or fears about the virus itself preventing people from searching for work.
In addition, workers on temporary layoff are likely not actively searching for work. If these workers
can return to their previous employers, they can bypass the market search-and-matching process.
Indeed, the maroon line in Figure 2 shows a spike in the share of hires who were on temporary
layoff in the previous month.8 This fraction typically hovers around 6%, rising to just under 10%
during the Great Recession. In sharp contrast, the COVID recovery has seen an outsized share of
hires from temporary layoff, peaking at 40% in May and coming down throughout fall (along with
hiring as a whole).
       In recent weeks, aggregate search activity recovered some ground, at the same time as the per-
manent share of unemployment has grown and overall hiring has slowed. Increasingly, the recovery
will hinge on how quickly and effectively new matches between job-seekers and new employers will
be formed.
       Thus, the COVID recession has been so far characterized by a steep employment collapse as
well as a collapse in search activity. The former is surprising in its magnitude and swiftness. The
latter is unprecedented in that we would expect, if anything, an increase in search activity when
there are 20 million newly non-employed people. These patterns then suggest the COVID recession
may be characterized by shocks to both labor demand and labor supply. Policy makers have at
their disposal tools to impact both. For instance, hiring credits can raise the profitability of hiring
a new worker. Unemployment insurance extensions and bonuses serve to stimulate spending but
may also disincentivize search. But how should policy makers think about the impacts of these
respective tools in the current environment?
       In the next section, we write down a simple model to understand factors that can influence job
creation. Specifically, we explore the importance of shocks to search effort, compared to profitability
per hire in generating employment growth. Further, we show that the relative importance of the
two factors varies over the business cycle.
       Our last motivating fact explores how COVID impacted the industrial and occupational mix
of jobs. With workers and consumers becoming reluctant to leave their homes, we would expect
jobs involving customer interactions to take a larger hit, while jobs that can be performed from
home could have been sheltered. Figure 4 plots employment (left) and job postings (right) for
aggregated industry and occupation groups in 2020 as a ratio, relative to their February level.
Indeed, customer-facing industries (solid blue line) took the largest hit in both employment and
postings.9 We pull out essential retail (Retail-E, dashed blue line) from the rest of the customer-
facing jobs because it had a very different experience with a much shallower employment decline
followed by a sharper recovery, as well as periodic positive spikes in job postings.
   8
     The CPS does not allow us to measure directly whether a worker was recalled by their previous employer but we
use the longitudinal link to observe whether a respond was waiting to be recalled in the prior month.
   9
     We use Forsythe et al. [2020] to define essential industries and Dingel and Neiman [2020] to define teleworkable
(WFH) occupations. Customer-related jobs contains arts and entertainment (NAICS code 71), food and accommo-
dation (72), other services (81) and non-essential retail.

follow Forsythe et al. [2020] in defining essential industries and Dingel and Neiman [2020] in defining teleworkable
(WFH) occupations. Customer-related jobs (blue solid line) contains arts and entertainment (NAICS code 71), food
and accommodation (72), other services (81) and non-essential retail and averages 16.5% of employment; essential
retail (blue dashed line) averages 6% of employment; work from home (WFH) occupations (green solid line) average
38% of employment; non-work from home (Non WFH) occupations (green dashed line) average 38.5% of employment.



    We split the remaining jobs into occupations that can likely be performed from home (WFH,
solid green) and those that cannot (Non WFH, dashed green). In terms of employment, Non-WFH
jobs did face a larger hit in April, consistent with expectations, though employment in both types
of jobs has converged during the recovery. Job postings saw a starkly different pattern. Postings
in non WFH occupations have largely recovered, while postings in WFH occupations took a much
larger hit and have exhibited only a shallow recovery.10 The data on posting thus runs counter
to commonly voiced expectations that the employment structure of the US will permanently shift
towards jobs that can be performed from home. Further, this asymmetry across sectors can affect
the mismatch between the characteristics of job seekers and job openings and matching efficiency.
We explore mismatch directly in Section 5.
  10
     When we also split by whether the industry is essential, we find identical results in job postings (i.e., the crucial
distinction is between WFH and not). For employment, non-essential non-WFH jobs took a larger hit and have
sustained a slower recovery compared to essential jobs and non-essential WFH jobs.

3         Job creation as tightness changes: Theory
Our model begins with a frictional labor market in the tradition of the Diamond-Mortensen-
Pissarides (DMP) model.11 We will use this model to look at comparative statics of employment
and vacancy creation with respect to shifts in profitability per hire and search effort among job
seekers. That is, we take as exogenous profitability and search and explore how shocks to these
factors will impact the endogenous employment and vacancy outcomes.

3.1         The dynamics and steady state of employment
We begin with two difference equations for the dynamic path of the stock of vacancies V (equation
1) and employment L (equation 2) over time t. Here the non-employed, 1 - Lt , have an average
search effort, et  [0, 1]. This effort can either be interpreted as the fraction of non-employed
who are actively searching or it can also include an intensive margin among active searchers. New
vacancies are denoted vt . Employment relationships end at exogenous rate  . Matches formed in
any period depend on the constant returns to scale (CRS) matching function M (), which takes as
arguments the stock of vacancies V and total search e(1 - L).



                                     Vt+1 = Vt + vt - M (et (1 - Lt ), Vt )                                    (1)
                                 1 - Lt+1 = 1 - Lt - M (et (1 - Lt ), Vt ) + t Lt                              (2)

         In these difference equations, vacancies in t +1 equal vacancies in t plus the new flow of vacancies
and minus any vacancies that are filled.12 Non-employment in t + 1 equals non-employment in t
minus jobs filled by the non-employed and plus new separations.
         From now on, we will consider an economy in deterministic steady state. The steady state
provides intuition about the key dynamics in our model, even though the economy is clearly subject
to shocks. However, given the speed of labor force transitions in the U.S., observed distributions
converge quickly to the steady state implied by current flows, should they persist (see, e.g. Elsby
et al. [2013]).13
         Thus, we set Vt+1 = Vt = V and Lt+1 = Lt = L. This allows us to solve the two difference
equations (1) and (2) for the steady state employment level:

                                                             v
                                                     L=                                                        (3)
                                                             

         Steady-state employment depends entirely on the flow of vacancies and the separation rate. This
is to say, if employment is at its steady state, the inflow of vacancies, v , equals the outflow from
employment, L. From now on, we will hold  fixed. Hence v determines steady state employment.
    11
     We draw on the classic model outlined in Rogerson et al. [2005].
    12
     Vacancies are assumed to last until they are filled, that is, they do not expire or depreciate.
  13
     As we will demonstrate in the empirical work below, current transitions rates are particularly high, which can
help reduce the approximation error associated with using the steady state.


                                                        11
Both search effort and outside factors that shift a position's profitability affect employment only to
the extent that they induce firms to create new positions. In the next subsection, we outline our
framework behind the firm's decision to create jobs (the key endogenous variable, v ).
    In this environment, define market tightness to be the ratio of the stock of vacancies to total
                 V                                                                                       M (V,e(1-L))
search:  =    e(1-L) .   Then the probability that a vacancy is filled in one period is q () =                V       .
For consistency with much of the literature and to simplify our notation, we impose a Cobb-Douglas
form to the matching function, so that M (V, e(1 - L)) = V 1- (e(1 - L)) . Then q () = - where
 is the elasticity of the matching function with respect to total job search.14
    It will be useful to solve for market tightness as a function of L and e using the equations (1)
and (2) in steady state and the matching function. This gives:
                                                                   1
                                                        L         1-
                                              =                        .                                           (4)
                                                     e(1 - L)

    From this equation for tightness, we can define the elasticity of tightness with respect to em-
ployment:
                                L     1    1      L      1            1
                         L        =                          =                                                     (5)
                               L    1 -  1 - L e(1 - L) q ()   (1 -  )(1 - L)
and therefore the elasticity of tightness with respect to search effort:

                                               e                  1
                                      e          = L (L - 1) = -                                                   (6)
                                              e                  1-

    These expressions are implied by the constant-returns matching function, by defining search
as e(1 - L), and by imposing the steady state so that v = L. For a matching function elasticity
  [0, 1], we have that L > 0 and e < 0. That is, tightness increases in employment and
decreases in search effort.

3.2    Endogenous vacancy creation
Given the primacy of v in determining employment, we now specify the firms' problem of posting
vacancies. To focus on the choice over v , we restrict separations from the representative firm to
be exogenous, which is consistent with our treatment of aggregate flows above. The firm's cost of
posting a vacancy is given by c(·), where we assume c > 0, c (v )  0, where the strictly convex
case will be our focus.15 Firms also incur a per-period carrying cost,  , for unfilled vacancies. Time
is discounted at rate r and, as above, employment relationships end at rate  .
    The profit per worker is  () =  (  ~). That is, we express profit per worker as a function of two
   14
      Lange and Papageorgiou [2020] challenge the standard Cobb-Douglas assumption for the matching function. In
particular, the elasticity of the matching function with respect to vacancies might itself change with tightness, which
would affect our conclusions below. So far, whether the matching function does vary with tightness is an empirically
unresolved question and we will assume for this analysis that it does not.
   15
      The convexity assumption is consistent with vacancy yield evidence from Davis et al. [2013]. They suggest that
firms make efforts to increase the yield per post as they post more, which is justified if these posts are increasingly
costly.



                                                          12
        ~) represents profitability that is impacted by tightness, ;  is anything else exogenously
terms:  (
shifting profitability, such as movements in aggregate demand. Tightness itself can potentially
impact profitability via, for example, wage pressure, whereby workers command a higher wage
when markets are tight. Further, the firm may be able to select from higher quality matches when
markets are slack. For both reasons we expect profitability of new hires to decline in tightness,
meaning that  ()  0. The parameter  will allow us to shift profitability per worker for exogenous
reasons. Such shifts will be a central focus in our comparative statics discussion below.
    Putting together these pieces, the firm's problem is to maximize profits:

                                                                      1
                             (V, L) = max  ()L - V - c(v ) +             (L , V )
                                          v                          1+r
                                    V = (V + v )(1 - q ())
                                    L = q ()(V + v ) + (1 -  )L .

The solution is characterized by the first order condition and envelope conditions, where we are
showing the latter already in a deterministic steady state.

                                     1  (V , L )         1  (V , L )
                         c (v ) =                q () +              (1 - q ())
                                   1+r      L           1+r   V
                                       1+r
                                 =  ()
                             L         r+
                                     1+r            1
                                 =          - +        ()q ()
                             V     r + q ()      +r

These combine to yield
                                                 q () () 1+ r
                                                          +r - (1 - q ( ))
                                      c (v ) =                             .                   (7)
                                                         q () + r
The solution in equation 7 states that the firm sets the marginal cost of creating a new vacancy
to the expected payoff ­ with probability q the firm earns  and with complementary probability
1 - q the firm pays  . These are discounted by r and the destruction rate of a vacancy, which is
also its filling rate, q .
    To further simplify this expression, we can set r = 0, a common assumption in search mod-
els considering high-frequency outcomes, and use our assumed functional form for the matching
function. At steady state v = L, so the vacancy creation condition is c (L) -  ()/ +  ( - 1) = 0.

3.3    Comparative Statics: The relative importance of search effort and prof-
       itability
Next, we consider how vacancy creation and consequently employment depend on two objects that
are parameters in this analysis: search effort, e, and our profit shifter, . In particular, we ask
whether the effect of the exogenous variables (e, ) on the endogenous variables (v, L) changes
depending on whether  is tight or slack.


                                                         13
       Starting with e, we take the first order condition (7) and perform comparative statics for e and
                                                                  dL e
the endogenous variable L. This allows us to solve for            de L :

                                               1     ()            
                                   dL e    q(   ) -                L   (1 - L)
                                        =                                               .                         (8)
                                   de L      1      ()            
                                           q( ) -                 L   + c (L)

                                                          dL e
       It is straightforward to sign this expression:     de L   > 0.16 This is in line with our intuition that
as the supply of search increases, there is more labor hired in equilibrium.
       To simplify the exposition, and because we believe  to be relatively small, we now set  = 0.17
This simplifies the above expression that characterizes the equilibrium elasticity of employment to
search effort. Recall, L is the elasticity of tightness with respect to employment.

                                           dL e   - ()
                                                       L (1 - L)
                                                =  (
                                           de L      )
                                                 -  L + Lc (v)
                                                                   dL e        dv e
Then using v = L, which allows us also to substitute               de L    =   de v ,   and uncover the elasticity of
new vacancies with respect search effort, ve

                                             dv e    - ()L (1 - L)
                                      ve          =                                                               (9)
                                             de v   - ()L + vc (v )
       We now consider variation in  to capture exogenous shifts in profitability not induced by
tightness. Such shifts might occur due to changes in the product demand, maybe induced by the
business cycle.
       Substituting  () = ~ () in the first-order condition for vacancy creation (7), our comparative
static of v or L with respect to  yields the elasticity of new vacancies with respect to profitability,
  16      1
        q( )

     is also positive, because  < 0. In the numerator, these terms are multiplied by L     
                                                                                             (1 - L) = -e , which is
also positive. So this is the effect that changing e has on , which then increases L. In the denominator, however,
the increase in e increases employment. This implies another change in --the first term of the denominator--and
an increase in the cost of posting vacancies to maintain the steady state at that level of employment, c .
  17
      captures costs such as maintaining the vacancy on online job boards and, more importantly, the administrative
costs within the firm. They should not include costs due to foregone profits while the position is unfilled since
discounting accounts for these. Overall, we think  likely to be small relative to onboarding costs and the costs of
equipping new positions with capital which are part of c(v ). Further, if we were to instead assume  > 0, then our
conclusions would be reinforced. This is because when markets are tight, the present discounted value of carrying a
vacancy ( q ( )
                ) increases and is more responsive to additional searcher in the market. Thus, when markets are tight,
search effort reduces the effective cost of holding open a vacancy until it is filled.

The second equality comes from substituting for L using equation (5).
                                                       ve        1
      This surprisingly parsimonious expression,       v    = - 1-  , shows the relative sensitivity of
vacancy creation to changes in e (search effort) or  (profit shifters). When the ratio of these
elasticities is large, vacancies are changing relatively more due to e. When the ratio it is small  is
the salient shock.

Discussion
The ratio in equation 11 is proportional to  ­ how profits change with market tightness ­ and
 1
1- .    The role of the latter is intuitive. 1 -  is the elasticity of the matching function with respect
                                                 ve
to vacancies. If it is large then the fraction   v    becomes small and vacancies will be relatively more
responsive to changes in profits per worker, . Intuitively, when matching is very responsive to
vacancies, that diminishes the role of search both for matching and thus also for vacancy creation.
      To understand why the elasticity  determines the relative sensitivity of vacancies with respect
to effort or profitability, observe that e factors directly into . A marginal increase in e lowers
tightness, which then acts on the ~ () portion of the profit function. As we noted, this represents
how profits per worker could increase in a slacker market through wages or selection. If this
determinant of profits is prominent (i.e.,  is large), then an increase in e would generate a larger
increase in vacancies. That is, the responsiveness of vacancies to search effort matters a lot. If, on
the other hand, profits are not that responsive to tightness then the increase in search effort will
matter less for vacancy creation, and instead our other profit shifter,  will be more important.
      Therefore, search effort will impact vacancy creation only in so far as tightness impacts profits.
If tightness does not have a large and direct impact on profits then other factors determining
profitability (such as aggregate demand) will be more important for vacancy creation.
      Further, this elasticity,  , may change with . In fact, fairly standard economic theory predicts
that  becomes more negative with tightness. First, the canonical search and matching model
 18
      This comes from

                             c (L) =~ ()/ -  ( - 1)
                                                         
                                  dL  2 c (v ) -  ()+ -1               = d~ ()
                                                  L      L
                              dL                 ()
                                  =

robustly concludes that wages depend on market tightness. With wages set by Nash bargaining,
profits decrease in tightness and at a larger rate as  gets larger. If firms' bargaining weight is fixed
                                                               -a
and postings costs are weakly convex,  takes the form         b-a   where a, b are constant and a is weakly
increasing in v . For the range in which we are concerned, b > a because otherwise this means
negative profits, but if  gets larger, that makes this elasticity larger in magnitude. Second, the
choice set of potential employees for a given vacancy declines as markets become tighter, potentially
reducing quality of the eventual hire and hence profitability. It stands to reason that this effect
will be relatively unimportant if the choice set is already large, but as markets become tighter and
the choice set shrinks, the effect of tightness on candidate quality will become more pronounced.19
         For both reasons, we argue that  increases in magnitude as markets become tighter. This
implies that a very tight market makes profits more sensitive to tightness and therefore search effort
is quite important for job creation. In contrast, when markets are slack and  is low, changes in
profit are most important.
         Though theory provides easy qualitative predictions about  , unfortunately, it is difficult to
estimate  and how it varies with . Estimates of this elasticity - either based on structural
arguments or from reduced form are sorely needed. Given the lack of good evidence, we will, for
the remainder of the paper, only postulate that the magnitude of  increases monotonically in
tightness .
         Our discussion implies that carefully measuring tightness in the labor market is a crucial first
step to properly evaluate how changes in vacancies, search effort and profits interact. In what
follows, we aim to carefully measure search effort, vacancies, and market tightness to both inform
how we think about what happened in the labor market during the last months and also provide
a crucial input for evidence based policy.


4         Searching and waiting
In this section, we show how to use the detailed Current Population Survey (CPS) questions to
better distinguish between those actively searching for jobs and those waiting to return to their
former employers. In particular, we will classify the non-employed to belong either to the "Waiting
Room', which consists of those waiting to be recalled to their previous job, the "Open Market"
which consists of those searching to match with a new employer, and those who are neither waiting
nor searching.
         We proceed in two steps. First, we take advantage of the longitudinal nature of the CPS to
track respondents who lost employment early during the pandemic; we call these respondents "April
separators". Thanks to the structure of the CPS, we can observe April separators for a restricted
sample, through June of 2020. We classify April separators by their search behavior while non-
employed, measure whether they were subsequently re-employed and, if so, we infer the likelihood
    19
    For example, adding 10 workers to the pool of applicants should have a big impact on quality of the chosen
candidate when there was previously only one applicant, while it should have less of an impact when there are
already 100 applicants.


                                                      16
that they were recalled to the same employer. Second, we use these differences in ex post inferred
recall rates to classify respondents based on their current labor market status and reported search
behavior. The ex ante classification system can be applied on a less restricted sample ­ one that
does not require us to know whether a non-employed individual lost their job during COVID or
whether they were re-employed ­ so that we can measure labor market progress moving forward.

4.1    Characterizing April Job Separators
We rely on the Current Population Survey (CPS), restricting attention to non-institutionalized
individuals aged 16 and up. We follow Madrian and Lefgren [1999] and match individuals across
months using longitudinal identifiers and confirm matches using sex, race, and age. We trace the
path of April separators: individuals who were employed in February or March of 2020 and were
non-employed in April. Given the survey structure of the CPS, we can follow individuals for up
to four consecutive months. Thus, we can estimate reemployment probabilities of April separators
through June 2020.
    Our goal is to estimate the rate at which April separators are recalled by their previous employer.
Differences in recall rates across labor market statuses helps us distinguish those who are likely
waiting to be recalled from those who are more likely searching for new employers. This exercise
helps us understand the extent to which we can rely on respondents' self reports about whether
they are waiting to be recalled for our ex ante classification.
    Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe whether individuals are recalled, so we have to rely on
a proxy: whether a re-employed worker returns to the same industry. We consider re-employment
in the same major industry category to be an "inferred recall". All other re-employment is termed
a "market hire".20 Of course, workers may return to the same industry without returning to the
same employer ­ though they cannot return to the same employer without also returning to the
same industry. Our inferred recall rate, i.e., the share of hires that are inferred recalls, is thus
an upper bound. Although the level overstates recalls in the economy, we hope that differences
between groups represent meaningful variation in the propensity to be recalled. Appendix Figure
A.2 shows a steep increase of around 30 percentage points in the inferred recall rate in spring 2020.
Reassuringly, this increase is of a similar magnitude to the share of hires who recently reported being
on temporary layoff (Figure 2), despite the fact that inferred recalls use none of that information.
    Table 1 reports on April separators by detailed labor force status classification in 2020 (top
panel) and, for comparison, 2015-2019 (bottom panel). Column 2 reports the distribution of April
separators across categories and column 3 the share that are re-employed in May or June. Column
4 reports the fraction of hires that are inferred recalls (returned to the previous industry.)
  20
     Using a narrower industry code will reduce the chance that we erroneously categorize a non-recall as an industry
stayer, but increases the chance that the same employer is mis-categorized in a different industry across months.
Thus, in the longitudinally matched data, we use the major industry code of the pre-pandemic employer. The cross-
sectional data includes a variable for previous industry, but only asks this of unemployed individuals. We use the
four-month panel so that we can observe a previous industry for a broader sample, including those who were recently
employed but currently out of the labor force.



                                                         17
       The rows in Table 1 highlight labor force categories that capture detailed types of non-employment.
The table also breaks out those that are employed but absent from work for unspecified reasons and
not paid during their work absence. During the pandemic months, an unusually large number of
people reported being absent from work for unspecified reasons. The BLS suggested that these were
most likely individuals on temporary layoff who had incorrectly identified as absent from work.21
We follow Cortes and Forsythe [2020a] and assign this group to non-employment, while keeping
those who were paid as employed. In practice, these employed-absent-unpaid individuals are func-
tionally equivalent to the temporary unemployed in that they are separated from their workplace,
do not receive a salary, but do maintain a link to their employer. The "employed absent" group
represents 16% of April separators in 2020 (compared to only 5% in normal times), has the highest
likelihood of being hired by May or June 2020 (53%), and more than 90% of these hires are inferred
recalls.
       Among the non-employed, we follow the path of the CPS questionnaire to classify respondents
further by attachment to the prior employer and by their search activity. Respondents are first
asked if they are on temporary layoff. To be on temporary layoff, the individual has to report being
(a) on layoff and (b) having a date to return or assurance that they will be recalled within 6 months.
In addition, individuals are asked whether or not they searched for work while on temporary layoff.
Since we are interested in participation in the Open Market, we separate temporary layoffs into
those not searching (Temp, No Search) and those searching (Temp, Search).22
       The CPS then asks the non-employed who are not on temporary layoff whether or not they
searched for work during the last four weeks. Those that report searching are then asked a series of
questions to classify their search into active or passive.23 If any active method is used, the individual
is classified as unemployed (Unemp, Search), while those using only passive methods are classified
as not-in-the-labor-force (NILF). In addition, individuals who perform no search, who are retired
or disabled, and those unable to work are assigned to the NILF category. Together, the temporary
layoffs and searching unemployed comprise the headline unemployment number reported monthly
in the BLS employment situation.
       Those NILF are asked a few more questions to gauge their attachment to the labor market,
including if they want a job, and whether they have done any search since they lost their job.
In Table 1, we distinguish among four NILF states: those who report wanting a job but are
not searching (NILF, Want Job, No Search), those who report wanting a job and are passively
searching or have searched (actively or passively) at some point since losing their job (NILF, Want
Job, Search), those who do not want a job (NILF, Don't Want Job), and those who report being
retired or disabled.
       These more detailed classifications inform us about how attached respondents are to their prior
  21
     See https://www.bls.gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-april-2020.pdf.
  22
     Many of those on temporary layoff have missing values for search activity. We categorize these as not searching.
  23
     Active search is defined as activities that could directly lead to a job offer. It includes contacting employers or
others for leads on jobs. Passive search includes activities that by themselves could not give rise to a job offer - such
as looking at job ads.

Note: Panels display the distribution of individuals who were employed in February or March and subsequently
non-employed in April of the relevant years. Hire rates are the share that are re-employed in May or June, and
inferred recall rates are the share of hires who returned to the same major industry. Estimates are weighted using
sampling weights from the respondent's fourth month in the survey. Employed Absent are people who report being
employed but absent from work for unspecified reasons and unpaid. Temp, No Search report being on temporary
layoff and not actively searching for work. Temp, Search report being on temporary layoff and actively searching for
work. Unemp. Search are all other unemployed. NILF categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive of those not
in the labor force.




                                                        19
employers. As mentioned, the Employed Absent have the highest hire rate and inferred recall rate.
Close behind are Temp, No Search, who represent 43% of 2020 April separators ­ an order of
magnitude more than during normal times. These temporarily laid off and not searching have the
second highest hire rate at 48%, and the vast majority of hires (84%) return to the same industry.
The next group, Temp, Search, is comprised of individuals who are searching for a new employer
despite reporting being on temporary layoff. These individuals are a small share of the April
separators (4% in 2020), and are less than 10% of the the total stock of individuals on temporary
layoff. This group has relatively high hiring rates and recall rates, but both are notably smaller
than the rates for those on temporary layoff who are not searching. This suggests that individuals
who are searching while on temporary layoff are somewhat less attached to their previous employer
compared to those who are not searching.
   Next, Unemp. Search were a surprisingly small part of the story of April separators, comprising
just 4.5%, compared to 15.6% in previous years. This group also had a much lower hire rate by
June at roughly a third. Conditional on finding a job, 60% of matches were to the same industry,
somewhat elevated compared to their rate of 50% in normal times. The inferred recall rate of this
group in normal times provides something of a benchmark for the likelihood that a worker with
limited ties to their previous employer returns to the same industry. The fact that the previous
groups discussed all have higher inferred recall rates suggests they are indeed more connected to
their last employer.
   Among the NILF, the share of those who report wanting a job but not searching is elevated
by a couple percentage points in 2020. In early April, new COVID cases had reached their first
peak, and almost all U.S. states were under strict stay-at-home orders, as was Canada and much
of Europe. Fears of the pandemic and the global halting of economic activity may have deterred
April separators from searching for work, and this could explain why we see only a small fraction
in Unemp. Search and a much larger fraction in NILF, Want Job, No Search. This latter group
had a fairly low hire rate ­ 31% had been hired by June. However, conditional on being hired, 82%
were an inferred recall, which is nearly as high as those on temporary layoff who are not searching.
   Finally, the remaining NILF groups collectively have much lower representation than in normal
times, roughly one-quarter, compared to two-thirds. These groups exhibit little connection to the
labor market in that they are much less likely to be reemployed by June.
   There are several more insights to be gleaned from Table 1. First, across almost all categories
(except retired/disabled), the hiring rate by June 2020 was lower than in the pre-pandemic period.
For some groups, the reduced hiring rate was dramatic: for those on temporary layoff but not
searching, hiring rates fell from 66% to 48%, while for searching unemployed, rates fell from 42%
to 34%. Second, almost across the board the inferred recall rates in May were larger than in the
pre-pandemic period. Hence, most hiring occurring in May and June 2020 was not reallocating
individuals to different industries. This trend could be due to either higher levels of recall, or lower
levels of market search activity, preventing individuals from finding non-recall jobs.

4.2     FKLW Taxonomy
We now introduce the FKLW Taxonomy, which simplifies the classification scheme discussed in the
previous section and can be constructed using the cross-sectional data from the CPS, i.e. data that
does not include whether the respondent was employed previously nor whether there will be an
inferred recall. In particular, we define four groups:

  1. Employment. This group includes all currently employed except those who declare themselves
       to be absent for an unspecified reason and say that they are not being paid.

  2. Waiting Room. This group includes:

      - Employed, Absent: those absent from work for other reasons and not paid.

      - Temp. No Search: those on temporary layoff who are not actively searching.

  3. Open Market. This group includes:

      - Temp, Search: those on temporary layoff who are actively searching.

      - Unemp. Search: The traditional, searching unemployed.

  4. NILF: This group collects all not-in-the-labor-force categories.

   In forming our taxonomy, we relied heavily on respondents' self-reports for whether they said
they were actively searching, in addition to the detailed CPS labor force status calculation. How-
ever, the analysis in the previous subsection was crucial since search activity may have been severely
restricted in the early days of the pandemic. In the previous subsection, we showed that those who
are actively searching had lower hire and inferred recall rates than those who reported that they
still maintained a tie with their previous employer and were not searching.
   Two groups pose ambiguity for us: those temporarily laid off and searching (Temp, Search)
and those who are not in the labor force but report wanting a job and not searching (NILF, Want
Job, No Search). These groups are over-represented among April 2020 separatorsrelative to normal
times. Their hire and inferred recall rates in 2020 fall between the two extremes of Temp, No search
and Unemp. Search. Thus, arguably these two groups could belong in either category. For Temp,
Search, we put them in the Open Market, following the word of the respondents themselves. We
believe this is a conservative choice since the fewer groups we exclude from the Open Market, the
more similar our story will look compared to the headline numbers.
   The NILF, Want Job, No Search are more difficult because the statistics in Table 1 rely on our
restriction that all observations were employed before the pandemic. However, after June 2020, we
cannot consistently observe pre-pandemic employment for CPS respondents. This fact is especially
problematic for NILF categories, because these groups are typically dominated by respondents who
have little labor force attachment. For instance, in April 2020, only half of those categorized as
NILF, Want Job, No Search were employed in February or March. Moving forward, once we lose

                                                  21
the pre-pandemic link, we will not be able to discern the pandemic job losers from the marginally
attached who are typically found in that category. To be consistent, we therefore place this group
among those NILF, i.e., neither employed, nor waiting nor searching.24
       The FKLW Taxonomy tells us at a given moment in time how many searching unemployed there
are (i.e., the Open Market). As highlighted in our model, measuring market tightness accurately is
crucial for understanding the relative roles of worker search effort and profitability in driving job
creation. In addition, the taxonomy highlights a reserve of potential job seekers. Someone waiting
to be recalled may learn that their job is not returning and move to the open market; someone who
is neither waiting nor searching because they would not want to leave home for work during a virus
outbreak may decide to begin searching once the virus is contained. With substantial movement
in either of these directions, the Open Market fills and the nature of the recovery would change.
       Table 2 shows the size of these four groups by population share for each month in 2020. The
numbers in this table very clearly document how much the crisis has been dominated by movements
in and out of the Waiting Room. Between February and April, the share employed declined by 11
percentage points. The decline was accounted for by an 8 percentage point increase in the Waiting
Room over the same time period, and a 3 percentage point increase in the share of the population
in NILF. The Open Market, by contrast, did not increase markedly.
       The second phase of the downturn then saw substantial movements back into employment
(+8 percentage points by November) and movements out of the Waiting Room (-7.5 percentage
points). However, this second period is also characterized by an increase in the Open Market. It
grew steadily through July 2020, and has shown little movement since then. Even in November,
the share of the population searching on the open market was 1.2 percentage points higher than in
February.
       Figure 5 shows the unemployment rates for those in the Waiting Room (blue line) and Open
Market (maroon line) going back to 1994. This figure underscores a key point: the rise of individ-
uals waiting to rejoin their former workplace is the defining event of the first half of 2020. The
unemployment rate using only those in the Waiting Room rises to historically unprecedented lev-
els, and entirely accounts for the rise in the headline unemployment rate. The steep surge reverts
quickly, but levels have remained unusually high through fall, 2020. The figure also shows the
Open Market increasing over the same time period, such that by July 2020, the unemployment
rate for the Open Market exceeded that of the Waiting Room. The rate of change in Open Market
unemployment might seem slow relative to the movements in and out of the Waiting Room. They
are however large and rapid when put into historical perspective. For instance, during the Great
Recession it took 10 months for Open Market unemployment to rise by the same amount that we
observed in the first 5 months of the COVID Recession.
       Thus, while the first three months (April through June) of the COVID Recession were dominated
  24
    The NILF, Want Job, Search did not have increased representation among the non-employed in April 2020, com-
pared to previous years. They also had the lowest hire rate and lowest inferred recall rate in the table. Furthermore,
using the broader sample, only a third in this category were pandemic job losers. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
classify the group as a whole as NILF.

Notes: Population (non-institutionalized age 16+) shares from Current Population Survey 2020 data, using sampling
weights. Columns sum to 1. Employed are those currently employed, excluding those absent from work for other
reasons and unpaid. The Waiting Room includes those employed but absent for other reasons and unpaid, as well as
those temporarily laid off and not searching. The Open Market includes those temporarily laid off and searching, as
well as the remaining unemployed. Neither working, waiting, nor searching includes all those not in the labor force.
Categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive of the non-institutionalized age 16+ population.




by the behavior of the Waiting Room, by July the Open Market has become poised to be the
predominant feature of unemployment in the coming months.

Notes: Using Current Population Survey data from 1994-August 2020, we plot the fraction of the labor force (unem-
ployed + employed) in the Waiting Room (blue line; those employed but absent for other reasons and unpaid, as well
as those temporarily laid off and not searching) and the Open Market (red line; those temporarily laid off and search-
ing, as well as the remaining unemployed). Categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive of the unemployed,
non-institutionalized age 16+ population. NBER-dated recession bars indicated with gray shading.



    Table 3 shows the monthly transition matrix the FLKW labor force states, averaged over April
through November. The diagonals reveal that the most likely outcome is to remain in the same
status the following month. However, the Waiting Room and Open Market are quite a bit less stable,
with 39% and 52% remaining in the same category in the next month, respectively, compared to
over 90% for the employed or NILF.
    Nearly 40% of the Waiting Room becomes reemployed in the subsequent month. A smaller
fraction of the Open Market, 21%, become reemployed in a given month.
    Figure 6 provides more detail on these transitions, depicting the flows in and out of the Waiting
Room and the Open Market for each month of 2020. In particular, the top panel of Figure 6 depicts
the flows into the Waiting Room (left) or Open Market (right) as shares of the overall population
16 and older by status in the prior month. In these figures, the height of all groups combined
corresponds to the fraction of individuals in the Waiting Room or Open Market. Each colored
band shows the share of the population flowing into the Waiting Room or Open Market by status
in the prior month.
    These graphs reveal that the composition of the waiting room by origin is changing. In April
2020, the vast majority of the Waiting Room comes directly from employment. Post-April 2020,

 Note: Each row sums to 100, representing the share of individuals moving from a state indicated by the row to a
state indicated by the column in the next month. Shares are constructed using CPS sampling weights from the second
month of the match. We take unweighted averages of the following month transition pairs: April-May, May-June,
June-July, July-August, August-September, September-October, and October-November 2020.



the inflows from employment (blue area) are now a much smaller fraction, though still elevated
relative to normal times. Instead, individuals persisting in the Waiting Room (red area) makes up
the highest fraction.
    For the Open Market, we observe that the total stock increased between March and June 2020,
and has held steady ever since. Further, the share of individuals who were already in the Open
Market last month increased (green area). Even in the peak layoff month of April, movements
from employment to the Open Market exhibited only a small bump. There have also been small
increases in inflows from the Waiting Room and NILF (orange). We continue to monitor these
movements since these may be a likely path for the economy to move into a more typical recession
with a large number of individuals searching on the Open Market.
    We next turn to moves out of these two groups (bottom panel of Figure 6). The overall height
of the sections is again the stock of the Waiting Room or Open Market in the given month. The
subcomponents give the destination in the subsequent month, again as a fraction of the population.
We highlight a key point: the outflow from the Open Market to employment (bottom right, blue
area) remains small and has not increased appreciably in recent months. In contrast, we saw
elevated movements out of the Waiting Room into employment between April and June, though
these transitions have slowed substantially since then. These patterns led the stock of workers in
the Open Market to steadily increase and overtake the stock of workers in the Waiting Room.
    These results illustrate how the U.S. labor market was able to recover a substantial share of
lost jobs through June, with much of the stock of individuals in the Waiting Room returning to
employment. However, the stock of individuals in the Open Market has held steady , and since
July has become the largest component of unemployment. Any further recovery will therefore rest
on how well the labor market can move these searching unemployed individuals into new jobs, a
topic we turn to in the next section.

Notes: Figures depict flows into the waiting room and open market (top panel) and flows out of each group (bottom
panel) as shares of the population age 16+. The height of all groups combined corresponds to the fraction of the
population in the waiting room (left) or open market (right). Each colored band shows the share of the population
flowing from or to the indicated group. For example, the top left panel shows that in April, 7.9% of the population
were in the Waiting Room, with 6.8%, 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.4% of the population having been in employment, the
waiting groom, the open market, and NILF, respectively, in March. As another example, the bottom left panel
shows that, again, in April 7.9% of the population was in the Waiting Room and 2.8%, 3.7%, 0.5%, and 1% of the
population moved to employment, (stayed in) the waiting room, the open market, and NILF, respectively, in May.



5                   An Interim Report on the COVID Labor Market
Our model in Section 3 highlighted the importance of market tightness for understanding factors
impacting job creation. Changes in worker search effort become increasingly important the tighter
are markets. In Section 4.2 we developed our taxonomy of measuring Open Market unemployment,
which is key for understanding market tightness during a time when an unprecedented number of
unemployed are waiting to be recalled and therefore not looking to match to a new employer.
            Armed with these building blocks, we now evaluate the COVID labor market 9 months into the
crisis. We first measure effective labor market tightness using our taxonomy. We next explore the
role of mismatch early in the recovery. Finally, we discuss how to interpret the patterns uncovered


                                                                               26
in these sections through the lens of our model.

5.1      Labor Market Tightness
To understand tightness, we rely on our taxonomy of the non-employed to separate out those active
in the Open Market from those waiting to be recalled to their former jobs and those neither waiting
nor searching. We measure vacancies using data from Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) because
it is available in real-time and with a high degree of detail. The detail will be useful when we
consider how tightness varies across different types of jobs (e.g., high-skilled versus low-skilled),
so for consistency, we use their data throughout the rest of this section. BGT give the number
of new vacancies posted in a given day. We convert BGT flows to a monthly stock with a law of
motion that assumes a fixed daily job filling rate of 5%.25 Where possible, we compare the BGT
vacancy series to the time-series of job openings from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey
(JOLTS), a nationally representative random sample of establishments surveyed by the BLS each
month. JOLTS data are available only at a longer time lag and with less detail, compared to
BGT. Reassuringly, results are broadly similar with the JOLTS measure, though we highlight some
differences throughout.
       Figure 7 shows two different measures of market tightness. Both use the stock of vacancies
in each month from BGT, but they differ in their measure of job seekers. The blue line uses
the headline number of unemployed, while the maroon line uses only unemployment in the Open
Market. Both measures show substantial declines in tightness beginning in April 2020. However,
these declines come off of a very tight labor market in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, so that
markets are relatively less slack than historical comparisons would suggest. For instance, the first
measure ­ based on the headline unemployment rate ­ placed us at tightness levels observed during
the early recovery from the Great Recession, with a modest partial recovery since April. This drop
reflects a weakening in the labor market, but interestingly the employment shock in April 2020 was
substantially larger than that experienced during the Great Recession. Based on the second measure
­ only including Open Market searchers in the denominator ­ effective labor market tightness fell to
levels observed in 2016 and 2017. While that still reflects a 50% drop, those years were universally
acknowledged as tight labor markets.26
       Next, we construct the Beveridge Curve, which traces out the movements of job openings and
job search over time and typically receives a great deal of attention during recessions. The left
panel of figure 8 plots the Beveridge curve using headline unemployment, while the right panel uses
  25
      Specifically, we begin in January 2010, setting the stock equal to the flow in the first week of the year. For
subsequent weeks, we take the integral of all preceding new posts that survive to the given week by assuming that
5% of posts disappear each day. To obtain the monthly vacancy stock, we take the value of our stock measure in the
first full week of the month, which most closely aligns with the CPS reference week. Results are similar when we
instead use the raw flow data.
   26
      Appendix figure A.3 shows analogous tightness measures using JOLTS vacancies instead of BGT, and provides
a longer term perspective going back to 2000. Results are quite similar both in terms of the qualitative patterns and
the magnitude drop in tightness in spring 2020.

Notes: We plot the ratio of vacancies to unemployed in each month from 2011 onwards. Vacancies are measured
using Burning Glass Technologies (BGT), converting weekly flows to monthly stocks assuming a 5% daily job filling
rate. The "Overall" series divides vacancies by all unemployment; the "Open Market" series divides vacancies by
Open Market unemployment, excluding those on temporary layoff and not searching.

only the Open Market. Both use the stock of BGT vacancies in each month.27 In these graphs,
market tightness ­ the focus of our analysis ­ is the angle from the origin to the Beveridge curve.
       The panel in the left displays very unusual movements in the number of vacancies and unem-
ployed. During recessions, we typically observe movements towards the bottom right quadrant as
unemployment increases and vacancies decline. Thus, over the recession tightness typically declines
rapidly. During the COVID recession, the unemployment rate rose to unprecedented levels. At the
same time, vacancies fell, but not nearly by the same magnitude. Over the last few months, both
vacancies and headline unemployed made partial recoveries.
       The right panel tells a very different story of the early COVID crisis. When we remove those
currently in the Waiting Room from unemployment, we find movements away from the Beveridge
curve that are much less pronounced, adding only modest slack in the labor market, but also no
improvements during the summer and early fall. Appendix Figure A.4 shows analogous Beveridge
Curves using JOLTS vacancies. Results are qualitatively quite similar, though JOLTS shows a bit
more recovery in vacancies in recent months.28
       In summary, figures 7 and 8 indicated a severe erosion in match efficiency followed by a partial
recovery when headline unemployment is used. Using only the Open Market, we see a much smaller
collapse. Although job postings collapsed in mid April, falling by 40%, the nadir was relatively
short lived, after which postings stabilized at a reduction of about 20%. At the same time, Open
Market unemployment has so far only moderately increased. Therefore, job seekers likely face an
easier time finding a job compared with the depth of the Great Recession. Indeed, in Appendix
Figure A.5 we show that hiring rates are above Great Recession levels for all groups except those
in the Waiting Room. Therefore, viewed through the FKLW Taxonomy, markets are not as slack
as one might expect.

5.2      Mismatch
So far, we have measured tightness without considering mismatch between the characteristics of
job seekers and vacancies. Such mismatch would be a potential source of error in our measure of
aggregate tightness. In particular, it is possible that the aggregate numbers indicate tightness while
substantial movement across markets would be necessary to clear the full population of job seekers.
This would be the case if vacancies require substantially different qualifications than those searching
for work. Above, we showed that employment losses were concentrated in somewhat different
markets than losses in job vacancies, suggesting that mismatch may be present. Heterogeneity
  27
     The standard way of constructing the Beveridge Curve relates the job opening rate (vacancies divided by employ-
ment) to the unemployment rate (unemployment divided by employment plus unemployment). We instead choose to
show vacancies and counts of job seekers relative to the population 16 and older because of the large movements in
employment over this time period.
  28
     As of October, 2020 (the most recent measure available at the time of this writing), JOLTS vacancies had fully
recovered to their pre-pandemic levels, while BGT data hovered at 20% below pre-pandemic levels from July onwards
(currently through November). The BGT pattern is reflected in other sources of online job postings (e.g., see for
Indeed Data: https://www.hiringlab.org/2020/09/17/job-postings-through-sept-11/) It is too early to tell whether
the recent deviation between the two datasets is random variation or an enduring trend.

across job seekers and vacancies is of interest in its own right since recessions are generally harder
on lower-skilled workers (Hoynes et al. [2012]) and, while the Great Recession saw a great deal
of restructuring that shifted demand towards higher skilled workers (Hershbein and Kahn [2018]),
ultimately mismatch played a small role in the overall level of unemployment (S
                                                                              ¸ ahin et al. [2014]).
       We now turn to investigate the extent to which such mismatch is currently present in the labor
market. We rely on the richness of the BGT data to explore heterogeneity in the job postings by
education requirements and, later, by occupation and industry.29 While workers can potentially
search across markets, this kind of reallocation is likely slower than when most matches can take
place within a market. Our analysis provides intuition for how much reallocation is needed for
markets to clear.
       We first separate job postings into those that require a college degree or more from those with no
  29

    ¸ ahin et al. [2014] used the Help Wanted Online series collected by the Conference Board to measure vacancies
in different submarkets during the Great Recession.


                                                                                    30
such requirement. Education requirements are strongly correlated with work-from-home capability,
though the former can vary at the ad-level, while we can only infer the latter based on occupation.
We divide the unemployed into those with and without a college degree, and then measure tightness
as job postings per job seeker for each group.30 In the top panel of Figure 9, the red lines show
tightness for the college labor market, while the blue line shows tightness for non-college. We
restrict our attention to Open Market unemployment, though Appendix Figure A.6 shows that
results are very similar using overall unemployment.
       Here we see that, pre-pandemic, labor markets were substantially tighter for college educated
workers; there were many more job openings for each college educated job seeker. During the
pandemic, tightness fell for both college and non-college markets. However, it fell substantially
more for the college market so that tightness measures converged across the two education groups.
       The relatively larger decline in tightness for the college market is driven by movements in the
numerator and the denominator. The second panel of Figure 9, shows that the share of vacancies
requiring a college degree has fallen and the college share among Open Market unemployment has
risen. Neither pattern can be explained by typical seasonal movements.
       We next explore, using the rich set of descriptors in the BGT data, whether the recent decline in
college requirements can be accounted for by the distribution of postings across industry, occupa-
tion, and firm. We regress the likelihood that a job advertisement requires a college degree or more
on other characteristics of the ad. Results are summarized in table 4. We report coefficients on two
indicators of interest: an "early COVID" dummy, equalling 1 if the ad was posted in March-May of
2020 and a "COVID recovery" dummy equalling 1 if the ad was posted in June through November.
We include data for the years 2015-2020. Standard errors are clustered by year-month, since this
is the underlying variation of interest.
       The first column in the top panel presents the baseline regression of whether or not the ad has
a college (or more) requirement on the two COVID indicators and no other controls. Early in the
COVID crisis, ads were 2.8 percentage points less like to have a college requirement, relative to the
pre-COVID era, and by the June-November period, ads were 6 percentage points less likely. This
represents a 20% decline from the pre-COVID era, when about a third of ads required a college
degree. Column 2 ads month fixed effects in order to control for seasonality and a year-month time
trend to smoothly control for any long-run trends in the data. These controls have little impact on
the key coefficients.
       Column 3 shows that the bulk of the decline remains when we control for industry composi-
tion (across major industry groups): the COVID recovery coefficient declines by about a quarter.
However, occupation fixed effects ­ shown in columns (4) and (5) with an increasing degree of
disaggregation ­ account for about half of the measured decline in requirements during the COVID
recovery.31
  30
     Hershbein and Kahn [2018] show a strong correlation between education requirements in BGT and average edu-
cation levels of employed workers at the MSA and occupation level, suggesting education requirements meaningfully
reflect desired worker characteristics.

Notes: The top panel shows market tightness (the stock of BGT vacancy postings divided by unemployment),
separately for college and non-college. Vacancies are defined as college if they require a college degree or higher.
Unemployment from the CPS is based on whether the respondent has a college degree or higher and is shown for the
open market only. The bottom panel gives the share of the BGT vacancy stock in the month that requires college
or more and the share of unemployed with college or more. See Appendix Figure A.6 for a comparison to overall
unemployment by education.




                                                                 32
    The second panel explores firm-level variation in education requirements. This panel restricts
to ads where the hiring firm can be identified and to firms that have sufficient postings before
and after COVID.32 We find the same patterns for the share of ads requiring college degrees as
in the unrestricted sample in the top-panel: a 6-7 percentage point decline during June-November
relative to the pre-period that is largely explained by a change in the occupation distribution of
posted ads. Further, once we control for industry, variation within firms accounts for about a third
of the remaining effect (comparing columns 2 and 3 of the bottom panel).
    In summary, from Table 4 we learn four key facts: First, education requirements have declined
by about 20% during the COVID recovery and this effect is not driven by seasonality or preexisting
trends. Second, about a quarter of that decline is accounted for changes in the mix of sectors
hiring ­ in Summer 2020, ads shifted towards industries that typically require less education such
as construction and essential retail. Third, after controlling for sectoral shifts, the remaining effect
occurs primarily within firm, where less than a third is due to a shift in ads towards firms that
always tended to require less education. Fourth, changes in the occupation distribution of ads can
account for the bulk of the decline in education requirements.
    Why has labor demand moved towards occupations that favor less educated workers? If any-
thing, we might have expected the opposite since remote work favors more educated occupations
[Dingel and Neiman, 2020]. Our data show that vacancies have shifted away from professional oc-
cupations in recent months and towards blue collar occupations such as construction, maintenance,
production, and transportation-related jobs. Figure 10 shows what these trends imply for tightness
in four markets defined by aggregated occupation groupings.33
    There are three key patterns in Figure 10. First, there are clear and persistent level differences in
tightness between occupational groups. The lower-skill occupations show persistently slacker labor
markets, with similar levels between blue collar and Food Prep/Retail/Personal Care, somewhat
tighter markets for Sales/Admin/Social Services and substantially tighter markets for Professional
occupations. Second, all groups demonstrate an increasing trend in tightness in recent years, along
with the economy as a whole; however, tightness increased by more for Professional occupations.
Third, during the COVID recession, tightness fell for all groups, but the drop was especially severe
for Professional occupations. This led to a convergence in tightness across occupation groups.34
occupation controls. Controlling instead for 6-digit occupation-by-sector absorbs almost all the variation in the data
but leaves the key coefficients of interest unchanged relative to columns 5 and 6.
  32
     Specifically, the sample restricts to the 74% of ads that can identify the firm posting the ad; of those, we further
restrict to the 78% of ads where the firm posts at least 10 ads during the COVID recovery and at least 50 ads
pre-COVID.
  33
     Professional includes highly educated white collar occupations (SOC 11-19, 23, 27, 29), Sales/Admin/Social Ser-
vices is roughly middle-skill white collar occupations (21, 25, 31, 41 (excluding 413), 43), Food Prep/Retail/Personal
Care includes lower-skill service occupations (35-39, 413), and Blue Collar includes construction, production, and
related occupations (33, 45-53). Tightness is defined using the stock of individuals in the Open Market who report
the particular occupation group as their previous occupation.
  34
     Appendix Figure A.7 shows the same pattern across industries. We prefer the analyses that define markets by
education or broad occupation because these more fixed characteristics, and less distorted by workers directing their
search towards vacancies. However, using industries we can compare and validate BGT tightness measures with
JOLTS data. Reassuringly, patterns are similar across datasets, and here we also find that tightness fell by most in
industries that had tighter pre-pandemic markets. In addition, in Appendix Figure A.9, we show that hiring rates fell

Notes: This table summarizes regressions estimated on Burning Glass vacancy data. The dependent variable is an
indicator for whether the ad has a college or more requirement. Regressions are estimated on data from 2015 to
November, 2020. Early COVID is an indicator equalling 1 if the ad was posted in March through May 2020. COVID
recovery is an indicator equalling 1 if the ad was posted in June through November. Standard errors are clustered
at the year-month level. Date controls include month fixed effects and a year-month time trend. In the top panel,
ads are restricted to have non-missing occupation and industry. In the bottom panel, observations are restricted to
ads posted by firms that have enough variation to identify firm fixed effects (our criteria is firms that post at least
10 ads in the COVID recovery and at least 50 ads before COVID).

Notes: Tightness is defined as the number of BGT postings in a given occupation divided by the number of unemployed
in the Open Market (from the CPS) who report most recently working in the given occupation. We show tightness
for four broad occupation groups. Professional includes highly educated white collar occupations (SOC 11-19, 23,
27, 29), Sales/Admin/Social Services is roughly middle-skill white collar occupations (21, 25, 31, 41 (excluding 413),
43), Food Prep/Retail/Personal Care includes lower-skill service occupations (35-39, 413), and Blue Collar includes
construction, production, and related occupations (33, 45-53).



    That tightness fell by more in professional occupations compared to the rest is somewhat sur-
prising, but actually is consistent with patterns observed during the Great Recession. Appendix
Figure A.8 uses the Help Wanted Online Index (a subset of the BGT data available over a longer
time series) and shows a very similar cyclical pattern in 2007-2009 in tightness across occupation
groups.
    The decline in professionals' tightness compresses distribution, which implies lower mismatch.
To quantify these changes in mismatch, we use the 2-digit SOC level disaggregation to construct
the hiring index of mismatch, Mh from S
                                      ¸ ahin et al. [2014]. This measure gives the number of
hires lost due to mismatch relative to a counter-factual in which they were optimally allocated, i.e.,

to the dispersion in tightness weighted by the occupation's fraction of                                                           searchers.35

ure 10, we decompose this index into the mismatch between professional occupations and everything
else and the residual, within-group mismatch.36
       In Figure 11, we plot the hiring index in gray and the amount of mismatch driven by professional
occupations in blue. In the COVID recession, overall mismatch declined by about a third, with
a small reversion in recent months. Further, this trend was largely driven by a decline due to
professional occupations. As tightness in professional occupations has declined towards the rest
it has taken overall mismatch down with it ­ though the overall effect on mismatch was small
(a few percentage points) because professional occupations represent a relatively small fraction of
unemployment.37 The mismatch series time series is quite noisy so a drop of this magnitude is not
unusual. However, there is certainly no evidence of an increase in mismatch as many have feared.

Notes: We plot mismatch across 2-digit SOC occupation groups using BGT job postings and the number of Open
Market unemployed who previously worked in the occupation. The hiring index from S    ¸ ahin et al. [2014] is the fraction
of hires lost due to mismatch relative to a counter-factual in which jobs were optimally allocated. We split this index
into mismatch due to professional occupations and the rest.



       Given that we are still in the middle of the COVID recession, it may be too early to extrapolate
  36
       Formally, we partition the data into two groups of occupations, Op and O-p and Vp =       oOp   Vo , Sp =   oOp   So ,
                                                                          1- 1-      1-    1-

V-p = oO-p Vo , S-p = oO-p So and then compute                    Mh
                                                                  =1-
                                                                   p           V 1- S 
                                                                                              .
  37
     Interestingly, even though the Great Recession saw a similar drop in professional occupation tightness, the trend in
mismatch was different. S  ¸ ahin et al. [2014] show that mismatch increased during the recession itself, before decreasing
during the recovery. In that case, physical occupations like construction and manufacturing drove mismatch upwards,
counteracting the effect coming from professional occupations (a relatively small fraction of job seekers).


                                                              36
from these preliminary patterns. However, so far, they hint at a potential reallocation from high-
to low-skilled positions. A relative slackening of the college labor market will likely have important
implications for low-skilled workers as well. College graduates can likely search across markets and
obtain lower skilled jobs if they choose. We should continue to monitor whether we increasingly
observe college graduates downgrade into lower skilled positions. Such a move might displace lower-
skilled workers from those job opportunities and thus merit careful observation also from an equity
point of view.

5.3    Discussion
Recall, our model highlighted the importance of tightness for understanding the relative roles of
worker search effort and profitability in generating job creation. When markets are tight, we believe
increased search effort will have a larger impact on profitability than when markets are slack. Our
model has implications for policy making over the cycle, since different sets of policies will affect
search effort as opposed to the profitability of new hires. For instance, unemployment benefits
for employees might affect the incentives to search for work directly. By contrast, tax credits for
hiring or stimulus payments intended to boost product demand are typically intended to raise the
profitability of hires.38
    In our empirical work, we have shown that markets are slacker than they were at the beginning
of the year, regardless of the measure used. Viewed through the lens of our model, this means that
overall, search effort has become less important for job creation. However, based on our effective
tightness measure, the labor market has reverted back to tightness levels observed in 2016, which
was widely considered to be a tight labor market. Furthermore, from our heterogeneity analysis
we conclude that there is no hidden slackness due to mismatch because, if anything, mismatch has
declined during the COVID crisis. Therefore, the relative tightness of the labor market at present
implies that vacancy creation could be more sensitive to the amount of search effort in the labor
market, compared to other recessionary periods. That is, viewed through the lens of our model,
the negative labor supply shock generated by the COVID recession could be having a meaningful
impact on job creation.
    However, it is important to keep in mind how this picture could change in the near future.
In November, compared to January, the Open Market contains an excess of 2.8 million workers.
This figure is small compared to that observed in the Great Recession and the size of the COVID
employment decline. This is why, at present, our analysis shows that markets are fairly tight.
However, there remains a large reserve of potential job seekers in the other categories. November
saw 1.1 million extra workers in the Waiting Room and 4.4 million in NILF ­ many of whom are
likely discouraged workers.39 The longer temporary layoffs last, the more likely they are to become
permanent; discouraged workers may return to the labor force when the virus gets under control. If
  38
     Although few policies will map neatly into supply or demand side factors alone, this framing can help theoretically
draw out distinctions between policies.
  39
     These calculations are obtained using population weights in the CPS.



                                                          37
both groups move into the Open Market (with no change in vacancies), tightness would fall by 40%
(from 0.26 to 0.16) to levels seen in 2013. It will be important to monitor how these groups evolve
moving forward. Hearkening back to our model, profitability will play an increasingly important
role as this extra slack gets drawn into the Open Market.


6    Conclusion
There are two overlapping processes at play in the pandemic economy. First, there was a massive
movement from employment to temporary layoffs in spring 2020. Since then, a plurality of new hires
reflect recalls. Second, there has been a more traditional recession pattern, where hiring fell and the
stock of searching unemployed (the Open Market) has risen. These groups of unemployed workers
are important to separate, because their relative magnitudes affect the ability and willingness of
workers to find new jobs and firms to find new workers--among many other fundamental aspects of
our understanding of a headline unemployment rate. The more scarce are traditionally unemployed
workers, i.e., those who are searching on the open market, the lower is the expected yield on a
vacancy, which can exacerbate the decline in postings and job creation. It also determines the
labor market's response to policies, since that can depend on the ease of recruiting.
    Although the recovery will hinge on individuals moving into new employment matches, it is
important to emphasize that there are many reasons why individuals may be sitting out of the
labor market. As the COVID pandemic continues, many individuals who were employed before the
pandemic are unable to safely return to employment. Further, with many schools operating only
remotely, parents face increased difficulty in supplying their labor. As we have demonstrated in the
model, this unusual decline in search activity specific to the COVID recession will have a smaller
impact on vacancy creation now than during times of economic expansion. Given the sharp drop in
market tightness observed using both the headline unemployment rate and our effective tightness
measure, our model implies that policies devoted to propping up labor demand will be fruitful.
    Furthermore, since June, we have seen both a middling recovery, and now two periods of
increased COVID infection rates. We therefore reinforce our previous conclusion [Forsythe et al.,
2020] that the number one policy response to boost the economy is to get the virus under control.
This would serve to boost labor demand, increase worker search effort, and resolve uncertainty.

Data Appendix
We draw on data from a variety of sources. Here we describe the main data sources we use for this
analysis.

Burning Glass Job Postings
We use real time job postings data collected by Burning Glass Technologies (BGT). BGT is a
private employment analytics company, which scrapes and processes the full text of online job
postings from over 40,000 online job boards and company websites, producing a near-universe of
online job postings since 2007. Because the data were new in 2007 and because there unfortunately
exist no data for 2008 and 2009, we focus our analysis to 2010 onward. The data used in this paper
use posting information from 2010 through November, 2020.
   Any information that is included in the job posting is available, including the job title, firm
name, and any requirements such as a college degree. BGT assigns industry and occupation to ads
that include firm name and job title, respectively.
   The ad-level data were first used in Hershbein and Kahn [2018] to understand the change in skill
requirements before and after the Great Recession; after the Great Recession, harder-hit MSAs saw
a relatively greater and persistent increase in cognitive and computer skill requirements. Combined
with firm-level data on capital inputs they argued the evidence was most consistent with firm-level
restructuring precipitated by the Great Recession towards labor-replacing technologies and away
from routine workers.
   Hershbein and Kahn [2018] provide a number of data validation exercises. They show the
data overrepresent higher skilled occupations but the representativeness of the data did not change
rapidly during their time period. Naturally, BGT contains only a subset of job openings. Reassur-
ingly, as we show, our results are very similar using a different sample of vacancies, collected by
the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.

BLS Data
We draw on three data sources collected Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): the Current Employment
Statistics (CES), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover
Survey (JOLTS). We describe each in turn.
   The CES is a survey of about 145,000 establishments each month, that collects data on total
employment and payroll. Together with the CPS, data is collected each month for the week that
contained the 12th of the month. The CES is used to construct the official measures of the total
employment numbers. We report data from January 2020 through November 2020.
   The CPS provides the worker-level counterpart of to the CES, collecting a variety of data on
individual-level labor market outcomes from a sample of about 60,000 households each month. The
CPS is used to construct the official unemployment rate. In addition, the CPS uses a rotating
panel, whereby households are surveyed for four consecutive months, take an eight month break,


                                                 42
and are then surveyed again for four more months. In order to measure hiring and other mobility
patterns, we match individuals across survey months using longitudinal link variables and confirm
matches using sex, race, and age. Depending on the specification, we use data from as far back as
January 1994, through November 2020.
   The JOLTS is a survey of approximately 16,000 establishments each month, that collects data
on hires and separations over a month time frame, as well as job openings at the end of the month.
We use this data to corroborate our findings using BGT. We use data from as far back as December
2000, when the series was created, through October 2020.

Unemployment Insurance Data
We use non-seasonally adjusted data on initial unemployment insurance (UI) claims that is reported
by state agencies to the Department of Labor each week. These claims include all individuals
who apply for regular state programs. This is a measure of individuals who have applied for
benefits, but does not reflect whether they received benefits. We do not include claims for federal
programs, including the new programs created during the pandemic. We retrieve the data from
FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICNSA).

Google Trends
We use data from Google Trends on searches that include the word "job". Google Trends constructs
an index of relative search intensity that allows for tracking the relative search volume over time.
This data is available back to 2004, thus allows us to compare relative search volume during the
COVID recession compared with the Great Recession.
   There are several caveats to this data. First, search volume may increase both due to total
internet searches for the term, but also due to greater search engine penetration by Google. Second,
changes over time in whether individuals use internet search engines to search for employment may
lead to trends over time. Third, our keyword search "job" may capture searches that are not for
employment. Nonetheless, we think that the trends in search volume are illustrative for capturing
aggregate search beyond what is available in the CPS (which is is limited to search by unemployed
individuals).

Additional Figures and Tables
In Figure A.1 we show that employers also report the vast majority of the spike in layoffs were
temporary in nature. Here we use WARN Act filings from California, which requires employers
with over 75 employees to provide advanced notice of any mass layoff event. Among other reporting
requirements, the state of California requires employers to document whether the layoff is temporary
or permanent. Here we see that layoffs spiked dramatically in March and April, with over 80% of
the layoffs temporary. By May the level had fallen, and the ratio became more balanced, with less




                                                43
than half of layoffs temporary. Thus, the employer-side data is consistent with employee reports in
the CPS on their status as on temporary layoff or permanently separated.

Notes: The top panel shows market tightness (the stock of BGT vacancy postings divided by unemployment),
separately for college and non-college. Vacancies are defined as college if they require a college degree or higher.
Unemployment from the CPS is based on weather the respondent has a college degree or higher and is shown as
overall (solid line) or for the open market only (dashed line). The bottom panel gives the share of the BGT vacancy
stock in the month that requires college or more and the share of unemployed with college or more.
