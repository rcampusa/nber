                                              ABSTRACT

California’s per-capita electricity consumption is 50 percent lower than national per-capita consumption.
Mild climate, deindustrialization, and its demographics explain part of this differential. California
energy efficiency policy is often claimed to be another key factor. A challenge in judging this claim
is the heterogeneity of the real estate capital stock. Residential homes differ along a large number of
physical attributes. We access a proprietary dataset from a large hotel chain that allows us to evaluate
the environmental performance of comparable commercial real estate across the United States. Controlling
for climate conditions and geographic location, we document that California’s commercial real estate
stock is the most energy efficient at a point in time but this differential is quantitatively small. However,
over the years 2007 to 2013, California’s hotels achieved much greater energy efficiency progress
than hotels in other states.

I.      Introduction

        In 2010, California’s per-capita electricity consumption was 50 percent lower than

  U.S per-capita electricity consumption. 1 This large differential may be due to several

     different factors. California’s unique climate requires less winter heating and summer

     cooling to achieve a given level of comfort. California’s high land prices, pro-labor

     union stance and stringent environmental regulation have all played a role in reducing

     the count of manufacturing jobs located in the state (Becker and Henderson, 2000,

     Holmes, 1998).

        California is also well known for its leadership with respect to building codes and

     energy efficiency for new durables (Rosenfeld 1999). 2 Recent empirical work by

  Levinson (2014) challenges the conventional wisdom that California’s conservation

  policies are the primary explanation for the state’s relative environmental progress.

  He studies several residential and industrial data sets and concludes that other

  concurrent demographic and geographic trends are the main reasons explaining

  differential trends in per-capita energy consumption (Levinson 2014a). In a second

     empirical study, he rejects the hypothesis that homes constructed since California

     instituted its building energy codes use less electricity today than homes built before

     the codes came into effect (Levinson 2014b).

        Levinson’s research highlights the importance of conducting a standardized

     comparison. Does a given piece of real estate (such as a home or a commercial

     building) consume less electricity if this capital is located in California? The ideal

experiment would be to take buildings of the same vintage, size and purpose and

randomly assign them to different sides of the California state border. At such borders,

the real estate would be exposed to the same climate conditions and local market

circumstances but would face different state regulatory regimes and different

electricity prices.

    To approximate this experiment, we partner with a major global hotel chain and

access monthly electricity consumption of hundreds of its hotels located across the

United States and around the world. These hotels feature a common management

structure and have several common features that increase our confidence that we are

making valid standardized comparisons of energy consumption across space and time.

    Commercial real estate is an important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions as

the sector is a major electricity consumer, but the United States government has not

conducted a representative survey of such buildings since the 2003 CBECS. 3 This was

a small sample survey that included roughly 5,000 observations across different

sectors. Our hotel data set allows us to fill in data gaps to evaluate the energy

performance of the real estate sector, as it covers all of the major states and even some

foreign nations. We rank different states with respect to their standardized energy

efficiency – this offers a different test of the “California exceptionalism” hypothesis.

We document that California stands out as the most energy efficient state, in accord

with its “green” reputation, but its energy efficiency differential relative to the next

most efficient state (Ohio) is economically small.




3
 The Department of Energy is currently preparing to release the new 2012 wave of CBECS data (see
http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.cfm?view=microdata).

                                               2
      In a second set of results, we include hotel-fixed effects and exploit the within-

   hotel panel variation to test for trends in energy efficiency using energy consumption

   per occupied room as the key standardized metric of energy performance. Relative to

   hotels in other states, the results show that California’s hotels are making the greatest

   progress over time with respect to reducing energy consumption per occupied room.

      The results in this paper add to the literature on energy efficiency in the real estate

   sector. Building codes have been credited for significant energy reductions (see

   Aroonruengsawat and Auffhammer, 2011 and Jacobsen and Kotchen, 2013. For a

   dissenting view see Levinson, 2014b). These results focus on the residential building

   stock, where consumption is determined both by physical buildings characteristics, as

   well as heterogeneous occupants. Understanding the implications of energy policy on

   the performance of the commercial real estate sector is important, given the large

   environmental externality imposed by the sector, and the fact that there is a negative

   correlation between commercial building vintage and building energy consumption

   (Kahn et al., 2014).

      The rest of this paper is organized as follows: first, to explore the role that

   electricity prices and regulation play in determining a hotel’s monthly electricity

   consumption, we discuss the economic tradeoffs that individual hotels face at any

   point in time. We then introduce our data set and econometric approach. Section III

   reports our results and Section IV concludes.



II.   Hotel Electricity Demand




                                              3
    At any point in time, a hotel’s electricity consumption depends on how the

building was constructed, its size, occupancy, and the activities of those who work and

stay at the hotel. A hotel uses electricity for a variety of different purposes ranging

from lighting, to cooling, to powering the elevators. As formally modeled for the

residential sector by Reiss and White (2005), real estate owners demand electricity as

an input in a Beckerian production function where the final output is a set of basic

services such as comfort, lighting, safety, and entertainment (Michael and Becker,

1973).

    In producing comfort, hotel occupants will turn on the air conditioner on hot days.

They will take elevators to their room rather than walking up and down the stairs. The

cleaning staff will use vacuums to clean the rooms. The guests will use the lights and

will plug in durable devices such as televisions and computers to amuse themselves in

their room. In the day-to-day operations, the hotel will use electricity in common

spaces such as the swimming pool, gym, atrium, restaurant and the common areas. 4

All of these choices increase hotel electricity demand. These choices in turn depend on

past investments in durables, such as the types of windows installed, the roof type and

the air conditioning system’s efficiency.

    As a for-profit, a hotel has strong incentives to invest in durables that are more

energy efficient if their purchase price plus the expected present discounted value

(PDV) of the operating expenses is less than the total purchase cost plus the PDV of

operating the conventional durables. In the hotel business there are three parties


4
 Kahn et al. (2014) use data from a single electric utility for many different types of commercial
buildings. Using the CoStar data, they know which buildings are rated “A”, “B”, “C” based on quality.
Controlling for square footage, vintage and occupancy and other attributes, higher quality real estate
consumes more electricity. In the case of hotels, this is also likely to be the case.

                                                  4
involved: (1) the hotel asset owner, (2) the hotel management company, and (3) the

brand franchise. Large chain hotels normally own both the brand franchise and the

hotel management company. Their management contract with an asset owner is

typically signed for a period ranging from 30 to 60 years. The hotel management

company will receive revenue and pay expenses on behalf of the owner. The owner

will then receive the net profit after deducting a management fee (normally 5 percent

of the total revenue). Almost every hotel has an engineer at the premise. Larger hotels

may even have a team or department. The hotel operator, usually the hotel

management company, will make recommendations to the asset owner about the

capital expenditures that are needed for energy conservation

   In contrast to residential households who may face cost of actions (see Wolak

2011), hotel chains spend large amounts of money on operating costs and are

increasingly focused on reducing those costs. By consuming less water and electricity,

such hotels simultaneously reduce their outgoings and increase their hotel’s

sustainability performance. The amount of cost savings hinges on the price of

electricity in the hotel’s electric utility charges. In evaluating energy efficiency

investments, hotels trade off the costs of up front expenditures versus the benefits of

future savings in operating costs. It is relevant to contrast such profit maximizing

entities versus utility maximizing households in considering energy efficiency

investments. Homeowners are more likely to be inefficient because they do not have

the skills to be a sophisticated energy consumer. A household’s annual electricity bill

is too small for it to significantly invest in energy management skills (Hassett and

Metcalf, 1993, Howarth and Sanstad, 1995).



                                          5
          Commercial firms may also be less likely to suffer from behavioral biases that may

   otherwise lead to suboptimal investment in energy efficiency (Tietenberg, 2009).

   Unlike commercial electricity consumers, residential consumers often face an

   increasing block tariff for paying for electricity (Ito, 2014).

          An important element in hotel energy consumption is the principal agent problem

   faced by hotel operators – hotels pay their own bills while the hotel guests face a zero

   marginal cost for electricity and water use. Similar to the well-known landlord-tenant

   split incentives problem (Gillingham et al., 2012), hotel guests have very weak

   financial incentives to engage in conservation. Anticipating this point, Goldstein et al.

   (2008) introduced the now widespread water nudges to encourage people to reuse their

   towels at hotels. In the case of electricity conservation, some hotels have introduced

   inserting key cards and other ways to encourage conservation.


III.      Methods and Data

        A. Methods

          Hotels represent a standardized piece of real estate whose managers have

       incentives to optimize their efficiency. We explore how their electricity consumption

    varies across time and space. Our first empirical approach compares similar hotels

    located in different states while controlling for climate and occupancy conditions and

    the physical attributes of the hotel, such as its size and vintage. To explain the

    variation in the hotel chain’s monthly electricity consumption, we estimate the

    following model for hotel i in state j at month t:

                     ln 𝑘𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑗𝑡 = State𝑗 + 𝛾 ∙ X𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡
                                                                                         (1)



                                                 6
    In equation (1), the dependent variable is the log of a hotel’s monthly electricity

consumption. We regress this on state-fixed effects, current climate conditions (a

quadratic of heating and cooling degree days), the hotel’s total occupied rooms and a

vector of observable attributes of the hotel; including its size, quality, service level,

and vintage. We estimate equation (1) for variety of subsets of our data and we

compare how our results change when we do and do not control for the average price

of electricity paid by the hotel in month j. 5 In all of the regressions reported in this

paper, we cluster the standard errors by hotel.

        We estimate equation (1) using OLS. In this regression, the error term

represents the unobserved determinants of a hotel’s electricity consumption in a given

month. For example, a hotel’s guests that month may watch more television or plug in

more electronic devices. The kitchen in the hotel may serve more meals. When we

estimate such cross-sectional regressions, we are implicitly assuming that sorting on

unobservables is not taking place. If guests in California hotels are systematically

different than guests of the same hotel chain in different states then we would recover

a California-fixed effect that represents a mixture of the average hotel’s energy

efficiency and the electricity consumption habits of these select guests. A second

challenge to interpreting our estimates of state-fixed effects as causal treatment effects

would arise if the hotels the chain builds in California were different on unobserved

quality attributes. 6




5
  Increasing block tariffs are not used for commercial or industrial consumers (see Borenstein, 2009).
6
  In results available upon request, we also included Census demographic variables on the hotel’s zip
code attributes. For example, hotels in a richer part of the city might be built to higher quality. Our
results are robust to controlling for such variables.

                                                  7
           The second hypothesis we test focuses on whether California’s hotels have

experienced greater energy efficiency progress as compared to non-California hotels.

We study this by estimating equation (2). For hotel i in location j at time t we seek to

explain the variation in electricity consumption per occupied room:

           𝑘𝑊ℎ
             𝑖𝑗𝑡
ln �𝑂𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑝𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑜𝑜𝑚 � = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛾1 ∙ Trend𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾2 ∙ Trend𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾3 ∗ 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡 +
                   𝑖𝑗𝑡


𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 (2)

   In equation (2), the dependent variable is now the log of electricity consumption

per occupied room. We view this as a measure of the hotel’s productivity, comparable

to gallons per mile for vehicles. We regress this on a hotel-fixed effect and climate

variables. Controlling for these factors, we recover the overall time trend and we allow

the time trend to differ by geography. For example, we will test if California’s time

trend differs from the national average. We seek to test whether California hotels are

becoming more efficient over time relative to the nation’s hotels. In estimating

equation (2), we are assuming that the within-hotel unobserved determinants of

electricity consumption per occupied room are uncorrelated with the observables.



B. Data

   Our dataset is based on one major United States hotel chain, with a global

presence. It is a random sample that covers the majority of their portfolio (more than

70 percent). Our dataset includes detailed information on the electricity and natural

gas usage for each hotel, as well as a large set of covariates, including: property

address, square footage, number of rooms, year of construction, the hotel market

quality segment, type of energy used, monthly occupancy, monthly usage and

                                           8
      expenditure on electricity. The data covers the January 2007 to November 2013

      period. For each hotel, climate data are matched to the nearest weather station by the

      data provider. We then compute heating degree days and cooling degree days for each

      month and for each property.

         We use the data to construct the average real price per month for electricity

      (defined as total expenditure on electricity divided by total consumption). In our

      dataset, Hawaii and New York hotels face a much higher average electricity price than

      other states, with Hawaii at 16 cents per kWh and New York at 15 cents per kWh.

      California’s hotels face the sixth most expensive rate, at 6.2 cents per kWh. We report

      our results with and without the log of real price. We view the price variable to be a

      control variable and do not attempt to recover a demand curve for hotel electricity

  consumption. The variable definitions are presented in Appendix 1 and a brief

  overview of the summary statistics is reported in Table 1.



                                         [Insert Table 1 here]



IV.      Results

      A. Ranking State Commercial Building Energy Efficiency

         Table 2 presents six estimates of equation (1). In column (1), we report results for

  all hotels, including the international hotels run by the chain. We include state-fixed

      effects for thirteen major states: California, Ohio, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Illinois,

      New Jersey, New York, Florida, Michigan, Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina,

      Massachusetts and Virginia. Together these states represent 70 percent of our hotel



                                                9
sample. The other hotels are included in the omitted category. A distinctive feature of

our study is that we can include an international dimension because the hotel chain

operates hotels in Canada, Mexico and South America. We include an international

dummy for these hotels.

   Controlling for climate, occupancy, and the hotel’s attributes, we find that

California hotels consume 24 percent less electricity as compared to the average hotel

located in smaller states, consume 41 percent less electricity than international hotels

(the coefficient on the international dummy is 0.17), and 36 percent less than Florida

hotels. While California stands out as the largest (in absolute value) fixed effect, Ohio

is the second most energy efficient state with a coefficient of -0.18.

   In column (2) of Table 2, we estimate the same regression, but now include the log

of the real average price of electricity that the hotel paid in month j. Our main goal

here is to analyze how robust the state-fixed effect results are to including additional

control variables. The California dummy shrinks significantly, and now California and

Ohio have roughly equal fixed effects – energy prices are correlated with energy

performance, which partially explains California’s relative efficiency. In regressions

(3) and (4), we drop the international hotels and re-run the results. We find that

findings are robust when we exclude these hotels.

   We document that full service hotels consume much more electricity than hotels of

lower quality. This result is in line with the findings of Kahn, et al. (2014), who

document that higher quality commercial real estate consumes more electricity per

square foot. The other explanatory variables have intuitive signs: electricity




                                            10
consumption is an increasing and concave function of hotel occupancy and square

footage, and electricity consumption increases as a function of cooling degree days.

   One surprising result in Table 2 is the absence of significant hotel vintage effects.

Relative to the omitted category (hotels constructed before 1980), hotels built in the

1980s, 1990s, and 2000s do not have much lower levels of electricity consumption.

We do find a borderline statistically significant result that hotels built in the 1990s

consume 11 percent less electricity than hotels built before 1980, but these results are

not persistent for more recently constructed hotels. These findings are also in line with

results documented by Kahn et al. (2014) – vintage and consumption are not

necessarily positively correlated in commercial real estate.

   In regressions (5) and (6), we split the sample and run equation (1) for hotels built

before and after the median year built (1990). We seek to test whether the California

effect differs for younger versus older hotels. The results show that, for both

subsamples, California’s hotels are the most energy efficient, but the California “lead”

over the next most energy efficient state is larger in the earlier period than the later

period.

   If California state policies are indeed causing the energy efficiency differential that

we documented in columns (1) – (6) of Table 2, then hotels within California should

be equally efficient across the state’s large geographic area. To test this claim, we

report additional estimates of equation (1) in columns (7) and (8) of Table 2. In this

case, we partition California into four regions: the San Francisco region (CA_SF), the

Los Angeles region (CA_LA), the San Diego region (CA_SD) and “other” (CA_OT).

We include dummies for each of these regions and test whether the dummies’



                                           11
coefficients are equal. As shown in the additional analysis, we cannot reject this

hypothesis. A joint F-test indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the

coefficients all are equal. This test lends support to our claim that there is a causal

effect of being located in California, independent from the exact location of a hotel

within the state. In column (8) of Table 2, we restrict the sample to only California

hotels and re-estimate equation (1). Note that each of the California region coefficients

is statistically insignificant (the omitted category is California “other”).



                                     [Insert Table 2 here]



   Mulligan and Shleifer (2005) offer a theory for why the largest states might have

the most effective regulation. They argue that there is a fixed cost associated with

creating regulation. This suggests that in small states such as Vermont that there would

be few benefits from introducing efficiency regulation because only a handful of

economic actors would be affected. In contrast, in states such as California there are

thousands of commercial buildings that are affected by regulation.

B. Substitution and the Energy Mix in Buildings

   The previous analysis focused on electricity consumption in buildings, but

California real estate is a major consumer of natural gas. In Table 3, we introduce a

new dependent variable which represents the log of a hotel’s average daily carbon

dioxide emissions produced. For each hotel, we know its NERC region emissions

factor and we use this information to calculate Y=log((kwh/1000)*co2 emissions

factor + 11.7*therms).      This equation uses information on each hotel’s electricity



                                             12
consumption, natural gas consumption and the hotel’s NERC region emissions factor

to calculate the log of pounds of carbon dioxide released by each hotel.

      This is the dependent variable in Table 3’s columns (1) and (2). The results for the

control variables are quite similar to those reported in Table. California continues to

have a negative and statistically significant coefficient relative to small states but is no

longer the “greenest” state.          Massachusetts and New York have more negative

coefficients. In column (2), we include the log of average energy cost. Average

energy cost is computed as the total expense divided by total usage. In column (3), we

switch the dependent variable to measure the log of average daily total energy BTU

per hotel. 7 We find that California has a negative coefficient of -.09 but it is less green

than Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas.



C. Testing for Differentials in Energy Efficiency Trends

      Environmental groups such as the National Resources Defense Council have

marveled that California's economic productivity per kWh of electricity consumed has

improved over 50 percent in real dollars since 1980. In contrast, the rest of the US has

only improved by 15 percent. 8 A standard environmental accounting approach would

seek to measure how much of this differential is due to shifting composition effects

versus actual technique differentials between states.

      We estimate equation (2) to study the relative progress in the energy efficiency of

California as compared to the rest of the nation. Table 3 presents the results.

7   This is defined as log((electricity consumption+natural gas in therms*100000/3413)/curr_days).

                                                  13
Estimates of equation (2) allow us to focus on testing spatial hypotheses related to how

the technique effect is changing in different states over time. The dependent variable is

the logarithm of monthly hotel electricity consumption per occupied room. Hotel

electricity consumption per occupied room offers a standardized comparison metric

similar to gallons per mile for vehicles or the industrial sector’s carbon intensity

(carbon emissions per dollar of value added).

   A more efficient hotel should consume less electricity per occupied room. We

control for hotel fixed effects and examine the monthly time trend. The average

domestic hotel has no change in its energy efficiency while the average international

hotel is consuming 9.6 percent (0.008*12) more electricity per year, on average. In

contrast, we estimate a negative and statistically significant trend for California’s

hotels equal to 4.8 percent per year. While our data set covers the years 2007 to the

end of 2013, this effect would add up to a large increase in energy efficiency over

time. In Summer 2014, President Obama committed the U.S to reduce its greenhouse

gas emissions, and part of that plan is a 1.5 percent per year improvement in energy

efficiency. Our estimate of the California time trend is much larger.

       In column 2 of Table 4 we introduce another explanatory variable, which is an

interaction between the hotel’s county’s share of the electorate that voted for John

Kerry (the Democrat) in 2004, interacted with the time trend. This variable allows us

to test for whether the California negative trend is due to the state’s liberal leaning. To

our surprise this interaction term is positive (indicating that hotels in more liberal

counties actually increase their electricity consumption over time relative to

Conservative counties), but the California dummy is still negative and statistically



                                            14
 significant. Recall that this time trend is identified based on within hotel variation in

 electricity consumption per occupied room between the years 2007 and 2013.

 Understanding the causes of this differential time trend merits future empirical

 research.

        In columns (3) and (4) we again include the log of the real average price of

 electricity that the hotel paid in month j. The coefficients indicate that electricity prices

 are strongly correlated with over-time progress in the reduction of electricity

 consumption. The results for California remain significant, and economically large,

 with an average annual reduction in electricity consumption of 3.6 percent (over the

 2007-2013 period). In column (5), we switch the dependent variable to be the log of a

 hotel’s total energy consumption. We find that California does not have a differential

 trend than the rest of the nation but when we switch the dependent variable to be the

 log of the hotel’s total carbon dioxide emissions, California again has a sharply

 negative trend of -.007 per month versus the rest of the nation at -.003 per month. Both

 of these coefficients and their differential are statistically significant.



V.      Conclusion

        While residential electricity consumption patterns have been well studied (see, for

     example, Chong, 2012, Jacobsen and Kotchen, 2013), we know very little about how

     commercial buildings, occupied by some of the major corporations, perform over time.

     Commercial real estate features owners are typically less heterogeneous and likely to

     be more responsive and better trained to use energy efficiently relative to residential

     electricity consumers.



                                               15
   This paper exploits a large random sample of hotels from a major global hotel

chain to explore both spatial and temporal variation in hotel electricity consumption.

The hotel capital stock is an important component of the commercial real estate stock.

Hotels consume electricity, with guests demanding basic services such as lighting,

comfort, entertainment and safety. As profit-maximizing entities, hotels have strong

incentives to invest in energy efficiency in order to equate the expected present

discounted savings in operating expenses with the marginal cost of achieving these

gains.

   At a point in time, the chain’s hotels face different climate conditions, occupancy

rates, and electricity prices. Controlling for these factors, we focus on recovering state-

fixed effects. California stands out as the most energy efficient state, but it is only

slightly more energy efficient than the next closest states such as Ohio and Arizona.

Based on regressions where we include hotel fixed effects, California’s hotels feature a

much larger decline in electricity consumption per occupied room than the rest of the

nation. California’s hotels are reducing their electricity consumption per occupied

room by roughly 5 percent per year during our sample period covering 2007 to 2013

while domestic hotels from the same chain not located in California are experiencing

no measurable energy efficiency progress. The within-hotel evidence is consistent with

the claim that California energy efficiency policy is an important determinant of

efficiency progress.

   Of course, our conclusions are based on a rather crude measure of “policy” and

more detailed insight into the drivers of reductions in consumption is desirable. Data

from the California Electricity Commission (CEC) are useful for establishing changes



                                            16
to the building code during the calendar years of our study. 9 These documents indicate

that California’s commercial building code tightened in the years 2001, 2005, 2008,

and 2013. If we had data on a sufficiently large number of hotels in California, we

could introduce an event study approach to test for whether these code changes yield

statistically significant reductions in electricity consumption. We do not have enough

hotels to implement this approach. The CEC’s records indicate a whole host of

changes concerning: the roof, insulation, the building envelope, water heating, cooling

and lighting and other features such that it would be quite difficult to tease out the

most important causes of electricity productivity gains. 10 Future research should

address the exact impact of these policy changes in more detail, ideally using monthly

hotel data rather than higher frequency such as 15 minute interval data.
