                                           ABSTRACT

We put forward a theory of the optimal capital structure of the firm based on Jensen's (1986)

hypothesis that a firm's choice of capital structure is determined by a trade-off between agency costs

and monitoring costs. We model this tradeoff dynamically. We assume that early on in the

production process, outside investors face an informational friction with respect to withdrawing

funds from the firm which dissipates over time. We assume that they also face an agency friction

which increases over time with respect to funds left inside the firm. The problem of determining the

optimal capital structure of the firm as well as the optimal compensation of the manager is then a

problem of choosing payments to outside investors and the manager at each stage of production to

balance these two frictions.

1. Introduction
      We put forward a theory of the optimal capital structure of the firm and the optimal

compensation of the firm’s managers based on Jensen’s (1986) hypothesis that a firm’s choice

of capital structure is determined by a trade-oﬀ between agency costs and monitoring costs.

We model this trade-oﬀ dynamically by assuming that outside investors in a firm face diﬀerent

obstacles to recouping their investment at diﬀerent times. Early on in the production process,

outside investors face an information friction – the output of the firm is private information

to the manager of the firm unless the outside investors pay a fixed cost to monitor the firm.

With time, the output of the firm is revealed to outside investors and, hence, the information

friction disappears. At this later stage in the production process however, outside investors

face an agency friction – the firm’s manager can divert resources not paid out to investors

in the early phases of production towards perquisites that provide him with private benefits.

The problem of determining the optimal capital structure of the firm as well as the optimal

compensation of the manager is then a problem of choosing payments to outside investors

and the manager at each stage of production to balance these two frictions.

      Our theory is developed in an dynamic optimal contracting framework, and, as a

result, our model yields predictions about the joint dynamics of a firm’s capital structure

and its executive compensation. The choice of compensation for the manager is shaped by

the assumption that the manager is risk averse while the outside investors are risk neutral.

Our theory has the following implications regarding optimal capital structure and executive

compensation. Each period, the payouts from the firm can be divided into payments to the

manager that consist of a non-contingent base pay and a performance component of pay based

on the realized output of the firm, as well as two distinct payments to the outside investors
that resemble payments to debt and outside equity respectively. The debt-like payment to

outside investors is made early in the period. It comes in the form of a fixed lump – the

failure of which to pay leads to monitoring. The equity-like payment to outside investors

comes in the form of a residual which depends upon the performance of the firm and is paid

at the end of the period.

      In our model, the fact that the manager receives some form of performance based

pay is not motivated by the desire to induce the manager to exert greater eﬀort or care in

managing the firm. Instead, the performance based component of the manager’s pay simply

serves to induce the manager to forsake expenditures on perquisites for his own enjoyment.

Hence, our model’s predictions for whether it is optimal to have the performance component

of the manager’s compensation depend on the total market value of the firm or on some

narrower measure of current performance such as current sales are determined entirely by our

assumptions regarding the extent of the agency friction. If the manager is able to appropriate

a broad measure of the firm’s resources for his own benefit, then his performance bonus will

be based on this broad measure. If the manager’s ability to appropriate resources is more

limited in scope, then his bonus pay will be based on this narrower measure of performance.

      Our theory also has implications for the relationship between the optimal financial

structure of the firm and its optimal production plan. Our theory predicts that there is a

wedge between the marginal product of capital in the firm and rental rate on capital that

depends upon the expected monitoring costs associated with bankruptcy and the ineﬃcient

risk-sharing between outside investors and the manager induced by the agency friction. Under

certain parametric assumptions, we are able to compute the magnitude of this wedge between

the marginal product of capital and its rental rate in terms of readily observed features of

                                              2
the firm’s financial structure and its executive compensation.

       To extend our model to a dynamic setting, we assume that there is an information

cycle in which outside investors first face an information friction and then face an agency

friction. This cycle is repeated indefinitely. We associate this cycle with an accounting or

capital budgeting cycle at the firm. We show the qualitative decomposition of the optimal

contract into four payments – base pay and performance pay for the manager, and debt

and equity-like payments to the outside investors – holds both in a static setting in which

there is only one information cycle, and in a dynamic setting in which there are an arbitrary

number of information cycles. Thus, repetition of our contracting problem does not change,

qualitatively, the interpretation of our eﬃcient contract as a theory of capital structure and

executive compensation.

       We derive two additional results in our model in dynamic setting with more than

one information cycle. The first of these results is that the compensation of incumbent

managers is non-decreasing over time, regardless of the performance of the firm. The second

of these results is that incumbent managers are protected against the risk that they become

unproductive with a “golden parachute”.

       The result that the pay of the incumbent manager is non-decreasing over time has

implications for the dynamics of the firm’s optimal capital structure since, ceteris paribus, the

dynamics of executive compensation alter the terms of the trade-oﬀ between the information

and agency frictions that outside investors face. In particular, this result implies that if the

firm is particularly profitable in one period, in the next period, the firm’s payout shifts away

from debt toward equity.

       The result that an incumbent manager that becomes unproductive receives a “golden

                                               3
parachute” suﬃcient to maintain the marginal utility of consumption that he enjoyed as

productive manager is a direct consequence of optimal risk sharing. The exact size of the

golden parachute is determined by the outside opportunities of an incumbent manager – if

these outside opportunities are not good, then the manager receives a large golden parachute

while if they are good, then the parachute mandated by optimal risk sharing is smaller.

       Our model delivers predictions for the division of payments from the firm between the

manager, the owners of outside equity, and the owners of the firm’s debt based on the trade-

oﬀ of information and agency frictions. It is important to note that our dynamic model does

not pin down the debt-equity ratio of the firm. This is because our model does not pin down

the source of financing for ongoing investment in the firm. We present an simple example

to demonstrate that, holding fixed the division of gross payments to debt and outside equity

holders, the firm will have a diﬀerent debt-equity ratio depending on whether debt is long

term and ongoing investment is financed out of retained earnings or debt is short-term and

ongoing investment is financed with new short-term debt. We conjecture that this failure

of our model to pin down the debt-equity ratio of the firm in a dynamic setting may be a

general aspect of completely specified “trade-oﬀ” models of corporate finance.

       This paper is considers the optimal financial contract between outside investors and a

manager in the presence of both information and agency frictions when there is the possibility

of monitoring. It is therefore related to a wide range of prior research on each of these topics.

The within period, or static, aspects of the information and monitoring aspect is similar to

Townsend (1979), while the static aspects of the agency friction and the information friction

are similar to Hart and Moore (1995), in that these frictions can rationalize a division of

the firms output into debt, and other payments.1 However, unlike these prior papers, the

                                               4
inclusion of both frictions and monitoring, and the specific form of these friction leads to

three diﬀerent payment streams coming out of the firm, outside debt, outside equity, and

managerial compensation.

       Since we consider these frictions within a recursive environment, our paper is related

to prior work on dynamic eﬃcient contracting. However, unlike the literature on dynamic

models of eﬃcient financial contracting with information frictions, such as Atkeson (1991),

Hopenhayn and Clementi (2002), Demarzo and Fishman (2004) or Wang (2004), our infor-

mation friction is temporary since there is complete information revelation by the end of the

period. As a result, while the costly state verification aspect of our model rationalizes outside

debt, the dynamic aspects and the overall tractability of our model are similar to those of the

dynamic enforcement constraint literature, such as Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004), and

Cooley, Marimon and Quadrini (2004). In particular, it shares the feature that if the manger

is retained, then his promised utility is weakly increasing over time, and these increases serve

to reduce the extent of the enforcement friction.

       In our model contracting is complete subject to explicit information and enforcement

frictions. This is in contrast to a large literature that seeks to explain various aspects of the

financial structure of firms as arising from incomplete contracting. Examples include Hart

and Moore (1995,1997), as well as: Aghion and Bolton (1992) which examines the eﬃcient

allocation of control rights, Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) in which outside investors choose

their holdings of a debt as opposed to equity claims to generate the eﬃcient decision with

respect to the interference or not in the continuing operation of the firm, Zweibel (1996) in

which manager uses debt as a means of constraint their future investment choices to be more

eﬃcient.

                                               5
2. Model
       We begin by presenting a one period version of the model. We extend our results to

a dynamic model in a later section.

       There is a large number of risk neutral outside investors who are endowed with capital

which they can rent in the market at rental rate r. There is also a large number of identical risk

averse managers. These managers have an outside opportunity that oﬀers them utility U0 .

We assume that the managers have a utility function u(c) with u(0) = −∞ and u0 (0) = ∞.

       There is a production technology that transforms capital and the labor of a manager

into output. The production process takes place over the course of three subperiods within

the period. In the first subperiod, a manager is chosen to operate the production technology

and capital K is installed. In the second subperiod, this production technology yields output



      y = θF (K)



where θ is a productivity shock that is idiosyncratic to this technology. In this subperiod,

this productivity shock θ and hence, output y as well, is private information to the manager.

The set of possible shocks is an interval given by Θ and the distribution of these shocks has

c.d.f. P with density p and an expected value of one. We assume that there are diminishing

returns to scale in the sense that F 00 (K) < 0.

       In the second sub-period, the outside investors have the option of monitoring the

output of the project to learn the realization of the shock θ (and hence output y as well)

at a cost of γF (K) units of output. At the end of the second subperiod, the manager has

the option of spending up to fraction τ of whatever output of the firm that he has not paid


                                                   6
out to the outside investors during this sub-period on perquisites that he alone enjoys. That

output that the manager does not spend on perquisites is productively reinvested in the firm.

For simplicity, we assume that the gross return on this productive reinvestment in the firm

between the second and third sub-periods is one.

       In the third sub-period, the outside investors can freely observe both the output of the

firm y = θF (K) and the division of this output between spending on perks for the manager

and productive reinvestment.

       The contracting problem between the outside investors and the manager can be de-

scribed as follows. A contract between these parties specifies a level of capital K to be hired

in the first subperiod, a decision by the outside investors to monitor m and a payment from

the manager to the outside investors in the second subperiod v, and a payment from the

outside investors to the manager in the third subperiod x.

       We assume that the outside investors can commit to a deterministic strategy for paying

the cost to monitor the output of the project in the second sub-period as a function of the

manager’s announcement θ̂ of the realization of the productivity shock θ. Denote this strategy

by m(θ̂) and denote set of announced shocks for which monitoring takes place by M ⊆ Θ.

       The payments v from the manager to the outside investors in the second subperiod

are contingent on the manager’s announcement of the productivity shock θ̂ as well as the

outcome of the monitoring decision. Let v0 (θ̂) denote the payment that the manager makes

to the outside investors in the second sub-period as a function of the announcement θ̂ in case

monitoring does not take place, and let v1 (θ̂, θ) denote the payment that the manager makes

as a function both of the announcement θ̂ and the true value of θ in case monitoring does

take place.

                                              7
         Finally, let x(θ̂, θ) denote the payment from the outside investors to the manager in

the third subperiod as a function of his report θ̂ in the second sub-period and the realized

production shock θ. Note that it is not necessary for x to depend on the monitoring decision

because the true value of θ is revealed to outside investors in the third sub-period at zero

cost.

         For reasons of limited liability, we require



        v0 (θ̂) ≤ θ̂F (K), v1 (θ̂, θ) ≤ θF (K), and x(θ̂, θ) ≥ 0.                             (1)



         We assume, without loss of generality, that x(θ̂, θ) is chosen to ensure that the manager

chooses not to take any perks for himself. This assumption implies a constraint on x(θ̂, θ)

that



        u(x(θ̂, θ)) ≥ u(τ (θF (K) − v0 (θ̂))) for all θ̂ ∈
                                                         / M, and                             (2)

        u(x(θ̂, θ)) ≥ u(τ (θF (K) − v1 (θ̂, θ))) for all θ̂ ∈ M.



         Given the terms of the contract, m, v0 , v1 , and x, the manager chooses a strategy for

reporting θ denoted σ(θ). We say that the report σ(θ) = θ̂ is feasible given v0 and θ if either

θ̂ ∈ M or θ̂ ∈
             / M and v0 (θ̂) ≤ θF (K). Note that this definition requires that the manager has

the resources to make the payment v0 (σ(θ)) in the event that he reports σ(θ) = θ̂ ∈
                                                                                   / M. We

restrict the manager to choose a reporting strategies such that σ(θ) is feasible given v0 for

all θ. We interpret this constraint as following from the assumption that there is an optimal

contract in which the outside investors choose to monitor if the manager announces θ̂ ∈
                                                                                      /M


                                                    8
but then does not pay v0 (θ̂) and that x(θ̂, θ) = 0 in this event.

       We restrict attention to contracts in which the manager truthfully reports θ. Hence,

we impose the incentive constraint



      u(x(θ, θ)) ≥ u(x(θ̂, θ)) for all θ ∈ Θ and feasible θ̂ given θ and v0 .            (3)



The manager’s expected utility under the contract is given by the expectation of u(x(θ, θ)).

Since managers have an outside opportunity that delivers them utility U0 , we require the

individual rationality constraint


      Z
          u(x(θ, θ))p(θ)dθ ≥ U0 .                                                        (4)



       Note that this contracting problem is a partial equilibrium problem in the sense we

assume that the outside investors have already purchased this production opportunity from

the entrepreneur who created it and now they simply seek to design a contract with the

manager that they hire on a competitive market to run this production opportunity. We

do not model the costs that entrepreneurs pay to create these production opportunities nor

the price that they receive when they sell a newly created production opportunity to outside

investors.

3. Characterizing an eﬃcient contract
       In this section, we characterize a contract that maximizes the expected payoﬀ to the

outside investors


      Z
          [(θ − γm(θ))F (K) − x(θ, θ)] p(θ)dθ − rK                                          (5)



subject to the constraints (1), (2), (3), and (4) in the following two propositions. We refer to

such a contract as an eﬃcient contract.


Proposition 1. There is an eﬃcient contract with the following properties: (i) v1 (θ̂, θ) =
                                                                            n            o
                                     ∗                             ∗
θF (K) for all θ̂ ∈ M and v0 (θ̂) = θ F (K) for all θ̂ ∈
                                                       / M, where θ = inf θ̂|θ̂ ∈  /M ,

(ii) M is an interval ranging from 0 to θ∗ , and (iii) for θ̂ 6= θ, x(θ̂, θ) = 0 if θ̂ ≤ θ∗ and

x(θ̂, θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) if θ > θ∗ .


Proof: To prove (i), we first consider the case of reports that lead to monitoring. For all

θ̂ ∈ M, setting v1 (θ̂, θ) = θF (K) relaxes the constraint (2) as much as possible and has

no eﬀect on the objective (5) nor on any other constraint. Hence we can, without loss of

generality, assume that v1 has this form.
                                                                                      n             o
       Next, consider the case of reports that don’t lead to monitoring. Let v0∗ = inf v0 (θ̂)|θ̂ ∈
                                                                                                  /M .

Note that for all θ < v0∗ /F (K), it is not feasible for the manager to report θ̂ ∈
                                                                                  / M since the

manager would be unable to make the payment v0 (θ̂) ≥ v0∗ in that case. This implies that

v0∗ ≤ θF (K) for all θ ∈
                       / M since, otherwise, truthtelling would not be feasible. From (2) and




                                              10
(3), for all θ ≥ v0∗ /F (K), we have that



      x(θ, θ) ≥ sup x(θ̂, θ) ≥ τ (θF (K) − v0∗ ) ,                                              (6)
                θ̂∈M
                  /




since the manager can, with strategic reporting of θ̂, ensure that the payment that he makes

to outside investors in the second subperiod is arbitrarily close to v0∗ and thus ensure that he

consumes arbitrarily close to τ (θF (K) − v0∗ ) in perks. Since (θF (K) − v0∗ ) ≥ (θF (K) − v0 (θ̂))

           / M, we can set v0 (θ̂) equal to a constant, here v0∗ , without aﬀecting any of the
for all θ̂ ∈

binding incentive constraints (2). Given a monitoring set M, setting the constant v0∗ as high

as possible relaxes the constraint (2) as much as possible. Given this, constraint (1) implies
                                 n         o
that v0∗ = θ∗ F (K) with θ∗ ≡ inf θ̂|θ̂ ∈
                                        / M is an optimal choice.

        To prove that M is an interval, note that if M were to contain some θ̃ > θ∗ , it would
                                                  ³       ´
still be the case that, for that θ̃, x(θ̃, θ̃) ≥ τ θ̃ − θ∗ F (K) since the manager has the option

of reporting any feasible θ̂ ∈
                             / M that he chooses and hence ensuring himself of consumption
                      ³       ´
arbitrarily close to τ θ̃ − θ∗ F (K). Hence, it is not possible to relax the constraint (2) for

θ > θ∗ any further by choosing to monitor for that report θ̃. Since it is costly to monitor, an

                              / M for almost all θ̃ > θ∗ . Thus, there is an eﬃcient contract
eﬃcient contract must have θ̃ ∈

in which M is an interval ranging from 0 to θ∗ .

       To finish the proof, observe that given the incentive constraint (3), we can, without

loss of generality, set x(θ̂, θ) for θ̂ 6= θ as low as possible to relax this incentive constraint

as much as possible. Hence, it is eﬃcient to set x(θ̂, θ) = 0 for θ̂ 6= θ and θ̂ ≤ θ∗ , and it

is feasible to do so since, in the event of monitoring, the outside investors take possession

of the output of the firm and there are no resources for the manager to spend on perks for


                                                 11
himself. From (2) and the results above, we set x(θ̂, θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ ) for θ̂ 6= θ and θ̂ > θ∗ .

Here it is not possible to set the manager’s compensation any lower. Note that by setting

x(θ̂, θ) in this way, we ensure that any choice of x(θ, θ) that satisfies nonnegativity for θ ≤ θ∗

and x(θ, θ) ≥ τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) for θ > θ∗ also satisfies both the no perks condition (2) and is

incentive compatible in that it satisfies (3). Q.E.D.

       With these results, we can restate our optimal contracting problem much more simply

as follows. The problem now is to choose a level of investment K, a monitoring set indexed

by θ∗ , and payments to the manager w(θ) = x(θ, θ) to maximize the expected payoﬀ to the

outside investors:


      Z
          (θF (K) − w(θ)) p(θ)dθ − γP (θ∗ )F (K) − rK,                                         (7)

and a no-perks constraint

With our assumption that managers’ utility is unbounded below, we know that the limited

liability constraint w(θ) ≥ 0 is not binding.

       Given values of θ∗ , K, and w(θ) that solve this problem, the contract with M =

{θ|θ ≤ θ∗ } , v1 (θ̂, θ) = θF (K), v0 (θ̂) = θ∗ F (K), x(θ, θ) = w(θ), x(θ̂, θ) = 0 for θ̂ 6= θ and

                                                12
θ̂ ≤ θ∗ , and x(θ̂, θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) for θ̂ 6= θ and θ̂ > θ∗ is an eﬃcient contract.

       In the following two sections, we use the first order conditions of this simplified con-

tracting problem to characterize the financial structure of this project and the relationship

between financial structure and production eﬃciency. To that end, we consider the La-

grangian associated with the problem (7) given by


                          Z
           max                (θF (K) − w(θ)) p(θ)dθ − γP (θ∗ )F (K) − rK+                  (10)

4. Debt, Equity and Executive Compensation
       In this section, we interpret the characteristics of the eﬃcient contract in terms of a

contract compensating the manager that consists of a base level of pay and a performance

bonus, a debt contract, and an outside equity contract.

       We begin by characterizing managerial compensation under this optimal contract in

the following proposition.


Proposition 2. Under an optimal contract, the payments to the manager w(θ) have the

form w(θ) = w̄ for θ ≤ θ̄ and w(θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) for θ > θ̄, where θ̄ is the solution to
      ¡       ¢
w̄ = τ θ̄ − θ∗ F (K).




                                                    13
Proof: The first-order conditions of (10) with respect to w(θ) are given by



     1 = (λ + δ(θ)) u0 (w(θ)) .                                                            (11)



This first order condition implies that w(θ) is constant for all values of θ such that the

constraint (9) does not bind (δ(θ) = 0). We denote this constant by w̄. Given w̄, the constraint

(9) binds for θ > θ̄ and does not bind for θ < θ̄. Clearly, w(θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) when (9)

binds. Q.E.D.

       Note that for those values of θ such that the constraint (9) is slack, the first order

condition (11) implies that


            1
     λ=               .                                                                    (12)
          u0 (w̄)


       From proposition 2, we have that the payments made to the manager in the third

sub-period are given by w(θ) = w̄ in the event that θ ≤ θ̄ and w(θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) =
 ¡      ¢
τ θ − θ̄ F (K) + w̄ in the event that θ > θ̄. We interpret the payment w̄ as the manager’s
                                                       ¡      ¢
base pay and the additional payment to the manager of τ θ − θ̄ F (K) in the event that

θ > θ̄ as the performance component of the manager’s pay. For the outside investors, the

value of this performance payment to the manager is given by

           ·Z                        ¸
                  ∞    ¡      ¢
     C=               τ θ − θ̄ p(θ)dθ F (K).
             θ̄




Note that the manager places a diﬀerent value on these payments because he is risk averse.

As we discus below, this wedge between the valuation of this performance payment by the

                                               14
outside investors and the manager plays a role in determining the firm’s optimal production

plan.

        To interpret the other payments under this optimal contract in terms of debt and

equity, we must ensure that payments to outside investors after the initial investment in the

first sub-period are non-negative so that they do not violate the limited liability constraint

imposed on investors in corporations. To do so, we assume that the outside investors invest

not only the capital K, but also the uncontingent portion of the manager’s pay w̄ in the

first sub-period. We associate the payments v0 or v1 made by the manager in the second

sub-period as the payments to debt holders. We associate the residual payments to outside

investors as the payments to outside equity.

        The payments made in the second sub-period are given by v1 (θ, θ) = θF (K) if θ ≤ θ∗

and v0 (θ) = θ∗ F (K) if θ > θ∗ . We interpret θ∗ F (K) as the face value of the project’s debt.

In the event that the realized value of the project exceeds the face value of the debt, the debt

is paid. In the event that the realized value of the project is less than the face value of the

debt, the project is bankrupt, monitored, and all remaining value is paid to the debt holders.

If one assumes that the debt holders bear the cost of monitoring, the market value of the

project’s debt is given by

             ·Z   θ∗                                    ¸
                                         ∗   ∗      ∗
        D=             θp(θ)dθ + (1 − P (θ ))θ − P (θ )γ F (K).
              0




Note that under the assumption that the debt holders bear the cost of monitoring, the value

of D can be negative since it is net of the cost of monitoring. Alternatively, one may assume

that the outside investors jointly contribute resources γF (K) in addition to uncontingent


                                                  15
payments K and w̄ in the first sub-period. Under this alternative assumption, the market

value of the debt is given by

           ·Z    θ∗                                         ¸
                                        ∗   ∗           ∗
      D=              θp(θ)dθ + (1 − P (θ ))θ + (1 − P (θ ))γ F (K),
             0




which is always positive. This alternative assumption can also rationalize commitment to

deterministic monitoring since the proceeds from monitoring are nonnegative even if θ = 0,

and are positive for θ > 0.

       The residual payout from the project is associated with the payments to the outside

equity holders. In the event of bankruptcy (θ ≤ θ∗ ), the outside equity holders receive no

payment. In the event that θ > θ∗ and θ ≤ θ̄, the outside equity holders receive payment

(θ − θ∗ ) F (K), which is the realized value of the project less the payment to the debt holders.

(Recall that the base portion of the manager’s pay, w̄, was set aside in advance). In the event
                                               ¡          ¡      ¢¢
that θ > θ̄, the outside equity holders receive θ − θ∗ − τ θ − θ̄ F (K) which is equal to the

realized value of the project less the payments to the debt holders and the payments to the

manager on the performance portion of his compensation.

       Note that in our model, the performance component of the manager’s pay resembles an

option on the value of the firm with strike price θ̄F (K), or equivalently an option on the value
                                           ¡       ¢
of the equity of the firm with strike price θ̄ − θ∗ F (K). This result that the performance

component of the manager’s pay resembles an option on the firm is driven by our assumption

that the agency friction applies to the entire value of the firm – that is, by our assumption

that the manager can spend up to fraction τ of all of the undisbursed output of the firm at

the end of the second sub-period.


                                                 16
       More generally, the measure of firm performance upon which the manager’s perfor-

mance pay is based is determined by the extent of the agency friction. To see this, consider

a variant of our model in which firm output had two components: current cash flow θf (K)

and undepreciated capital (1 − δ)K. Assume that the manager is able to spend up to fraction

τ of undisbursed cash flow on perquisites, but that he cannot divert undepreciated capital

for his own use. In this variant of the model, the constraint (2) on payments to the manager

would be modified to read



     u(x(θ̂, θ)) ≥ u(τ (θf (K) − v0 (θ̂))) for all θ̂ ∈
                                                      / M, and

     u(x(θ̂, θ)) ≥ u(τ (θf (K) − v1 (θ̂, θ))) for all θ̂ ∈ M,



and the limited liability constraint (1) would be modified to read



     v0 (θ̂) ≤ θ̂f (K) + (1 − δ)K, v1 (θ̂, θ) ≤ θf (K) + (1 − δ)K, and x(θ̂, θ) ≥ 0.



It is straightforward to show that the optimal contract in this variant of the model would break

down into four payments as before, except in this case, the performance pay to the manager

would be based on cash flow θf (K) and not on the value of the firm (which includes the value

of undepreciated capital). It is also straightforward in this variant of the model to interpret

the payments v backed by undepreciated capital (1 − δ)K as payments to collateralized debt.

It is worth noting, however, that our model does not have predictions regarding the optimal

mix of collateralized and uncollateralized debt.




                                                 17
5. Capital Structure, Production and Monitoring
       The standard result due to Modigliani and Miller (19??) is that in a frictionless

world, the capital structure of a firm has no impact on its eﬃcient production plan. Here we

have assumed specific frictions that determine the optimal capital structure of the firm. In

this section, we discuss the impact of these frictions of the firm’s eﬃcient production plan

as characterized in Proposition 3 below. In particular, we show that, under the optimal

production plan, there is a wedge between the expected marginal product of capital within

the firm and the opportunity cost of capital. Our main result is that the magnitude of this

wedge can be measured in terms of elements of the firm’s capital structure and its executive

compensation.

       We refer to an economy in which the monitoring cost γ = 0 as a frictionless envi-

ronment. In such an environment, the optimal contract specifies that the outside investors

monitor the output of the project in the second sub-period for all values of θ̂ and pay the

manager constant compensation w̄ independent of the realized value of θ. In this friction-

less environment, the eﬃcient capital stock satisfies F 0 (K) = r. In contrast, with financial

frictions, there is a wedge between the marginal product of capital and its rental rate. We

characterize this wedge in proposition 3.


Proposition 3. Assume that the support of θ in unbounded above. Then, under the optimal

contract, F 0 (K) > r.


Proof: The first order-condition of (10) with respect to K is given by

      ·Z                                                           ¸
           {θ − δ(θ)u (τ (θ − θ )F (K))τ (θ − θ )} p(θ)dθ − γP (θ ) F 0 (K) = r.
                     0        ∗               ∗                  ∗
                                                                                         (13)


                                               18
From (11) and (12), we have that


                   1        1
      δ(θ) =            −        .
               u0 (w(θ)) u0 (w̄)


With this result and the assumption that the expectation of θ is 1, this first order condition

for capital simplifies to

      ½              Z           ∞   ·                         ¸                 ¾
                ∗                        u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)]
       1 − γP (θ ) −                  1−                         τ (θ − θ )p(θ)dθ F 0 (K) = r.
                                                                         ∗
                                                                                                 (14)
                            θ̄                   u0 (w̄)


Note w̄ is finite as long as the manager’s reservation utility is finite. Hence the assumption

that the support of θ is unbounded above implies that P (θ̄) < 1. Thus, since


                u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)]
      0<1−                            < 1 ∀θ > θ̄,
                        u0 (w̄)


we have that


                      Z     ∞    ·                         ¸
                ∗                    u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)]
      1 − γP (θ ) −               1−                         τ (θ − θ∗ )p(θ)dθ < 1.
                       θ̄                    u0 (w̄)


Hence, F 0 (K) > r. Q.E.D.

       Note that the assumption that the support of θ is unbounded above is suﬃcient to

ensure that F 0 (K) > r, but it is not necessary. What is necessary is that either P (θ∗ ) > 0 or

P (θ̄) < 1, so that either there is monitoring or there is not perfect risk sharing.

       From (14), one can see that there are two parts to this wedge between F 0 (K) and r.

The first part is the expected loss due to monitoring given by γP (θ∗ ). This loss is a cost of


                                                         19
debt since the monitoring that debt requires in the event of bankruptcy results in a loss of

output. The second part of the wedge is the loss due to ineﬃcient risk-sharing between the

outside investors and the manager that arises as a result of the performance component of

the manager’s compensation. Specifically, this is the loss due to the fact that the risk averse

manager places a lower valuation on the state contingent component of his compensation

than the outside investors do, and this loss is represented by the term


        Z     ∞   ·                         ¸
                      u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)]
                   1−          0
                                              τ (θ − θ∗ )p(θ)dθ.
         θ̄                   u (w̄)


To interpret this term, observe that the outside investors value the manager’s option at
R∞
 θ̄
      τ (θ − θ∗ )p(θ)dθ. In contrast, the payment of τ (θ − θ∗ ) to the manager in the event that

productivity θ > θ̄ is realized raises the manager’s utility by u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)] τ (θ − θ∗ ) and

hence relaxes the promise keeping constraint by an amount that is worth only


        u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)]
                 0
                              τ (θ − θ∗ )
                u (w̄)


to the outside investors.

         Log Preference Example: If we assume that u(c) = log(c), then the first order

condition for capital (14) reduces to

        ½              Z            ∞                  ¾
                  ∗
         1 − γP (θ ) −                  τ (θ − θ̄)p(θ)dθ F 0 (K) = r.                           (15)
                               θ̄




Hence, in this case the wedge between the marginal product of capital and the rental rate on

capital is given by one minus the sum of the fraction of expected output (F (K)) devoted to

                                                            20
the monitoring cost and the fraction of expected output paid to the manager as the option

portion of his compensation. Thus, in this example, it is a simple matter to link our model’s

implications for the impact of financial frictions on eﬃcient production plans to observables.

         We turn next to the determination of the optimal extent of monitoring. The first

order-condition of (10) with respect to θ∗ can be written as follows once we substitute for

δ(θ) as we did in the capital condition (14),


         Z     ∞   µ                         ¶
                       u0 [τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K)]
     τ              1−           0
                                               p(θ)dθ = γp(θ∗ )F (K).                    (16)
          θ̄                    u (w̄)


This condition implies that under the eﬃcient contract, θ∗ is determined by a trade-oﬀ be-

tween the marginal cost of monitoring as captured by the right hand side of the above

expression, and the marginal impact of monitoring on the cost of distorting the manager’s

consumption, as captured by the left hand side of the above expression.


6. The Dynamic Contracting Problem
         We now consider the optimal contracting problem in a dynamic extension of our one

period model. In this section we show that the optimal dynamic contract is quite similar

to the optimal static contract in that it can be broken down into four payments: base pay

and performance pay for the manager, debt, and outside equity. We then show that the

manager’s pay is non-decreasing over time. In this section, we keep our problem simple by

assuming that all managers are equally productive in running the firm. In a later section, we

introduce the possibility that the incumbent manager in the firm may, at random, become

unproductive at running the firm. With this further extension of the model, we show how



                                                     21
a “golden parachute” forms part of the optimal package of executive compensation. In the

next section, we discuss several issues concerning the interpretation of an optimal contract

in this dynamic setting as a theory of the capital structure of the firm.

       The extension of our one period model to a dynamic setting is as follows. Each period

consists of three sub-periods as described above. In the first sub-period, the outside investors

hire a manager to run the project and put forward capital. In the second sub-period, the

current productivity shock θ, and hence current output y = θF (K), is realized, and these

values are observed only by the manager. The manager makes some payment to the outside

investors in this second sub-period. At the end of the second sub-period, the manager has

the option of investing up to fraction τ of the remaining output of the firm into perks that he

consumes and otherwise he reinvests the remaining output of the firm at gross rate of return

one. In the third sub-period, the realized value of the shock θ becomes public information, as

well as the manager’s division of the firm’s output between perks and productive reinvestment.

The manager is paid in this third sub-period. This production process is then repeated in

subsequent periods. We interpret this cycle of information about production as corresponding

to an accounting cycle or a capital budgeting cycle within the firm.

       We assume that all managers not running a project have an outside opportunity to

enjoy consumption c̄ each period. Corresponding to this consumption flow is a reservation

expected discounted utility level U0 . Individual rationality requires that new managers can

expect utility of at least U0 under a contract and that incumbent managers can expect a

utility of at least U0 in the continuation of any contract.

       We present a recursive characterization of the optimal dynamic contract. Accordingly,

we assume that the incumbent manager is indexed by a utility level U promised him from this

                                              22
period forward under the contract the previous period. This utility level is a contractual state

variable carried over from the previous period and hence is determined before the realization

of the productivity shock θ. We let V (U) denote the expected discounted value of payments

to outside investors given utility promise of U to the incumbent manager.

       A dynamic contract has the following elements. Given the utility U promised to the

incumbent manager as a state variable, the contract specifies a monitoring region M(U ) with

indicator function m(θ̂; U ) indicating the monitoring decision as a function of the manager’s

report, payments from the manager to the outside investors in the second subperiod v0 (θ̂; U)

if there is no monitoring and v1 (θ̂, θ; U) if there is monitoring, and payments from the outside

investors to the manager in the third subperiod x(θ̂, θ; U). The recursive representation of

the contract also specifies continuation utilities Z(θ̂, θ; U) for the incumbent manager. In

what follows, we suppress reference to U where there is no risk of confusion.

       These terms of the contract are chosen subject to the limited liability constraints (1).

Since the incumbent manager can always quit and take his outside opportunity in the next

period, we have an individual rationality constraint



      Z(θ̂, θ) ≥ U0 for all θ̂, θ                                                           (17)



       We require that the contract deliver the promised utility U to the incumbent manager


      Z
          [u(x(θ, θ)) + βZ(θ, θ)] p(θ)dθ = U.                                               (18)



The incumbent manager must be induced to truthfully report θ in the second sub-period.



                                                23
Hence we have incentive constraints, for all θ and θ̂ ∈
                                                      / M such that θ̂ is feasible in that

θ ≥ v0 (θ̂)/F (K),



      u(x(θ, θ)) + βZ(θ, θ) ≥ u(x(θ̂, θ)) + βZ(θ̂, θ).                                          (19)



Finally, there is a dynamic analog to the constraint (2) arising from the assumption that the

manager can spend fraction τ of whatever resources are left in the project at the end of the

second sub-period on perks that he enjoys. This constraint is given by



      u(x(θ̂, θ)) + βZ(θ̂, θ) ≥ u(τ (θF (K) − v1 (θ̂, θ))) + βU0 if θ̂ ∈ M                      (20)

      u(x(θ̂, θ)) + βZ(θ̂, θ) ≥ u(τ (θF (K) − v0 (θ̂))) + βU0 if θ̂ ∈
                                                                    /M



for all θ and for all θ̂ ∈
                         / M such that v0 (θ̂) ≤ θF (K). Here we have used the requirement that

the manager’s continuation utility cannot be driven down below U0 in the left-hand side of

(20) to compute the manager’s utility in the event that he invests in perks and then is fired

as a consequence.

       The terms of the dynamic contract are chosen to maximize the expected discounted

payments to the outside investors. This problem is to choose K, m(θ̂), v0 (θ̂), v1 (θ̂, θ), x(θ̂, θ),

and Z(θ̂, θ) to maximize


                  Z ½                                         ¾
                                                 1
      V (U) = max    (θ − γm(θ))F (K) − x(θ, θ) + V (Z (θ, θ)) p(θ)dθ − rK                      (21)
                                                 R


subject to the constraints (1), (17), (18), (19), and (20).



                                                 24
       In the remainder of this section, we characterize elements of an eﬃcient dynamic

contract. In proposition 4, we show that the optimal dynamic contract is similar to the

optimal static contract in that the monitoring set is an interval from 0 to θ∗ , and payments

in the second sub-period are given by v1 (θ̂, θ) = θF (K) if there is monitoring and v0 (θ̂) =
                       n         o
θ∗ F (K) where θ∗ ≡ inf θ̂|θ̂ ∈
                              / M if there is no monitoring. The line of argument here is

similar to that in proposition 1.

       In proposition 5, we discuss the manager’s pay and retention. We show that the man-

ager’s pay consists again of a constant base pay level denoted w̄ and then an increasing portion

of pay if a suﬃciently high realization of θ occurs. The line of argument on compensation is

similar to that for Proposition 2. We also show that, under the optimal dynamic contract, if

β ≥ 1/R, then the pay to the incumbent manager is non-decreasing over time.


Proposition 4. There is an eﬃcient contract with the following properties: (i) v1 (θ̂, θ) =
                                                            n         o
θF (K) for all θ̂ ∈ M and v0 (θ̂) = θ∗ F (K), where θ∗ ≡ inf θ̂|θ̂ ∈
                                                                   / M , (ii) M is an interval

ranging from 0 to θ∗ , and (iii) x(θ̂, θ) = 0 and Z(θ̂, θ) = U0 for θ̂ 6= θ and θ̂ ∈ M and

x(θ̂, θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) and Z(θ̂, θ) = U0 for θ̂ 6= θ and θ̂ ∈
                                                                 / M.


Proof: The proof here is quite similar to the proof of proposition 1. For all θ̂ ∈ M, setting

v1 (θ̂, θ) = θF (K) relaxes the constraint (20) as much as possible and has no eﬀect on the
                                                                    n            o
objective (21) nor on any other constraint. Again define v0∗ = inf v0 (θ̂)|θ̂ ∈
                                                                              / M and θ∗ =

inf {θ|θ ∈
         / M} . Observe that to relax the constraint (19) as much as possible, the manager’s

utility following a misreporting of θ̂ 6= θ should be set as low as possible. Given (1), (17),




                                                25
and (20), this gives x(θ̂, θ) = 0, Z(θ̂, θ) = U0 for θ̂ 6= θ and θ̂ ∈ M, and



      u(x(θ̂, θ)) + βZ(θ̂, θ) = u(τ (θF (K) − v0∗ )) + βU0                                   (22)



       / M, and θ ≥ v0∗ /F (K). Again, holding fixed the monitoring set, setting v0∗ as high as is
for θ̂ ∈

feasible relaxes this constraint as much as possible. Since feasibility requires that θ∗ F (K) ≥

v0∗ , this gives us that under an optimal contract, v0∗ = θ∗ F (K). That M is an interval follows

from the argument that including some θ > θ∗ in the monitoring set does nothing to relax

(22) and does require resources for monitoring. That x(θ̂, θ) = τ (θ − θ∗ )F (K) for θ̂ 6= θ,

   / M follows from the result that v0∗ = θ∗ F (K). Q.E.D.
θ̂ ∈

       With this proposition, we can write our optimal contracting problem more simply as

one of choosing capital K, the upper support of the monitoring set θ∗ , current managerial

pay w(θ) = x(θ, θ), and continuation values W (θ) = Z(θ, θ) to maximize the payoﬀ to the

outside investors


                  Z ½                         ¾
                                    1
      V (U) = max    θF (K) − w(θ) + V (W (θ)) p(θ)dθ − γP (θ∗ ) − rK                        (23)

subject to the promise-keeping constraint


      Z
          [u(w(θ)) + βW (θ)] p(θ)dθ = U                                                      (24)



the dynamic no-perks constraint



      u (w(θ)) + βW (θ) ≥ u (τ (θ − θ∗ ) F (K)) + βU0 ,                                      (25)


                                                26
       As in the static case, we can derive several results regarding the characteristics of

managerial compensation from the first order conditions of this problem. These characteristic

include that managerial pay consists of base pay plus a performance based component and

that pay for the incumbent manager is non-decreasing over time.


Proposition 5. There is an optimal contract under which there is a cutoﬀ θ̄ together with

a level of base pay w̄ for the manager such that w(θ) = w̄ and the continuation values W (θ)

are also constant at W̄ for θ ≤ θ̄. Both w(θ) and W (θ) are increasing for θ > θ̄. If βR ≥ 1,

then managerial pay w(θ)F (K) is non-decreasing over time.


Proof: The proof is quite similar to that of proposition 2 and follows from the first order

conditions of the optimal contracting problem. Let λ be the Lagrangian multiplier on the

constraint (18) and ρδ(θ)p(θ) the Lagrangian multipliers on the constraints (25). The first

order conditions of this problem with respect to w(θ) and W (θ) are



      1 = (λ + δ(θ)) u0 (w(θ)),



and


       1
      − V 0 (W (θ)) = β(λ + δ(θ)).
       R


These first order condition imply that w(θ) and W (θ) are constant unless the constraint (25)

binds. Note that since u (τ (θ − θ∗ ) F (K)) + βU0 is increasing in θ, there is a cutoﬀ θ̄ such

that this constraint does not bind for θ ≤ θ̄ and binds for θ > θ̄. When the constraint (25)



                                              27
binds, the optimal choices of w(θ) and W (θ) satisfy


               1 0
      1=−        V (W (θ))u0 (w(θ))
              βR


and (25) as an equality. Hence, w(θ) and W (θ) are both increasing in θ when this constraint

binds. To prove that if βR = 1, then w(θ) is non-decreasing over time, we use the envelope

condition −V 0 (U ) = λ.Plugging this into the first order conditions for w(θ) and W (θ) and

using βR = 1 gives



      u0 (w(θ))/u0 (w̄0 ) = βR ≥ 1



where w̄0 and F (K 0 ) are next period’s values of these variables. Hence w̄0 ≥ w(θ), which gives

our result.

         Note that this proposition implies that performance bonuses paid in one period are

incorporated into the manager’s base pay in future periods.


Remark 1. Because there is complete resolution of uncertainty at the end of each period, it is

straightforward to extend the model to allow for persistence in the idiosyncratic productivity

shock.


         To be concrete, assume that the production shock follows a Markov process, and

therefore the c.d.f. P (θ; θ−1 ) and p.d.f. p(θ; θ−1 ) are conditional on the prior periods shock

θ−1 . This time dependence in the shock would mean that the return to the outside investors

and the elements of the eﬃcient contract would be functions of both the ex-ante promised

utility U and the prior period’s shock θ−1 .

7. Capital structure in the dynamic model
       In this section, we discuss two issues that arise in interpreting an eﬃcient contract

in our model as a theory of the capital structure of the firm and the compensation of the

firm’s manager. The first of these issues concerns our model’s implications for the optimal

debt-equity ratio of the firm. We show here that while our model does have implications for

the payments to debt and equity holders, it does not pin down the debt-equity ratio of the

firm. The second of these issues concerns the interpretation of the monitoring of the firm by

outside investors as bankruptcy.

       Our dynamic model delivers a theory of the division of the gross payments out of

an ongoing firm between holders of the firm’s debt, outside equity, and the firm’s manager.

This division of gross payments is not suﬃcient, however, to pin down the relative value of

the firm’s debt and equity. This is because our model does not pin down whether it is the

debt holders or the outside equity holders who pay for the investments K in future periods.

This issue is not new to our model and can arise in any financial contract in which there are

multiple flows out of the firm.

       We illustrate this problem with the following simple example. Imagine that an entre-

preneur has created a project that can be operated for 2 periods in which an investment of 1

at the beginning of each period produces an output of 2 at the end of each period. Assume

that this entrepreneur sells this project to outside investors after having made the initial in-

vestment at the beginning of period 1 and that there is no discounting, so that the total value

of this project is equal to 3 units of output (2 units of output in period 1 plus two more units

in period 2 less 1 unit of investment in period 2). Hence, it is clear in a competitive capital

market, the outside investors must pay the entrepreneur 3 units of output at the beginning

                                              29
of period 1 to purchase this project. What is to be determined is the division of this value

between outside investors who hold debt and outside investors who hold equity. Imagine

further that a theory such has ours has yielded the implication that, each period, the gross

output of 2 is divided equally between debt and equity holders, so 1 unit is paid to the debt

holders and 1 unit is paid to the equity holders. As the following examples make clear, the

division of the value of this firm between debt and equity is not pinned down under these

assumptions, despite the fact that the division of the gross payments to the outside investors

is pinned down.

       To see this, assume first that the firm is financed with a combination of short-term

debt and equity. In particular, assume that short-term debt holders lend one unit at the

beginning of each period and are repaid that one unit at the end of each period. In period 1,

the equity holders pay 2 units to the entrepreneur to purchase the project and the remainder

of the purchase is financed with the first issuance of 1 unit of short-term debt. The equity

holders in this case receive a dividend of one unit each period in exchange for their investment

while the investment of 1 unit required at the beginning of the second period is financed by

a second issuance of short-term debt at the beginning of period 2. Under these assumptions,

in the first period, after the initial investment of 1 unit has been made, the value of the debt

is 1 unit and the value of the equity is 2 units.

       Next assume that the investment of one unit in the firm at the beginning of the second

period is financed by the outside equity holders (through retained earnings) while the debt

is long-term debt. In this case, to purchase this project, one group of outside investors puts

forward 2 units of output in exchange for a long-term debt claim that pays 1 unit at the

end of each of the two periods while another group of outside investors puts forward 1 unit

                                               30
of output in exchange for an equity stake that pays no dividend in the first period and a

dividend of 1 unit at the end of the second period. The three units of output raised in this

way are used to purchase the project from the entrepreneur. Under this financing scheme,

the firm’s debt is worth 2 units and the firm’s equity is worth 1 unit.

       As this simple example makes clear, under diﬀerent assumptions about the division of

responsibility for ongoing investments in the firm, one obtains diﬀerent implications for the

debt-equity ratio of the firm. We conjecture that this issue will arise in any well-specified

“trade-oﬀ” theory of optimal capital structure.

       In interpreting our eﬃcient contract as a theory of capital structure, we associate

monitoring with bankruptcy. Monitoring in our model occurs whenever the current gross

output of the firm fall below a threshold θ∗ F (K) determined by the optimal contract. In our

one-period version of the model, in the event that θ ≤ θ∗ , monitoring occurred, all of the

remaining value of the firm was paid to debt-holders and the outside equity holders received

nothing. In this sense, in the one-period model, monitoring corresponds to a stylized notion

of bankruptcy. In a multi-period version of our model, the division of the value of the firm

between debt and equity holders in the event of monitoring is not so stark. In the event that

θ ≤ θ∗ , monitoring occurs, but the firm still has a value to the outside investors as an ongoing

concern (denoted by the continuation value V (W (θ))). In the event that this continuation

value exceeds the face value of the debt, then the equity holders emerge from this episode

of bankruptcy with shares that still have positive value. In this sense, monitoring in the

dynamic model does not necessarily correspond to the liquidation of the firm. Of course, the

same is true of bankruptcy in the data.



                                               31
8. Retention and Golden Parachutes
       We now extend our dynamic model to include a decision whether to retain the man-

ager. This decision is contingent on the realization of an observable shock that aﬀects the

productivity of the incumbent manager in running the firm. Outside investors have an in-

centive to retain incumbent managers with high productivity and replace those with low

productivity. We show that a golden parachute type payment to an incumbent manager who

becomes unproductive and is fired is part of the optimal compensation scheme.

       To extend the model, we assume that each period, the incumbent manager who has

been running the project experiences a shock η ∈ {0, 1} at the beginning of the period to

his productivity with this project, so that the project’s output is given by ηθF (K). This

shock η is observable to all parties. This shock follows a Markov process in which η = 0 is

an absorbing state and the probability that η = 1 in the current period given that η = 1

in the previous period is given by ρ. As we show below, along the equilibrium path, the

outside investors choose to continue with the incumbent manager if η = 1 and they hire a

new manager if η = 0. Hence, in what follows we suppress reference to η where there is no

risk of confusion.

       With this alteration to our model, we need to include additional terms in the contract

between the outside investors and the manager. In particular, we need to include a payment

from the outside investors make to the incumbent manager in the event that he is not retained

as well as notation for the cost to the outside investors of hiring a new manager. Let Ṽ (wF )

denote the indirect lifetime utility of the incumbent manager in the event that he is not

retained and paid wF . We assume that Ṽ (0) ≤ U0 , that is that an incumbent manager

who has been fired with no severance pay gets no more than the reservation utility of an

                                              32
unemployed manager.

        Since our results characterizing an eﬃcient contract in proposition 4 carry over here,

we can express the problem of choosing the optimal contract as one of choosing contract

terms w(θ), θ∗ , K, W (θ) ≥ U0 together with the payment that a manager receives if he is

not retained wF so as to maximize the objective




                          ¡       ¢
       V (U) = max         V0 − wF (1 − ρ) + ρV R (U R )
                wF ,U R




subject to the promise-keeping constraint



       ρU R + (1 − ρ)Ṽ (wF ) = U.                                                       (26)



Here V R is notation for the value of retaining the incumbent manager when that manager

receives continuation utility U R conditional on being retained. The function V R (U R ) is

defined by


                           Z ½                         ¾
   R       R                                 1

       Z
           [u(w(θ)) + βW (θ)] p(θ)dθ = U R                                               (28)




                                                  33
and the dynamic no-perks constraint



      u (w(θ)) + βW (θ) ≥ u (τ (θ − θ∗ ) F (K)) + βU0 .                                      (29)



The term V0 denotes the value to the outside investors of hiring a new manager (with η = 1

and U = U0 ) and is defined as the solution to the problem of choosing w0 (θ), θ0∗ , K0 , W0 (θ) ≥

U0 to maximize


           Z ½                              ¾
                                 1
      V0 =    θF (K0 ) − w0 (θ) + V (W0 (θ)) p(θ)dθ − γF (K0 )P (θ0∗ ) − rK0                 (30)

          [u(w0 (θ)) + βW0 (θ)] p(θ)dθ = U0                                                  (31)



and the constraint (29).

       In the next proposition, we establish the optimality of a golden parachute payment to

incumbent managers who have become unproductive.


Proposition 6. In the event that η = 0, then the manager’s pay satisfies Ṽ 0 (w0 ) = u0 (w̄).


       Proof: Let λ be the Lagrangian multiplier on the constraint (26). From the first

order conditions for wF and U R we have



      1 = −V R0 (U R )Ṽ 0 (wF ).




                                               34
The envelope condition from the problem defining V R (U R ) we get that V R0 (U R ) = −1/u0 (w̄),

hence



        u0 (w̄) = Ṽ 0 (wF ),



where w̄ is the base pay to the manager if he is retained.

         This proposition implies that the optimal golden parachute payment to an incumbent

manager who has been unproductive should be large enough to allow him to maintain the

living standard that was guaranteed in his base pay. The optimal size of this golden parachute

payment will be larger, then, the more limited the outside options of the manager in the event

that he is not retained.


9. Comparative Statics

         We now consider how the terms of the optimal contract for financing the firm depend

on the parameters τ, U0 , and γ governing the severity of the agency problem and the costs

of monitoring the output of the firm. We focus on the one-period contracting problem. In

general, these comparative statics depend on the parameters of the manger’s utility, the

distribution of shocks θ, and the production function F. We present analytic results here

under the assumption that the manager’s utility is CRRA, the distribution of shocks θ is

uniform, and the optimal choice of capital K is fixed. With K fixed, the contract terms that

vary are base pay w̄, the set of states θ < θ∗ for which monitoring occurs, and the set of states




                                               35
θ > θ̄ for which the manager receives a performance bonus. These contract terms maximize

Proposition 7. Assume that u(c) = (c1−φ − 1)/(1 − φ), θ is uniformly distributed, and

F (K) = min {K, 1} . If w̄ and θ∗ are an interior solution of the problem (32) and the optimal

choice of K is fixed at 1, then


  1. monitoring θ∗ and the bonus cutoﬀ θ̄ are increasing in the perks parameter τ. The eﬀect

       on base pay w̄ is ambiguous.

  2. base pay w̄ is increasing and monitoring θ∗ and the bonus cutoﬀ θ̄ are decreasing in the

       reservation utility U0

  3. base pay w̄ is increasing and monitoring θ∗ and the bonus cutoﬀ θ̄ are increasing in the

       monitoring cost γ


         Proof: We proof this proposition by diﬀerentiating the first order conditions deter-

mining the optimal choice of contract terms. We use (34) to substitute out for w̄ in (32) and

First observe that with θ uniform p0 (θ∗ ) = 0 and with CRRA preferences, u00 (θ − θ∗ ) is

increasing in θ. Hence the term multiplying dθ∗ in (37)

and with K and parameters τ and γ fixed, (35) defines implicitly a function θ1∗ (θ̄) with slope

everywhere strictly greater than 1. Likewise, with K and parameters τ and γ fixed, (36)

defines implicitly a function θ2∗ (θ̄) with positive slope everywhere strictly less than 1. Since

any interior solution of (35) and (36) is found at an intersection of θ1∗ (θ̄) and θ2∗ (θ̄), any such

solution is unique.

       We now solve for the comparative statics by analyzing how shifts in the parameters

τ, γ, and c0 shift the implicit functions θ1∗ (θ̄) and θ2∗ (θ̄). Observe that because the slope of

θ1∗ (θ̄) is everywhere greater than the slope of θ2∗ (θ̄) which in turn is greater than zero, a shift in

parameters that raises the function θ1∗ (θ̄) and leaves θ2∗ (θ̄) unchanged lowers the equilibrium

θ∗ and θ̄. Moreover, the equilibrium θ̄ falls by more than the equilibrium θ∗ . Likewise, a shift

in parameters that raises θ2∗ (θ̄) and leaves θ1∗ (θ̄) unchanged raises the equilibrium θ∗ and θ̄

and the increase in θ∗ is larger than the increase in θ̄.

       The comparative statics are the derived as follows. From (37) we see that an increase

in τ lowers θ1∗ (θ̄), while from (38) we that that an increase in τ raises θ2∗ (θ̄). The fall in θ1∗ (θ̄)

by itself raises θ∗ and θ̄, with the implied increase in θ̄ larger than the increase in θ∗ . The

increase in θ2∗ (θ̄) by itself also raises θ∗ and θ̄, but now the implied increase in θ∗ is larger

than the implied increase in θ̄. Hence we get that an increase in τ increases both θ̄ and θ∗ ,

with the net eﬀect on base pay w̄ = τ (θ̄ − θ∗ ) depending on parameters.


                                                      38
          An increase in the manager’s reservation utility U0 , or equivalently an increase in c0 ,

only aﬀects (36) and hence θ2∗ (θ̄). From (38), we see that an increase in c0 lowers θ2∗ (θ̄), leading

to a fall in θ∗ and θ̄, with the fall in θ̄ being smaller than the fall in θ∗ . Hence, base pay w̄

rises.

          An increase in the monitoring cost γ only aﬀects (35) and hence θ1∗ (θ̄). From (37) we

see that an increase in γ lowers θ1∗ (θ̄) and hence raises θ∗ and θ̄, with the increase in θ̄ being

larger than the increase in θ∗ . Hence base pay w̄ rises. Q.E.D.

          In this proposition, we have assumed that the optimal choice of capital is fixed. In

general, we cannot obtain analytic comparative statics when capital is variable because the

relationship between changes in θ∗ , θ̄, and K depends on parameters. This is easiest to

see if we assume that preferences are logarithmic, so the first order condition determining

the optimal capital stock K reduces to (15). Each of the comparative static exercises we

considered above resulted in either an increase in both θ∗ and θ̄ or a decrease in both θ∗ and

θ̄. From (15), however, we see that the impact on the optimal choice of K from an increase in

both θ∗ and θ̄ is ambiguous – increasing θ∗ increases the probability of costly monitoring and

hence reduces the optimal choice of K while increasing θ̄ improves risk sharing between the

manager and the outside investors and hence increases the optimal choice of K. If we assumed

that the manager was risk neutral, so that there was no problem of risk sharing between the

outside investors and the manager, it would be easy to show that if the manager’s reservation

utility c0 were high enough so that


                  Z   ∞
         c0 > τ           θp(θ)dθF (K ∗ )
                  0




                                                 39
where K ∗ is defined by F 0 (K ∗ ) = r, then the optimal contract is fully eﬃcient with no

monitoring and the terms of the contract do not change with marginal changes in τ, γ, and

c0 . In contrast, when


               Z    ∞
      c0 > τ            θp(θ)dθF (K ∗ ),
                0




the optimal choice for base pay w̄ is zero, so that θ̄ = θ∗ , and the optimal choices of θ∗ and

K solve the first order conditions


                Z   ∞
      τ F (K)           (θ − θ∗ ) p(θ)dθ = c0
                   θ∗




      [1 − γP (θ∗ )] F 0 (K) = r.


Under this assumption of risk neutrality, an increase in τ results in an increase in θ∗ and a

decrease in K, an increase in c0 results in a decrease in θ∗ and an increase in K, while an

increase in γ leads to a decrease in θ∗ and a decrease in K.
