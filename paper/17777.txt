                                           ABSTRACT

We document that the percentage of all U.S. assets that are “safe” has remained stable at about 33
percent since 1952. This stable ratio is a rare example of calm in a rapidly changing financial world.
Over the same time period, the ratio of U.S. assets to GDP has increased by a factor of 2.5, and the
main supplier of safe financial debt has shifted from commercial banks to the “shadow banking system.”
We analyze this pattern of stylized facts and offer some tentative conclusions about the composition
of the safe-asset share and its role within the overall economy.

   Over the past sixty years, the total amount of assets in the United States economy has

exploded, growing from approximately four times GDP in 1952 to more than ten times GDP at

the end of 2010. Yet within this rapid increase in total assets lies a remarkable fact: the

percentage of all assets that can be considered “safe” has remained very stable over time.

Specifically, the percentage of all assets represented by the sum of U.S. government debt and by

the safe component of private financial debt, which we call the “safe-asset share”, has remained

close to 33 percent in every year since 1952. In this paper, we document the stability of the safe-

asset share, analyze its composition and dynamics, and briefly examine some of the policy

implications of our results.

   The dynamics of the safe-asset share are important for economists, policymakers, and

regulators to understand because “safe” debt plays a major role in facilitating trade. Gary Gorton

and George Pennacchi (1990) argue that the main purpose of financial intermediaries is to

produce “safe” debt, with bank deposits as the quintessential example. Most financial-sector

debt has the primary feature that it is information-insensitive, that is, it is immune to adverse

selection in trading because agents have no desire to acquire private information about the

current health of the issuer (see Tri Vi Dang, Gorton, and Bengt Holmström (2010)). Treasuries,

Agencies, and other forms of highly-rated government debt also have this feature. To the extent

that debt is information-insensitive, it can be used efficiently as collateral in financial

transactions, a role in finance that is analogous to the role of money in commerce. Thus,

information-insensitive or “safe” debt is socially valuable. Importantly, the stability of the safe-

asset share implies that the demand for information-insensitive debt has been relatively constant

as a fraction of the total assets in the economy. Given the rapid amount of change within the

economy over the past sixty years, the relatively constant demand for safe debt suggests an
                                                                                              2


underlying transactions technology that is not well understood. Thus, we view this paper as part

of a larger research agenda aimed at understanding the role of financial-sector debt within the

economy.

   While the safe-asset share has remained constant, the components of the safe-asset share

have changed dramatically over time. Historically, Treasuries and bank deposits constituted the

vast majority of safe debt. Over the past thirty years, however, an entirely new segment of the

financial sector known as the “shadow banking sector” has emerged which produces a material

fraction of the safe debt in the economy. The shadow banking sector has largely escaped (and

continues to escape) the attention of regulators and policymakers, much to the chagrin of many

participants in the economy. However, the constancy of the safe asset share implies that

regulators and policymakers should tread carefully when considering any new regulations or

legislation that would potentially limit the production function of the financial sector. If the

demand for information-insensitive debt is constant, attempts to regulate the shadow banking

sector too onerously may simply push the creation of safe debt to other sectors of the economy,

where it would (presumably) be produced less efficiently. Likewise, attempts to impose

additional regulation on the traditional banking sector may backfire by pushing more of the

production of safe debt into the shadow banking sector. In short, regulators and policymakers

must adroitly balance the need to improve financial stability with the simultaneous need to

maintain enough liquid, safe debt in the economy to meet the demand for such debt. This

requires a better understanding of the drivers of the demand for safe debt, which we believe

should be an important area of research interest in future years.

   I.      The Growth of Assets

   Moritz Schularick and Alan Taylor (2012) gathered data on the banking-sector assets of 14

major economies since 1870. They found that the ratio of such assets to GDP was relatively

stable until World War 2, but subsequently rose sharply. They label this post-war period the

“second financial era”, and contrast this increasing ratio with the relatively stable long-run

relationship between money and GDP throughout the entire period. Data availability constraints

restricted Schularick and Taylor (2012) to focus on the commercial banking sector. However,

data availability in the United States allows for broader coverage of the entire financial sector.

Figure 1 plots the growth of overall assets, financial-sector assets, and equity as a ratio of GDP.

The data show that overall assets rise from about four times GDP in 1952 to ten times GDP in

2010. Financial-sector assets represented a large part of this overall growth, rising from about

one times GDP in 1952 to more than four times GDP in 2010. In total, the assets of the financial

sector have risen from about 25 percent of the assets in the economy in 1952 to about 40 percent

of the assets in the economy by the end of 2010. Thus, assets in the economy have grown

rapidly over the past 60 years, with much of this increase coming from the financial sector.

   Interestingly, Figure 1 also shows that the (equity) capital to GDP ratio has remained

relatively constant over the past 60 years, consistent with the stylized fact first popularized by

Nicholas Kaldor (1957). This suggests that most of the growth in assets over the past 60 years

has been financed through debt rather than equity. In other words, Figure 1 shows that while the

efficiency in which the economy converts capital into output has remained constant, the amount

of capital needed to produce a dollar of assets has fallen considerably over the past sixty years.

Thus, the growth of assets has been primarily fueled by higher leverage in the economy.

   II. The Stability of the Safe-Asset Share

   While the assets of the financial sector and the economy as a whole have rapidly grown, the

fraction of “safe” assets in the economy has remained relatively constant. In this section, we

document the stability of the safe-asset share. Our definition of “safe” assets includes assets that

are either directly or indirectly used in an information-insensitive fashion, i.e. as money. The

key components of “safe” debt include bank deposits, money market mutual fund shares,

commercial paper, federal funds and repurchase agreements (“repo”), short-term interbank loans,

Treasuries, agency debt, municipal bonds, securitized debt, and high-grade financial-sector

corporate debt. The latter five categories of debt are commonly used as collateral in repo

transactions and the asset-backed commercial paper market, and prior to the financial crisis, repo

lenders did not demand excess collateral (“haircuts”) from borrowers when these assets were
                                                                                                    5


deposited as collateral. Hence, at least until the crisis, these assets were information-insensitive

(Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick (2012)). From the list above, it is clear that most forms of

safe debt are issued by the government and the financial sector. While an argument can be made

that certain types of non-financial corporate debt are “safe” according to the definition above, the

size of the market for this debt is very small relative to the size of the other markets in question.

Thus, we restrict our attention to safe, information-insensitive debt issued by the government and

the financial sector.

    We compute the fraction of safe debt in the economy using data from the Federal Reserve’s

Flow of Funds database. We begin by examining the total liabilities of the government and the

financial sector, as well as the total liabilities and equity in all sectors (which approximates total

assets). We then make a number of adjustments to arrive at a calculation for the amount of safe

debt in the economy. First, we remove U.S. government securities held by federal retirement

programs and loans from the federal government to states from both government liabilities and

total assets, since these essentially represent intra-governmental loans. We also move non-MBS

agency debt from the financial liabilities category into the government liabilities category, since

“plain” agency debt is effectively no different than Treasuries. Next, we remove taxes payable,

mortgages taken out by REITs, mutual fund shares, life insurance reserves, and pension fund

reserves from the Fed’s computation of financial liabilities, as these liabilities do not represent

information-insensitive security offerings by financial-sector participants. We also assume that

only 85% of MBS, ABS, and other forms of long-term debt issued by the financial sector are

considered information-insensitive, and therefore safe enough to use in financial transactions.

Likewise, we remove life insurance reserves and retiree health care funds from the computation

of “safe” government liabilities, as these liabilities are not information-insensitive. After making
                                                                                                     6


the adjustments listed above, we then compute a “high” and “low” estimate of the amount of safe

debt in the economy. Our high estimate of safe debt encompasses all remaining government and

financial-sector liabilities, which are largely comprised of Treasuries, municipal bonds, short-

term and long-term corporate debt, securitized debt, and other miscellaneous liabilities. Our low

estimate excludes miscellaneous financial liabilities, loans, a number of accounts involving

payables, and other liabilities that are not routinely traded. The Appendix posted on the AER

web site provides more detail on what items are included in both of our scenarios.

   Figure 2 shows that in the post-war period, the fraction of total “safe” liabilities to total assets

in the economy hovers in a tight band between approximately 30-35%. Thus, to the extent that

the demand for information-insensitive securities equates with supply, the figure suggests that

the demand for such securities has been relatively constant over this period. However, we also
                                                                                                   7


wish to stress that a number of the components of safe debt in Figure 2 are likely measured with

error. Hence, until better data becomes available, our results should be mostly viewed as

suggestive.

   To examine the demand for safe debt more closely, we regress the ratio of (Financial +

Government Liabilities)/Total Assets against a time trend using quarterly data from 1952-2011.

Panel A of Table 1 shows that the ratio of financial and government liabilities to total assets has

remained fairly constant over the past 60 years at around 33% under our high estimate of safe

debt and 31% under our low estimate of safe debt. While the time trend variable in Table 1 is

statistically significant, its economic significance is marginal: over 239 quarters, the total

predicted decrease in the ratio is only 1.5% under the high estimate and 5% under the low

estimate. Figure 2 also suggests that government debt and bank debt may be substitutes; as

government debt decreases as a fraction of total assets, debt issued by financial intermediaries

tends to increase, and vice versa. To examine this possibility in more detail, we regress the

fraction of private financial liabilities in the economy against the fraction of government

liabilities in the economy. Consistent with the view that financial liabilities and government

liabilities are substitutes, Panel B of Table 1 shows that the coefficients on government liabilities

are strongly negative.

   These results suggest that financial liabilities and government liabilities may be substitutes.

However, since both financial and government liabilities appear in the denominator on both

sides, it may be possible to obtain the results in Panel B through a mechanical relationship. To

analyze this possibility, we simulated 10,000 regressions identical to the regressions in Table 1

for our high estimate of safe debt using Monte Carlo methods. Specifically, for each of the

10,000 iterations, we constructed eight new time series (there are eight major series in the Fed
                                                                                                                              8


data) by growing each series’ initial value based on random shocks that were drawn from a

normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation of the series’ growth rate over our

sample period. We then computed the variables shown in Table 1 from our simulated data and

estimated the regressions reported in Table 1.

     If the coefficients in Table 1 were the result of a mechanical relationship, we would expect

the coefficients in Table 1 to lie roughly in the middle of our simulated coefficients. However,

fewer than 7% of our 10,000 simulated regressions from Panel A produced point estimates

smaller than our reported coefficient. Thus, the simulations suggest that the constancy of the

safe-asset share is not simply an artifact of the ratio computations. In contrast, approximately

30% of our simulated regressions produced point estimates smaller than the coefficient reported

in Panel B of our table, leaving some combination of chance and the mechanical relationship as a

possible explanation for our results in Panel B. However, additional evidence in support of the

substitutability of financial and government debt is provided by Arvind Krishnamurthy and

Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2010), who find, for example, that the spread between second-tier

commercial paper and first-tier commercial paper falls when the supply of Treasuries expands,

suggesting that top-tier commercial paper is a substitute for Treasuries. Robin Greenwood,
                                                                                                 9


Samuel G. Hanson and Jeremy C. Stein (2010) also provide evidence that short-term financial-

sector debt and government debt are substitutes. Neither of these papers examines longer-term

financial-sector obligations that may be used as collateral for repo or other forms of short-term

debt. Hence, to our knowledge, our findings on safe debt are novel.

   III. Safe Financial-Sector Debt: A Closer Look

   The classic form of safe financial debt is bank deposits. But while bank deposits comprised

the vast majority of safe financial debt before 1980, the share of deposits has dropped by more

than one half from its peak. Figure 3 plots the details. In the figure, “money-like debt” refers to

commercial paper, net repurchase agreements, federal funds, money market mutual fund assets,

interbank transactions, broker-dealer payables, and broker-dealer security credits. More details

are provided in the Appendix.

   The figure shows that bank deposits were near 80 percent of the total through the 1950s and

1960s, and remained as high as 70 percent as late as 1978. This percentage then began a steep

30-year decline, with the rise of money market mutual funds, broker-deal commercial paper,

securitized debt from GSEs, and other asset-backed securities. On the eve of the financial crisis,

the share of bank deposits had fallen to 27 percent. At the end of 2010, it stood at a little less

than 32 percent.

   Taken together, Figures 1, 2, and 3 provide a picture of calm stability (Figure 2) amidst rapid

change (Figures 1 and 3). While the financial system has grown rapidly relative to overall

economic activity, the system itself seems anchored to a constant share of safe, information-

insensitive debt. At the same time, a variety of changes in the financial sector has moved the

production of this debt from their traditional source in bank deposits to newer sources in the

shadow banking sector.

   IV. Discussion

   The recent financial crisis dramatically revealed that the U.S. financial system has changed

significantly over the last sixty years. The traditional concepts of a “bank” and of “money” are

no longer adequate to describe the world in which we live. In the past thirty years, the shadow

banking system has grown enormously. Furthermore, the ratio of total assets to GDP has grown

by a factor of 2.5 since 1952. Yet despite these significant changes, the safe-asset share has
                                                                                                 11


remained constant. This constancy is not by chance and suggests an underlying transactions

technology. The production of total assets appears to require safe debt as an input. Little is

known about this transactions technology.

   Figure 2 suggests that the demand for safe or information-insensitive debt exceeds the supply

of U.S. Treasuries outstanding. The private sector can produce substitutes for government debt

in the form of short-term instruments or long-term debt securities that can be used as collateral or

as safe stores of value. Consistent with the rise of the shadow banking system, the main

producers of safe debt are not commercial banks, whose share of private safe debt has been

shrinking. Of course, the government could attempt to completely satiate the demand for safe

debt by issuing more Treasuries. In such a world, there would be no need for “safe” private

financial-sector debt outside of banking deposits. However, recent developments in sovereign

debt markets suggest that even governments cannot issue too much debt without such debt

becoming information-sensitive. Thus, if the demand for safe assets cannot be met in whole by

the government, near-riskless debt issued by the financial sector plays an important role in

facilitating trade. This makes the “safe” debt provided by the financial sector socially valuable.

   These findings are important for banking regulatory policy. The traditional banking system

is no longer the central actor in the production of safe debt. Small policy changes with regard to

this sector may well drive activity further into the shadow banking sector. Furthermore, since

the demand for safe assets is roughly constant, attempts to squelch the shadow banking sector

would simply push the production of safe debt into another, less efficient sector.

   A more striking conclusion is that despite the size and importance of the financial system, we

currently know very little about the demand for and supply of “safe” debt. While we hope that

our work is a start in the right direction, our paper raises a number of important questions. Why
                                                                                            12


is the safe-asset share constant? Did the demand for safe assets play a role in the rise of the

shadow banking system? What is the underlying transactions technology that relates the safe-

asset share to the rest of the economy? We hope that these and other questions regarding safe

debt will be addressed through future research.

Other notes:
1) In both scenarios, “Government-sponsored enterprises; other GSE issues; liability” was moved from
   Financial to Government liabilities.
2) In Figure 3, “MBS/ABS Debt” includes all GSE and private-label MBS debt, as well as all ABS debt.
   “Corporate Bonds and Loans” includes "Financial business; corporate and foreign bonds; liability",
   "Private nonbank financial institutions; bank loans not elsewhere classified; liability", and "Financial
   business; other loans and advances; liability."
3) Series labeled with the term “asset” above represent series in which assets = liabilities. Hence, we are
   actually measuring liabilities. This accounting mechanism comes directly from the Flow of Funds.
