Socioeconomic Differences in the Adoption of New Medical Technologies

                                          ABSTRACT

New medical technologies hold tremendous promise for improving population health, but they

also raise concerns about exacerbating already large differences in health by socioeconomic

status (SES). If effective treatments are more rapidly adopted by the better educated, SES health

disparities may initially expand even though the health of those in all groups eventually

improves. Hypertension provides a useful case study. It is an important risk factor for developing

cardiovascular disease, the condition is relatively common, and there are large differences in

rates of hypertension by education. This paper examines the short and long-term diffusion of two

important classes of anti-hypertensives - ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers - over the

last twenty-five years. Using three prominent medical surveys, we find no evidence that the

diffusion of these drugs into medical practice favored one education group relative to another.

The findings suggest that - at least for hypertension - SES differences in the adoption of new

medical technologies are not an important reason for the SES health gradient.

     New medical technologies hold tremendous promise for improving population health, but

they also raise concerns about exacerbating already large differences in health by socioeconomic

status (SES) (James P. Smith, 1999). In prior work, we found that better self-management of

disease by the more educated was a critical factor in maintaining the SES health gradient for two

distinct diseases—diabetes and HIV (Dana Goldman and James P. Smith, 2002). For these

diseases—both characterized by the introduction of new effective treatment technologies—

differences by education in patient adherence to prescribed treatment explained a significant

component of the health gradient.

     The impact of a new technology on health disparities depends not only on how difficult it is

to adhere, but also on who actually receives the treatment. If effective technologies are more

rapidly adopted by the better educated, SES health disparities may initially expand even though

the health of those in the lowest SES groups eventually improves.

     Hypertension provides a useful example. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease

and a relatively common condition—in 2002, 21% of those 18 and older had the disease, and the

prevalence grows rapidly with age (over 50% among those 65 and over). There also is a gradient

with schooling—29% prevalence among those with less than a high school diploma compared to

only 19% for those with a bachelor’s degree or more.1 Before the introduction of effective

drugs, the recommended treatment consisted of some combination of exercise and diet,

particularly to reduce excessive weight and salt. But as a consequence of positive results from

clinical trials, starting in the early 1970s, a sequence of very effective drug treatments has been

introduced.

       In this paper, we examine the short and long-term diffusion of anti-hypertensive therapy

and how that diffusion varies by a key SES marker—education. Our investigation begins with




                                                  1
the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), which has contributed much of the epidemiological

knowledge about cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. Initiated in 1948, the FHS enrolled

5,209 white men and women aged 28 to 62 from Framingham, Massachusetts. Framingham is

well suited to our analysis as it begins with a cohort free of cardiovascular disease in 1948 and

follows them for over 50 years, tracking their health status with biennial medical examinations.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are measured three times at each examination, and a

physician performs a comprehensive medical examination. Patients are also asked to list all

medications they are taking with the list of medications changing over time as new drugs enter

the market.2 As the original cohort progressed, many FHS participants developed hypertension

and initiated drug treatment.

       Table 1 documents patterns of diffusion of anti-hypertensive therapies among diagnosed

hypertensives in FHS, including diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE

inhibitors. In 1978, less than half of FHS hypertensives were taking any drug at all and virtually

all these drugs were in the diuretic class. Clinical evidence was first provided for the efficacy of

diuretics in the late 1960'
                          s and early 1970'
                                          s.

       The data in Table 1 inform us that the use of drugs to treat hypertension has grown

rapidly over these sixteen years and is no doubt a key factor contributing to the substantial

decline in heart disease risk and mortality. This expansion partly reflects the increased use of

existing drugs, but also the adoption of a series of new drug innovations hitting the market.

Following FDA approval for hypertension in 1976, beta-blockers were introduced into

widespread clinical practice; by 1978, 10% of the Framingham hypertensives were using the

drug. Usage rate doubled over the next four years and plateaued around 30% by the late 1980s.

FHS first asked about calcium channel blockers in 1982, but their use received a big boost when




                                                  2
they were recommended by a national panel of experts in 1988 as an option for first line therapy

(JNC IV, 1988). Finally, ACE inhibitors first appear in the FHS in 1986 and were quickly

adopted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These last two drugs in particular appear to both

expand overall drug use but also to substitute to some extent for older antihypertensives.

       Our principal question concerns the relative speed of adoption of these new drug

therapies of people with different education levels. These patterns are described in Table 2. Is it

the case that more educated patients adopt new drugs at a more rapid rate? The two most

interesting drugs for our purposes are calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, since we

can observe the full adoption paths. For neither of them do there appear to be any systematic

differences by schooling in the speed of adoption.

       As a more formal test, using the FHS we estimated linear regression models for the use of

each drug where the covariates included age, gender, marital status, the education classes used in

Table 2, mean cholesterol levels in the exam, blood sugar level, whether the person was obese or

overweight, and a quadratic time trend. This quadratic time trend was interacted with the

education dummies to see if the speed of diffusion varied by schooling level. The p-values for

the F tests for differences across education groups were 0.87 (ACE inhibitors), 0.37 (calcium

channel blockers), 0.38 (beta-blockers), 0.04 (diuretics), and 0.39 (taking any drug). The only

statistically significant effect was obtained for diuretics, and in that case the least educated were

more likely to be taking the drug.

       Framingham may be unique for several reasons. It is a closed, aging cohort that

represents one relatively homogenous New England town (for example no racial minorities).

Moreover, doctors rather than patients may drive the adoption process, and doctors in this mid-

size town may have simply recommended the same drug therapy regimen to all their patients




                                                  3
regardless of their education. Even though a relationship of SES and adoption may not exist in

Framingham or any other specific place, an aggregate relation could emerge if communities

whose average SES levels are higher than average adopt new medical technologies more quickly

(perhaps due to the type of doctors who work there).

       To test this hypothesis, we turn to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey

(NAMCS), a nationally representative study of ambulatory care in physicians’ offices. Each

year 3,000 physicians are randomly selected to provide data on approximately 30 patient visits

over a 1-week period. Data are obtained on patients'symptoms, physicians'diagnoses, and

medications ordered or provided. Since there is no information on individual patients’ SES, we

use area-specific mean education to detect whether adoption was faster in high SES locales.

Geography is coarse in NAMCS so we are limited to the four census regions and within regions

to whether it is a MSA or not. Since drug data are only available starting in 1980 and we want to

track the full diffusion, we focus on calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors used by

diagnosed hypertensives.

       Figures 1.a and 1.b plot the diffusion of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors for

the four census regions. For both drugs, there exists a remarkable similarity in the speed of

adoption across geography. To provide a more formal test, we estimated a model predicting the

use of each drug by year on a quadratic time trend and region-urban dummies with interactions

of that quadratic with each of the eight sub-regions (the four Census regions subdivided into its

MSA and non-MSA components). The p values for the F-tests of no statistically significant

differences in trends across these sub-regions was p=0.57 for calcium channel blockers and

p=0.11 for ACE inhibitors. Subject to the broad level of geographic aggregation forced by




                                                 4
available data, we find no evidence of any relationship between the area specific levels of

education and the speed of diffusion of hypertensive drugs.

       Finally, we turn our attention to a nationally representative sample of hypertensives from

the third wave of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) fielded

between 1988 and 1994. NHANES III contains data obtained through personal interviews and

physical exams for 33,994 people two months and older. Information is available on the

prevalence of a wide variety of illnesses including hypertension, specific types of drugs taken,

and individual characteristics including age, gender, race, marital status, household income and

education. Besides the four Census regions and an urban rural distinction within each region, one

can identify 35 separate large counties. For each of these 43 identified areas, we computed mean

education levels of those 25-64 years old from the 1990 Census and matched it to the NHANES

III files. Although individual years cannot be identified, the data are separated into two

nationally representative phrases (1988-1991 and 1991-1994).

       We estimated models predicting the use of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors

for people with hypertension. These models included measures of the demographic variables

listed above, health co-morbidities (serum cholesterol, serum glucose, diabetes, arthritis,

bronchitis, asthma, cancer, and heart disease) and health behaviors (smoking). For our purpose,

the critical variables are household income and individual education (classified as not a high

school graduate, high school grad, and more than high school). Household income was never

statistically significant, and the p-values for the F-tests for education were 0.65 for channel beta-

blockers and 0.45 for ACE inhibitors. The results for these SES variables did not change if we

limited the sample to those hypertensives taking medication or to the first phase of NHANES III

(spanning 1988 to 1991 only). These models also included mean level of education in the




                                                  5
identifiable areas. In no case was area-specific, mean education levels related to the adoption of

any of the drugs, providing additional evidence that a relationship between education and

adoption emerges as more educated areas adopted more quickly.


Conclusions

       The reasons for the very large difference in health outcomes by several measures of SES

are being vigorously debated anew within and outside economics (Smith, 2005). In this paper,

we investigated one possible reason for the health gradient—that novel and effective medical

technologies are adopted more quickly by those with higher SES, giving them at least a

temporary advantage in improved health. We test this hypothesis by examining the introduction

of new drugs to treat hypertension, of which there have been several important examples over the

last twenty-five years. However, using three prominent medical surveys we find no evidence that

the diffusion of these drugs into medical treatment favored one education group relative to

another. This suggests that at least for hypertension, a key risk factor for heart disease, the SES

differences in the adoption of new medical technologies are not an important reason for the SES

health gradient.

    There are several caveats to our conclusions. We have only analyzed a single medical

condition, one where the short-term medical risks are not great, the recommended drug therapies

not particularly expensive, and where the therapeutic efficacy of some of the new drug

innovations has been questioned ex post. Whether our findings reported here extend to other

diseases, especially those that are more severe and/or more expensive to treat so that people with

higher incomes may have an extra advantage, must await additional research by others and us.
