                        Managers, Investors, and Crises:
                   Mutual Fund Strategies in Emerging Markets




I. Introduction

        Financial crisis in 1997 engulfed not only Asia, it spread to countries as distant as
South Africa, the Czech Republic, and Brazil. To understand why, a literature has
developed that examines why the spreading of crisis might be due to financial links. There
is evidence that banks, for example, were important in spreading the 1997 crisis. The
transmission channel was lending: countries were exposed to the same banks (Kaminsky
and Reinhart 1999). Portfolio investors have also been scrutinized, particularly
institutions, such as hedge funds, pension funds, and mutual funds (Brown et al. 1998,
Eichengreen and Mathieson 1998, Kim and Wei 1999, Frankel and Schmukler 1998,
among many others). A common conclusion is that institutions sometimes panic,
disregarding fundamentals, and spreading crisis even to countries with strong
fundamentals. The literature notes that individuals, too, can contribute to this panic by
fleeing from funds—particularly mutual funds—forcing fund managers to sell when
fundamentals do not warrant selling.
        This paper contributes to this literature on financial links by examining the trading
strategies of an important class of investor: U.S. mutual funds. Surprisingly, systematic
analysis of mutual funds’ international strategies does not yet exist.1 Consequently, our
results are of more general interest than our crisis motivation might suggest. At the same
time, the lack of systematic analysis of funds’ behavior during crises warrants special
attention. Though there is some evidence that funds help crisis to spread, that evidence is
indirect and highly aggregative. Frankel and Schmukler (1998), for example, use closed-
end mutual funds to show that the Mexican crisis in 1994 was not transmitted to Asia
directly, but indirectly, via New York, where the funds are traded. The opposite view—

 Funds’ domestic (U.S.) strategies have been analyzed extensively, however. See Grinblatt et al. (1995),
Warther (1995), and Wermers (1999), among others.



                                                   1
that funds do not spread crisis—also has some support in aggregate data. For example, net
redemption by mutual-fund investors during crisis periods is not large, and outflows that
occur tend to be small and short-lived (at least during Mexico’s crisis—see Marcis et al.
1995 and Rea 1996). Froot et al. (1998) present a similar picture based on aggregated
flows that mix mutual funds with other types of international investor. They find that net
inflows during the Mexican and Asian crises decreased, but there is little evidence of net
outflows.2
        Our paper departs from the more aggregated analysis above by effecting analysis at
the portfolio level. We develop a novel data set that includes individual portfolios, which
allows us to examine trading strategies at much higher resolution. The data include the
quarterly holdings of 13 mutual funds from April 1993 to January 1999. All 13 funds are
dedicated Latin America funds. (At year-end 1998, there were 25 Latin America funds;
the 13 we track account for 88% of the value of these 25 funds.) We use these data to
address two sets of questions. The first set relates to whether funds engage in momentum
trading—systematically buying winning stocks and selling losing stocks (Jegadeesh and
Titman 1993, Grinblatt et al. 1995). The second set of questions relates to whether funds
engage in contagion trading, by which we mean systematically selling stocks from one
country when stock prices are falling in another. In addressing this second set of
questions, we establish a first, direct empirical link between contagion and trading
strategies.
        The methodological contribution of the paper is our approach to attributing actions
to fund managers versus underlying investors. Despite a vast literature on the behavior of
domestic (i.e., U.S.) funds, to our knowledge we are the first to disentangle the two. In
effect, the trades of mutual funds reflect both institutional and individual decisions. To
understand those trades, particularly in the international context, ensuring that the
decisions are not commingled is an important step.


2
  Though a lovely data set, the Froot el al. (1998) data do not include transactions settled in foreign
currencies, e.g., ADR trades in New York and Brady bonds. These trades can be especially important in
times of crisis when local-market liquidity is at a minimum. For Latin American countries, the
importance of these trades extends to non-crisis periods as well—for many stocks, more trading occurs in
New York as ADRs than on the local market. Our fund-portfolio data include all trades.



                                                   2
       Our results show that emerging-market funds do indeed engage in momentum
trading. Their strategies exhibit positive momentum—they systematically buy winners and
sell losers. This is due to momentum trading at both the fund-manager level and the
investor   level   (through   redemptions/inflows).   We   further   distinguish   between
contemporaneous momentum trading (buying current winners and selling current losers)
and lagged momentum trading (buying past winners and selling past losers).
Contemporaneous momentum trading is stronger during crises, and stronger for fund
investors than for fund managers. Lagged momentum trading, on the other hand, is
stronger during non-crisis periods, and stronger for managers. We also find that funds
engage in contagion trading, by which we mean that they systematically sell assets from
one country when asset prices fall in another. This contagion trading is due primarily to
underlying investors, not managers.
       The paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines our approach to
measuring momentum trading and contagion trading. Section III describes our data.
Section IV presents our momentum and contagion results. Section V addresses whether
return autocorrelation within Latin America can rationalize our section-IV results. Section
VI concludes. The appendix provides some related regression-based analysis.


II. Strategies: Momentum Trading and Contagion Trading


       This section presents our approach to testing whether funds employ momentum
and contagion trading strategies. Momentum trading—also called positive feedback
trading—is the systematic purchase of stocks that have performed well, and sale of stocks
that have performed poorly (“winners” and “losers”). Contagion trading is the selling of
assets from one country when asset prices are falling in another. Contagion trading is thus
a cross-country phenomenon, in contrast to momentum trading, which is a within-country
phenomenon. (This type of cross-country analysis is not possible using recent single-
country data sets, such as those of Kim and Wei 1999 and Choe, Kho, and Stulz 1999.)
       First, we review the existing finance literature on momentum trading. Second, we
present our approach to testing for momentum trading, an approach that draws from this



                                            3
earlier literature. Then we turn to contagion trading, presenting first a brief review of the
“contagion” literature, followed by our approach to testing for contagion trading. The
approach we adopt in testing for contagion trading is in the same spirit as our test for
momentum trading.


II.1. Introduction to Momentum Trading
         The literature on momentum trading includes two lines of work, one based in asset
pricing and the other based in international finance. The asset-pricing line begins with the
finding that a strategy of buying past winners and selling past losers generates significant
positive returns over 3- to 12-month holding periods (Jegadeesh and Titman 1993, Asness
et al. 1997, Rouwenhorst 1998).3 Once established, this result inspired work on whether
investors actually follow momentum trading strategies. Grinblatt et al. (1995), for
example, examine the domestic strategies of U.S. mutual funds and find that they do
systematically buy past winners. They do not systematically sell past losers, however. They
also find that funds using momentum trading strategies realize significantly better
performance. Evaluation of performance is a central theme for all the papers in this asset-
pricing line of the literature.
         The second line of work on momentum trading is based in international finance. Its
organizing theme is the link between returns and international capital flows. At the center
of this literature is the positive contemporaneous correlation between capital inflows and
returns. Early work establishes this correlation using data aggregated over both time and
types of market participant (Tesar and Werner 1994, Bohn and Tesar 1996). Later work
relaxes the aggregation over time to address whether the contemporaneous correlation in
quarterly data is truly contemporaneous (Froot et al. 1998, Choe et al. 1999, Kim and Wei
1999). Higher frequency data can distinguish three possibilities. Returns may precede


3
  The return “continuations” that are implied by this result are not inconsistent with the return “reversals”
documented elsewhere in the literature. Horizon length is the key to understanding this: continuations
appear at mid-range horizons, 3 to 12 months. Return reversals, in contrast, appear at short horizons (up
to 1 month, see Jegadeesh 1990 and Lehmann 1990) and at long horizons (3 to 5 years, see De Bondt and
Thaler 1985). Reversals call for “contrarian” (or negative feedback) trading strategies. Parenthetically, all
these time-series anomalies are distinct from the cross-sectional anomalies that have received much
attention in the asset-pricing literature recently (e.g., size and book-to-market effects).



                                                     4
flows, indicating positive feedback trading (which is not necessarily irrational, per the
asset-pricing literature noted above). Returns and flows may be truly contemporaneous,
indicating that order flow itself may be driving prices.4 And returns may lag flows,
indicating flows’ ability to predict returns. Using high-frequency data aggregated across
types of market participant, Froot et al. (1998) find evidence of all three, with the first—
positive feedback trading—being the most important for explaining quarterly correlation.
Choe et al. (1999) and Kim and Wei (1999) use high-frequency data from Korea to
examine positive feedback trading around the 1997 currency crisis. Choe et al. find that
foreign investors as a group engage in positive feedback trading before the crisis, but
during the crisis feedback trading mostly disappears. Kim and Wei examine foreign
institutional investors separately and find that they engage in positive feedback trading at
all times—before, during, and after the crisis.
        Our analysis is related to, and borrows from, both the international-finance and
asset-pricing lines of the literature. Like the work in international finance, we are more
concerned about international flows and crisis transmission than portfolio performance.
Like work in asset pricing, however, we maintain a direct link to investment strategy and
its measurement. In particular, we focus on a specific class of international investor—
mutual funds. A benefit of focusing on a specific investor class is that we can characterize
the evolution of actual portfolios, and how that evolution relates to returns in various
countries. Another benefit is that our data allow us to analyze jointly the behavior of fund
managers and their underlying investors. On the cost side, focusing on funds as a specific
investor class means that we lose resolution in terms of data frequency: our data are
quarterly.




4
  Microstructure finance provides three channels for truly contemporaneous price impact. The first is
information—if the buyer has superior information about a security’s payoffs, then the purchase signals
that information, shifting expectations, and thereby increasing price. The second is incomplete risk-
sharing at the marketmaker level—the buyer’s purchase temporarily disturbs the marketmaker’s position,
which requires the buyer to pay compensation in the form of a higher price (so-called “inventory effects”).
The third is imperfect substitutability—the buyer’s purchase may be a large enough portfolio shift relative
to the market as a whole that permanently higher price is required to clear the market (even if it is
common knowledge that the buyer does not have superior information about the security’s payoffs).

II.2. Measuring Momentum Trading
        Our momentum-trading measure is akin to that used to analyze funds’ domestic
strategies (e.g., Grinblatt et al. 1995). The measure captures the relation between security
transactions and returns. It is based on the mean of individual observations of the
variable:5
                                                Qi , j ,t − Qi , j ,t −1 
                                  M i , j ,t =                            R j ,t − k ,              (1)
                                                         Q               
                                                           i , j , t     


where Qi,j,t is the holding by fund i of stock j (in shares) at time t, Q i, j, t is (Qi,j,t+Qi,j,t-1)/2,

and Rj,t-k is the return on stock j from t-k-1 to t-k. When k=0, this measure captures the
contemporaneous relation between trades and returns—referred to as lag-zero momentum
trading (L0M). When k=1, the measure captures the lagged response of trades to returns,
and is referred to as lag-one momentum trading (L1M). Parenthetically, notice the
implication of the j subscript: the mean of Mi,j,t measures the intensity of momentum
trading at the level of individual stocks. Testing the null of no momentum trading is a test
of whether the mean of Mi,j,t over all i, j, and t is zero.
        This measure of momentum trading has two important advantages. First, it is not
contaminated by “passive price momentum.” Passive price momentum arises in momentum
trading measures—like those of Grinblatt et al.—where the term in brackets is a change in
portfolio weight, rather than a percentage quantity adjustment. When using a portfolio
weight, a price increase in one stock (relative to prices of other holdings) produces a
positive relation between weights and returns that has nothing to do with trading strategy.
(A similar positive relation arises for losing stocks.) The second advantage of our measure
over one based on portfolio weights is that our measure is not contaminated by another
passive effect— “passive quantity momentum.” When using portfolio weights, a large
trade in one stock can have substantial effects on the weights of holdings that involve no

5
  This mean estimate does not value-weight the individual stock positions. This could make a difference if
the intensity of momentum trading differs depending on position value. After calculating it both ways, we
did not find any qualitative difference in the results.



                                                           6
transactions. Our main concern here—as in the rest of the international-finance-based
literature on momentum trading—is the relation between returns and transaction flows.6
Accordingly, we want our realizations of Mi,j,t to reflect actual transactions—the buying
and selling of winners and losers.


Separating Manager and Investor Momentum Trading
         An important issue in the context of mutual-fund strategies is the effect of net
redemptions. Many funds experience substantial redemptions during crisis periods. If, on
average, funds sell shares to meet redemptions when Rj,t-k is negative, then our momentum
trading measures will be positive. This result is not spurious. But it does reflect strategies
of underlying investors, rather than strategies of the fund manager.
         We control for this redemption effect by measuring the quantity transacted in each
stock relative to a fund-specific benchmark. This benchmark reflects the quantity that
would be transacted if a fund’s net flows from investors produced proportional adjustment
in all stocks. Specifically, to isolate the manager’s contribution to momentum trading we
calculate individual observations of:

where Pj,t is the price of security j at time t, and Pj, t is (Pj,t+Pj,t-1)/2. The second term in

brackets is a term that is fund-specific, i.e., for a given fund i and time t, it is invariant
across stocks j. It captures the percent increase in portfolio size due to net inflows. Here,
we use the notation j∈i to denote all those stocks j held by fund i. The overall momentum
trading measure in equation (2) therefore reflects the degree to which the manager of fund
i buys winners and sells losers beyond any average quantity adjustment due to fund

  This contrasts with the asset-pricing-based literature on momentum, whose main concern is portfolio
performance, in which case it is necessary to consider the return impact of all portfolio positions. Note too




                                                                 7
inflows/outflows. To understand why, note that the numerator of the second term in
brackets is the change in portfolio value due to inflows/outflows—using the Pj, t term

factors out capital gains/losses—and the denominator is the average portfolio value. (As
with our first momentum trading measure M i, j, t , when k=0 M ′i, j, t captures the

contemporaneous relation between trades and returns—L0M—and when k=1 M ′i, j, t

captures the lagged response of trades to returns—L1M). Under the null hypothesis of no
momentum trading at the manager level, the mean of the observations M ′i, j, t is zero.

        We can also examine the investor-level term in isolation. That is, we can calculate
individual observations of

Henceforth, we refer to momentum trading statistics calculated from equations (1)-(3) as
whole-fund, manager-only, and investor-only momentum, respectively.


A Second Investor-Level Measure
        Before moving on, it is important to recognize what our investor-only measure is
capturing, and what it is not capturing. What our investor-only measure does capture is
investor effects on our whole-fund measure; that is, the sum of the investor-only and
manager-only measures equals the whole-fund measure. (This is not quite true in our
reported results because we omit some outlier observations for robustness, as described
below in section IV.) Though this investor-only measure is certainly an object of interest,
it does not recognize that investors’ decisions are made at the level of the fund, not at the
level of individual stocks. (Manager decisions, in contrast, are made at the level of
individual stocks). To capture this, we also estimate an investor-only measure at the fund
level. Specifically, we estimate the mean of the statistic:


that emerging-market funds are subject to large and rapid redemptions which, depending on liquidity in
specific markets, can produce significant passive quantity momentum.



                                                                8

                                             j∈i
                                                   i , j ,t   − Qi , j ,t −1 ) Pj ,t
                                M i′′,′t =                                             Ri , t − k       (4)

where Ri,t-k is the change in fund i’s Net Asset Value (NAV) in period t-k. Clearly, this
reduces the number of observations—we lose the stock dimension—but it better
corresponds to the decision that investors actually face.


Conditional Momentum Trading
        In addition to the momentum measures L0M and L1M, we are also interested in
conditional momentum trading. Specifically, we split our sample into sub-periods: crisis
and non-crisis. The crisis portion of our full sample (April 1993 to January 1999) includes
four sub-periods: December 1994 to June 1995 (Mexico), July 1997 to March 1998
(Asia), August 1998 to October 1998 (Russia), and January 1999 (Brazil).7


Statistical Inference
        Several inference issues deserve further attention. First, the percentage quantity
changes—the term in brackets in equations (1) through (4)—may have fund-specific
volatilities. Two factors could account for differing volatilities at the fund level. Factor
one is the considerable cross-sectional difference in fund size—size can affect trading
strategies. Factor two is fund differences that are distinct from size, such as turnover
ratios, redemption penalties, and other factors. Below, we test for heteroskedasticity
across funds i, and after finding it, we correct for it.8


7
  We also examined a second conditional momentum measure by splitting our sample into buys and sells
(as in Grinblatt et al. 1995). Buying past winners and selling past losers need not be symmetric. We
found, however, that our results were extremely sensitive to the specification of expected returns, an
adjustment that is necessary when splitting buys from sells (see Grinblatt et al., page 1091). We do not
report those results due to their fragility.
8
  Because our heteroskedasticity correction affects only standard errors, each observation of Mi,j,t gets
equal weight in the calculation of a momentum measure’s mean. Our correction for heteroskedasticity
therefore does not alter the fact that funds with more observations have more effective weight. Regrettably,
we have little statistical power to explore whether funds differ appreciably in the intensity of their


                                                              9
        While the first inference issue pertained to heterogeneity across funds, a second
inference issue pertains to dependence across observations within funds. Specifically,
individual observations of our various momentum trading statistics, Mi,j,t, are unlikely to
be independent across stocks within a given fund. Our mean estimate should account for
this cross-stock, within-fund correlation. Our estimates of the mean cluster observations
within funds, and allow the weights assigned to individual observations to vary with the
covariance structure.
        A third inference issue that warrants attention is the possibility that our momentum
trading measures might be biased due to high return volatility, which is clearly a feature of
our crisis-ridden sample (see Forbes and Rigobon 1998). In fact, we are not exposed to
this bias under our null, because under our null the statistics we report in Tables 1-5 are
equal to zero. In this case the bias is not problematic.9



II.3. Introduction to Contagion

        The financial crises of the 1990s in Europe, Mexico, Asia, Russia, and Brazil
spread rapidly across countries, including countries with diverse market fundamentals.10
These events spawned a literature to make sense of the seeming “contagion.” The term
contagion is used quite differently by different authors, however, so let us be more
specific. From the outset, however, it was clear that authors use that term quite


momentum trading. As for heteroskedasticity in the time-series dimension, our sample partition into crisis
and non-crisis periods accounts for the most obvious correction.

9
  Under the alternative hypothesis of non-zero measures, however, precise statistical comparisons across
crisis and non-crisis sub-samples would require adjustments for the volatility-specific nature of the sample
split. This type of comparison is not central to our paper. Nevertheless, we did re-estimate our main
comparative results with a Forbes-Rigobon correction (in this case, a correction to estimated covariance,
rather than correlation), and found no qualitative change in the results. (Note, too, that the regression
results we report in the appendix are not subject to this potential bias.)
10
   Witness Indonesia in 1997. Nobody can disagree that there were signs of weakness in the Indonesian
economy at the outset of the Asian crisis: the banking sector was fragile, the economy was not growing,
and there was a current account deficit. Still, these problems were not insurmountable. Kaminsky (1998),
for example, estimates that the probabilities of crisis in Indonesia by June 1997 amounted to only 20
percent. This probability stands in sharp contrast to the likelihood of a currency crisis in Thailand, which
skyrocketed to 100 percent at the beginning of 1997. Still, the Indonesian rupiah collapsed only weeks
after the floating of the Thai baht.



                                                    10
differently. Presently, the literature on contagion identifies three types: fundamental-
spillover contagion, common-cause contagion, and non-fundamental contagion.
Fundamental-spillover contagion occurs when an inside disturbance is rapidly transmitted
to multiple, economically interdependent countries. Common-cause contagion occurs
when an outside disturbance is rapidly transmitted to multiple countries (e.g., a fall in
commodity prices, or learning about common fundamental factors). Fundamental
disturbances underlie both of these first two types. The third type—non-fundamental
contagion—can stem from any kind of disturbance; the defining characteristic is that the
rapid transmission to multiple countries is beyond what is warranted by fundamentals (i.e.,
controlling for fundamentals cannot account for it). This third type is sometimes referred
to as pure or true contagion.
          Many authors focus on the first two types of contagion, those driven by
fundamentals. For example, Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996) examine whether
contagion is more prevalent among countries with either important trade links or similar
market fundamentals. In the first case, devaluation in one country reduces competitiveness
in partner-countries, prompting devaluations to restore competitiveness (fundamental-
spillover contagion). In the second case, devaluation acts like a wake-up call: investors
seeing one country collapsing learn about the fragility of “similar” countries, and speculate
against those countries’ currencies (common-cause contagion). The Eichengreen et al.
evidence points in the direction of trade links rather than similar fundamentals. Corsetti et
al. (1998) also claim that trade links drive the strong spillovers during the Asian crisis.
Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) focus instead on financial-sector links. In particular, they
examine the role of common bank lenders and the effect of cross-market hedging (a type
of common-cause contagion). They find that common lenders were central to the
spreading of the Asian crisis (as they were to the spreading of the Debt Crisis of the
1980s).
          The non-fundamental category of contagion has attracted more attention than the
two fundamentals-driven categories. Theoretical work on non-fundamental contagion
focuses on rational herding. For example, in the model of Calvo and Mendoza (1998), the
costs of gathering country-specific information induce rational investors to follow the



                                             11
herd. In the model of Calvo (1999), uninformed investors replicate selling by liquidity-
squeezed informed investors because the uninformed mistakenly (but rationally) believe
these sales are signaling worsening fundamentals. Kodres and Pritsker (1999) focus on
investors who engage in cross-market hedging of macroeconomic risks. In that paper,
international market comovement can occur in the absence of any relevant information,
and even in the absence of direct common factors across countries. For example, a
negative shock to one country can lead informed investors to sell that country’s assets and
buy assets of another country, increasing their exposure to the idiosyncratic factor of the
second country. Investors then hedge this new position by selling the assets of a third
country, completing the chain of contagion from the first country to the third.
       The literature on non-fundamental contagion also has an empirical branch.
Kaminsky and Schmukler (1999) find that spillover effects unrelated to market
fundamentals are quite common, and spread quickly across countries within a region.
Valdes (1998) examines the degree to which comovement of Brady-bond prices is
unexplained by fundamentals. Interestingly, contagion in his paper is symmetric, applying
both on the downside during crises and on the upside during periods of rapid capital
inflow. A different line of empirical work on non-fundamental contagion examines
whether crises are spread by particular investor groups. For example, Choe, Kho, and
Stulz (1998) use transaction data in the Korean equity market to examine whether foreign
investors destabilize prices. They find evidence of herding by foreign investors before
Korea’s economic crisis in late 1997, but these effects disappear during the peak of the
crisis, and there is no evidence of destabilization. Since their data include only transactions
on the Korean Stock Exchange, these authors cannot examine the transmission of crisis
across countries.


II.4. Measuring Contagion Trading

       Our approach to testing for contagion is different from the literature reviewed
above. Data on individual portfolios allow us to address contagion in a new way—from
the trading-strategy perspective. We will use the term contagion trading to mean the



                                              12
systematic selling (buying) of stocks in one country when the stock market falls (rises) in
another.11
        To do this we introduce a new measure—a contagion trading measure. Our
contagion trading measure is based on the methodology outlined above for measuring
momentum trading. Like the momentum measures, we present contagion trading measures
at three different levels: whole-fund contagion trading (C), manager-only contagion
trading (C'), and investor-only contagion trading (C''). These three measures are the
sample averages of the variables:

        Instead of testing for a relation between quantity changes and own-stock returns,
our contagion trading measure tests for a relation between quantity changes and foreign-
country equity returns. In effect, we are testing for what might be called “cross-country
momentum trading.” Here, Rf,t is the return on the foreign-country index f from t-1 to t.
For each of the three measures above (C, C', and C''), we consider five different contagion


11
   Notice that this definition does not take account of the fundamental-versus-non-fundamental distinction
introduced above. The appendix introduces a regression-based approach that allows us to test for
contagion with controls for various fundamental factors.




                                                                          13
trading measures, each one constructed from a different foreign equity index. Those
foreign equity indexes include Brazil, Mexico, Asia, Russia, and the U.S. Naturally, when
calculating the contagion trading measure when f=Brazil, we do not include observations
where stock j is from Brazil (similarly for Mexico). Under the null hypothesis of no
contagion trading, the mean of the observations Ci,j,t is zero.
        Our contagion trading measure in equations (5)-(7) allows us to address many of
the issues we address with our momentum trading measure. For example, we examine
crisis versus non-crisis sub-samples, and we partition the crisis sub-sample further to
isolate the effects of particular crises. We do not offer a contagion-trading analogue to
equation (4)—investor-only at the fund level—only because the results we shall find for
that measure are, in the end, similar to the investor-only results from equation (7).


III. Data


        Our data on mutual-fund holdings come from two sources. The first source is the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Mutual funds are required to report
holdings to the SEC twice a year. The second source is Morningstar. Morningstar
conducts surveys of mutual fund holdings at a higher frequency: quarterly surveys are the
norm for most funds. For our purposes, quarterly data are available from Morningstar for
about 50% of the funds we examine. In those instances where our measure of Mi,j,t is
based on portfolio holdings that are not measured three months apart, these observations
of ∆Qi,j,t are multiplied by 3/x, where x is the number of months between Qi,j,t and Qi,j,t-1.
        Our sample includes the holdings of 13 Latin America equity funds (open-end)
from April 1993 to January 1999 (24 quarters). Those funds are (1) Fidelity Latin
America, (2) Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Institutional Latin America, (3) Van Kampen
Latin America (formerly Morgan Stanley), (4) BT Investment Latin America Equity, (5)
TCW Galileo Latin America Equity, (6) TCW/Dean Witter Latin America Growth, (7)
Excelsior Latin America, (8) Govett Latin America, (9) Ivy South America, (10) Scudder
Latin America, (11) T. Rowe Price Latin America, (12) Merrill Lynch Latin America, and




                                               14
(13) Templeton Latin America. Not all of these funds existed from the beginning of our
sample; on average we have about 10 quarters of data (out of a possible 24) per fund.
        Our third source of data is Bloomberg and the International Finance Corporation
(IFC). Bloomberg provides monthly price series for all equities held by the 13 funds,
including ADRs. (The need for monthly price data arises in our analysis of lag-one
momentum trading.) These price series are corrected for splits and dividends. The IFC
provides information on stock market indexes, which we need for our contagion trading
analysis. Our contagion trading analysis uses the IFC Latin America Stock Market index,
the IFC Asia Stock Market index, and several IFC country stock market indexes. The U.S.
equity return is the S&P 500 return. All return data are expressed in percent.


IV. Results: Momentum and Contagion Trading


        We present our results in four parts. First, we present aggregate evidence on the
trades of mutual funds in times of crisis. Then, we present results on within-country
momentum trading (equations 1-4). We follow these with cross-country contagion trading
results (equations 5-7). In the appendix, we also present some regression-based results
relating momentum and contagion trading with other determinants of trading strategy.


IV.1. Aggregate Evidence on our Sample of Funds During Crisis
        Though our data set does include individual portfolios, let us first consider
evidence based on the aggregation of those portfolios. We focus this aggregate evidence
on funds’ experience with investor inflows and outflows. During the fourth quarter of
1997—the peak of the Asian crisis—Latin American funds suffered large outflows (Figure
1).12 The reversal from inflows to outflows during the Asian and Russian crises is more
severe than that during the Mexican crisis in December 1994. In the Mexican crisis, funds
tended to pull out of Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, all of which are relatively liquid;


12
   Net selling in Figure 1 is calculated as the change in number of shares—as a percentage of average
shares held during the quarter—valued at the beginning-of-quarter price. The average shares held during
the quarter is the mean of the beginning- and end-of-quarter holdings.



                                                  15
funds tended not to pull out from more illiquid markets, such as Colombia. Moreover, the
Mexico-induced pullout was temporary—by the third quarter of 1995 fund inflows to
Latin America had resumed (consistent with the findings of Marcis et al. 1995 and Rea
1996). Relative to the Mexican crisis, the Asian and Russian crises of 1997 and 1998 were
more broad-based and persistent. In those crises the retreat from Latin America was more
indiscriminate, with heavy sales reaching even the most illiquid markets. On average, net
sales in 1998 were about 32 percent. This result differs from that of Froot et al. (1998),
who find little evidence of net outflows during the Asian crisis. A possible explanation is
that the aggregated data used by Froot et al. include institution types that counteract the
clear net selling by mutual funds (hedge funds?). Another possible explanation is that the
Froot el al. data do not include transactions settled in dollars, euros, or yen, e.g., ADR
trades in New York and dollar denominated bonds. This is very important in Latin
America. Our data set includes all these trades.
         One technique available to managers is using “cash” (e.g., liquid money-market
instruments such as U.S. Treasury bills) to buffer their portfolios from redemptions.
Holding cash allows managers to meet redemptions without the need to sell less-liquid
assets. In principle, this can mute the effect of investor outflows on the underlying stocks.
However, managers can also reinforce investors’ actions if they increase their liquid
positions in times of investor retrenchment. For our whole sample, funds kept an average
of 4.4 percent of their net asset value in cash. We then split our sample into two sub-
samples, one where on average these funds received inflows, and one where on average
these funds suffered outflows. In the inflows sub-sample we find an average cash position
of 4.6 percent, whereas in the outflow sample we find an average cash position of 4.3
percent. Average cash positions are remarkably stable. Managers’ choice of cash position
does not appear to either mute or reinforce investor actions.13



13
   A natural question is whether these cash positions are stable because managers face some kind of
constraint. The reality is that funds are far less constrained than our cash-holding results might indicate in
any de jure sense. De facto, however, managers are sensitive about departing too much from their
benchmarks. The classic example is the hapless manager at Fidelity’s Magellan Fund in the late 90s who
felt that the stock market was over-valued, switched heavily into cash, watched the market rise further,
and was fired for the decision.


                                                     16
IV.2. Momentum Trading Results
        In our full sample, we find strong evidence of lag-zero momentum trading at all
three levels: whole-fund, manager-only, and investor-only (Table 1, column 1).
Interestingly, contemporaneous momentum trading is especially strong during crises. In
terms of attribution, it is investors that account for the lion’s share of the
contemporaneous momentum trading at the whole-fund level. Significant lag-one
momentum trading is present only in the non-crisis portion of our sample, and it is
concentrated at the manager level.14 For robustness, we estimate each cell based only on
observations of Mi,j,t within three standard deviations of its mean. This is the reason why,
within any column of Table 1, the manager-only and investor-only estimates do not sum to
the whole-fund estimate exactly.15
        To interpret the size of the coefficients, consider the whole-fund L0M estimate of
2.36. Given the units of our data, an L0M estimate of 2.5 implies that on average the
product of (∆Qi,j,t/ Q i,j,t) and Rj,t over a quarter is 2.5 percent (a representative example
would be a return of –10% and a position reduction of 0.25, or 2.5%).16
        Table 2 presents estimates of our investor-only measure at the fund level, rather
than at the stock level as in Table 1. Recall that this fund-level variant of the investor-only
measure recognizes that investors’ decisions are made at the level of the fund, not at the
level of individual stocks. Despite fewer observations from losing the stock dimension, our
results are sharpened in terms of statistical significance, though the overall pattern remains
the same. The only notable change in the pattern is the significance of L1M at the investor
leve: it is now significant at the 1 percent level, whereas it was insignificant in Table 1.
        Table 3 presents momentum trading measures for three crisis-period sub-samples:


14
   In our estimation, L1M always relates the transacted quantities between t-1 and t with the return over
the month preceding t-1. Increasing the length of the period over which lagged returns are measured
diminishes explanatory power, in general.
15
   Using all observations tends to increase both point estimates and t-statistics.
16
   Returns are measured in percent. The quantity-adjustment term in momentum is untransformed (e.g.,
the 0.25 in the example). Note that the quantity-adjustment term uses the average quantity in the
denominator, so that the position reduction in our parenthetical example is only approximate. Note too
that our L1M measures below are based on monthly returns, not quarterly returns as in our L0M
measures, so their size is correspondingly smaller.



                                                   17
the Mexican Crisis (December 1994 to June 1995), the Asian Crisis (July 1997 to March
1998), and the Russian Crisis (August 1998 to October 1998). The interesting question
here is whether momentum trading is equally strong across different crises. The answer is
no. Within our Latin American sample, we find that positive momentum trading was
strongest during the 1994 Mexican Crisis.


IV.3. Contagion Trading Results
       Tables 4 and 5 present our contagion trading results. Table 4 presents the all-
sample results, as well as the crisis versus non-crisis sub-samples. Table 5 splits the crisis
sub-sample further into the Mexican, Asian, and Russian crises. In Table 4, we find more
significance at the investor level than at the manager level. Thus, investors clearly engage
in contagion trading, but managers are less apt. Of the five different return benchmarks
(Brazil, Mexico, Asia, Russia, and the U.S.), Russia clearly has the strongest effects—
funds are systematically buying Latin American equities when Russia’s returns are high,
and vice versa. This is especially true during the Russian Crisis, which squares with
informal accounts of the extraordinarily intense contagion at that time. Even during the
Russian Crisis, however, fund managers remained cool-headed: there is no evidence they
engaged in contagion trading. The contemporaneous relation with U.S. equity returns is
the only one of the five return benchmarks that is concentrated at the manager level. It is
also the only significant effect that is negative. This negative LOC statistic for the U.S.
return implies that fund managers systematically buy Latin American equities when U.S.
returns are low (controlling for fund inflows/redemptions). Though past work has shown
clear links between emerging-market returns and U.S. interest rates, this is the first
evidence of which we are aware that links actual portfolio shifts to U.S. equity returns.
       Table 5 focuses on contagion trading during three specific crises: the Mexican, the
Asian, and the Russian. The reaction of investors to Russian equity returns during the
Russian crisis was particularly strong: investors systematically sold Latin American
equities when Russian equity returns were low. Note, though, that this link to Russia is
not operative at the manager level. In the case of the Mexican crisis, the effect is smaller,
but still significant, and there is some evidence that managers were involved in that case.



                                             18
In the case of the Asian crisis, there is no discernable link to the trading of Latin American
equities. The last three columns show the link to U.S. market returns during each of these
three crises. Given the proximity to Mexico, and the importance of economic links
between the two countries, it is not surprising that the link between Latin-American
portfolios and U.S. returns is strongest during the Mexican crisis. Interestingly, the
contagion trading statistic is negative, and is significant at both the manager and investor
levels. This suggests that, during the Mexican crisis, managers and investors tended to sell
Latin American equities when U.S. returns were high, and vice versa. One interpretation is
that strong U.S. returns in the face of Mexico’s crisis bodes well for Mexican equities,
which induces a portfolio shift away from the rest of Latin America.
       In closing this section on contagion trading, it is worthwhile re-emphasizing the
qualitative difference between the results above and the existing contagion literature. The
difference is that we measure quantities, as well as prices, and address their joint behavior,
whereas much of the literature focuses on correlation in prices only.


V. Rationalizing Momentum Trading: Return Autocorrelation?
       In an environment with positively autocorrelated returns, momentum trading is a
natural response. The previous section presented evidence of positive L0M and, at least
during non-crisis periods, positive L1M. This raises the question of whether returns within
Latin America exhibit positive autocorrelation. One common way to test for return
autocorrelation is using variance ratios. If returns follow a random walk, then return
variance is a linear function of horizon length. That is, the variance of returns over k
periods is k times the variance of returns over one-period. If instead returns are positively
autocorrelated, the variance of k-period returns is larger than the sum of one-period
returns—variances grow faster than linearly. Thus, variance ratios larger than one are
consistent with rational positive momentum trading. Alternatively, when returns are
negatively autocorrelated, the variance of k-period returns is smaller than k times the
variance of one-period returns. Variance ratios smaller than one would call for negative
momentum (or contrarian) trading.




                                             19
           Table 6 reports the values of the variance-ratio test statistic at different horizons,
together with p-values, for seven Latin American countries. For comparison we also
provide results for the U.S. stock market.17 Interestingly, stock returns in several Latin
American markets are highly persistent (variance-ratio statistics larger than one), even at
three and four-year horizons. In contrast, U.S. returns show no persistence at any horizon.
Though certainly not proof that the positive momentum trading we find in Latin America
is rational—after all, this persistence in returns is at the index level—these results do point
to the possibility of rationalizing our momentum results, at least for some countries (e.g.,
Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela).
           It is important to note, however, that while positive autocorrelation is necessary
for rationalizing positive L1M, it is certainly not necessary for rationalizing positive L0M.
As noted in Section II.1, returns and trades may be truly contemporaneous if order flow
itself is driving prices. This is possible where fund transactions are “large” relative to
liquidity in the market (the imperfect substitutability channel noted in footnote 4), or when
fund managers’ trades are perceived as containing superior information.


VI. Conclusion
           Discriminating among the various ways that financial markets can spread crisis
requires a sharper picture of actual behavior. Who is doing the trading? What are their
trading strategies? In this paper we examine portfolios of an important class of
international investor—US mutual funds. We address two sets of questions. The first
relates to whether and when these funds engage in momentum trading—systematically
buying winning stocks and selling losing stocks. We find that international funds do
engage in momentum trading. Their trading exhibits positive momentum, due to
momentum at two levels: the fund manager level and the investor level (through
redemptions/inflows). Funds also engage in momentum trading in both crisis and non-
crisis periods. Contemporaneous momentum trading is stronger during crises, and stronger
for fund investors than for fund managers. Lagged momentum trading, on the other hand,
is stronger during non-crisis periods, and stronger for managers.

     See Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997) for the asymptotic distribution of the variance-ratio test.


                                                      20
       The second set of questions we address relates to funds’ use of contagion trading
strategies—selling assets from one country when asset prices fall in another. We find that
funds do engage in contagion trading. Per the appendix, this result is robust to controlling
for own-stock returns, the local-market factor, and the U.S.-market factor. Strictly
speaking, while these controls have a sound theoretical basis, they are not sufficient to
conclude that this contagion trading is non-fundamental (or pure) contagion trading. In
any event, we have uncovered several stylized facts that are useful for evaluating
hypotheses about the emerging-market crises and their transmission.
       Beyond these stylized facts, this paper includes several methodological
innovations. For example, the distinction between momentum trading at the manager and
investor levels is new to the literature, as is our method for distinguishing the two. Our
method of measuring contagion trading via transaction quantities is also new. Finally, our
regression-based approach to controlling for systematic return factors in measuring
momentum and contagion trading provides a valuable check on the bilateral measures’
robustness.
       An important question we have not addressed is, Who takes the other side of these
momentum and contagion trades? Someone certainly must. This question is, unfortunately,
beyond the feasible scope of our analysis. We can offer some parting thoughts however.
Consider for example the following question: If the model in our managers’ and investors’
heads is one of undershooting prices, followed by positively autocorrelated returns, then
must it be that their counter-parties believe the opposite model? No, this is not necessary.
The literature in microstructure finance—which we touch on in section II.1—provides
many models of liquidity providers who do not have opposite models or views, they
simply require compensation for providing liquidity in the form of transaction costs
(revenues from their perspective). It is also appropriate to keep in mind that, together, the
mutual funds we examine own only about 10 percent of the market capitalization of the
countries we consider. If they were a more substantial fraction, then finding counter-
parties for their trades would be much more difficult. Indeed, the premise that funds
respond to contemporaneous returns rather than causing them would be become rather
tenuous.



                                             21
                              Appendix: A Regression-Based Approach

         The bivariate relations examined via equations (1)-(7) draw from, and therefore
allow direct comparison with, past empirical work on momentum trading. But these
bivariate relations provide no means of testing joint significance. Is lag-one momentum
trading still significant after controlling for lag-zero momentum trading (i.e., after
controlling for contemporaneous price effects)? Is cross-country contagion trading still
significant after controlling for own-price effects via lag-zero and lag-one momentum
trading? Are these relations robust to including local-market index returns and the U.S.-
market index return?
         A regression-based approach provides a natural framework for addressing these
questions. At the whole-fund level, the questions of the previous paragraph can be
addressed by estimating:


         Qi , j ,t − Qi , j ,t −1 
                                   = α + β 1 R j ,t + β 2 R j ,t −1 + β 3 RLA,t + β 4 RLM ,t + β 5 RUS ,t + ε i , j ,t . (A1)
                  Q               
                    i , j , t     

Here, Rj,t and Rj,t-1 are own-stock returns, as before. These variables capture lag-zero and
lag-one momentum trading, respectively. The variable RLA,t is the contemporaneous return
on a Latin American equity index.18 This variable captures cross-country contagion
trading. The fourth variable, RLM,t, is the local-market index return. This variable does not
enter the analysis introduced in the previous sections, and is intended here as a control for
country-level systematic factors. The last variable, RUS,t, is the U.S.-market index return.
This variable also does not enter in the previous sections, and is intended here as a control
for systematic U.S. factors, which have well established effects on emerging equity
markets.




18
   We do not attempt to remove the own-country portion of the broader Latin American index. Note,
thought, that the own-country index is also in the regression, and our results are able to distinguish quite
sharply between them. In fact, the own-country index is never significant, so it is highly unlikely the
effects are confounded.

This follows the separation of the manager-only and investor-only levels in our analysis of
bivariate momentum and contagion trading.

Results
          Tables A1-A3 present OLS estimates of the models in equations (A1), (A2), and
(A3). At the whole-fund level (Table A1), the full sample generates significant positive
coefficients on all of the first three variables. Thus, momentum and contagion trading are
robust to moving from bivariate measures to multivariate measures, and including controls
for the overall local and U.S. markets. Interestingly, the local-market control is never
significant. The U.S.-market control, in contrast, is quite significant, and negative. This
squares with past empirical work showing that U.S. investors tend to chase emerging
markets when returns at home are low. When the sample is split into crisis and non-crisis
sub-periods, we find that contagion trading is largely a crisis-period phenomenon.
          Tables A2 and A3 present results for the manager-only and investor-only
regressions, respectively. At the manager level, we find significant positive momentum
trading (both lag zero and lag one), and significant contagion trading with respect to the
U.S. market, but no evidence of contagion trading with respect to other Latin American
markets (β3), except in times of crisis. Our investor-level results tell a distinctly different
story. Once we control for the local index return, we find that investors do not engage in



                                                        23
stock-specific momentum trading. This is not surprising: one would not expect investors
to respond to individual stocks, but to the market as a whole. They do respond strongly,
however, to the contemporaneous local-index return. And they also respond strongly
within the quarter to other Latin American markets per the significant positive coefficient
β3. Note, though, that these latter two effects are concentrated in the non-crisis periods.

         the number of shares is divided by the mean number of shares (at the beginning and end-of-period), changes can be greater than 100
         percent.

equation (1). Manager-Only momentum controls for investor redemption effects as in equation (2). Investor-Only momentum reflects only
investor redemption effects as in equation (3). All t-statistics are corrected for heteroskedasticity across funds. Full sample: quarterly data
from April 1993 to January 1999. The crisis portion of the sample is December 1994-June 1995, July 1997-March 1998, August 1998-
October 1998, and January 1999. The non-crisis portion is the rest of the sample. The total of roughly 4400 observations is 13 funds times
an average of about 35 stocks per fund, times an average of about 10 quarters of available data per fund. For robustness, results in each
cell are based only on observations within three standard deviations of the mean.

L0C denotes lag-0 contagion trading. Whole-Fund contagion tests whether the mean of (∆Qjt/ Q ijt )Rft is zero, where Rft is the return on foreign index f from t-1 to t, with f∈{Brazil, Mexico, Asia, Russia, U.S.},
per equation (4). Manager-Only contagion controls for investor redemption effects as in equation (5). Investor-Only contagion reflects only investor redemption effects as in equation (6). All t-statistics are
corrected for heteroskedasticity across funds. Full sample: April 1993 to January 1999. The crisis portion of the sample is December 1994-June 1995, July 1997-March 1998, August 1998-October 1998, and
January 1999. The non-crisis portion is the rest of the sample. Asia is the IFC Asia Stock Market Index. Note that Brazilian equities are excluded from the calculation of L0C for Brazil (similarly for Mexico).

P-values shown in parentheses for the null hypothesis that the variance ratio equals 1, where the numerator is the variance of k-month returns and the denominator is k times the variance of 1-month returns. If
returns follow a random walk (i.e., no return autocorrelation), then return variance is a linear function of horizon length: the variance of returns over k periods is k times the variance of returns over one-period.
If returns are positively autocorrelated, the variance of k-period returns is larger than the sum of one-period returns—variances grow faster than linearly. Thus, variance ratios larger than one are consistent with
rational positive momentum trading. Alternatively, when returns are negatively autocorrelated, the variance of k-period returns is smaller than k times the variance of one-period returns. Variance ratios smaller
than one would call for negative momentum (or contrarian) trading. Sample: monthly index returns from January 1975 to October 1998.

These results are “Whole Fund” in that they include no control for investor redemption effects as in equation (7). T-statistics are corrected
for heteroskedasticity across funds. Full sample: April 1993 to January 1999. The crisis portion of the sample is December 1994-June
1995, July 1997-March 1998, August 1998-October 1998, and January 1999. The non-crisis portion is the rest of the sample. For
robustness, results in each cell are based only on observations within three standard deviations of the mean.
