Decades of evidence reveal a complicated relationship between mammograms and mortality.
Mammograms may detect deadly cancers early, but they may also lead to the diagnosis and
potentially fatal treatment of cancers that would never progress to cause symptoms. I provide a
brief history of the evidence on mammograms and mortality, focusing on evidence from clinical
trials, and I discuss how this evidence informs mammography guidelines. I then explore the
evolution of all-cause mortality relative to breast cancer mortality within an influential clinical
trial. I conclude with some responses to the evolving evidence.

How Has the Evidence Evolved?

                                             Abstract

         Decades of evidence reveal a complicated relationship between mammograms and
      mortality. Mammograms may detect deadly cancers early, but they may also lead
      to the diagnosis and potentially fatal treatment of cancers that would never progress
      to cause symptoms. I provide a brief history of the evidence on mammograms and
      mortality, focusing on evidence from clinical trials, and I discuss how this evidence
      informs mammography guidelines. I then explore the evolution of all-cause mortality
      relative to breast cancer mortality within an influential clinical trial. I conclude with
      some responses to the evolving evidence.


           dvocates of preventive care emphasize that it saves money and lives. However,

A          preventive care need note save money (as Newhouse discusses in this issue). Pre-
           ventive care also need not save lives. In this paper, I analyze evolving evidence
on the mortality impact of a common form of preventive care: the mammogram, an X-ray
picture of the breast.
    The rationale for widespread mammography is that early detection of potentially fatal
breast cancers enables earlier and more effective treatment. But there is a potential draw-
back: mammography can detect some early-stage cancers that will never progress to cause
symptoms -- a phenomenon often referred to as overdiagnosis. In such cases, the emotional,
financial, and physical costs of a cancer diagnosis and any subsequent treatments occur
without any corresponding health benefit. Because it is hard to tell which women will be
harmed by their cancers, there is a tendency to treat all women as if their cancers will be
lethal (Mukherjee, 2017). Even if the initial cancer would have never proven life-threatening,
exposure to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery can potentially lead to new conditions,

even to new fatal cancers (Praga et al., 2005; Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative
Group, 2005).
    The possibility of overdiagnosis turns out to be central to guidelines for mammography
screening. Prior to 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (2002) recommended regular
mammography screening for asymptomatic women aged 40 and older. In 2009, the task force
revised its guidelines in light of the most recent follow-up data available from clinical trials
on mammography (US Preventive Services Task Force, 2009).
    The task force's latest guidelines, which are based on a 2016 meta-analysis, reaffirm the
2009 revision. They recommend regular mammography for women aged 50 to 74, but they
leave the mammography decision up to individual women in their 40s: "Women who place a
higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial
screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years" (Siu, 2016). The task force does not provide
guidelines for women older than 74 due to insufficient evidence.
    In all age groups, mammography has increased dramatically over time in the United
States, as shown in Figure 1a. By 2015, 58.3 percent of women aged 40­49, 71.3 percent of
women aged 50­65, and 63.3 percent of women aged 65+ reported receiving a mammogram
within the past two years. Mammography for women in their 40s has fallen only slightly and
gradually since guidelines changed in 2009. Widespread mammography seems embedded in
the US health care system, both as a matter of the acculturation of patients and health
care providers, and also as a matter of financial incentives: the aggregate annual cost of
mammography has been estimated to be $2.1 billion just among US women in their 40s with
private health insurance (Kunst et al., 2020).

harm that mammograms pose. Though false positives can also pose harm, overdiagnosis is
a separate phenomenon. According to the task force definition, overdiagnosis refers to "the
diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not
have become a threat to their health, or even apparent, during their lifetime" (Siu, 2016).
    Overdiagnosis is difficult to identify. If a mammogram catches an early-stage cancer, it is
impossible to discern how that cancer would have progressed absent detection, especially for
a given individual. However, several types of evidence suggest overdiagnosis of cancer. For
example, autopsy studies showing that almost half of older men die with, but not necessarily
of, prostate cancer have been important to prostate cancer screening guidelines since the
late 1980s (US Preventive Services Task Force, 1989). As summarized by Welch and Black
(2010), autopsy studies also suggest overdiagnosis of thyroid and breast cancer, and time
series evidence suggests overdiagnosis of thyroid, melanoma, and kidney cancer: as diagnoses
have risen dramatically with screening, deaths from these types of cancers have been stable.
    Deaths from breast cancer have decreased as mammography has increased, but differ-
ences in the decreases across geographic areas suggest overdiagnosis. Autier et al. (2010)
find that breast cancer mortality for women under age 50 fell from 1989 to 2006 in all 30
European countries that they examine, but they note that the greatest reductions occurred
in countries where screening was less common. Using their results, Gøtzsche and Jørgensen
(2013) emphasize that the reduction in breast cancer mortality was 49 percent in Denmark
but by only 36 percent in Sweden, despite the availability of screening mammography to
half of women in this age group in Sweden versus none in Denmark. In the United States,
breast cancer mortality for women under age 50 fell by an intermediate 39 percent over the
same period (author's calculations from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Pro-
gram (2019)). Difference-in-difference evidence within Denmark for older women aged 55 to
74 shows steeper declines in breast cancer mortality in regions without screening programs
from 1997 to 2006 (Jørgensen et al., 2010). These findings suggest that decreases in breast
cancer mortality are due to factors other than screening, such as decreased use of menopausal
hormone therapy (Ravdin et al., 2007) and improved treatments.
    Bleyer and Welch (2012) provide an approach that quantifies overdiagnosis from screen-
ing. The goal of screening is to prevent early-stage cancers from progressing to a late stage.
Therefore, an increase in early-stage cancers without a decrease in late-stage cancers of the
same magnitude indicates overdiagnosis, under the assumption that late-stage cancers will
be detected regardless of screening. Figure 1b shows that the incidence of early-stage breast
cancers in the United States has skyrocketed as the incidence of late-stage breast cancers has
declined only slightly. Bleyer and Welch (2012) estimate that in 2008 alone, breast cancer
was overdiagnosed for 70,000 women, accounting for 31 percent of all breast cancer diag-
noses. Conducting the same exercise using the data in Figure 1b, which replicates their main
figure to 2008 and extends it to 2015, I find a similar rate of overdiagnosis in the subsequent


                                              3
seven years.
    Evidence of overdiagnosis from randomized controlled trials is the most compelling.
Screening detects cancer, so trials should find higher rates of cancer in the intervention
arm in the short term. In the long term, if the only impact of screening is to detect cancer
early, rates of cancer should converge in the intervention and control arms as women who
experience symptoms have their cancers diagnosed. A failure to converge after a reasonable
amount of lead time indicates overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis became apparent in a lung can-
cer screening trial based on 16 years of follow-up data (Marcus et al., 2006). Since then,
overdiagnosis has become apparent in two studies of mammography trials based on at least
15 years of follow-up data, which imply overdiagnosis rates of 5 to 55 percent depending on
the subgroup and base rate (Zackrisson et al., 2006; Baines et al., 2016).
    Overdiagnosis, though undesirable, might be tolerable if screening reduces mortality.
The goal of this paper is to analyze how evidence on mortality has evolved over time, across
randomized controlled trials of mammography and within one trial. Preventive care such
as mammography aims to preempt harm over time, so it is important to consider evolving
evidence. I begin with a brief history of the prominent trials, and I present the latest
mortality results. These results are the basis for the US Preventive Services Task Force
guidelines on mammography screening as well as the basis for guidelines from other public
health authorities in the United States and other countries. In a new empirical exercise,
I explore the evolution of all-cause mortality relative to breast cancer mortality within a
prominent trial, the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, using 20 years of follow-up
data. In the conclusion, I offer some responses to the evolving evidence.

A Brief History of Mammography Trials
The 2016 guidelines for mammography screening from the US Preventive Services Task Force
are based on a meta-analysis that focuses on mortality impacts obtained from eight large
randomized controlled trials (Nelson et al., 2016). All trials combined include over 600,000
women, and individual trials range in size from approximately 39,000 to 160,000. Overall,
the meta-analysis finds no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality for women
in any age group. Some trials even show imprecise increases in all-cause mortality across
all age groups or within an age group. Results focused only on breast cancer mortality are
slightly more promising. The meta-analysis finds statistically significant but small reductions
in breast cancer mortality for women in their 50s and 60s, and it finds imprecise reductions
for women aged 39 to 49 and women aged 70 to 74. In this section, I provide a brief overview
of the trials and some related evidence on mammography.
    The first randomized controlled trial of mammography screening was established in the
United States in 1963. Interest in mammograms was growing at the time because breast
cancer was the leading cause of cancer death among US women (National Cancer Institute,
1979). Before mammograms were used to screen asymptomatic women, they were used to

                                              4
diagnose women with symptoms detected through clinical or self-examination. Large declines
in cervical cancer mortality were attributed to pap test screening (Boyes et al., 1973), so
there was hope that mammography screening would reduce breast cancer mortality.
    Women aged 40­64 who were enrolled in the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York
entered the trial between December 1963 and June 1966. The plan provided medical care on a
prepaid basis, with no additional fees for follow-up care. The plan randomly assigned 31,000
women to an intervention arm. Those women were invited for a mammogram and a clinical
breast examination, followed by three years of follow-up examinations, which continued even
if the women disenrolled from the health insurance plan.
    The Health Insurance Plan trial compared the intervention arm to a control arm of 31,000
women who continued to receive care as usual. Preliminary results were published in 1971
based on data through 1969 (Shapiro et al., 1971), which followed almost all women for at
least four years and some women for up to six years, depending on their enrollment dates.
Of the women invited for screening, about two-thirds appeared for their initial examination,
and about two-thirds of those women continued through their third annual examination,
resulting in an adherence rate of approximately 45 percent. Of the screened women, biopsies
were recommended for 873 women, 545 of which were recommended only on the basis of the
clinical exam and not mammography. Of that group, 624 women underwent biopsies, which
confirmed breast cancer for 127 of them; for the remaining 497 women, about 80 percent of
those who underwent biopsies, the breast cancer diagnosis was a false positive.
    Overall, there were 31 breast cancer deaths in the intervention arm and 52 in the control
arm. Thus, the "relative risk" of breast cancer mortality in intervention relative to control
was about 0.6 (31/52). In absolute terms, there was a less striking reduction of about 7
breast cancer deaths per 10,000 women ((52-31)/31,000)). Almost all this reduction was
for women who died at age 50 and older. Among women who died in their 40s, there were
11 breast cancer deaths in intervention and 12 in control.
    The researchers had followed up intensively on all women with confirmed breast cancer
cases to identify breast cancer deaths, but they had only completed their process of gathering
information on deaths from all causes among 14 percent of women without confirmed breast
cancer cases. In the preliminary data, there were 109 deaths from all causes in intervention
but only 99 in control (Shapiro et al., 1971). That is, overall deaths were higher among
women invited for screening.
    The preliminary results on breast cancer deaths from the Health Insurance Plan trial
galvanized support for a massive breast screening program in the United States, the Breast
Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project. The project did not involve randomization,
although it did facilitate some data collection. Between 1973 and 1980, the project recruited
280,000 women to be screened annually for five years via mammograms and clinical breast
exams (Cunningham, 1997). The project recruited women as young as 35, and approximately


                                              5
half of participants were under age 50, despite the lack of evidence in favor of mammography
for younger women. Even before any long-term data became available, the American Cancer
Society started recommending regular mammograms for women aged 50 and older in 1976; it
recommended regular mammograms for women aged 40 and older in 1983 (American Cancer
Society, 2017).
    At this point, interest in breast cancer screening programs began to increase around
the world, but there was some skepticism given the limited evidence from the Health In-
surance Plan Trial. More randomized trials were needed, but given the large numbers of
US women who were already receiving mammograms, a follow-up randomized trial would
have been practically quite difficult in the United States. A working group convened to
review the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (Summary Report of the Work-
ing Group to Review the National Cancer Institute-American Cancer Society Breast Cancer
Detection Demonstration Projects, 1979) and recommended randomized controlled trials to
evaluate questions left unanswered by the Health Insurance Plan trial: for example, should
the guidelines recommend mammograms for women in their 40s? And what was the relative
contribution of mammography compared to breast examination for women in their 50s?
    In 1980, researchers initiated the Canadian National Breast Screening Study to evaluate
these and other questions (Miller et al., 1981). Rather than inviting women for screening
from a health insurance plan or a population register, this trial conducted a multi-pronged
publicity campaign to recruit individual women. Initial media enthusiasm supported re-
cruitment, but over time, high-profile critics fueled public concerns over radiation exposure
(Baines, 1984). Though overdiagnosis was not central to public concerns, the trial protocol
acknowledged concerns related to overdiagnosis as the other main potential hazard from
mammography (Miller et al., 1981). The protocol also proposed an approach that has been
used to quantify these concerns using data on breast cancer diagnoses from the trial (Miller
et al., 2014; Baines et al., 2016).
    The Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS) enrolled roughly 90,000 women
between 1980 and 1985: CNBSS-1 enrolled 50,430 women aged 40 to 49, while CNBSS-2
enrolled 39,405 women aged 50 to 59. These enrollments were in line with power calculations
established in the trial protocol (Miller et al., 1981), informed by the latest breast cancer
mortality results from the Health Insurance Plan trial (Shapiro, 1977). All participants
in the CNBSS received a clinical breast exam at enrollment before randomization. Women
assigned to the intervention arm received a mammogram during each year of the active study
period, which included the enrollment year and the three to four years following enrollment
(depending on where and when they enrolled). Women assigned to the control arm received
usual care in the community in CNBSS-1 and access to a clinical breast examination during
each year of the active study period in CNBSS-2. The trial had the highest adherence
rate of all major mammography trials--85 percent (Nelson et al., 2016). For background

information on the CNBSS, good starting points include a recent book by Pellerin (2019)
and academic publications by the investigators, especially those that report the latest results
on mortality and breast cancer incidence 25 years after the first participants enrolled (Miller
et al., 2014; Baines et al., 2016).
    Several other international trials began in the 1970s and 1980s. Table 1 summarizes the
main trials. It takes information directly from a table within the meta-analysis that informs
the current US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines (Nelson et al., 2016). Although
Table 1 contains seven rows, Nelson et al. (2016) count CNBSS-1 and CNBSS-2 separately
in their discussion of eight trials. Four trials included in Table 1 began in Sweden, in part
because Sweden had population registers that could be used to define a trial population by
age within a geographic area. Furthermore, it was straightforward to track outcomes because
Sweden had a cause of death registry that began in 1951 and a cancer registry that began in
1958. In 1976, the Malm¨   o Mammographic Screening Trial, later known as MMST I, began
in Malm¨  o, Sweden. As shown in Table 1, it included approximately 42,000 women. In the
following year, 1977, a trial that was more than twice as large, known as the Swedish Two-
                                            ¨
County Trial, began in Kopparberg and Osterg¨      otland. In 1977, the trial in Malm¨ o closed
and began enrolling women in an extension trial with the same protocol, known as MMST II.
Other trials began in Stockholm in 1981 and Gothenburg in 1982. The Swedish trials have
subsequently been pooled for analysis to increase statistical power (Nystr¨ om et al., 1993).
    Another trial began in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1978 (Alexander et al., 1999). It recruited
approximately 45,000 women from 87 general practices to participate in the first cohort, and
it conducted randomization at the practice level. Because of baseline differences between
the intervention and control arms, there are substantial concerns about the randomization
in the Edinburgh trial. It is therefore not included in the meta-analysis that informs the US
Preventive Services Task Force guidelines or in Table 1. Much later, in 1991, another trial
began that included participants in Scotland, England, and Wales. That trial is known as
the UK Age trial, or simply, the Age trial. Like the Edinburgh trial, the Age trial enrolled
women based on their affiliation with general practices, but it conducted randomization at
the individual level. An extension of the Age trial, the AgeX trial, began recruiting women
aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 in 2009. As of late 2018, the AgeX trial has recruited 4 million
women, making it over six times larger than the combined size of the trials included in the
meta-analysis by Nelson et al. (2016). The trial is powered to detect a 15 percent reduction
of breast cancer mortality (Patnick et al., 2018).

Latest Mortality Results across Trials
The meta-analysis by Nelson et al. (2016) that informs the US Preventive Services Task Force
mammography guidelines primarily considers the relative risk of breast cancer mortality at
the latest available date for each trial. Table 2 reproduces the main results. Within each age
group, the table reports results from various studies that provide results for distinct groups

within the eight main trials. In all age groups, the relative risk of breast cancer mortality is
less than one, indicating that the ratio of the breast cancer mortality rate in intervention to
control is less than one. The relative risk is only statistically different from one for women
aged 50­59 and 60­69.
    Nelson et al. (2016) note that the implied reduction in breast cancer mortality is small in
absolute terms. Screening 10,000 women aged 50­59 over 10 years prevents 7.7 breast cancer
deaths, and screening the same number of women aged 60­69 over 10 years prevents 21.3
(Nelson et al., 2015). The number of breast cancer deaths avoided due to mammography
screening seems considerably lower than the number of cause-specific deaths avoided due to
screening for other cancers. As a point of comparison, the US Preventive Services Task Force
guidelines on colorectal cancer screening report that it prevents 200 to 240 colorectal cancer
deaths per 10,000 people aged 50 to 70 (Bibbins-Domingo et al., 2016).
    Deaths attributed to a particular type of cancer may not capture the full mortality
impact of screening. Cause of death coding can be a subjective enterprise. For example,
mammography screening can increase the probability of a breast cancer diagnosis, which
can increase the probability that a death is coded as a breast cancer death. Through this
mechanism, mammography trial estimates can be biased against showing reductions in breast
cancer mortality. However, mammography can also lead to overdiagnosis and other collateral
harms, which may or may not be captured in breast cancer mortality. The overall direction
of the bias is unclear. Thus, it seems useful to examine all-cause mortality to capture a wider
range of potential benefits and harms from mammograms.
    The meta-analysis that informs the US Preventive Services Task Force mammography
guidelines includes an analysis of all-cause mortality in a technical document (Nelson et al.,
2015). Table 3 reproduces the results here. Combined analysis of all trials indicates a relative
risk of 0.99 for women aged 39 to 49, 0.97 for women aged 60 to 69, and 0.98 for women aged
70 to 74. None of these relative risks are significantly different from one at the 5 percent
level. Furthermore, the relative risk is 1.02 for women aged 50 to 59, indicating net harm.
Several individual studies also report relative risks greater than one. All of these relative
risks are imprecise and should thus be interpreted with caution. Imprecision aside, relative
risks greater than one are striking. Even if a trial shows overdiagnosis in terms of breast
cancer incidence, overdiagnosis could still be innocuous in terms of all-cause mortality.
    It should also be noted that, for many trials, the mean follow-up for all-cause mortality
reported in Table 3 is much shorter than the mean follow-up for breast cancer mortality
reported in Table 2. The lack of later follow-up is concerning, given that reductions in
mortality due to prevention of late-stage cancers might be expected to happen relatively
sooner in the follow-up period, while negative effects of overdiagnosis might manifest rela-
tively later. In one trial, the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, results in terms
of all-cause mortality have tended to weaken the case for mammography over time (Miller

et al., 1992a,b, 2014). Later in this paper, I will offer some new evidence on the time profile
of impacts on breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality using the data from this trial.
    It is hard to understate the controversy surrounding the results from the mammography
trials. The idea that finding small, treatable cancers will save lives by stopping them from
growing into larger malignant cancers is appealingly simple. Furthermore, the mammography
trials began in an era in which sexism and paternalism toward women were much more overt
than they are today. Spurred by the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project,
manufacturers of mammography equipment were eager to expand their market. Billboard
signs implored, "If you don't get a mammogram, you need more than your breasts examined"
(Pellerin, 2019).
    For advocates of mammography, it was thus disappointing when the evidence from the
randomized controlled trials was underwhelming. Some began to update their thinking on
the value of mammography. Others challenged the methodologies of the trials themselves,
particularly whether the randomization had been adequate. The meta-analysis that informs
the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines rated the randomization of all of the tri-
als in Table 1 as "fair" quality but raised various concerns about specific studies in terms
like: "Generally effective randomization and comparable groups are assembled initially, but
some question remains whether some, although not major, differences occurred in follow-up,"
"Important differential loss to follow-up or overall high loss to follow-up; adherence <80%,"
"Numbers of participants unclear," and "Did not maintain comparable groups (includes at-
trition, crossovers, adherence, contamination)." For comparison, a Cochrane review deemed
most of the trials, including the second part of the Malm¨   o trial (MMST II) to be "subopti-
mally" randomized, but it also deemed the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, the
first part of the Malm¨ o trial (MMST I), and the Age trial to be "adequately" randomized
(Gøtzsche and Jørgensen, 2013).

Trial Results Inform Mammography Guidelines
The evidence from mammography trials has informed mammography guidelines in many
countries. For example, Swedish trials are the only trials in Table 2 that show statisti-
cally significant decreases in breast cancer mortality in some age groups. Swedish national
guidelines recommend mammograms for women aged 40 to 74 (Ebell et al., 2018).
    In contrast, Canadian national guidelines "recommend not screening" with mammog-
raphy for women aged 40 to 49 (Klarenbach et al., 2018) but "recommend screening with
mammography" for women aged 50 to 74. As summarized in Table 2, the most recent mor-
tality results from the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (Miller et al., 2014) show
an imprecise increase in breast cancer mortality for women in their 40s and an imprecise
decrease in breast cancer mortality for women in their 50s. The most recent breast cancer
incidence results indicate overdiagnosis (Baines et al., 2016).

United Kingdom, do not recommend mammography for women in their 40s, and they also
do not recommend against it as Canadian guidelines do (Ebell et al., 2018). However, the
Swiss Medical Board recommended steps to limit screening programs in 2014 (Biller-Andorno
and J¨uni, 2014). In 2016, the French Minister of Health released results of an independent
review that recommended that the national screening program end or undergo radical reforms
(Barratt et al., 2018).
    Within the United States, guidelines vary but tend to make selective recommendations
similar to those of the US Preventive Services Task Force (CDC, 2020). For women in their
40s, the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Academy of Family Physicians,
and the American College of Physicians all leave the mammography decision up to individual
women and their doctors, as does the American Cancer Society for women aged 40 to 44. In
contrast, the American College of Radiology recommends regular mammograms for women
in their 40s.

Evolution of Mortality Results within a Trial
The medical literature has commonly evaluated randomized controlled trials of mammogra-
phy by using breast cancer mortality as the primary outcome, and it commonly examines the
outcome only at the latest available date. The meta-analysis that informs the US Preventive
Services Task Force mammography guidelines follows these practices too. However, breast
cancer mortality may or may not capture mortality impacts of mammography that occur
through overdiagnosis (and perhaps false positives). Indeed, some in the medical literature
argue for a focus on all-cause mortality (Black et al., 2002). In addition, measuring the
outcome of a mammography trial at the latest available date does not reveal how benefits
and harms of mammography may develop over different timeframes.
    In this section, I reanalyze data from the Canadian National Breast Screening Study
(CNBSS, 2015), the trial with the longest follow-up length of all trials considered by the
Nelson et al. (2016) meta-analysis, with an emphasis on how breast cancer mortality and
all-cause mortality evolve over time. Each intermediate result that I examine reflects a fixed
follow-up length since enrollment. In contrast, the CNBSS investigators examine results at
the latest available calendar date, which is not quite the same thing. Because participants
enrolled in the CNBSS over a period of five years, the most recent CNBSS results reflect
follow-up lengths that vary from 20 to 25 years across participants. The practice of aggre-
gating information across multiple follow-up lengths is common and reasonable because it
preserves balance between intervention and control and incorporates all available informa-
tion. For example, the meta-analysis that informs the US Preventive Services Task Force
guidelines reports an estimate from the latest available date for each trial (Nelson et al.,
2016) and reports the mean follow-up length, per Table 2. However, this practice makes
trends difficult to interpret.
    Mammography trials often reassess results as data accumulates and the latest available

                                             13
date advances (Miller et al., 1992a,b, 2000, 2002, 2014), and some research in the medical
literature has emphasized systematic analysis of cause-specific mortality over time (Miettinen
et al., 2002; Hanley, 2005, 2010, 2011; Hanley et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015). Here, I will show
that a systematic assessment of all-cause mortality over time reveals additional information.
    As a starting point, I examine breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality 20 years
after enrollment in this study, which is the maximum follow-up length available for all par-
ticipants. Following the latest mortality results published by the Canadian National Breast
Screening Study investigators (Miller et al., 2014), I begin by pooling results for women of
all ages. The first row of Table 4 shows that the intervention arm experienced 20 fewer
deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 women than the control arm. This imprecise reduc-
tion in breast cancer mortality in the intervention arm is consistent with the negative and
statistically insignificant point estimate published by the CNBSS investigators at the latest
available date (Miller et al., 2014), and it is replicated in the last column of the second panel
of Table A.1 in the online Appendix available with the paper at the JEP website.

    I next examine the excess all-cause mortality rate in the intervention arm 20 years after
enrollment. The second row of Table 4 shows that the intervention arm experienced 89
more all-cause deaths per 100,000 women than the control arm. Again, this estimate is
not statistically different from zero, and it is consistent with the positive but statistically
insignificant point estimate published by the Canadian National Breast Screening Study
investigators at the latest available date (Miller et al., 2014), replicated in the last column
of the second panel of Table A.1 in the online Appendix.
    The next step is to look at the evolution of breast cancer mortality over time. I start
by constructing point estimates analogous to the point estimate reported in the first row of
Table 4 for each intermediate annual follow-up length, starting with the enrollment year as
year 0. I plot the results in Figure 2. All but two of the point estimates are statistically
indistinguishable from zero. To investigate the existence of a trend, I plot the line of best
fit across all point estimates. I obtain the statistical significance of the trend using the

                                                             14
equivalent panel regression to take into account that the point estimates as well as the trend
are estimated. The trend line appears flat with a slope that is not statistically different
from zero. Based on these results, it is not surprising that the literature, which focuses on
breast cancer mortality as the primary outcome at various points in time, does not identify
a compelling trend in breast cancer mortality as follow-up length increases.

Note. Years after enrollment are constructed for each subject based on the exact calendar date of enrollment. 95 percent
confidence intervals in each year after enrollment are obtained from the same 200 bootstrap samples. The standard error on the
slope of the line of best fit, in parentheses, is calculated from a panel regression, block bootstrapped by year after enrollment,
which takes into account that the point estimates and the line of best fit are estimated. Subjects aged 40­59 at enrollment are
included.


    I next carry out the same approach with all-cause mortality as the outcome of interest.
As shown in Figure 3, through 20 years after enrollment, point estimates are not statistically
different from zero at any follow-up length. However, a pattern emerges over time: point
estimates in the first four years after enrollment are negative. Year five is the first positive
point estimate, and the point estimates are always positive after year six. Although these
point estimates are individually imprecise, they are consistent with a hypothesis that life-
saving benefits of mammograms outweigh their collateral harms at first, but as more time
passes, collateral harms rise.
    I plot the line of best fit across all point estimates, which I obtain from an equivalent
panel regression, in Figure 3. A pronounced upward-sloping and statistically significant
trend is visible in the all-cause mortality results. With each additional year that passes
after enrollment, an additional 7 excess deaths per 100,000 women become apparent among

                                                                                        15

intervention arm participants relative to control arm participants. To put this trend in
perspective, annual road traffic deaths in the United States are 12.4 per 100,000 (World
Health Organization, 2018).
    In Figures A.1 and A.2 in the online Appendix, I show that the positive trend is larger
in magnitude for women aged 40­49 at enrollment (a slope of around 8 deaths per 100,000
women per year) than for women aged 50­59 at enrollment (a slope of around 6 deaths per
100,000 women per year). This difference by age group is unsurprising given the weaker
evidence on the effect on breast cancer mortality for younger women and the corresponding
difference in the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for women in their 40s.
    There are many mechanisms that could explain the trend in all-cause mortality. For
example, breast cancer treatments could have mortality impacts that are not captured by
breast cancer mortality. Randomized controlled trials of radiotherapy show that it increases
lung and esophageal cancer mortality among women treated for early-stage breast cancer
(Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, 2005). I add lung and esophageal
cancer deaths to breast cancer deaths and estimate the trend. From these three causes
combined, I find that an additional 3.6 excess deaths per 100,000 women become apparent
in each additional year after enrollment. This trend is statistically significant, and it can
explain more than half of the trend in all-cause mortality (results shown in Figure A.3 in the


                                                                                16
online Appendix). Perhaps deaths from other types of cancer can explain some of the rest
of the difference. However, other cause-specific measures of mortality are subject to similar
limitations as breast cancer mortality.
    The trend in all-cause mortality is especially striking given that mammography likely
increased in the control arm over time. Although the investigators did not collect complete
data on mammograms received after the active study period, Canadian breast screening
programs began in the late 1980s and 1990s, so it seems likely that some women in the
control arm began receiving regular mammography at some point within 20 years of en-
rollment (Baines et al., 2016). Convergence in mammography behavior should attenuate
mortality differences between the intervention and control arms over time--which makes the
positive trend in excess all-cause mortality in the intervention arm all the more surprising.
Convergence in mammography behavior also implies that the results speak to whether mam-
mography should begin at younger ages, say, in a woman's 40s rather than in her 50s, in line
with the most recent change in the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.
    These findings should be interpreted with caution. The Canadian National Breast Screen-
ing Study began decades ago. In any of the mammography trials, factors such as mammo-
gram technology and breast cancer treatment could have changed over time, so past trends
could differ from future trends in ways that are difficult to assess. For instance, technological
improvements that allow mammograms to identify smaller tumors could worsen the mortal-
ity impact of overdiagnosis if those smaller tumors are less likely to advance to late-stage
cancers. In contrast, innovations that make breast cancer treatment milder could alleviate
the mortality impact of overdiagnosis.
    Despite these challenges, evolving results from mammography trials represent the best
available evidence. Examination of the trend in all-cause mortality reveals that the tradeoff
between the harms and benefits of mammography has been shifting toward harms over time.
It also offers a prediction of how the evidence will continue to evolve, which is useful since
organizations such as the US Preventive Services Task Force update guidelines over time.

Responses to Evolving Evidence
One response to the evolving evidence on mortality from mammography trials is to incorpo-
rate it into new policies. Section 2713 of the Affordable Care Act (2010) ties health insurance
coverage for preventive services to current and future guidelines of the US Preventive Services
Task Force. However, it makes an explicit exception for mammography, allowing coverage
for annual mammograms for women in their 40s, despite current guidelines.
    Another response is to reverse existing policies that are at odds with current guidelines,
such as policies that lead to over-utilization of mammography among women older than
74. For example, California state auditors implemented a policy in the late 1980s that
required many elderly women enrolled in a particular health plan to receive at least one
mammogram. The mean age of the women screened between 1995 and 1997 as a result of

                                               17
the policy was 81. Unsurprisingly, 17 percent of these women experienced significant burdens
from mammography (Walter et al., 2001). This policy was later reversed, but the issue of
screening older women persists. One doctor told Kaiser Health News that doctors continue
to screen older women because of fears of lawsuits, health system bonuses for high screening
rates, and because "doing less can be perceived as a lack of caring or as ageism...It can be
uncomfortable for a physician to explain why doing less is more" (Szabo, 2017).
    Even if it is difficult to limit mammography, medical practice can respond to evolving
evidence on mammography by reducing or at least postponing the use of potentially unneces-
sary treatments, especially treatments for early-stage cancers identified with mammography.
The New York Times described the results of a recent clinical trial of breast cancer treat-
ment as "good news for women with breast cancer: many don't need chemo" (as reported in
Grady, 2018). The trial found that the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy does
not increase invasive disease-free survival for women with certain breast cancer diagnoses,
but it has some benefit for women aged 50 or younger whose breast cancers are initially
deemed more likely to recur (Sparano et al., 2018).
    Yet another response to the evolving evidence on mammography is to produce more
targeted evidence. In that vein, it is instructive to learn from responses to experimental
evidence in development economics. As Esther Duflo (2020) discusses in her Nobel lecture,
initial responses from the microfinance industry were critical of experimental evidence that
contradicted the perception of microfinance as a panacea against poverty. However, exper-
imental evidence was never meant to pass a categorical judgment on microfinance; rather,
it aimed to uncover contexts in which microfinance may work well. As with microfinance,
the underwhelming evidence on benefits of mammography should not motivate a wholesale
rejection of the practice, but rather it should motivate research aimed at uncovering the
contexts in which mammograms may provide benefits.
    Existing and new methods can be used to predict the characteristics of women for whom
mammography is most beneficial within trial data. In my ongoing research, I propose an
approach to quantify the number of individuals in a trial who would be harmed by an
intervention, such as access to mammography, even if the trial does not show harm on
average (Kowalski, 2020b). Advances in machine learning can then be applied to determine
which women are most likely to benefit. With this knowledge in hand, examination of which
women select into mammography (as in Kim and Lee (2017); Einav et al. (2019)) and how
these selection patterns translate into heterogeneous treatment effects of mammography (as
in Kowalski (2020a)) can help policymakers craft better targeted policies. There has already
been careful work that examines the impact of policies on mammography (Mehta et al., 2015;
Bitler and Carpenter, 2016; Kadiyala and Strumpf, 2016; Lu and Slusky, 2016; Buchmueller
and Goldzahl, 2018; Myerson et al., 2020). Such work can be extended to examine the
targeting of mammography in light of evidence on mortality from clinical trials.

Replication of Published Results
The last column of the second panel of Table A.1 replicates published results in Miller et al.
 (2014), which considers evidence up to the 2005 calendar year, as opposed to 20 years after
enrollment. The results are qualitatively similar.

Note. Years after enrollment are constructed for each subject based on the exact calendar date of enrollment. Standard errors
in parentheses are calculated as the standard deviation of the point estimates obtained in 200 bootstrap samples. Subjects
aged 40­59 at enrollment are included. Some differences between statistics might not appear internally consistent because of
rounding.



Separate Trends for Women in Their 40s and 50s
Figures A.1 and A.2 present separate trends for women in their 40s and 50s at enrollment.
Despite losses in statistical power that result from dividing the sample, the magnitude of
the time trend is similar within each age group. With each additional year of follow-up,
mammography assignment yields 8 additional excess deaths per 100,000 women aged 40­49
and 6 additional excess deaths per 100,000 women aged 50­59.

Trend in Mortality from Breast, Lung, and Esophageal Cancer
Combined
Figure A.3 shows that there is a positive, statistically significant trend in excess deaths due
to breast, lung, and esophageal cancers combined: with each additional year of follow-up
after enrollment, there are an additional 3.6 excess deaths per 100,000 women in intervention
relative to control, which explains almost half of the trend in all-cause mortality depicted in
Figure 3.

Note. Years after enrollment are constructed for each subject based on the exact calendar date of enrollment. 95 percent
confidence intervals in each year after enrollment are obtained from the same 200 bootstrap samples. Lung cancer mortality is
defined using ICD-9 code 162 for subjects who died before 2000 and using ICD-10 codes C33-34 for subjects who died from 2000
onward. Esophageal cancer mortality is defined using ICD-9 code 150 for subjects who died before 2000 and using ICD-10 code
C15 for subjects who died from 2000 onward. The standard error on the slope of the line of best fit, in parentheses, is calculated
from a panel regression, block bootstrapped by year after enrollment, which takes into account that the point estimates and
the line of best fit are estimated. Subjects aged 40­59 at enrollment are included.
