     Current   cost containment strategies will undoubtedly result in

fewer health services for patients. The analytical framework presented

in this paper shows how the effects of reductions in services on health

and social welfare depend upon the amount and distribution of services

(relative to potential benefit) prior to cost containment and on the

size and selectivity of the reductions. Disagreement over whether cost

containment has gone too far arises from disagreements about the

criterion (health or social welfare), the prior distribution, and how

selective the reductions will be. In the long run selectivity will be

the key to successful cost containment.

                             Victor R. Fuchs



     Cost containment strategies are sweeping through the health care

system like fire through parched underbrush. Medicare's prospective

payment system based on diagnosis-related groups is leading the way,

with health maintenance organizations, preferred provider

organizations, state regulatory agencies, and deductibles and

coinsurance close behind. The reasons for the changes in health care

financing and organizations are well understood.' But what about

their effects? Over the long run the current revolution in health care

finance is likely to change every aspect of the health care system:

medical practice, medical education, medical research. The debate over

whether cost containment has gone too far has already begun. This

paper does not attempt to resolve that debate or to discuss all of the

eventual ramifications of cost containment. It does offer an

analytical framework for thinking about the direct effects of current

policies on health and social welfare.


How Cost Containment Works

     Regardless of whether cost containment is sought through

competition or regulation or a combination of both, reductions in

spending on health care can be achieved in only three ways. First, the

producers of health care may be forced to increase poduction

efficiency, i.e., to deliver the same amount of services with fewer

inputs. Such gains in efficiency are always possible in every


                                         Â£
organization, but it is unlikely that they will prove to be a major

source of cost reduction. Even under the old payment systems there was

no reward for the inefficiency associated with using more resources for

a given amount of services. The inefficiencies that critics pointed to

had more to do with what care was delivered than how it was produced.

     Second, even with the amount of services and production efficiency

unchanged, health care spending can be reduced by reducing the prices

paid for inputs. As with efficiency, it is always possible to squeeze

input prices a little- - to trim nurses' wages and physicians' fees and

drug industry profits. But it is highly unlikely that this will be the

major source of cost reduction, especially over the long run. In the

short run, supplies of inputs may be relatively inelastic and therefore

their prices can be squeezed. In the long run, however, nurses,

physicians, drug companies, and other inputs into health care must

receive competitive compensation or the supplies will not be forthcoming.

     The third, and by far the most important way to contain costs is

to deliver fewer services. At the most fundamental level, cost

containment must mean fewer hospital admissions, shorter lengths of

stay, fewer t&sts and X-rays, and similar reductions across the

spectrum of care. Thus, the question about the effects of cost

containment can be restated: How will health and social welfare be

affected by a reduction in the amount of health services? This question

can be illuminated with the help of a few diagrams.



Maximizing Health and Social Welfare

     Figure la presents a stylized description of the relationship

between health benefit and amount of services, defined to include both

quantitative and qualitative dimensions. For instance, an increase in

the amount of care can be thought of as an increase in length of stay

in the hospital (holding services per day constant), or as an increase

in the number of tests per day, or as any combination of changes in

days and tests that results in more services. For each patient the

health benefit typically increases as the amount of services increases,

but at a decreasing rate. Eventually a point is reached, Q2, where the

health benefit is at a maximum, and additional services do more harm

than good. Figure la also shows that cost rises as the amount of

services increases. To simplify the presentation without undue violence

to reality, it is assumed that cost rises at a constant rate, i.e.,

each additional unit of service adds as much to cost as does the

preceding unit. If all the benefits of care are reflected in the health

curve, the amount of services that maximizes social welfare is Q1. If

any less care is provided, the benf it would decrease more than the

cost; if any amount greater than Q1 is provided, cost would increase

more than the benefit.2

     The basis for defining the amounts of services that maximize

health and maximize social welfare can perhaps be seen more clearly in

Figure ib, which shows the marginal (i.e., additional) benefit and

marginal cost curves derived from the total benefit and total cost

curves of Figure la. The exact shape of the marginal benefit curve will

vary from disease to disease and from patient to patient, but the

marginal benefit, on average, surely declines as the amount of services

increases, and eventually becomes negative. Overall, the linear

approximation may not be far off, and greatly simplifies the analysis.




                                      4
The Effects of Less Care

     What happens as cost containment strategies reduce the amount of

services? The answer clearly depends on how much is being provided.

Any reductions that occur to the right of Q2 will result in an

improvement in health; reductions to the left of Q2 will decrease

health. For social welfare, Q1 is the critical point. Reductions in the

amount of services to the right of Q1 increase social welfare (because

they reduce cost more than benefit); reductions to the left decrease

social welfare (because they reduce benefit more than cost). Thus, the

effect of cost containment on health may differ from the effect on

social welfare; any reductions between Q2 and Q1 would simultaneously

decrease health and increase social welfare. Both effects, however,

depend on the initial distribution of patients by amount of services

and on the change in services.

     It is reasonable to assume that prior to cost containment

different patients are receiving different amounts of services

(relative to potential benefit); a stylized description of such a

frequency distribution is presented in Figure 2. Some patients are

receiving th& amount that maximizes the health benefit, Q2; some are

receiving more, and some less. Some patients may not even be receiving

as much as Q1. This distribution and the size and pattern of the

reduction in services determine the changes in health and social

welfare. Consider the following hypothetical scenarios.

     1) Equal absolute reductions

     Suppose that cost containment results in a uniform absolute

reduction, a, in the amount of services received by each patient. For

instance, if amount of services is measured by days in the hospital,

                                  6
each patient has the same reduction of a days. The average effects on

health and social welfare will be determined by the size of the

reduction, a, and the mean (Q) of the distribution prior to the change.

More precisely, the change in health will be equal to a(â -        1-
This means that health will increase, decrease, or stay the same, de-

pending on whether Q is greater than, smaller than, or equal to Q2 +      a/2.
In the same way, the effect on social welfare will depend only on the

relationship between Q and Q1 +   a/2.
     2) Equal percentage reductions

     Suppose that cost containment results in a uniform percentage

reduction, a, in the amount of services received by each patient. For

instance, suppose each length of stay is reduced by Q where Q is the

original amount. In that case, the effects on health and social welfare

will depend on the size of o, the mean of the distribution, Q, and the

variance (cr2) of the distribution. The larger is 2 the smaller can be

Q consistent with a favorable effect on health or social welfare. More

precisely,   the change in health will be equal to [

                                                             '<2
This means that health will increase, decrease, or stay the same,

depending on whether Q is greater than, smaller than, or equal to

2Q2 Ã· (l+C2)(2âcO, where C equals the coefficient of variation (i.e.,

standard deviation divided by mean of the distribution). For the effect

on social welfare, simply substitute Q1 for Q2.

     Thus, in the case of equal percentage reductions, it is possible

for there to be no decrease in health even if Q is less than Q2

provided the coefficient of variation is sufficiently large and cY. not

tremendously large. Figure 3 shows the Q Q2 ratio that would result

in no change in health for various combinations of C and c. For

instance, if the coefficient of variation was .5 and the reduction in

care was 30 percent (c             .3), there would be no change in health if

  Ã·        = .94.   If Q Ã·        were greater than .94, a 30 percent reduction in
                             Q2

care would actually result in an increase in health; if it were

smaller, health would decrease. By substituting Q1 for Q2, Figure 3 can

be used to infer the Q Ã· Q1 ratios that would result in no change in

social welfare for different combinations of C and .

      3)     Unequal percentage reductions

      If the reductions are selective; i.e., if the patients receiving

more services (relative to potential benefit) experience larger than

average percentage reductions, the effects on health and social welfare

will be more favorable than those in case 2 for any given values of Q

and C. Of course, if the reductions are perversely selective; i.e., if

those patients receiving fewer services (relative to potential benefit)

experience larger than average percentage reductions, the effects will

be less favorable than in case 2.



The Policy Debates

      The foregoing analytical discussion should help to clarify key

aspects of the current debate about whether cost containment has gone

too far.

      Disagreement over the criterion for ludging "too far." Which side

a person takes in this debate may depend on whether health or social

welfare is the criterion. It is certainly possible (many experts would

say probable) that reductions in the amount of services will

simultaneously decrease health but increase social welfare because the

value of the decreases in health will be smaller than the value of the

resources freed for other uses.


                                                a
    Disagreement over the distribution prior to cost containment.

Even individuals who agree that health should be the criterion may

disagree about the distribution of patients with respect to Q2 prior

to cost containment. If Q is substantially to the right of Q2 (a large

amount of services that harm health), then equal absolute reductions in

care will not reduce health on average. Some patients will be hurt by

the reductions but others will benefit. Even if Q is to the left of Q2

it is still possible for equal percentage reductions to be benign if

the prior distribution has considerable variance.

     Disagreement over how selective the reductions will be. Even

individuals who agree about the criterion and about the prior

distribution may disagree about how the reductions will be applied. If

reductions are selectively concentrated on those patients who were

receiving too much care, the effect will be very different than if the

reductions are exerienced by all patients.

     In the absence of hard data it is not surprising that experts

differ in their estimates of the prior distribution and of the

probability that reductions will be selective. Those who believe that

many patients 'receive excessive care and that the variance is large can

point to the uneven incidence of surgery across geographical areas4 and

to the findings of the Rand Health Insurance Experiment. In that

experiment cost-sharing resulted in substantial reductions in the

amount of care received by some families, but no major effects on

health were observed for either adults or children.5'6

     On the other hand, a study of the effects of Medicare and Medicaid

on utilization of surgical operations casts doubt on the ability of

patients to reduce care selectively when faced with less insurance



                                     10
coverage. Urban nonwhites experienced an increase of 50 percent in

their utilization of 11 selected surgical procedures after the

government insurance programs went into effect, but the average level

of urgency or necessity of the procedures performed on these patients

was the same as it was prior to Medicare and Medicaid.7 If any

selectivity had been present during the period of limited or no

insurance, the average level of urgency and necessity should have

fallen as utilization increased. There is no doubt that deductibles and

coinsurance can induce consumers to demand less medical care, but given

the complexity of many medical decisions, it is questionable whether

consumers know which services to cut back on and which to retain.

     Selectivity will become increasingly important as the reductions

in amount of care (relative to potential benefit) grow larger. The more

selective the reductions, the greater can be the decrease in cost for

any given change in health or social welfare. This suggests that the

question "Is cost containment being pursued in the best possible way?"

may be as important as how far it is pursued. Those strategies such as

prepaid group practice that rely on physicians to contain costs are

likely to result in more selective reductions than those relying on

patients' responses to cost sharing because physicians have more

understanding of the potential effects on health of alternative

protocols. Moreover, the improvement and expansion of research and

education programs designed to increase that understanding will be

essential in the long run in order to contain costs in the best

possible way.

                                Derivation of Results8



1. Equal absolute reductions

        If the marginal benefit curve is linear and we define the marginal

benefit of the first unit of care as 1, then when the amount of care is Q

the marginal benefit equals 1 â                         Therefore,     if each patient receives

a fewer units of care, the change in health for a patient initially receiving

Q units is equal to


           Qâa                                  2   Qâa

               Q          '<2                       Q


           Since the expected value of any linear function of Q is the same

function of Q (the mean of Q), the average change in health

                                      Q2

           For the social welfare calculation, costs and benefits are measured
relative to the marginal cost line, rather than the horizontal axis. When

the amount of care is Q the marginal effect on social welfare equals 1 â
                                                                                                  '<1
Substituting Q1 for Q2 in the above equations gives the change in social

welfare.

 2.                     entage reductions

              If each patient receives cxQ fewer units (where cx is a proportion

between 0 and 1), the change in health for a patient initially receiving

Q     units   is equal to


                                                2   I QâcxQ         2

                                         Qââ
                                                              =
              JQ                                Q2Q                2

              Since this function is ratic in Q, we
                                                    cannot simply replace Q
with    Q   in   taking the expected value. The expected value of Q                is   Q   but   the
expected value of Q2          is   Q2   + G2. Thus,       the average change in health



                    =     (Q+G)(2)          -




Therefore,         tH = 0 when Q = 2Q2 Ã·
