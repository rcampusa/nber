      The search for microeconomic foundations of rion—Wairasian outcomes

 In labor and product markets has spawned many studies of contracting.

 This paper emphasizes the role of contracts for market equilibrium——for

many raw materials and basic industrial commodities——In which long—term

 contractual arrangements and spot markets coexist. Our principal goals

are two——(I) to explain the existence of contracts and the equilibrium

fraction of trades carried out under contract, and (ii) to consider the

impact of demand and supply shocks on spot prices when market trades

also take place through long—term contracts.

     We find that the relative importance of contracting depends on,

inter alla, the variance of the spot price and the sources of underlying

fluctuations. Consistent with the findings of previous macroeconomic

studies, we find that contracting and price rigidity are more likely the

more important demand shocks are relative to supply shocks. We adapt

our static model of contract price and quantity determination to discuss

the adjustment of contract prices. Finally, we discuss three important

applications of our multiple—price modeling structure——to (I) analyses

of the effects of changes in vertical market structure on market

equilibrium in commodity markets (with specific reference to petroleum

and copper), (ii) models of the optimal degree of contract indexation,

and (iii) aggregate studies of "sticky prices" In macroeconomics.

I.   INTRODUCTION

     Studies of price adjustment in commodity and industrial product

markets have been a key element of research in macroeconomics and

industrial organization for decades. Outside the static and

instantaneous market clearing in textbook models, an important goal for

economic theory is to provide an explanation of how prices move to clear

markets. For a variety of Issues from assessing the efficiency of

commodity markets to testing price flexibility in Industrial markets to

measuring the sensitivity of aggregate prices and quantities to demand—

management policies, it is not sufficient to maintain that Wairasian

equilibria will be obtained, without describing the process of

adjustment.

     The failure of the Walrasian, market—clearing framework to explain

movements in prices and quantities has been a focus of macroeconomics

since the Keynesian revolution.' Particular emphasis has been placed on

"sticky wages" in labor markets and "sticky prices" in goods markets.2

Outside of Keynesian macroeconomics, Means's (1935) assertion that

market power led to sticky "administered" prices prompted an ongoing

debate in industrial organization.

     Previous efforts at motivating these rigidities have classified

product markets into "auction" and "customer" categories (the terms are

from Okun, 1981). The principal goal of this paper is to characterize

price flexibility in markets exhibiting both fixed—price and flexIble—

price behavior. The basic model put forth in section II Is of interest

as an intermediate case between the "no contracting, instantaneous price

adjustment" Wairasian model and the "contracting only, no price

adjustment" models recently investigated by Carlton (1978, 1979b) and
                                   —2—

Gould (1978). The model is an alternative to one constructed by Akerlof

and Yellen (1985a, 1985b), in which the intermediate case arises because

a fixed fraction of the agents in the market are assumed to be non—

maximizers. Some of the results from our model, in which all agents

optimize, are similar to theirs.

     A line of research in the recent macroeconomics literature has

focused on the microfoundations of price flexibility (Rotemberg, 1982;

Mankiw, 1985; Taylor, 1979). When prices are neither inflexible nor

perfectly flexible, multiple prices are likely to occur.4 Multiple—

price arrangements are prevalent in commodities5, and in industrial

goods.6 In the static model, we consider both cases of competitive and

monopoly producer behavior. We illustrate how an endogenously

determined multiple—price system can provide a foundation for models of

the form suggested by Taylor (1979), and contrast it with the

alternative foundation suggested by Akerlof and Yellen (1985b).

     Our modeling framework is based on Canton (1979a). Carlton

derived the relationship between spot and contract prices in a model

with two types of buyers——those who must contract in advance for

planning purposes and those who can purchase on auction markets. In our

model, buyers and sellers choose the extent to which they rely on

contracting. In general, the contracting regime and hence the degree of

price flexibility depend on the variance of the spot price, relative

prices in spot markets, and the covariances of these prices with buyer

and seller profits in the absence of contracting. An extension to

multiperlod contracts is also presented.

     In Section III, we apply the model to analyze the impact of

contracting on the adjustment of prices to demand and supply
                                   —3—

fluctuations in a framework based on the labor—market model of Taylor

(1979) and the one—price commodity market model of Turnovsky (1983).

Introducing speculative storage, we find that even transitory demand and

supply fluctuations exhibit "persistence effects" on spot prices in the

presence of contracts. At the close of the paper, we put forth three

potential applications of the multiple—price modeling structure——to (i)

analyses of the effects of changes In vertical market structure on

market equilibrium in commodity markets (with specific reference to

petroleum and copper), (ii) models of the optimal—degree of contract

indexation, and (iii) aggregate studies of "sticky prices" in

macroeconomics.




II. CONTRACTING AND MULTIPLE—PRICE SYSTEMS IN PRODUCT MARKETS

       Equilibrium Spot and Contract Trades: Static Model

      The coexistence of "predetermined" and "flexible" factors In a

market requires at least two prices. For simplicity, suppose that

contracts are identical, thereby reducing the number of prices to two ——

the   "contract price" and the "spot price." In a multiple—price system,

the decision of how much to buy (to produce) Is accompanied by a

decision of how to divide purchases (sales) between spot and contract

markets. We define a contract as an ongoing agreement to purchase a

coimnodity at a given price. Because of the definition of contracts,

shocks (unanticipated exogenous changes in demand or force majeure

interruption of contract completion) are absorbed through adjustment on

the spot market.
                                    —4—

      Buyers' Problem

      Buyers use the commodity purchased as an input in production and

are subject to random demand disturbances. They can buy on both spot

and contract markets. The tradeoff between the two types of purchasers

stems from the fact that while price is fixed for contract purchases,

spot purchases can be tailored to meet demand exactly. Once contract

purchases have been optimized (qc*), spot purchases are chosen to

maximize the expected profit 11b

              b      s    css cc*
             11 PZ(Q +Q )—PQ—PQ


where Z is the production function (Z > 0, Z < 0), and P is the output

(downstream) price. Buyers are assumed to be price—takers in the input

market.

      The first—order condition yields the standard result for inputs,

namely that the factor price and the value of marginal product are

equalized:

      Buyers are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion and

choose contract purchases qc to maximize

respectively represent the expectation and variance of the outcome
                                     —5—

conditional upon available information. The optimal contract purchase

follows from the first—order condition, and is equal to

where 11b denotes the (ex ante) profit in the absence of contracting, and

coy (pS 11b) represents the covarlance of the spot price and 11b      it is

important to note that risk aversion is not necesary for the form of

these results. Canton (1979a) puts forth a similar model in which the

incentive to offer long—term contracts stems from the influences of

cash—flow variability on a firm's costs.

      The first term in equation (4) demonstrates that desired contract

purchases depend on the spread between the contract price and the

expected spot price, the degree of buyer risk aversion, and the variance

of the spot price. An increase in the variance of the spot price,

ceteris paribus, lowers the reliance on long—term contracts. The second

term in (4) recognizes the importance of the covariance of the spot

price and ex ante profit, and its sign depends on the origin of the

shock. For example, if all shocks stemmed from the supply side,

coy (pS, 11b) < 0, and buyers could purchase through contracts even when

the quoted contract price exceeds the expected spot price. With the

addition of demand shocks, coy (pS flb) could be positive, so that

purchasers desire contracting only when the contract price is offered at

a discount to the spot price.7

        Producers' Problem

        Producers (sellers) are assumed to maximize the certainty

equivalent of profit lip, and to exhibit constant absolute risk

aversion. Their objective is to



(5) max {pcQc +             E    (p5 qS) — E C (Qc +            qS) —   - var   [pSQS_ c (QC + QS)JJ



where C is the cost function (C > 0) and                             measures the degree of risk

aversion.

        Below we formulate the solution under the polar cases of

competition and monopoly. For a competitor, the equilibrium spot price

will satisfy the condition that price equals marginal cost, while the

monopolist's analogue is the equalization of marginal revenue and

marginal cost. That is, under competition,


                 s* =       '
                                     c*+       s*

(7)          P (1FnD)=c(Q  +Q s* )

where      is the price elasticity of demand.

        For the case of competition, (5) is maximized with respect

to 0c subject to

 where lI denotes profit in the absence of contracting. The similarity

 between the general form of the optimal contract purchase (in equation

 (4)) and the optimal contract sale (in equation (9)) is clear.

 Ceteris paribus, producers prefer to sell more through long—term

contracts the greater is the excess of the contract price over the

expected spot price. With demand variability only, contracting can take

place even if the contract price is less than the spot price. With both

supply and demand shocks, the second term in (9) can be negative, so

that no contract trade occurs unless Pc > E pS

        Hence, knowledge of both buyers' and sellers' contract decisions

and of the source of the shocks is necessary to determine market

equilibrium. So that we can determine market equilibrium from the

contracting behavior of individual firms, we suppose that the upstream

and downstream industries consist of identical firms: s sellers and b

buyers. Under the assumption of rational expectations, equating

simultaneously supply and demand in the spot and contract markets yields

the following expressions for the contract price and the spot price:


                          coy (pS             +   bflb)
(10)        PC=EPS                                            and
                                          +
                               (..)           (V

(11)        Ps =    Z(5 + C) =        C'( +        S)


where      and qC denote total spot and contract volumes, respectively.
                                              —8—

       Equation (10) reveals that the expected spot price is an unbiased

predictor of the spot price only if at least one of the parties is risk—

neutral (i.e., only if y=0 or =0).                   The difference between the two

prices depends in sign and in magnitude on the correlation between the

spot price and total profits in the absence of contracting.

       When sellers are competitive, the equilibrium volume of total

contract trades is just
                            s                                 s
                      coy (P ,
                                  'p
                                 11       )   — y coy (P ,        II   )
(12)       QC =
                                      +       -p.)   varr'8

No contract trade takes place unless the right—hand side of equation

(12) is positive. In equilibrium, the extent of contracting depends on

a weighted average of the covariance of the spot price with sellers'

profits in the absence of contracting and (the opposite of) the,

covariance of the spot price with buyer's ex ante profits, with the

weights being measures of the parties' risk aversion.

       The components of the covariance terms in (12) have an intuitive

interpretation. The standard deviations of the profits in the absence

of contracting indicate the varibility of buyer and seller profits in

auction markets. Signs and magnitudes of the correlations of the spot

price with buyer and seller profits depend on the source of the

underlying shocks, that is, whether shocks come more from the demand

side or the supply side. Under reasonable assumptions about the

production function and demand curve, it can be shown that

the correlation coefficients are positive when most uncertainty stems

from the demand side, and negative when most uncertainty stems from the

supply side (see Weiner, 1985 for a derivation). We measure the

"vulnerability" of market participants when there is no contracting by
                                         —9—

the absolute value of the product of the risk aversion coefficient and

the covarlance of profits with the spot price. Some cases are reviewed

below.

        First, note that if we let p and a represent a correlation

coefficient and standard deviation, respectively, we can rewrite (12) as

                                     —
                     (OpS   11)°11       pS J)j
(12')        Qc* =
                                     +


so that contracting takes place whenever



(12a)        4Dc             >
                                 4, 1)jb
        This condition is most easily understood as follows. If only

sellers are risk—averse, then contracting takes place only if

          > 0, that is, if demand shocks are the source of uncertainty.

Similarly, if only buyers are risk—averse, contracting takes place if

uncertainty stems from the supply side (i.e., ps         < 0). More

generally, both demand— and supply—side uncertainty will be present, so

that both the source of disturbances (sign of the correlation

coefficients) and the relative vulnerability (again measured by the

absolute value of the product of the covariance of the spot price and

profits in the absence of contracting weighted by the risk aversion

parameter) are needed to determine the extent of contracting. These

results are summarized in Table I.
                                                                     TABLE   I

       Equation (12') and Table I suggest intuitively that contracts are
signed (i) when most shocks come from the supply side and buyers'

profits are more vulnerable than sellers' to spot price risk, and (ii)

when demand shocks are more important and sellers' profits are more

vulnerable.

       As a convenient summary statistic, we can write the equilibrium

fraction of trades carried out under contract a as


                              B coy (P sp-
                                        11 )   —T

                                                                  II
                   +    —             ''—1
                                      C    (F5) (var pS)


Note that this is not a "solution" for a, since a and var pS are

simultaneously determined (i.e., aa/avar P5 < 0 from (13), and

avar PS/aa > 0 by Le Chatelier's principle——the greater the fraction of

trades carried out under contracts, the more variable the market—

clearing spot price). We return to this issue later.

       In general, sellers' profits should be more vulnerable to spot

price fluctuations than buyers' profits, so long as the value of any

given intermediate purchase is sinai! relative to the value of output.8

Then, in the context of the model presented here, contracting is more

likely the more important demand shocks are relative to supply shocks.

These results are consistent with those of some previous studies. As

would be predicted by the price asynchronization model of Blanchard

(1982), prices should be more flexible in industries in early stages of

production than in finished—goods Industries. Finally, the predictions

of the model may be useful In explaining failures in obtaining

reasonable econometric estimates of price equations. Certainly,

problems with estimating such price equations with government price
                                       — 11 —




 indices   (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics data) are well known (see for

example Nordhaus; 1972; Canton, 1979a). Canton notes particularly

 that the influence of demand fluctuations on prices has been difficult

to Isolate.       rn this model, a dominance of demand fluctuations would

lead to nominal price rigidity, and precisely the Inability to estimate

demand influences on prices.

       Monopoly

       The monopolist's problem is to choose the contract price pC or

contract sales Q so as to maximize the certainty equivalent of

prof it.9 We let the producer choose pC to maxmize equatIon (5) above

subject to the condition that



(14)        qS =    R'(P)   — QC




where R denotes the marginal revenue function.

       Incorporating the information about the buyers' spot and contract

demands conditions on pC and pS, we can rewrite (5) as


                      E Ps_Pc     —   coy   s Th
(15) max         pC1 __________                      + E [P8 R'(p) —     pSQCJ

            —E C(R(P)) —           var [pS Rl(P8) — p5 QC_ C(R1(P))}}.


The contract price can be solved from the first—order condition and the

market equilibrium condition to be:

uncertainty, and the variance of the spot price, the higher is the

variance of the spot price, the lower the fraction of trades carried out

under contract.

Comparison of Competitive and Monopoly Outcomes
       It is useful to compare the monopoly and competitive solutions

under the two—price system. As long as the market can be described as

"demand—shocks—only" or "supply—shocks—only," the relationship between

the spot and contract prices is similar to that in the competitive

case. As under competition, the contract and expected spot prices are

equal when buyers are risk—neutral. That is not true, however, under

seller risk neutrality; the monopolist does not provide "contract

insurance" without additional compensation. Finally, using equations

(12) and (19), we can compare the contract volumes under competition and

monopoly. With seller risk neutrality, we obtain the usual result that

the monopoly volume is half of the competitive volume.

       The relationship between market structure and price flexibility has

figured prominently in debates in industrial organization since Means's

advancement of the "administered prices" hypothesis. Focusing on the

polar cases of competition and monopoly, we can address in the context

of our model whether, ceteris paribus, monopolists have stickier prices

than competitors. The hypothesis of a positive relationship between

industry concentration and price rigidity implies that a should be

larger under monopoly. That is, holding constant across market

structures the values of the risk aversion parameters and the

covariances of buyer and seller profits with the spot price, contracting

and price rigidity are more extensive under monopoly if

where P and P      represent the prices corresponding to the equilibrium

quantities where price equals marginal cost and marginal revenue equals

marginal cost, respectively.

     The value of the expression on the left—hand side of the inequality

in (22) is at least unity, since total competitive production must

exceed monopoly production. The expression on the right—hand side is

bounded between one and two.

     No unambiguous result can be delineated, but some special cases are

illustrative. In the case wherein marginal cost curves and demand

curves are linear, contracting (and price rigidity) is necessarily

greater under monopoly only if buyers are risk—neutral. In general, the

result depends on the slopes of the demand and marginal cost curves.

Price flexibility will be relatively greater under monopoly the steeper

is the marginal cost curve or the flatter is the demand curve.

Associating changes in marginal cost with changes in capacity

utilization, the former implies that a monopolist would be more likely

to raise prices during booms in this case.




III. CONTRACTING AND PRICE ADJUSTMENT

     Obtaining closed—form solutions for c'. and var P5 requires the

specification of functional forms for the demand and marginal cost

curves. In so doing, we chose a modeling framework that will also allow

us to consider the Impact of contracting on the "persistence" demand and

supply shocks on prices. Turnovsky (1983) has considered the

persistence effects of transitory shocks on prices in markets for

storable commodities. Recent macroeconomic models of the influence of
                                    — 15 —



labor   contracts on the behavior of wages and prices (e.g., Fischer,

1977; Taylor, 1979) have also focused on the "persistence issue and

have considered roles for stabilization policy in the presence of

contracts.

       If in the absence of storage, there were a single spot price for a

given commodity, then transitory shocks could exert no persistence;

there would only be a one—period change in the price. If the good were

sold only through long—term contracts, the persistence of transitory

fluctuations would be imbedded in the ability of contract provisions to

adjust to market conditions. With trade on both spot and contract

markets, shifts in the mix of spot and contract trades can alter the

short—run and long—run impacts of shocks on prices.

       To facilitate comparison with other studies, smoothing, we

introduce speculative stockpiling by third parties, following

Turnovsky.1° We then examine the impact of a two—price system on market

equilibrium in the presence of demand and supply disturbances. Both

contracting and storability will affect not only the Immediate impact of

transitory shocks on current—period spot prices, but also persistence of

that impact. Further, both the variance of the distribution of spot

prices will be altered.

       Total demand is the sum of consumption and inventory demands.

Price—taking, risk—neutral speculators trade in Inventories on the spot

market in anticipation of changes in price. Speculators are assumed to



                                    —
(23)         max E{((1+o)'     +1            — - I}
                                  — 16 —



where I represents the end—of—period stock level and d is the discount

rate (identical to that of the buyers and sellers). Holding stocks Is

assumed to be costly——in fact, increasingly costly——In the size of the

stock due to payments to factors fixed in the short run (e.g., storage

facilities). Thus changes in price expectations cannot be fully acted

upon instantaneously. We model such costs as quadratic, the simplest

specification of "diminishing returns;" these costs are indexed by the

parameter h."

       Maximizing (23) with respect to I yields the following demand

function for stocks:



(24)        It = h ((1+6)           —



As with most other studies since the original development by Muth

(1961), speculative holdings are a function of the expected increase in

price — taking into account the cost of adjusting stock levels.

       To obtain solutions for   and var pS we suppose that, in the

absence of shocks, the demand function is linear and of the form



(25)           =
                   a—dP,


and that the cost function is such that



(26)       C       = F +    c



so that

(27)       C'(Q) = cQ.
                                  — 17 —




Further   suppose that the market is subject to additive demand and supply

shocks       and CSt: respectively, that are Identically and independently

distributed with mean zero and variances      and    ,   respectively.
       In the competitive case, buyers and sellers carry out planned spot

purchases and sales equal to (1—c)(a—dP5) and (l—a)c'P, respectively,

where cz is an equilibrium parameter determined as before with respect to

"normal sales" (excluding speculative stockpile movements). Inventory

movements as well as demand and supply shocks are also absorbed on the

spot market. For example, an interruption in contract

supply        < 0) affects the market as follows. There Is excess demand

at the prevailing contract price, and the spot market functions to

absorb disturbances. Given an optimal choice of c, equilibrium in the

spot market requires that



                                                            —
(28) (1—cs) c P5 +       =
                                                                EtlP +


       To facilitate the solution for the spot price, we first define

lower—case p's as prices in deviation form. That is,



                   —
(29)       p =


where S is the long—run equilibrium price at which expectations are

realized. We can then rewrite equation (28) as



(30)      [(1—a) (c+d) + 2h'J         Dt —   St + hp1 + h'Etp+l
                                        — 18 —



       Under the assumption of rational expectations, we can solve the

second—order inhomogeneous difference equation in (30) by standard

methods to yield



(31)            pt =41p      +           CDCS
                                 (1—ct) (c +d) + h (2—41)


where 4'   is   the root within the unit circle of the quadratic equation

h12 + ((1—cx) (c+d) + 2h') 41 + h = 0.

       Even transitory shocks exhibit persistence effects on the spot

price, because of inventory behavior and because of the existence of

contracts. Moreover, the variance of the spot price increases

with 4', since


                                   a2   + a2
                    s   =           D       S
(32)        var P
                            ((i—a) (c+d) +

       Again, with transitory shocks, the variance of the spot price

depends on a: 3 var PS/3a > 0.          While the use of long—term contracts is

often seen as an instrument of price stability, this inequality

indicates that maintenance of contract prices in the presence of

fluctuating supply and demand increases variability in the spot

market. Equations (13) and (32) constitute a pair of nonlinear

relationships between a and var pS• These nonhinearitles can cause

problems of nonuniqueness and nonexistence of rational expectations

equilibria (see McCafferty and Driskill, 1980). Given our assumptions

of linear demand and marginal cost curves and the results In equations

(13) and (32), we can write the implicit expression for a as the

solution to
                                 — 19   —

                                                                 +d) + h   (2-)
                     C_l(PS)   (Y÷8)                               cr




It can be easily shown that the signs of the derivatives of c with

respect to the underlying parameters—measures of rIsk aversIon, the

correlations of buyer and seller profits with spot price movements, the

variability of profits in the absence of contracting, and the variances

of supply and demand shocks—are exactly as in equation (13) before.

     Three relationships between the persistence parameter ij and the

underlying structural parameters are of interest. First, since

dç/da > 0, the larger is the fraction of trades carried out under

contracts, the greater is the persistence. Second, dp/dd < 0, so that

the greater is the demand response to a change in price, the smaller is

the initial increase In price and the lower is the persistence. These

two relationships imply that Increasing the fraction of trades carried

out under contracts will increase the variance of the spot price, while

higher values of d will lead to a smaller variance of the spot

price.12 Third, since dP/dh < 0, the less costly, is stock adjustment

(and hence the greater the speculative response to expected price

changes), the greater is the persistence effect on prices of a

transitory shock.

Extension to Multiperiod Contracts

       The expression for the spot price derived above can be used in the

context of multiperiod contracts to motivate the sort of price

adjustment model suggested by Taylor (1979). Consider a contract

lasting T periods.13 Discount rates for buyers and sellers are set

equal to a common rate 5.        We consider the competitive case below; the

monopoly case is analogous.

       The analogue to equation (9) for desired contract purchases is



(34)          qC = (E0          p5J — pC          y coy (pS, b)
                          tO

                                                                         T
where the weights & are contructed so that               =   (l+o)_t/         (1+c5)

         =   1.   The sellers' case derives analogously. Equilibrium in spot
t=0

(35)         PC=(E0             t          (b÷S)
       Equation (35) illustrates the importance of expectations of the

spot price over the duration of the contract in determining the

equilibrium contract price. When buyers or sellers are risk—neutral,

the contract price is a weighted average of expected future spot

prices. Hence expectations of future demand and supply shocks can

influence the current contract price. In general, the difference

between the contract price and the weighted average of expected future

spot prices depends on sources of underlying disturbances, market

structure, and the degree of risk aversion of trading parties.

       Now consider the simple case of two—period contracts. When shocks

are transitory, we can combine equations (31) and (35) to yield the

following expression for adjustment of the contract price:



(36)        P =    (1—4))   S    + 4)             t-l +    1   t +    2 Et PS1)   +

where       =
                   Dt —     c)/((1_cx)(c'             +    d) +



        Equation   (36) provides a formal justification for the model of

contract price adjustment suggested by Taylor (1979)——in which market

participants consider lagged and expected future prices and the impact

of current—period shocks——and can be considered in three parts. First,

whether the contract price exceeds, equals, or is exceeded by the

function of the spot price and market conditions embodied in the first

two terms of (36) depends on buyer and seller risk aversion and the

covariance of the     spot       price and profits in the absence of

contracting. Second, in the first term of (36), the distribution of

weight placed on the long—run mean spot price versus that placed on the

weighted average of current, lagged, and expected future spot prices

depends on the magnitude of the persistence parameter P.                          The greater

is th persistence, the smaller is the weight placed on the long—run

price. The weights on current, lagged, and expected future spot prices

are a function of the discount rate. When                         =   0,   =      =2   =
                                                                                           4   ,   and

equal weight is placed on the three spot prices. Finally, both current
                                     — 22 —



 demand and supply shocks matter for the determination of the contract

 price in the current period.

       Note that when IP=O, equation (36) is exactly the expression for the

 contract price in the static model derived previously. The Importance

 of P in (36) indicates the role of decisions about the use of long—term

 contracts and Inventories In determining the sensitivity of the prices

on newly signed contracts to current market conditions.

       The dependence of contract prices on the persistence effects of

shocks on the spot price suggests again the importance of the

relationship among h, a, and P.       The greater is the equilibrium

fraction of trades carried out under contracts and the more sensitive is

speculative stockpiling to expected price appreciation, the larger is

the persistence parameter iP, and the greater is the weight placed on the

expected path of spot prices In determining the contract price. As

shown earlier, the extent of contracting (as determined by a ) is a

function of the variance of the spot price and the covariances of buyer

and seller profits with the spot price. The more important are demand

shocks relative to supply shocks, the larger is a, and the more gradual

is contract price adjustment to shocks.



IV. EXTENSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

       Considerable attention has been devoted by macroeconomists and

industrial economists to the problem of "sticky" or inflexible prices,

and   its   consequences for market equilibrium and the effectiveness of

stabilization policy. The search for microeconomlc foundations of non—

Walrasian outcomes in labor and product markets has spawned many studies

of contracting. Our purpose in this paper has been to emphasize the
                                  — 23 —




role   of contracts in markets (for many raw materials and basic

industrial commodities) in which long—term contractual arrangements and

spot markets coexist. These markets provide a laboratory for studies of

the behavior of prices in response to demand and supply fluctuations,

studies that can help to explain recent failures In estimating

econometric price equations.

       Our analysis has been pursued with two goals in mind——(i) to

explain the existence of contracts in product markets and their

contribution to price stickiness, and (ii) to consider the impact of

demand and supply shocks on spot prices when market trades also take

place through long—term contracts. With respect to the first point, we

find that the relative importance of contracting is endogenous,

depending on, inter alia, the variance of the spot price and the sources

of underlying fluctuations. Consistent with the findings of previous

macroeconomic studies, we find that contracting and price rigidity are

more likely the more important demand shocks are relative to supply

shocks.

       Second, we adapt our static model of the determination of contract

prices and quantities to discuss the adjustment of contract prices.

Introducing storage by speculators, we find that even transitory

disturbances exhibit persistence effects on spot prices in the presence

of contracts. Links between contracting and storage suggest a fruitful

extension in merging two strands of the recent macroeconomics literature

explaining "persistence"——that based on the role of inventories and that

based on overlapping (labor) contracts. In general, the predicted

adjustment of spot prices to transitory shocks depends on the use of
                                  — 24 —




contracts,   the ease with which speculative stocks can be adjusted, and

the source of the shocks.

       Three extensions of our results seem particularly promising. The

analysis of econometric models of price determination in commodity

markets is an obvious application of the "two—price" model presented

here. As noted earlier, many commodity markets have experienced

multiple—price regimes, most notably copper and petroleum. Equation

(31) for the spot price indicates that the intertemporal correlation of

price changes depends on the importance of nominal contracting in the

market. Moreover, the relationship between the contract price and

expected future spot prices embodied in equation (35) depends on the

same factors determining the importance of contracting (as measured

by a). Hence we would expect that markets experiencing structural

change   in terms of the source of or variance of shocks should undergo
changes in contracting structure. The change in contracting    then alters
the   time—series properties of the effects of shocks on prices and the

cross—sectional relationship between prices.

      Nowhere is this pattern more apparent than in the oil market, where

vertical integration was replaced by a two—price system in the 1970s,

with contracts signed by newly—formed state—owned production

companies. Through the first major oil shock (in 1973—74), contract

trade was supplemented by a "thin" spot market (with about five percent

of total world volume). Given the increased volatility of the market,

almost half of all trades were carried Out Ofl the spot market by the

time of the second shock in 1979—80. In the oil market of the mid—

1980s, the vast majority of trades are effectively carried out on spot

markets, with a dramatic reduction in the term of contracts still
                                            — 25 —




used.'4     Similarly, the two—price system In the copper market was

replaced over the 1970s by spot trading on the London Metals Exchange.

       These developments have important policy implications. Hubbard and

Weiner (1984) have shown that the optimal public strategic stockpile

responses to commodity price shocks depend on the persistence effects of

price changes (4'         in    equation (31)). Since persistence is an increasing

function/Of the relative importance of contracting, the optima!

stockpile policy and the effectiveness of any stockpile policy change

with the contracting regime.

       That is, the question of which price to observe is Important; one

implication of the two—price model outlined above is that the behavior

of spot and contract prices may diverge substantially from that of

"average" prices. Since a represents the optimal fraction of trades

carried Out under contracts, the weighted—average acquistion price P

satisfies

       To consider the effect on the volatility of average prices of

changes in the volatility of demand and supply, note that since

variance of the composite price to a change in the volatility of

underlying shocks may be greater or less than the response of the

variance of the spot price to that same change, depending on the

sensitivity of the contracting decision to the variance of the spot

price (i.e., depending on the risk aversion of the transactors). That

Is, the relationship between the responses to changes in the variance

the "spot" and "average" prices is likely to be unstable. Hence, price

stabilization schemes facilitated by public stockpiles will in general

be unable to stabilize "average" prices by focusing on spot prices.

     Second, in the real world, we find indexed contracts with elements

of both the contract and spot trades stylized in the previous

sections. Hence, while we have structured the model to think about the

optimal mix of individual trades carried out on auction markets and on

nominal contracts, we can interpret the results in terms of the optimal

degree of indexation of typical contracts in the industry. Indexation

of contracts corresponds to a low value of      in the preceding section.

We expect a higher degree of Indexation when (i) most shocks come from

the supply side and sellers' profits are more vulnerable (in the sense

defined before) to spot price changes, and (ii) demand shocks are more

important and buyers' profits are more vulnerable to spot price

changes. If we again assume that sellers' ex ante profits should be

more vulnerable to spot price fluctuations than buyer's profits, then

indexation is likely to be more extensive the more important are cost

shocks relative to demand shocks.

     Two   hypotheses   can be readily tested using panel data on the

different industries. First, cyclical price sensitivity should be
                                  — 27 —




greater   as aggregate cost shocks become more important relative to

aggregate demand shocks. Specifically, changes in input prices should

be "passed through" more rapidly as cost shocks become more important.

Second, since seller vulnerability to price fluctuations should be

greatest early in the chain of production, price flexibility should be

greatest in Intermediate—goods Industries whose output goes to another

Intermediate—goods industry rather than to final consumption.'5

     A third application of the two—price approach is to macroeconomic

studies of aggregate price flexibility. An extension to a dynamic

analysis of sticky prices Is logical, as "contracting" Is a

manifestation of the notion that prices are in some sense "costly to

adjust." This focus on costs of adjustment has appeared in Barro

(1972), Sheshlnski and Weiss (1977), and Rotemberg (1982). In this

literature, such costs are hypothesized to be of two   types.   First,

there is some (fixed) cost attached to changing prices, including, for

example, any physical costs of changing list prices. The second cost

relates to any negative effects of price changes on firms'

"reputations." Our model provides an alternative explanation for price

rigidity, and our use of nominal contracts does not rely on menu costs

or on a group of agents' being non—maximizers. Our model is similar in

many ways to the structure used by Roteinberg (1982), though, in our

framework, the analogue to costs of adjustment (i.e., the determinants

of c) differs across industries, so that treating such costs as

identical across Industries to facilitate aggregation for time—series

studies may pose a serious difficulty.

     While we have concentrated our attention on multiple—price regimes

in Individual markets for primary or Industrial commodities, the
                                — 28 —



approach has Important implications for aggregate models of prices and

quantities. If contractual arrangements In product markets are

endogenous, then models of price adjustment designed to examine the

impacts of demand and supply shocks on market equilibrium and the

potential for effective policy intervention must go further than

determining prices as a simple markup over standard unit input costs.

Moreover, to the extent that price rigidIty" implied by contracting is

the result of an optimizing process, profitable opportunities for policy

intervention (to alter the variances of prices or output) may be

lacking.

'Indeed, sticky product prices appear to antedate sticky wages (see the
    early discussions in Mills, 1927, and Tucker, 1938).
    Gordon (1981) provides a review of macroeconomic models of output
    and price adjustment.

2Impllclt contract theory has been used to rationalize "Keynesian
    unemployment" (Okun, 1981; Harris and Holmstrom, 1983). Formal
    models of the influence of labor contracts on price flexibility can
    be found in Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1979). In such models, the
    predetermination of prices for some given period provides a role for
    stabilization policy. An alternative approach is suggested by
    Blanchard (1982)——namely that price adjustment in the aggregate
    appears gradual because individual price adjustments are
    desynchronized.

3rhe empirical model In Rotemberg (1982) offers a test of the importance
    of customer markets, justifying price stickiness because of costly
    price adjustment (in the sense of upsetting buyer—seller
    relationships).

4Price dispersion can occur for two other reasons: (I) imperfect
    information about prices, combined with costly search and
    heterogeneous buyers and sellers; and (ii) price discrimination.
    The first is likely to be important for differentiated retail goods
    (Pratt, Wise, and Zeckhauser, 1979), but less so for homogeneous
    commodities, whose prices are widely quoted. The second is illegal
    under U.S. antitrust law, unless cost differences can be
    demonstrated.

5copper and petroleum are oft—cited examples here; others worth mention
    are coal, natural gas, aluminum, iron ore, and oil tanker
    services. A small literature has developed on the two—price system
    In the copper market (see Fisher, Cootner, and BaIly, 1972; McNicoi,
    1975; Mackinnon and Olewiler, 1980; and DeKuljper, 1983). Although
    the most dramatic episodes of spot—contract price divergence has
    occurred in the oil market, analytical work has been scarce (see
    Nordhaus, 1980; Verleger, 1982; Bohi, 1983; Hubbard and Weiner,
    1983).

6Stigler and Kindahl (1970) showed that many Industrial commodities are
    purchased on contracts whose typical duration is at least a year.

7Carlton (1979a) considers this issue from the sellers' point of view in
    the context of the informational value of contracts. If all
    uncertainty exists on the demand side, price discounts for long—term
    contracts can be traced to this information role.

81n addition, as goods progress from raw materials to finished output, a
    progressively larger share of the total cost reflects labor cost.
    To the extent that wages are sticky, sellers' profits are more
    vulnerable to spot price risk than those of buyers.

9Given the symmetrical structure of the model, the monopsony case is
    analogous.

'0In many markets, middlemen (e.g., petroleum refiners, grain
    processors) hold most of the inventory. In an empirical study of
    the copper market, Bresnahan and Suslow (1985) examined the impact
    of changes In the relationship between spot and contract prices on
    inventory behavior.

"For a more general intertemporal optimizing model of inventory
    behavior under uncertainty, see Hubbard and Weiner (1984).

'2ExtensIon of the model to consider serially correlated shocks
    amplifies the results presented here. For dIscussIon of shocks
    following autoregressive processes, see Hubbard and Weiner (1984); a
    comparison to a one—price model can be made by seeing also Blinder
    (1982).

'3We take the contract duration of T periods as given here. In general,
    the length of the contract Is also a choice variable for the
    negotiating parties (see for example Roberts, 1980).

'4For a more detailed discussion of the two—price system In the world
    oil market, see Hubbard (1984).

15PrelImlnary tests along these lines using panel data on manufacturing
    industries have produced results favorable to the predictions of the
    model; see Doinowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen (1985).
