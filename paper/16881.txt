The Effects of Student Coaching in College: An Evaluation of a Randomized Experiment
in Student Mentoring

                                              ABSTRACT

College completion and college success often lag behind college attendance. One theory as to why
students do not succeed in college is that they lack key information about how to be successful or fail
to act on the information that they have. We present evidence from a randomized experiment which
tests the effectiveness of individualized student coaching. Over the course of two separate school
years, InsideTrack, a student coaching service, provided coaching to students from public, private,
and proprietary universities. Most of the participating students were non-traditional college students
enrolled in degree programs. The participating universities and InsideTrack randomly assigned students
to be coached. The coach contacted students regularly to develop a clear vision of their goals, to guide
them in connecting their daily activities to their long term goals, and to support them in building skills,
including time management, self advocacy, and study skills. Students who were randomly assigned
to a coach were more likely to persist during the treatment period, and were more likely to be attending
the university one year after the coaching had ended. Coaching also proved a more cost-effective method
of achieving retention and completion gains when compared to previously studied interventions such
as increased financial aid.

Introduction


         While college attendance rates have risen dramatically over the past four decades, college

completion has not kept pace. For example, while the percentage of 23-year olds with some

college experience increased by 31 percent between 1971 and 1999, degree completion by this

age increased by only 4 percent (Turner 2004). Part of this decline is due to students taking

more time to complete degrees (e.g. Turner 2004, Dynarski and Deming 2008), yet whereas the

U.S. previously led the world in the percentage of the population having bachelor’s degrees, it

has now lost that leadership. Over the last three decades, cohort-based completion rates have

increased by 2-3 percentage points across cohorts in the US while other OECD countries such as

the UK and France have seen 10-15 percentage point increases in completion rates (OECD

2007).

         These concerns about educational attainment have led to increased scrutiny of college

completion and movements to hold universities accountable for graduation rates. Foundations

and policymakers have increased their focus on improving persistence and graduation rates. For

example, President Obama’s 2009, 2010 and 2011 State of the Union addresses have all touched

on college completion, most notably in 2009 when he said, “This country needs and values the

talents of every American. That is why we will provide the support necessary for you to

complete college and meet a new goal: by 2020, America will once again have the highest

proportion of college graduates in the world” (Obama, 2009). This focus on completion rates is

not new; universities have long been concerned with low completion rates and have actively

searched for strategies to increase college persistence and completion. One such effort which is

the focus of our paper has been the use of mentors and coaches to facilitate student persistence

and completion.

                                                                                                 1
        The use of college counselors is a well established practice in higher education. Work by

Tinto (1975, 1998) on the social and academic factors leading to dropout and recent studies (e.g.

Goldrick-Rab 2010, Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, and Sanbonmatsu 2010) highlight how

personalized support and advising might bridge students’ informational gaps and help students

complete tasks they might not otherwise complete.

        Our paper focuses on coaching, a form of college mentoring.             InsideTrack is an

independent provider of coaching services that incorporates a combination of methodologies,

curricula, and technologies.    InsideTrack matches students to potential coaches, and these

coaches regularly contact their students to provide help and support as they are starting a

semester of study and as they continue through their first year in school. In coaches’ interactions

with students, they work to help students prioritize their studies, plan how they can be successful,

and identify and overcome barriers to students’ academic success. Specifically, the coaches

focus significant time assessing the student’s life outside of school, which InsideTrack has found

to be the leading influencer on student persistence and completion. Topics such as personal time

commitments (work scheduling), primary care-giving responsibilities, and financial obligations

are common during a student-coach interaction.

        Over the past decade, InsideTrack has provided student coaching at a variety of public,

private, and proprietary colleges. The company’s model focuses on partnering with universities

to deliver its mentoring program. Inside Track provides required people, processes and

technologies. The economies of scale the company realizes from serving multiple institutions

enables it to make investments that are typically out of reach for individual colleges and

universities.




                                                                                                  2
        Our data come from InsideTrack. We requested data from InsideTrack for the 2003-2004

school years and the 2007-2008 school years.1 During these two years, InsideTrack conducted a

total of 17 different randomized studies in cooperation with participating universities.

InsideTrack wanted to convince the participating universities of its effectiveness, so to eliminate

bias, InsideTrack used randomization in each of these cohorts to determine with which students

they worked.       Within institutions, InsideTrack randomly divided eligible students into two

balanced groups and then allowed the respective institution to choose which set of students

would receive support. These pseudo-lotteries enable us to compare the set of students who

received coaching to those who did not and to create unbiased estimates of the impact of the

services.2

        We find that retention and completion rates were greater in the coached group. This held

true for every length of time following enrollment.              After six months, students in the coached

group were 5.2 percentage points more likely to still be enrolled than students in the non-coached

group (63.2 percent vs. 58.0 percent). At the end of 12 months, the effect was 5.3 percentage

points. The effects persisted for at least one more year after the coaching had concluded. After

18 months, there was a 4.3 percentage point increase in college retention and after 24 months,

there was still a 3.4 percentage point treatment effect from the coaching. These differences are

all statistically significant over a 99 percent confidence interval. Moreover, these results do not

  InsideTrack worked with more than just these 17 cohorts during these two years. The 17 cohorts represent all of
the cases where lotteries were used in these two years. The research team selected the two years used in the
research. We chose the 2004 cohorts so that we could make some comparisons to the 2003/2004 Beginning
Postsecondary Study. We chose the 2007 cohorts as they are the most recent cohort for whom we observe 24-month
retention rates.

  InsideTrack also worked with additional cohorts in the two years upon which we focus. In these other cohorts, the
universities or colleges wanted InsideTrack to serve all students at their campus rather than a subset. In order to
identify the effects of the program, we focus on the 17 cohorts where lotteries were used.

change when we control for age, gender, ACT score, high school GPA, SAT score, on- or off-

campus residence, receipt of a merit scholarship, Pell Grant awards, math and English

remediation.    For three cohorts for which we have degree completion data, we find that

graduation rates increased by four percentage points. All of these estimated effects represent the

intention to treat, and given that not all students selected for the treatment actually participated in

the treatment, estimates of the effect of the treatment on the treated are likely much higher.




II.    Background on Student Coaching



College Retention Studies

       College retention has long been the focus of research in sociology, education, and

economics, and the relationship between student and institutional characteristics and college

graduation rates has been a frequent topic in the academic literature (e.g. Tinto 1975, 1998;

Gansemer-Topf and Schuh 2006 ). The academic literature has identified several barriers which

could potentially reduce graduation rates. For example, one direction of research has largely

focused on financial barriers and liquidity constraints (e.g. Dynarski and Deming 2010, Belley

and Lochner 2008) or students’ incentives (e.g. Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos 2006). These

studies often focus on identifying the effects of additional financial aid on students’ persistence

and graduation (e.g. Dynarski 2010, Bettinger 2004).

       There are other lines of research which are germane to our study of college mentorship.

College mentorship has elements of academic preparation, information gathering, and social

integration. For example, one of the goals of a college mentor is to help a student academically



                                                                                                     4
prepare for their courses. Academic preparation has long been acknowledged as a contributing

factor to college retention (e.g. Adelman & Gonzalez 2006). Studies of college remediation (e.g.

Calcagno and Long 2008, Bettinger and Long 2008) have attempted to identify whether

academic remediation can improve students’ college outcomes.          In college mentoring, the

mentors often counsel students both on how to acquire better study skills and on how to identify

additional academic resources at their respective institutions.

       Another related line of study comes from the emerging research in behavioral economics.

Recent studies have focused on the complexity of processes that students face and the

information upon which they make decisions (e.g. Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, and

Sanbanmatsu 2010). Students often need a “nudge” (Thaler 2008) to complete complex tasks.

In higher education, it is often assumed that course requirements provide that nudge or that

students are sufficiently self-motivated to not need external stimuli. College graduation rates

show that that assumption might not be true; student coaching might be a mechanism to “nudge”

students. One of the goals of student coaching is to motivate the students to complete tasks.

       A final set of related research focuses on students’ feelings of separation and exclusion

and how perceived separation might contribute to drop-out rates. Tinto (1975) articulated a

theory of retention which suggests that feelings of separation lead to students dropping out.

Researchers have attempted to identify ways to decrease students’ feelings of separation (e.g.

Bloom and Sommo 2005). Student coaching may be a way for universities to reach out to

students who may not otherwise be connected to their respective institutions.

       There are a number of related interventions which attempt to influence students in

multiple dimensions. For example, Bloom and Sommo (2005) examined learning communities.

Learning communities enroll a cohort of undergraduate students in a common set of courses and



                                                                                                5
often have these students reside near each other. The idea is to create a “community” where the

students will not feel isolated. While the communities in this study led to improved academic

performance, they did not increase college persistence.       Scrivener et al’s 2008 study of a

freshman learning community found that students randomly assigned to the treatment group

moved through remedial courses more quickly, took and passed more courses and earned more

credits in their first semester than students in the control group. Two years later, they were also

more likely to be enrolled in college.

       Other interventions have focused on improving the efficacy of students’ academic habits,

time management and study skills. For example, Zeidenberg, Jenkins and Calcagno (2007) found

that enrollment in a student success course (classes that focus on time management, note taking,

learning styles and long term planning) at Florida community colleges corresponded to an

increase in persistence rates of eight percentage points. Other studies (e.g. Kern, Fagley, &

Miller 1998; Robbins et al 2004) that has shown a positive link between productive study habits

and cumulative GPA and college persistence.

       In recent years, several educational interventions have attempted to use college

counseling as a means for improving college outcomes. However, treatments identified as

“counseling” or “advising” vary greatly- some are strictly academic, others focus on study skills

and social needs. Some treatments employ school personnel while others test the efficacy of

utilizing third party providers.

       The need for student support in college has been well documented. Research has found

that many community college students have little knowledge of course requirements and are

unsure if their courses will meet requirement needs (Goldrick-Rab, 2010). Deil-Amen and

Rosenbaum (2003) note that such structured advising is advantageous to students with less social



                                                                                                 6
know-how (first generation college students and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds).

They find that such students often do not know that they need help, don’t take the initiative to

seek it out or don’t know what questions to ask.

       Additionally, traditional college counseling programs are unable to provide support for

all students. A study of counselors at community colleges conducted by the American College

Counseling Association found that counselors report high student-to-counselor ratios. Fifty-five

percent of schools have counselor to student ratios between 1 per 1500 and 1 per 3500

(Gallagher 2010).

       The literature on the effects of college advising on retention is growing. A few rigorous

studies have recently been conducted. One study (Scrivener & Weiss 2009) studied the effect of

enhanced counseling at two community colleges in Ohio. They found that students randomly

assigned to an intervention consisting of increased counseling (meeting with a program

counselor twice a term for two terms) and a small stipend (to incentivize students’ attendance in

this more frequent, intensive advising) registered for classes at a higher rate than did students in

the control group. The effects dissipated after the intervention had ended.

       Brock and Richburg-Hayes (2006) investigation of the Opening Doors Scholarship

program in Louisiana tested the effects of financial incentives and individual college counseling.

Students could receive as much as $1000 per semester for their academic performance. College

counselors followed up with students and reminded them of the incentive. Opening Doors

students signed up for more credits than those in the treatment group, they were more successful

in passing courses and they persisted in school in greater numbers.

       Angrist, Lang and Oreopoulos (2009) examined the effects of financial incentives and

support services on academic achievement and persistence. Students were randomized into three



                                                                                                  7
treatment groups and a control group. The first treatment group was offered a range of support

services including access to mentoring by older students and additional academic support. The

second group was eligible to receive a substantial financial fellowship. The third treatment

group was offered a combination of services and financial incentives. The authors found that

students who were in the group receiving the combination of financial incentives and support

services benefited the most. That group earned more credits, had higher GPAs and had lower

levels of academic probation over the course of the year. The effect on grades persisted into the

second year, after the program had finished. There was no impact on grades found for the

services only group and the students who received the fellowship only showed a small increase

in grades. Importantly, these results were driven only by significant effects on female students;

male students showed no increases in retention or academic success.

       These previous studies provide a rich context for the current investigation. While these

studies parallel this study in important ways, most of the prior rigorous research on the effects of

college counseling has included other factors, most notably financial incentives. While these

studies suggest that advising can be an effective strategy for improving college success, the

effect of trained one-on-one counselors on retention has not been studied by itself.



Background on InsideTrack

       The motivating principle at InsideTrack is that student coaching in a student’s

educational career can lead to engagement, learning, retention and an increased probability of

completing a degree.    InsideTrack began offering services in the 2000-2001 school year and has

coached more than 250,000 students nationally. The company first tested its coaching program

by offering “free academic strategy sessions” to students at Stanford and UC Berkeley. Building



                                                                                                  8
on the success of these initial coaching curricula, the company partnered with universities to

provide coaching to their incoming students. InsideTrack is now the largest provider of student

coaching in the country, employing hundreds of coaches who work with thousands of students

nationwide.

        As part of InsideTrack’s services, InsideTrack wanted to demonstrate its success to its

partner universities.      The universities gave a list of potential students to InsideTrack. Each

school determined the criteria for inclusion and the size of the sample and selected students

according to their own priorities. While most schools assigned a representative sample of new

entrants, there was some heterogeneity in the assignment systems. Some schools focused on

full-time students; others assigned part-time students. Some assigned upperclassmen; others

assigned new entrants. One school assigned athletes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of its

program, InsideTrack randomly divided the students into two groups while monitoring the

randomization to make sure that the two groups were balanced across observable characteristics.

After balancing the groups, InsideTrack allowed its partner organization to choose which of the

two groups would receive counseling and coaching services.3                        These groupings allowed

universities to monitor and to evaluate ex-post the efficacy of InsideTrack.

        Students were then randomly assigned by InsideTrack to a “coach.” The coach presented

him or herself as a representative of both InsideTrack and the partner institution. InsideTrack

carefully selected these coaches and trained them to work with students in identifying strategies

for success. The coaches call their students regularly and in some cases have access to course

syllabi, transcripts, and additional information on students’ performance and participation in

specific courses. InsideTrack uses this additional information in a set of predictive algorithms

3
 In some cases, the partner organization wanted a smaller control group. In these cases, InsideTrack showed the
balance of the two groups and had the respective institutions certify that they were balanced.


                                                                                                                  9
that assess each student’s daily status for the purpose of reaching out to them on the right issues

at the right times. Because of this background knowledge, conversations between coaches and

students are both individualized and focused on success in school. Coaches generally work with

students over two semesters although some students were part-time students enrolled in a single

course. Students have the option to participate or not when contacted by the coach. Coaches

contact students via phone, email, text messages and social networking sites. All of the students,

regardless of whether they opted to participate in the coaching, are included in our analysis. The

goal of the college coach was to encourage persistence and completion by helping students find

ways to overcome both academic and “real-life” barriers and to identify strategies for success.

Because InsideTrack has worked with a variety of private, public, and proprietary institutions,

lessons from InsideTrack may be more generalizeable than studies of a particular institution.



III.     Data and Empirical Methodology



Data

         To evaluate InsideTrack’s program, we requested the academic records for all of the

students who were invited to work with InsideTrack during the 2003-2004 and 2007-2008 school

years. During those two years, InsideTrack measured the performance of 13,555 students across

eight different higher education institutions, including two- and four-year schools and public,

private not-for-profit, and proprietary colleges.4 The students were randomly assigned in 17

lotteries – five occurring in the 2003-2004 school year and 12 in the 2007-2008 school year.

Across these 17 cohorts, Inside Track randomly assigned 8,049 to receive services. The other

4
  To protect the respective institutions and their strategies for retention and recruitment, Inside Track did not reveal
the names of these colleges to the research team.


                                                                                                                       10
5,506 did not receive InsideTrack coaching services. All other services to the students (i.e.

support from academic counselors, access to tutoring on campus) remained the same for both

groups of students.



       In Table 1, we report basic descriptive statistics for the control group and the differences

(with their standard errors) for the treatment group. In terms of descriptive characteristics, the

profile of students is weighted more toward non-traditional college students. For example, the

average age of students is about 31. Only about 25 percent of students are under the age of 23.

Unlike higher education throughout the United States, the sample of students is slightly more

male (51 percent) than female.

       As the fourth column of Table 1 illustrates, the data are somewhat uneven across sites.

The most common variable across sites was gender, which we observed in 15 of the lotteries.

Age (8 lotteries), SAT (4 lotteries), and campus living conditions (4 lotteries) are the next most

common variables.

       Random assignment should ensure that our treatment groups are balanced and

comparable. As we explained, InsideTrack randomly divided lists of students provided by the

partner schools into two groups. InsideTrack had the same data we have when they did the

lottery, so in many cases, the balancing occurred on just one or two student characteristics. Once

the lists were divided, the schools then chose which group received coaching and which group

received the control (no additional services) treatment. While one might expect some small

discrepancies, we should largely observe that there are no significant differences between the

control and treatment groups. As shown in Table 1, this is the case. In the sample taken as a

whole, there were no significant differences between the coached group and the non-coached



                                                                                                11
group on any of the observable characteristics (gender, age, SAT scores or on- or off-campus

residence). Similarly, these variables were missing in comparable proportions of the coached

and non-coached groups; there were no significant differences in the information available for

the two groups. Because of our sample sizes, we have sufficient power to identify even small

differences in the groups.      Hence our failure to find differences is an affirmation of the

randomization.

       To further demonstrate the balance of the treatment and control groups, we can also

examine the balance of student characteristics by lottery. Table 2 does exactly this. In most

cases, we know little about the overall sample; the lotteries differed on the number of observable

characteristics recorded (ranging from one to 14). For each lottery, we tested the difference

between the control and treatment groups. The effectiveness of the randomization holds when

examining each lottery individually; of the 73 characteristics compared over the 17 lotteries, only

one revealed a significant difference between the coached and non-coached groups at the 90

percent confidence level. Had we used a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have found

no differences in any of the lotteries.

       Finally, Figures 1-3 graph kernel density estimates of the age distributions, SAT scores,

and high school grade point averages of both the treatment and control groups. For each

variable, the distributions for control and treatment groups are similar.       These similarities

validate the randomization making it possible to identify the effects solely through comparing

coached and non-coached groups within each lottery.

       Partner universities also provided data on student persistence after six, twelve, eighteen,

and twenty-four months. In some cases, partner institutions provided additional information on

students’ degree completion. We only track persistence at the partner colleges, but given that



                                                                                                12
public policies are focused on retention at the institutional level, tracking persistence at this level

is important for public policies and institutional success.



Empirical Strategy

            Because the proposed treatment was administered using randomization, simple

comparisons of participants in the treatment and control groups can identify the relative effects

of the interventions. We estimate the “intent-to-treat” (ITT) effect using equation 1:



      (1)      yij = δ + β*COACHi + αj*Lotteryj + bXi + εij



where y is an outcome for individual i who participated in lottery j. COACH represents whether

the individual was randomized into the treatment coaching group. We also include fixed effects

for the student participation in a specific lottery, and X is additional controls for variables such as

gender, age, high school GPA, and school type. The outcome of interest is college persistence,

measured in six month increments from the start of the treatment. Our standard errors control for

heteroskedasticity. As we mentioned above, many of our variables are available for one cohort,

but not another. In these cases, we include a dummy variable for each variable indicating

whether it is missing or not (e.g. a variable for gender missing, a variable for age missing) while

substituting either the mean (for continuous variables) or a value of zero (for binary variables) to

IV.         Empirical Results




                                                                                                    13
       In Table 3, we report our baseline results. Each column focuses on retention, as reported

to InsideTrack by the colleges. We look at retention in six month increments. In Panel A, we

report the baseline differences between coached and uncoached students without any controls

except for the lottery fixed effects. In Panel B, we add controls for gender, age, ACT score, high

school GPA, degree program, living on campus, Pell grant receipt, prior remediation experience,

SAT score, and controls for missing values of covariates. The sample size changes across

because of data availability from the individual schools.

       The baseline persistence rate after six months is 58 percent. This persistence rate is lower

than that of the overall population, possibly due to the fact that many of these students are part-

time students or older non-traditional students. In contrast to the uncoached persistence rate of

58 percent, the retention rate among coached students was 63 percent.            The difference is

significant over a 99 percent confidence interval. The relative effect is about a 9 percent increase

in retention.   When we control for covariates, the treatment effect is constant at about 5

percentage points.

       In Column 2, we examine 12 month retention. Here the persistence rates for coached and

non-coached students were 48.8 percent and 43.5 percent respectively. The treatment effect does

not change as we include covariates in Panel B. The estimated effect represents a 12 percent

increase in college retention.

       The results after 6 and 12 months occur at a time when, in most cases, the treatment is

still active. Coached students during this period are receiving phone calls from their coaches.

Columns 3 and 4 show the results after 18 and 24 months. By this point, the coaches are no

longer contacting the students. The treatment is over, yet we still find effects. After 18 months,

the treatment effect was 4.3 percentage points representing a 15 percent increase in retention in



                                                                                                 14
this sample, and after 24 months, the treatment effect was 3.4 percentage points representing a 14

percent increase in persistence. These differences are all statistically significant over a 99

percent confidence interval. Moreover, these results do not change when we control for age,

gender, ACT score, high school GPA, SAT score, on- or off-campus residence, receipt of a merit

scholarship, Pell Grant awards, math and English remediation.

       For a subsample of students (3 lottery cohorts), we observe whether the student

completed a degree within four years of the start of the treatment. InsideTrack worked with a

variety of students, and degree completion could mean the completion of a certificate, an

associate’s degree, or a bachelor’s degree.        Across the three lottery cohorts, the average

completion rate among the control group is 31 percent. The treatment effect is 4 percentage

points and is statistically significant over a 90 percent confidence interval.

       These graduation results only strengthen our results on retention. In our analysis in Table

3, we have only included students who are were attending the university after six, 12, 18, or 24

months. Some students may have completed a degree within the first six to twelve months, and

these students would not appear to be attending. Our enrollment data did not include these

individuals who might have already graduated. If we were to amend our results in Table 3 by

redefining persistence as being persistence at time X or eventual graduation, then the estimated

effects become slightly stronger.

       These effects on persistence (and completion) are large when compared to other

interventions. Goldrick-Rab (2011) examined a randomized experiment where students were

given money for attending college without seeing any impact on persistence. Other studies of

persistence find that need-based financial aid can modestly improve college persistence (e.g.

Bettinger 2004, 2010). These papers find that retention rates increase by 3 percentage points per



                                                                                               15
$1000 of aid. In her study of merit-based aid, Dynarski found that full tuition scholarships in

Georgia led to 5-11 percentage point increases in college persistence. In the case of the Georgia

scholarships, the average expenditure was roughly $2500 per year. There is no evidence that the

effects disappear or persist once students are no longer eligible for aid. Over this period of time,

InsideTrack charged roughly $500 per semester. The effects are stronger in InsideTrack and

show persistence at least one year following the end of the treatment.



Robustness

        The balance in the randomization and the failure of covariates to reduce the treatment

effect suggest that the results are somewhat robust. One worry might be that a single lottery or

single year could somehow account for the treatment effects. In Table 4, we estimate treatment

effects separately for each lottery. We focus on the 12-month retention rate and the 24-month

retention rate.

        All of the lotteries show positive treatment effects after 12 months except for two (lottery

12 and lottery 17). The positive treatment effects are somewhat uniform around the average

treatment effect of 5 percentage points. Two lotteries show effects in excess of 10 percentage

points. Nine of the observed effects are statistically significant within the lotteries.

        After 24 months, we only observe treatment effects in 11 of the 17 lotteries. Among the

treatment effects after 24 months that we observe, four are positive and statistically significant

with the maximum observed effect around 6.6 percentage points.             Five are positive but not

statistically significant with three of these five being larger in magnitude than the average

treatment effect across all sites. Two are negative with the lowest observed effect at -1.7

percentage points.



                                                                                                 16
        The lesson from Table 4 is that the treatment effects are not arising because of one

specific lottery. The observed effects are quite similar across sites. Broadly speaking the results

suggest that the program is having a consistent effect across sites.

        Another possibility is to check whether there are differences in treatment effects across

years. If, for example, InsideTrack were to have different levels of effectiveness in different

types of schools, we might expect some differences in treatment effects depending on whether

InsideTrack’s client base is similar across years. If these differences are large enough, then one

year’s impacts might explain the overall effects, but as we show in Table 5, the effects are

balanced across years. Except in one case (2004 cohorts after 24 months), the treatment effects

are all positive and significant for both samples across the different time horizons. The effects

appear somewhat smaller in the case of the 2007 cohort although the differences are not

statistically different except in the estimates of retention after six months. The effects seem to be

somewhat balanced over time suggesting that the program’s effects are not being driven by one

year.



Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects

        In Table 6, we investigate whether the effects differ for males and females. In Panel A,

we report the effects for females, and in Panel B, we report the effects for males. After six

months, the treatment effects were 2.5 percentage points for females and 6.1 percentage points

for males. The difference is statistically significant. After 12 months, the treatment effects are

4.5 and 5.4 percentage points for females and males respectively. After 18 months, the treatment

effects are 3.3 and 4.7 percentage points for females and males respectively. The impacts of

coaching are not significantly different in persistence after 12 or 18 months. The impacts after



                                                                                                  17
24 months are 2.2 and 4.7 percentage points for females and males respectively.            These

differences are statistically significant.

        The difference between the non-coached and coached groups was always greater for

males than for females. While males persisted at rates lower than their female peers, student

coaching had larger effects for males. Two of the four differences in treatment effects were

statistically significant. Male completion rates typically lag behind females and have been

somewhat insensitive to interventions. There appears to be some evidence that the effect is larger

for males suggesting that this student coaching could reduce gender gaps in completion.

        In Table 7, we examine the effects of the program for different age groups. We find that

the estimated treatment effects have similar magnitudes across different age groups.          The

treatment effects are about 3.7 percentage points for students 30 and under after six months and

about 6.2 percentage points for students older than 30.    The treatment effects are 5.2 and 4.4

percentage points respectively after 12 twelve months. After 18 months, the treatment effects are

4.0 and 3.4 percentage points for students 30 and under and over 30 respectively. After 24

months, the treatment effects are 4.1 and 2.4 percentage points respectively. All of the estimates

are positive and only the treatment effect on older students after 24 months is statistically

insignificant.



V.      Conclusion

        Oftentimes in higher education, we assume that students know how to behave. We

assume that they know how to study, how to prioritize, and how to plan. However, given what

we know about rates of college persistence, this is an assumption that should be called into

question. Across all sectors of higher education, more needs to be known about how to increase



                                                                                               18
college persistence. Literature in economics, education, and sociology suggests that student

coaching may be one way to help students succeed in college.

       We find exactly this. While coaching was taking place during the first year, coached

students were about 5 percentage points more likely to persist in college. This represents a 9 to

12 percent increase in retention. We also find that the effect of coaching on persistence does not

disappear after the treatment. Coached students were 3-4 percentage points more likely to persist

after 18 months and 24 months. These represented roughly a 15 percent increase in college

retention among our sample. All of these effects were statistically significant. For the three

campuses for which we have degree completion data, we find that coached students had

graduation rates four percentage points higher than uncoached students after four years.

       These results are highly supportive of the potential of student coaching. When we

compared the costs and benefits of student coaching to programs that target financial aid, we find

that student coaching leads to larger effects than financial aid and are much less costly to

implement. The persistence of the effects after the treatment period and impact on completion

only increases the cost effectiveness.

       The results also shed light on recent interventions which included a counseling

component. For example, in the Opening Doors initiative, students were provided financial

incentives and counseling. While economists have stressed the incentives as being important in

the observed effects, the regular contact from a college counselor may have been the operative

mechanism by which effects occurred.

       Additionally, Angrist, Oreopoulos and Lang (2006) finds that students who had access to

incentives and counseling had higher academic performance in college. They, however, did not

find any effect of counseling by itself. There are two key differences between InsideTrack and



                                                                                               19
the intervention studied by Angrist et. al. One is that the counseling was voluntary in the

treatment studied by Angrist et. al.    Students had to find the counselors.        In the case of

InsideTrack, the coaching remains voluntary but the counselors attempt to find the students and

provide both proactive and continuing outreach to the students. The outreach by counselors was

also present in the Opening Doors experiment. Another key difference is that the advisers in the

Angrist et al study were trained upper class students, not full-time coaches and were not

supported by the process and technology infrastructure that InsideTrack utilizes.

       Our study is one of the first studies to use random assignment to evaluate the effects of

student coaching, and additional study is warranted. Research in other educational evaluations

(e.g. Dee 2004, Bettinger and Long 2004) suggests that the traits of high school and college

instructors influence student outcomes. It would be interesting to know if there are specific

characteristics of the college coaches which increase their efficacy. We also do not know the

specific types of coaching services and the specific actions of coaches which are most effective

in motivating students.

       Further study can also shed light on how student coaching might affect other student

populations. Our study includes public, private, and proprietary institutions, and it includes a

broad range of students including students who are pursuing associate’s degrees, and bachelor’s

degrees. While the sample with whom InsideTrack works is more similar to the broad range of

college students, we cannot observe all of the unique characteristics of students in our samples,

and even if we could, we do not have enough power to identify the effects on important

subgroups. We do have power to identify the effects on males and females and younger and

older students. We find that the effects do not vary by age. The effects on older students and

younger students are similar. While the effects are positive for both males and females, we do



                                                                                               20
find some evidence that the effect is larger for males. As such, it could reduce some of the

disparities in college completion that exist by gender.
