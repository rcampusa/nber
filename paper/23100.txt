Provider Incentives and Healthcare Costs: Evidence from Long-Term Care Hospitals
Liran Einav, Amy Finkelstein, and Neale Mahoney
NBER Working Paper No. 23100
January 2017
JEL No. D22,I11,L21

                                         ABSTRACT

We study the design of provider incentives in the post-acute care setting – a high-stakes but
under-studied segment of the healthcare system. We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs)
and the large (approximately$13,000) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a patient's
stay reaches a threshold number of days. The descriptive evidence indicates that discharges
increase substantially after the threshold, and that the marginal patient discharged after the
threshold is in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and behavioral
response in a high mortality population, we are unable to detect any compelling evidence of an
impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules,
we estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge decisions. When we
conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that
an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about $2,100 per admission, or about 5%
of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate substantially greater savings,
but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our
results highlight how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare spending,
without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.

1       Introduction
Healthcare spending is one of the largest scal challenges facing the U.S. federal government. In
2014, the U.S. federal government spent $1.1 trillion on public healthcare programs (BEA, 2015)
and the CBO projects that spending will grow to $2.0 trillion by 2026 (CBO, 2016). Within the
healthcare system, post-acute care (PAC) is an under-studied sector, with large stakes for both
spending and patient health.
    Post-acute care is the term used for formal care provided to help patients recover from a surgery
or some other acute care event. Medicare spending on PAC is substantial, about $60 billion in 2013,
or about 20% more than the much-studied Medicare Part D program. PAC spending is growing
faster than overall Medicare spending. PAC spending accounts for almost three-quarters of the
unexplained geographic variation in Medicare spending (Newhouse et al., 2013). The quality of
post-acute care has potentially important consequences for patient health; over 40% of hospital
patients are discharged to PAC, and PAC patients are high-risk, with 15% of Medicare deaths
involving a PAC stay in the prior 30 days.1
    In this paper, we study the impact of provider nancial incentives in determining patient ows
and government spending in the Medicare PAC system. The PAC setting is attractive for several
reasons. First, given its scal importance, understanding the e¤ects of nancial incentives is a
natural area for inquiry. Second, the institutional setting  involving multiple interlocking and po-
tentially substitutable settings that operate under di¤erent reimbursement regimes  suggests that
  nancial incentives may have rst order consequences. Third, ine¢ciencies in the PAC sector have
potentially important implications for public health, given that PAC patients are disproportionately
high-risk and might be more vulnerable to ine¢ciencies in the delivery of care.
    Our analysis focuses on patients whose point of entry into the PAC system is an LTCH.2 We
focus on LTCH patients because of the sharp variation in provider incentives at this type of facility.
This is illustrated in Figure 1: providers are reimbursed a daily amount (of approximately $1,300)
up to a threshold number of days, at which point there is a large (approximately $13,000 on average)
increase in payments for keeping a patient an additional day beyond the threshold, but no payments
for any days beyond it. We investigate the e¤ects of this jump in payments at the threshold using
detailed Medicare claims and administrative data on the universe of LTCH stays over the 2007-2012
period, when this non-linear payment schedule was in e¤ect, as well as the 2000-2002 period, when
LTCHs were instead reimbursed under a linear (i.e., constant per-diem) payment schedule.
    We start by presenting descriptive evidence on the e¤ect of the jump in payments. Discharges
respond strongly to the payment increase, with the share of stays discharged increasing from 2%
to 9% at precisely the day of the jump. The marginal patient discharged at the threshold appears
to be much healthier than the average dischargee prior to the threshold. At the threshold, pa-
    1
    These statistics are taken from MedPAC (2004), MedPAC (2015a), and MedPAC (2015b), with the exception of
the statistic on deaths which we calculate using the data described in Section 2.
    2
     The acronym LTCH is typically pronounced el-tack, presumably reecting the fact that LTCHs are sometimes
referred to as long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs), which is pronounced in this manner.



                                                      1
tients are disproportionately more likely to be discharged to a less intensive PAC facility or home
(downstream) than to an acute care hospital (upstream); they also have substantially lower
post-discharge mortality than patients discharged on earlier days.
    A natural question raised by this evidence is whether distortions in the timing of discharge have
an impact on patient health. Given the high baseline mortality rate for LTCH patients (30% die
within 90 days of LTCH admission), if the distortions are harmful, it seems plausible that we could
detect an e¤ect. Empirical analysis is challenging, however, because unlike discharge behavior,
mortality e¤ects may not appear right at the threshold.
    The available evidence shows no compelling evidence of any mortality e¤ects from the distortions
in discharge behavior. We nd no evidence of a change in the level or the slope of the mortality
hazard in the vicinity of the threshold. We provide an additional informative contrast by comparing
for-pro t and non-pro t LTCHs. We show that while both types of hospitals have similar payment
schedules, the behavioral response in discharges is much stronger for for-pro t hospitals. Despite
the larger behavioral response at the threshold, we nd no indication of a mortality impact even
for the for-pro t hospitals.
    While these results provide no smoking gun evidence of patient harm, they do not allow
us to comprehensively rule out a mortality e¤ect. We cannot, for instance, rule out an e¤ect for
every type of patient or at each and every hospital, and we cannot rule out adverse health e¤ects
that would not manifest in higher mortality rates. However, at minimum, we do not detect robust
enough mortality e¤ect that would allow us to use the jump in payments to estimate how LTCHs
trade o¤ pro ts and patient health. Indeed, the results suggest that the marginal patients are able
to receive similar care whether they are located in an LTCH or in their alternative setting, which
empirically is usually a less intensive PAC facility such as a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF).
    Another natural question raised by the descriptive evidence on discharge behavior at the thresh-
old is how providers respond to the payment schedule on days further from the threshold. Likewise,
the descriptive analysis does not provide a natural way to gauge the magnitude of provider response,
or to estimate how treatment patterns and Medicare payments would be a¤ected by counterfactual
payment schedules.
    To address these questions, we specify and estimate a dynamic model of LTCH discharge behav-
ior. In our model, patients are characterized by their health, which evolves stochastically over time.
LTCHs face a (daily) decision of whether to retain the patient or discharge her to another facility.
The LTCHs objective function includes both net revenue (Medicare payments net of costs) and
patient utility. If the patient is discharged from the LTCH, the provider receives zero net revenue,
but internalizes at least a portion of the patient utility from being treated in an alternative loca-
tion. If the LTCH keeps the patient, it receives net revenue that depends on Medicares payment
schedule, while also accounting for the patients utility from being treated in the LTCH and the
option value of making a similar discharge decision the following day. The provider therefore faces
a standard dynamic discrete choice problem.
    We estimate the model by simulated method of moments to match the observed discharge and
mortality patterns under the linear and non-linear payment schedules. To take advantage of the

                                                  2
variation provided by the sharp jump in payments, we assign greater weights to moments that are
close to the jump. The estimated model ts the data reasonably well.
    We use the model and the estimated parameters to investigate the e¤ects of alternative contracts
that  like the observed contract  have a daily reimbursement rate up to a cap but that  unlike
the observed contract  do not have a jump in payments at a threshold day. We nd, for example,
that if we were to lower the xed payment to eliminate the jump in payments at the threshold, we
would reduce total payments per admission for the episode of care by 25% on average, or about
$13,000 per admission. However, such a payment schedule substantially reduces LTCH revenue
and estimated pro ts, and therefore may have out-of-sample impacts on LTCH behavior that our
estimates would not capture, such as induced LTCH exit or lower service quality.
    We therefore also engage in a more conservative set of counterfactuals in which we restrict
attention to alternative contracts that would hold the LTCH harmless if their behavior did not
change. Speci cally, we consider the set of contracts that hold LTCHs revenue constant under their
observed discharge schedule. Thus, if we apply this schedule and it triggers behavioral response
by LTCHs then they must be better o¤. Using our estimated model, we are able to identify a
broad set of win-win payment schedules that reduce Medicare payments and, by construction,
leave LTCHs (weakly) better o¤.3 The contract that generates the largest savings reduces Medicare
payments for the episode of care by 4.5%, and increases LTCH pro ts by 5.1%. Interestingly, this
reduction in Medicare payments is slightly larger than the reduction from changes in organization
form; our model estimates imply that if all LTCHs behaved like non-pro ts  rather than all LTCHs
behaving like for-pro ts  Medicare payments per episode of care would be reduced by 2.9%.
    Our paper relates to a large literature examining how healthcare spending responds to nancial
incentives. Given the importance of healthcare spending in the economy and in public sector
budgets, the existence of this large literature is not surprising. What is surprising  and arguably
unfortunate from this perspective  is that the vast majority of this literature (including much of our
own work) has focused on the impact of consumer nancial incentives, such as deductibles and co-
payments, with relatively less attention to the impact of provider nancial incentives.4 The majority
of healthcare spending, however, is accounted for by a small share of high-cost individuals whose
spending is largely in the catastrophic range where deductibles and co-payments no longer bind,
and thus consumer cost-sharing is likely to have little impact relative to provider-side incentives.
    The relative lack of research on the provider side presumably reects the di¢culties in nding
clean variation in incentives to model and study. Perhaps not surprisingly, the sharp incentives
created by the current LTCH payment schedule have already received some attention in both
   3
    Given the lack of compelling evidence of mortality e¤ects at the threshold, it seems reasonable to assume that
mortality impacts are also unlikely to be rst-order under these LTCH held harmless alternative contracts.
   4
    The literature on the impact of consumer incentives (moral hazard) in health insurance is too vast to try to
summarize or cite here. Existing work on provider-side incentives has focused on descriptive evidence that providers
do respond to incentives, with much of the evidence coming from the response to the introduction of the Inpatient
Prospective Payment System in 1983 (Cutler and Zeckhauser (2000) provide a review of this evidence). More recently,
Clemens and Gottlieb (2014) provide a rare look at the behavioral response of physicians to nancial incentives.



                                                         3
academic (Kim et al., 2015) and popular (Weaver et al., 2015) spheres. Our descriptive work on
discharges around the threshold is quite similar to this prior work, while our descriptive analysis
of the health of the marginal dischargee and our exploration of mortality e¤ects is new. Our
paper is most closely related to Eliason et al. (2016) who  in independent work  also study the
impact of the LTCH payment schedule on discharge behavior descriptively and through the lens of
a dynamic model. Where comparable, the results are broadly similar to ours; however they focus
more on heterogeneity in provider responses and, unlike us, do not analyze patient mortality or
post-discharge healthcare use.
    Finally, from a more conceptual perspective, our paper is related to a growing literature that
seeks to interpret descriptive evidence of the behavioral responses to non-linear payment schedules
(bunching) through the lens of economic models that allow for assessments of behavior under
counterfactual schedules (e.g., Chetty et al., 2011; Einav et al., 2015; Manoli and Weber, 2017).
    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some background on the PAC
sector, LTCHs, and our data. In Section 3, we describe the discharge and mortality patterns around
the jump in payments. Section 4 presents the model, discusses estimation, and presents the results
from our counterfactuals. Section 5 concludes.


2     Setting and data
2.1   Post-acute care in the United States
Post-acute care (PAC) is the term for rehabilitation and palliative services provided to patients
recovering from an acute care hospital stay. In the United States, the Center for Medicaid and
Medicare Services (CMS) associates PAC with three types of facilities  long-term care hospitals
(LTCHs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)  as well as
care at home provided by home health agencies (HHAs) (MedPAC, 2015b). In 2013, Medicare paid
$60 billion to PAC providers, approximately 16% of the $368 billion paid that year for Traditional
Medicare (TM) claims (MedPAC, 2015a). This is about 20% larger than spending in Traditional
Medicare on the much-studied Medicare Part D program.
     In recent years, the geographic variation and growth rate of spending on PAC have raised
concerns about the e¢ciency of the sector. From 2001 to 2013, Medicare spending on PAC grew
at an annual rate of 6.1%, 2 percentage points higher than the rate of total spending growth for
TM (The Boards of Trustees for Medicare, 2002 and 2014; MedPAC, 2015a). A recent Institute
of Medicine report found that, despite accounting for only 16% of spending, PAC contributed to
a striking 73% of the unexplained geographic variation in spending, suggesting that there may be
substantial ine¢ciencies in the sector (Newhouse et al., 2013).
     It is useful to think about patients generally owing downstream through the healthcare sys-
tem. Upon experiencing an acute health event, they enter a regular Acute Care Hospital (ACH);
from there they may enter a PAC facility to recover, and eventually go home once they are suf-
  ciently healthy and can function independently. Some ACH patients skip the PAC stay and


                                                  4
return home directly from the ACH, and some patients occasionally relapse and move upstream
from a PAC facility back to an ACH.
    The top panel of Figure 2 gives a sense of transitions among ACHs, PAC facilities (LTCHs,
SNFs, and IRFs), home (including HHAs), and death (including hospice). (Throughout the rest
of the paper, we use the term PAC facilities to refer to LTCHs, SNFs, and IRFs, because these
are facilities that provide in-house care, in contrast to HHAs, which provide care at the patients
home.) In our data, described below, 26% of patients who are discharged from an ACH receive
follow-up care from a PAC facility.5 From these PAC facilities, 60% of patients continue to ow
home, where they may still receive treatment from an HHA, while 33% are discharged back to an
ACH. The remaining 7% of discharges are to a hospice or due to death.
    Just like the natural ow of patients into and out of the PAC system, there is also a general
ordering of care within it. LTCHs provide the most intensive care, SNFs and IRFs provide less
intensive care, and HHAs provide the least intensive bundle of medical services. Severity of Illness
(SOI) categories are a commonly used measure of intensity of care, and are constructed using the
patients age, diagnoses, procedures, and comorbidities. The share of patients in the highest severity
of illness category declines from 43% at LTCHs, to approximately 12% at SNFs and IRFs, to 4%
at HHAs (AHA, 2010). Medicare payments per day follow the same declining pattern.
    Our point of entry into the PAC landscape is through admission to an LTCH. The bottom panel
of Figure 2 looks at patient ows from LTCHs. About 11% of LTCH patients are discharged back
to an ACH, 38% are discharged to another PAC facility (SNF or IRF), and 33% are discharged
to their homes, where they may continue to receive care from an HHA. The remaining 18% are
discharged to a hospice (4%) or die within the LTCH (14%). In contrast, once in a SNF or IRF,
patients almost never get discharged to an LTCH, die much less frequently (5%), and much more
often (60%) return directly home.
    Despite the interlocking nature of the PAC system, the way that Medicare reimburses post-
acute care varies substantially by the setting. Historically, all providers were paid according to an
administrative estimate of their costs. Since the early 2000s, however, many PAC stays are paid
under a prospective payment system (PPS), yet the unit of payment varies across sites. Loosely,
HHAs are paid per 60-day episode-of-care, SNFs are paid a xed rate per day of stay, while IRFs
and LTCHs are in principle paid a xed amount per admission (like ACHs).6 We provide more
details on LTCH payments in Section 3.
    The fact that each type of facility is paid under a di¤erent system has raised concerns. From a
public health perspective, there is concern that the separate payment systems do not give providers
   5
   In analysis that includes HHAs in the calculation, the share of ACH patients who are discharged to PAC rises to
42% (MedPAC, 2015b).
   6
    These di¤erent payment systems also have di¤erential implications for bene ciaries cost-sharing requirements
across types of PAC settings. Bene ciaries generally are not required to make any cost sharing for HHA services. IRF
and LTCH stays are tied to the bene ciaries inpatient deductible, so when patients arrive from an ACH there would
typically be no requirement for additional cost sharing. SNF stays are associated with separate SNF coinsurance for
stays longer than 20 days.



                                                         5
enough incentive to coordinate care across di¤erent facilities. From a budgetary perspective, there
is concern that providers may shu­e patients across facilities with the aim of increasing Medicare
payments. These concerns have spurred various proposals for payment reform, including a re-
cent bill which proposes providing a bundled payment to a single PAC coordinator, and letting
this coordinator internalize the costs and bene ts associated with the sequence of admissions and
discharges for the entire episode of care (H.R.1458  BACPAC Act of 2015).

2.2   Long-term care hospitals
Our primary focus is on patients whose point of entry into the PAC system is a long-term care
hospital (LTCH). The demarcation LTCH describes how the provider gets paid by Medicare. It
is a regulatory concept, rather than a medical one. For a hospital to get paid as an LTCH, it must
have an average inpatient length of stay of 25 days or more. Naturally, there are many ways to
meet this requirement, so from a medical standpoint the question of what exactly is an LTCH often
results in di¤erentiated or fuzzy answers.
    The LTCH category of hospitals was created to solve a potential problem created by the 1982
Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA), which established the prospective payment
system (PPS) for acute care hospitals. Under the new PPS, hospitals were paid per discharge, and
not based on their costs, as a way to create incentives for hospitals to be e¢cient in their treatment
decisions. Regulators who were designing the PPS realized that there was a small number of
hospitals that had long average length-of-stays (LOS) and would not be nancially viable under
the xed-price PPS. LTCHs were thus created as a carve-out from PPS for hospitals that had an
average LOS of at least 25 days. At that point in time, there were 40 hospitals that quali ed
as LTCHs  mainly former tuberculosis and chronic disease hospitals in the Boston, New York
City, and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. LTCH payments were based on costs measured in 1982,
roughly in the spirit of the pre-1982 payment system, and adjusted for ination in subsequent years.
See Liu et al. (2001) for more on the background of the LTCH sector.
    Over the last 30 years, and perhaps because of the LTCH exemption from PPS, there was rapid
growth in the LTCH sector. Because new entrants did not have cost data for 1982, payments for
new entrants were determined by costs in their initial years of operation. This encouraged new
entrants to be ine¢cient when they rst opened and earn pro ts by increasing their e¢ciency over
time (Liu et al., 2001). From the initial 40 hospitals rst designated as LTCHs in 1982, there are
now over 400 such hospitals in the country.
    Geographic penetration of LTCHs is extremely varied. This presumably reects their historical
roots as tuberculosis and chronic disease hospitals in the northeast, as well as certi cate of need
(CON) laws that restrict entry. There are only a few LTCHs in the west of the country, and three
states (Massachusetts, Texas, and Louisiana) account for a third of all LTCHs. In places where
there are LTCHs, these hospitals are an important part of Medicares PAC landscape. For instance,
in hospital service areas (HSAs) with at least one LTCH, we calculate that LTCHs account for 13%
of Medicare PAC facility days and 28% of Medicare PAC facility spending; nationwide, payments


                                                  6
to LTCHs account for 12% of Medicare PAC facility spending.7
    LTCHs are much more likely to be for-pro t than other medical providers. According to 2008
data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), 72% of LTCHs are for-pro t (versus 17% for
ACHs), 22% are non-pro t, and 6% are government run. The LTCH market is dominated by two
for-pro t companies, Kindred Health Systems and Select Medical, which run about 40% of LTCHs,
according to the AHA data. Company reports indicate that LTCHs are highly pro table. For their
business segments that include LTCHs, Kindreds pro ts have hovered between 22% and 29% of
revenue and Selects pro ts have ranged between 16% to 22% of revenue.8
    Approximately half of LTCHs are known as Hospitals-within-Hospitals (HwHs), meaning that
they are physically located within the building or campus of an ACH but have a separate governing
body and medical sta¤. Regardless of an LTCHs location (co-located or freestanding), they tend to
have strong relationships with a single ACH.9 Because of concerns over close relationships between
LTCHs and their partner ACHs, in 2005 CMS established a policy known as the 25-percent rule
that creates disincentives for admitting more than 25% of patients from a single facility; however,
Congress has delayed the full implementation of the law.10

2.3    Data
Our main analysis focuses on patients who are admitted to an LTCH and follows them throughout
their entire healthcare episode. Our primary data source is the Medicare Provider and Analysis
Review (MedPAR) data, spanning the years 2000-2012. The dataset contains claim-level informa-
tion on discharges from ACHs, LTCHs, SNFs, and IRFs. Each record is a unique stay for which
a claim was submitted, and the data contain information on procedures, admission and discharge
dates, admission sources and discharge destinations, hospital charges, and Medicare payments. The
MedPAR data also provide us with basic demographic information such as the age, sex, and race
of the bene ciary, and information about the patients diagnoses (DRG).
    We supplement this primary source with several ancillary data sources. First, we use Medicares
bene ciary summary le on cost and use it to approximate post-LTCH discharge payments for
hospice and for HHAs, as well as post-LTCH discharge hospice days; Appendix A provides more
   7
     Authors calculations using 2007-2012 data described below. PAC facilities include LTCH, SNF and IRF. PAC
facilities represent about 70% of total PAC spending, with the other 30% due to PAC provided by HHAs (MedPAC,
2015a).
   8
    Pro ts are de ned as EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization). Kindreds pro ts are based on
2009 to 2015 company reports. Prior to 2009, Kindred did not separate out their reporting of LTCH pro ts from the
much larger SNF category. Selects pro ts are based on company reports from 2004 to 2015.
   9
     MedPAC (2004) found that HwHs receive 61% of their cases from their most frequent referring hospital and
freestanding hospitals receive 42% from their most frequent referring hospital.
  10
    There is also a regulation known as the 5-percent rule that addresses the incentive for HwH to ping-pong
patients between the ACH and LTCH. In particular, if more than 5% of patients who are discharged from an LTCH
to an ACH are readmitted to the LTCH, the LTCH will be compensated as if the patient had a single LTCH stay
(42 CFR 412.532).

details.11 Second, we use Medicares bene ciary les to determine whether the bene ciary is dually
eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and the date of death (if any) through 2012. Third, we use the
Medicare chronic conditions le to measure whether the individual has any of 27 chronic conditions
in the calendar year prior to the LTCH stay. Finally, we use data from the American Hospital
Association (AHA) survey over the same period to determine whether an LTCH is for-pro t, non-
pro t, or government owned, and whether it is co-located with an ACH.
    Our analysis focuses on the current Medicare payment schedule for LTCHs, known as LTCH-
PPS. We analyze the time periods before and after full implementation of LTCH-PPS, which was
phased in over a ve year period starting on October 1, 2002. We de ne the pre-PPS period as
discharges that occurred from January 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002. For this period, we measure
post-discharge payments, days and mortality through March 31, 2003, which is six months after
the last LTCH discharge. We exclude the October 2002 to September 2007 phase-in period because
provider behavior during this period potentially reects the combination of changing nancial
incentives and learning about the new incentive structure, complicating the interpretation of the
data. We de ne the PPS period as discharges that occurred from October 1, 2007 to July 31, 2012,
and analyze post-discharge payments, days and mortality through December 31, 2012, which is
similarly six months after the last LTCH discharge.
    Table 1 shows summary statistics on ACH, LTCH, and SNF/IRF admissions in the pre-PPS
and PPS periods.12 Since an observation is an admission, some patients (16%) show up multiple
times in the data. LTCH patients are, on average, slightly younger than ACH patients and much
younger than SNF/IRF patients. LTCH patients are also almost twice as likely to be black and
about one-third more likely to be eligible for Medicaid, relative to ACH and SNF/IRF patients.
These di¤erences are fairly stable over time. From a health perspective, patients in an LTCH look
less healthy than those in an ACH or SNF/IRF. They have more chronic conditions prior to the stay
and higher mortality. For example, about 15% of LTCH patients die within 30 days of admission
and 30% die within 90 days; these mortality rates are about 50% larger than mortality rates for
SNF/IRF patients and about twice as large as those for ACH patients.
    In terms of the intensity of medical care, LTCH stays are closer to ACH stays than stays at
a SNF/IRF. The majority of LTCH and ACH patients receive at least one medical procedure
versus about 5% of patients who visit an SNF/IRF. The most common LTCH procedures (blood
transfusion and ventilation) are also more similar to those that occur at an ACH, relative to
occupational and physical therapies, which are the most common procedures in SNF/IRF. Length
of stay at an LTCH, however, is (by design) much more similar to that of a SNF/IRF. The average
  11
     In the MedPAR data, we can observe all discharge destinations, but we can only observe post-discharge payments
and days for ACH and PAC facilities (SNF, IRF, LTCH) and not for home health visits or hospice. Appendix A
shows how we estimate these using the summary le on cost and use which includes spending for all components of
care. In practice, HHA and hospice payments are quite small as a share of the total. For example, we estimate that
of individuals with an LTCH discharge, LTCH and SNF/IRF payments constitute over 90% of total PAC payments,
with home health accounting for only 8%.
  12
    We group SNF and IRF admissions together for convenience, as both represent post-acute care that is less
intense than an LTCH and because IRFs only account for a small (6.4%) fraction of these admissions.


                                                        8
stay at an ACH is 5 days, while it is just over 25 days in LTCH and SNF/IRF.
    The bottom rows of Table 1 show statistics on Medicare and out-of-pocket payments. Medicare
payments in the PPS period average $2,079 per day at an ACH, $1,392 per day at an LTCH, and
$507 per day at a SNF/IRF. However, because LTCH stays are much longer than ACH stays, per-
admission Medicare payments at LTCHs average over $35,000, which is three times greater than
per-admission ACH and SNF/IRF payments. Out-of-pocket payments at ACHs and LTCHs arise
from Medicares Part A deductible ($1,156 in 2012) and from co-insurance payments that apply
when the patient has more than 60 hospital days in the bene t period ($289 per day in 2012).
Because patients have no out-of-pocket exposure between the deductible and their 60th hospital
day, out-of-pocket payments are a modest 7.7% of Medicare payments at ACHs and 5.4% at LTCHs
in the PPS period. SNFs, on the other hand, have a separate co-insurance schedule with payments
of $144.50 per day in 2012 for stays in excess of 20 days, and have a much higher out-of-pocket
share.
    Our analysis encompasses not only the experience of the patient in the LTCH (i.e., length of stay
and payments) but also their post-discharge experience. Table 2 provides some summary statistics
on post-discharge experience. We de ne a post-discharge episode of care as the spell of continuous
days with a Medicare payment to an ACH, SNF/IRF or LTCH; the episode ends if there are two
days or more without any Medicare payments being made to any of these institutions. For each post-
discharge episode we report 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, post-discharge Medicare payments,
and post-discharge facility days (i.e. days in an ACH, SNF/IRF, LTCH or hospice). Focusing on
the PPS period, about one-quarter of LTCH patients die in the 90-days post discharge. Average
length of stay in the post-discharge episode of care is 26 days, which is similar to the average time
in the LTCH (see Table 1). Average post-discharge Medicare payments is $22,975, about 60% of
Medicare payments to the LTCH (see Table 1).
    In some of our analyses below, we will nd it useful to classify live discharges from the LTCH as
either upstream or downstream based on their discharge destination. Upstream discharges
represent patients in worse health than downstream destinations. Speci cally, we group LTCH
discharges to hospice or ACH as upstream and discharges to SNF/IRF, or home (with or with-
out home healthcare), or to other as downstream.13 Table 2 shows that most (about 85%) of
LTCH discharges are downstream, and that patients initially discharged downstream have substan-
tially lower post-discharge mortality (e.g. 18% 90-day mortality compared to 60% for upstream
discharges), length of stay, and payments.
  13
    Appendix Table A1 shows more granularity on the discharge destinations within upstream and downstream. In
the PPS period 97% of patients discharged upstream are sent to ACH (vs hospice); of patients discharged downstream,
about half are sent to SNF/IRF (which we group together because over 90% of discharges to SNF or IRF are to SNF)
and another 40% are discharged to home or home health care.

3     LTCH payments, discharge patterns, and outcomes
In this section we present descriptive analysis on LTCHs response to nancial incentives. We start
by describing the LTCH budget set, including the large jump in payments that is our primary
source of identi cation. We then show evidence on how discharge patterns and mortality rates vary
with the budget set. This descriptive evidence motivates several of our key modeling choices in the
dynamic model of LTCH discharge behavior, which we present in the next section.

3.1   LTCH payments
We provide a basic overview here of how LTCH payments vary with the patients length of stay,
an object we refer to as the LTCH budget set or payment schedule. Appendix B provides more
details. Figure 1 summarizes the payment schedules in the pre-PPS and PPS periods.
    Prior to October 1, 2002, LTCHs were paid their (estimated) daily cost, generating a linear
relationship between the length of the hospital stay and payments. As described earlier, this
cost plus reimbursement of LTCHs was seen as potentially encouraging ine¢cient entry into the
LTCH market. Because of this and other concerns, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and
1999 Balanced Budget Re nement Act (BBRA) implemented a PPS for LTCHs. LTCH-PPS was
phased in over a 5-year period starting on October 1, 2002 and was fully implemented by October
1, 2007. At a broad level, LTCH-PPS is designed to operate like the PPS for acute care hospitals
(IP-PPS), under which hospitals are paid a lump-sum that is based on the patients diagnosis
(diagnosis-related group, or DRG) and does not vary with the patients length of stay.
    Much like LTCHs were originally created to address a potential problem with the introduction
of PPS for ACHs, the features of the LTCH-PPS payment schedule can similarly be thought of as
attempting to address a potential problem arising from the introduction of PPS for LTCHs. In
particular, in designing LTCH-PPS, o¢cials were concerned that LTCHs might discharge patients
after a small number of days but still receive large lump-sum payments intended for longer hospitals
stays. To address this concern, they created a short stay outlier (SSO) threshold. If stays were
shorter than the SSO threshold, payments would be based on the pre-PPS cost-based reimbursement
schedule and LTCHs would not receive a large lump sum. However, while reducing the incentive to
cycle patients in and out of the LTCH, the SSO system creates potentially problematic incentives
at the SSO threshold. At the day when payments switch from per-day reimbursement to lump-sum
prospective payment amount, Medicare payments for keeping a patient an additional day jump
by a large amount.
    Figure 1 graphs the average payment schedules in the pre-PPS and PPS periods, pooling across
LTCH facilities and DRGs. The y-axis shows cumulative Medicare payments, ination-adjusted
to 2012 dollars. The x-axis shows the length of the stay relative to the SSO threshold, which we
normalize to be day 0. The SSO threshold is de ned as ve-sixths the geometric mean length of
stay for that DRG in the previous year and therefore varies by DRG (and also, to a much lesser
extent, by year). The average threshold is at 22.5 days; the modal threshold (accounting for 22.4%



                                                10
of PPS stays) is 20 days and 99% of the sample has a SSO threshold between 16 and 39 days.14 As
a result, in this and subsequent gures, we present results relative to the SSO threshold so that we
can pool analyses across DRGs.15 Because the SSO threshold is unde ned in the pre-PPS period,
we assign pre-PPS stays the threshold for their DRG from PPS period.16
    Under the pre-PPS system, average payments scale linearly with the length of stay at a rate of
$1,071 per day. Under the PPS system, payments increase linearly by $1,386 per day to the left of
the SSO threshold, jump by $13,656 at the SSO threshold, and remain constant thereafter. The
increase in payments at the jump is large: it is equal to 55% of the cumulative payment amount
on the day prior to the threshold, or equivalent to about 10 days of payments at the pre-threshold
daily rate.
    This sharp jump in payments was presumably not the intention of the policymakers who de-
signed the LTCH-PPS, but it arises naturally from the interaction of two sensible policies. As is
standard in xed price contracts, the LTCH-PPS payments were likely set to approximate average
costs per stay. As noted, payments on a cost-plus basis up to the SSO threshold were introduced to
avoid paying LTCHs large lump sum amounts for relatively short stays. While reducing the incen-
tive to discharge patients from an ACH to an LTCH, the transition unavoidably creates potentially
problematic incentives. Particularly concerning is where the threshold was set: we estimate that
under the pre-PPS payment scheme, 44% of stays would have been below the subsequent short stay
outlier threshold, which is a large fraction for a policy that is at least ostensibly designed to target
outlier events.
    In Section 4 we explore the impact of alternative, counterfactual payment schedules. To elim-
inate the jump in payments, our counterfactuals alter the payment prior to the SSO threshold
(so that it does not approximate per-day costs), alter the xed PPS amount (so that it does not
approximate average costs), or alter both segments of the payment schedule.

3.2       Discharge patterns
We present a number of descriptive results on discharge patterns from the LTCH around the
threshold. The results can be summarized as follows. First, there is a large spike in discharges
at precisely the day of the jump in payments, indicating a strong response to nancial incentives.
Second, the marginal patients discharged at the threshold are in relatively better health: they are
disproportionately discharged downstream and they have lower post-discharge mortality rates
than patients discharged at other times. Third, among patients discharged downstream, the mar-
ginal patients discharged at the threshold are relatively sicker, with higher post-discharge payments
  14
       Across all DRGs, the SSO threshold ranges from 14 to 56 days.
  15
    We start the x-axis range at -15 days because nearly all SSO thresholds occur after 16 days. If we extended the
x-axis range to -16, for example, there would be a change in the composition of DRGs between days -16 and -15
due to the entry of new DRGs into the sample. We end the x-axis range at 45 days because there are relatively few
(2.1%) patients who are kept at the LTCH more than 45 days beyond the SSO threshold.
  16
    Since the thresholds occasionally vary over time, we use the SSO threshold from 2007, which is the rst year in
the PPS period.



                                                         11
than pre-threshold dischargees. Below we discuss how these patterns can be rationalized with a
simple model of LTCH behavior.
    Figure 3 shows the aggregate pattern of discharges by length of stay in the pre-PPS and PPS
periods. A discharge occurs when the patient is transferred to another facility, sent home, or dies at
the LTCH. The y-axis shows discharges as a share of the total number of stays at the LTCH. The x-
axis plots the length of stay relative to the DRG-speci c SSO threshold, de ned in the same manner
as in Figure 1. In the PPS period, there is a sharp increase in discharges at the SSO threshold, with
the share of discharges increasing from about 2% to 9% per day. Discharge rates remain elevated
over the subsequent 7 to 10 days before reverting to baseline. In the pre-PPS period, there is no
evidence of any bunching at the SSO threshold. This discharge pattern is consistent with a strong
response to the nancial incentives.
    Relative to the pre-PPS constant, per-day payment schedule, the increase in discharges under
PPS at the threshold could be drawn either from the left or from the right of the distribution.
In other words, the excess discharges at the threshold could reect patients who under the pre-PPS
schedule would have been discharged before the threshold but are retained in order to get the
lump sum payout at the threshold, or patients who would have been discharged after the threshold
but are now discharged earlier since there is no longer a marginal nancial payment associated with
keeping them for additional days.
    Because the share of discharges to the left of the threshold is lower in the PPS period relative to
the pre-PPS period, it is tempting to infer that the excess mass of discharges is primarily drawn
from the left of the distribution. However, we caution that di¤erences in the discharge rate might
not only reect the change in nancial incentives but also changes in patient health and other secular
trends between the pre-PPS and PPS periods. For example, a simple reweighting of the pre-PPS
admissions to match the DRG composition of the PPS period eliminates approximately 30% of the
di¤erence between the pre-PPS and PPS discharge rates prior to the SSO threshold (Appendix
Figure A2). In Section 4, we show how we can use our model to compare discharge patterns
under the observed PPS payment schedule to discharge patterns under alternative, counterfactual
payment schedules.
    Figure 4 decomposes the discharge pattern by the location of discharge in order of descending
patient health: downstream, upstream, and death. The gure shows increases at the threshold in
discharges both upstream and downstream, but the proportional increase is substantially larger
on the downstream margin. Moreover, because the pre-threshold discharge rate is much higher
downstream, the sharp change in discharge rate at the threshold (shown in Figure 3) is almost
entirely driven by downstream discharges. We defer our discussion of the bottom panel on mortality
to the subsection below.
    Appendix Figure A3 plots the 30-day post-discharge mortality rate, de ned as death within
30 days of a (live) discharge, by length of stay. The graph shows a sharp drop in post-discharge
mortality at the SSO threshold, again suggesting that the patients who are discharged at the
threshold are healthier than the patients who are discharged immediately beforehand. Of course,
the decline in mortality not only reects changes in the composition of patients discharged at the

                                                  12
threshold, but could in principle reect a treatment e¤ect of discharge on health. We address this
in the next section.
    Finally, Figure 5 plots Medicare payments for the episode of care that occurs after the LTCH
discharge, by length of stay at the LTCH. We show these post-discharge payments separately
for patients discharged upstream and discharged downstream and view them as a proxy for
the patients health at the time of discharge. For patients discharged downstream, there is a
sharp increase in post-discharge payments at the threshold, with average post-discharge payments
increasing from approximately $10,000 to $20,000. There is a small change in the opposite direction
for patients initially discharged upstream. For longer lengths of stay, the gure becomes noisy due
to the small number of discharges.
    Figure 5 suggests a simple model of LTCH behavior, which motivates the model we present in
Section 4. Prior to the threshold, retaining patients is pro table, and only the healthiest patients are
discharged to SNF/IRF or their home and the sickest patients discharged to an ACH or a hospice.
After the threshold, on the downstream margin, LTCHs work down the distribution and discharge
less healthy patients, increasing post-discharge payments on average. Similarly, on the upstream
margin, LTCHs work up the distribution, discharging patients who are in better health, and
decreasing post-discharge payments on average. The marginal patient discharged downstream at
the threshold is therefore sicker than the average patient discharged prior to the threshold, while
the marginal patient discharged upstream is slightly healthier than the average patient discharged
upstream in prior days.

3.3      (Lack of) Mortality e¤ects
A natural question raised by the discharge patterns is whether the distortions in the timing of
discharges have an impact on patient health and in particular mortality. Since the 90-day mortality
rate of LTCH patients is approximately 30% (see Table 1), if these distortions are harmful to health,
it seems plausible that we might be able to pick up an e¤ect with our data.
      Empirical identi cation of mortality e¤ects from the distortion in patient location at the
threshold is challenging, however. Health evolves according to a stochastic process, with sicker
patients having a higher probability of death. Distortions to the location of care might impact
the level of someones health, generating an on-impact e¤ect on the probability of death analogous
to the on-impact e¤ect on discharges we detected. However, distortions to the location might
also a¤ect the stochastic process for health, which would be associated with a longer-run change in
mortality rate, but might not have an immediate mortality e¤ect. We therefore attempt to examine
not only whether there is an immediate impact on mortality at the threshold, but whether we can
detect any longer-run changes.
    We have already seen in the bottom panel of Figure 4 some suggestive evidence that mortal-
ity rates are declining over the course of the LTCH stay with little di¤erence around the SSO
threshold.17 However, the interpretation of the bottom panel of Figure 4  which plots mortality
 17
      The downward trend results from natural selection: as the sickest patients die, the remaining patients become



                                                          13
rates for LTCH patients by length of stay  is complicated by selection concerns. Since LTCHs are
di¤erentially discharging healthier patients at the SSO threshold, the composition of patients who
remain at the LTCH is changing, making it tricky to disentangle any potential treatment e¤ects on
mortality from e¤ects due to changes in the selection of LTCH patients.
    In Figure 6 we circumvent this issue by taking advantage of the fact that our data allow us to
track mortality outcomes for patients even after their LTCH discharge. Conceptually, our mortality
analysis follows the logic of a reduced form regression, where the mortality hazard is the outcome,
discharge patterns are the endogenous variable, and the SSO threshold is the instrument. In
particular, since we know there is a sharp jump in discharge patterns at the threshold (analogous
to a large rst stage), if there is a change in the level or slope of the mortality hazard at the
threshold (that is, non-zero reduced form), we can infer that the distortion in discharge location
has an impact on mortality.
    The top panel of Figure 6 is thus similar to the bottom panel of Figure 4, but uses the full
set of LTCH patients (unconditional on their location) rather than only those who have yet to be
discharged. As before, natural selection leads mortality rates to decline over time, but we now can
interpret more cleanly the mortality pattern around the SSO threshold. The plot shows no obvious
evidence of a change in the level of mortality hazard in the vicinity of the threshold during the
PPS period. In Appendix C, we examine this mortality pattern more formally using a regression
discontinuity design and similarly fail to reject the null of a smooth mortality hazard around the
SSO threshold. These ndings are consistent with no mortality e¤ect but do not allow us to rule
out a gradual e¤ect that would not appear sharply in the data.
    If distortions in the location of care a¤ected the stochastic process for health, we might not
observe an immediate e¤ect, but would see a change in mortality over a longer time horizon. The
bottom panel of Figure 6 attempts to look for a more gradual e¤ect by plotting a 30-day mortality
rate, by days since LTCH admission, where the 30-day mortality hazard measures the share of
patients who are alive on a given day but die during the subsequent 30 days. The plot once again
shows no e¤ect around the threshold, suggesting that there are no gradual e¤ects of the distortion
in location on mortality. In Appendix C, we present a regression discontinuity analysis that more
formally con rms this result.
    Figure 6 suggests little evidence of a quantitatively large e¤ect on mortality that is created by
the sharp discharge incentives at the SSO threshold. This (lack of) reduced form e¤ect should be
judged in relation to the size of the rst stage e¤ect on the location of care. And as we will show
in the analysis in the next section, the jump in payments at the threshold only shifts the location
of care for a relatively small number of days, so perhaps the null result is not surprising.
    Finally, we provide some additional traction on potential mortality impacts by exploiting dif-
ferences in the response to incentives between for-pro t and non-pro t LTCHs. Figure 7 shows
the payment schedules (top panel), discharge shares (middle panel), and mortality rates (bottom
panel), separately by for-pro t status. While the payment schedules are almost the same across

gradually healthier.



                                                 14
the two groups of hospitals, the behavioral response to the jump in payments is substantially larger
at for-pro t LTCHs. Prior to the threshold, for-pro t hospitals have a slightly lower discharge
rate, but at the SSO threshold their discharge share rises by about twice as much as that of non-
pro t hospitals, suggesting that, perhaps not surprisingly, for-pro t hospitals are relatively more
responsive to nancial incentives.
     Given that for-pro ts LTCHs exhibit much larger behavioral response to the jump in payments,
if the PPS payment schedule a¤ected mortality, we would expect a more pronounced mortality e¤ect
at for-pro t hospitals. The bottom panel of Figure 7 provides no suggestion of any di¤erences in the
mortality pattern by for-pro t status. Mortality hazards in the PPS period are remarkably similar
across both groups in the immediate vicinity of the SSO threshold; this suggests no on-impact e¤ect
of the location distortion on mortality.18
     While these results provide no smoking gun evidence of patient harm, they do not allow
us to comprehensively rule out a mortality e¤ect. We cannot, for instance, rule out an e¤ect for
every type of patient or at each and every hospital, and we cannot rule out adverse health e¤ects
that would not manifest in higher mortality rates. However, combined with the earlier results
which indicate that the patients who are most a¤ected by the SSO threshold are disproportionately
healthy, the results suggest that the marginal patients a¤ected by the PPS payment schedule are
able to receive similar care whether they are located in an LTCH or in their alternative setting,
which empirically is usually a SNF.


4        Quantifying the importance of nancial incentives
The results in the last section provide descriptive evidence of the response of LTCHs to the sharp
 nancial incentives associated with the SSO threshold. One way to quantify the importance of the
 nancial incentives in determining LTCH discharge patterns is to assess how these patterns would
change in response to counterfactual nancial contracts that exhibit weaker incentives. Doing so
requires a dynamic model, which is the focus of this section.

4.1      A simple model of LTCH discharge decisions
Consider a patient i who is admitted at day t = 0 to LTCH l. We index patient is health at
the time of admission by hi;0 , and assume that hi;t (conditional on patient i staying at LTCH l)
evolves stochastically from day to day. In our baseline speci cation, we assume that hi;t follows a
monotone Markov process, such that hi;t  F (jhi;t 1 ) with F (jh) stochastically increasing in h.19
We use higher values of h to indicate better health and thus assume that daily mortality hazard
m(h) is strictly decreasing in h.
    18
    The mortality pattern for non-pro t hospitals is slightly noisier, but this is presumably driven by sampling
variation due to the smaller samples size of non-pro t admissions (113,154 versus 487,988 for for-pro ts in the PPS
period).
    19
    In sensitivity analysis, we examine the robustness to our ndings by allowing the health process to vary with
time since admission.


                                                        15
    Hospital ls ow (daily) payo¤ from keeping patient i (whose health is given by h) during the
tth day since admission is given by

                            ul (h; tjkeep) = p(t)   cl (h) + wl (h) +   ilt ,                    (1)

where p(t) is the hospitals revenue, which depends on CMS reimbursement schedule for patient
i, cl (h) is the hospitals daily cost of treating a patient with health index h, and the third term
captures the patients utility from staying at LTCH l, wl (h), multiplied by the hospitals weight
on it . Finally, ilt is an error term, which is distributed i.i.d. type I extreme value and scaled
by the parameter   . The error term presumably captures idiosyncratic considerations associated
with the patient and/or the hospital.
    Our focus is on the hospitals discharge decision. Consider a set of J alternative destinations
for patient i, each indexed by j. Conditional on discharging the patient to destination j, LTCH
ls revenue and cost are both zero, and its ow payo¤s are given by the patients utility, again
multiplied by the hospitals weight on it , and a logit error, scaled by   :

                              uj (h; tjdischarge to j) = wj (h) +   ijt .                        (2)

Moreover, because hospital l loses control over the patient upon discharge, it will be convenient to
denote by Wj (h) the present value to hospital l of the patients utility from being discharged to
alternative j.
    This setting lends itself to a simple dynamic programming problem, which can be represented
by the following Bellman equation:

where  is the LTCHs (daily) discount factor. That is, the two state variables are the health of
the patient and the number of days since LTCH admission. Every day the hospital makes a binary
decision whether to discharge or keep the patient, and in the event of a discharge the hospital
also decides about the discharge location. Of course the model can allow the patient to actually
decide about the discharge destination by having the hospital place a large weight on patient
utility. While we did not nd a mortality e¤ect in our descriptive analysis, by allowing the health
process outside the LTCH to evolve according to Gj (jh), instead of F (jh) within the LTCH, our
model allows patient health to evolve di¤erentially across alternative locations of care
    It is convenient to benchmark the patients utility against her utility at the LTCH. That is, we
normalize wl (h) = 0 for all h, vj (h) = wj (h) wl (h), and normalize Vj (h) accordingly. Applying
these adjustments and using the well-known expression for the logits inclusive value, we can write
the problem as

                                                    16
   Finally, we note that the state variable t only a¤ects the problem through the hospital revenue
function p(t), and p(t) = 0 for all t > SSO, so the problem becomes stationary after the SSO
threshold, and the solution is simply a xed point of
                      8                                                                      9

We can therefore solve for the dynamic problem by rst solving for the xed point associated with
the post-SSO stationary part of the problem given by equation (5), and then iterating backwards
until t = 0 using equation (4).

4.2   Parameterization, estimation, and identi cation
Parameterization. We make several additional assumptions before we take the model to the data.
First, we restrict the set of alternative discharge destinations J to include only two options, J =
fD; U g. Motivated by the summary statistics described in Section 3, option D covers the collection
of downstream destinations (SNF, IRF, and home with or without HHA) that are appropriate
for LTCH patients who are of better health or require lower levels of medical monitoring. In
contrast, option U covers upstream discharge destinations (ACH and hospice) which would be
natural discharge destinations for patients who are of worse health.
     Because, conditional on discharge, nancial incentives do not a¤ect the LTCHs discharge des-
tination, having a richer set of discharge options is unlikely to a¤ect our counterfactual predictions.
By focusing on two options, we essentially restrict the LTCH to consider two types of marginal
LTCH patients. One set of marginal patient are those who are healthier, and for whom the hospital
must consider whether to keep them or discharge them to location D. The second set of marginal
patients are sicker, and for whom the hospital must consider whether to keep them in the LTCH
or transfer them to location U .
     The second assumption is about the health process. Given that mortality is monotone in h,
it is convenient to normalize the health index by mortality risk. We do so by assuming that h is
de ned by its associated mortality hazard using the following relationship:

                                          m(h) = 1          (h),                                  (6)

where () is the standard normal CDF. We note that h is an index and thus has no cardinal mean-
ing, and the above is simply a normalization, which endows h with a cardinal measure. Equipped
with this normalization, we then make parametric assumptions about the initial (as of LTCH ad-
mission, t = 0) health distribution of newly admitted patients, and about how the health process
evolves over time within the LTCH. Speci cally, we assume that hi;0 is drawn from N (0 ;  20 ) and
that F (jhi;t 1 ) follows a simple AR(1) process:

                           hi;t =  + hi;t   1   + "i;t ; where "i;t  N (0;  2 ).               (7)



                                                       17
In our baseline speci cation, we allow the health process to be di¤erent inside the LTCH in the
pre-PPS and PPS periods to accommodate potential di¤erences in the LTCH patient mix, which
may result from the growth of the LTCH sector, time trends in medical technology and practice,
or directly from the change in nancial incentives. Note that we do not need to model the health
process outside the LTCH since any e¤ect of the post-discharge location on health would a¤ect the
discharge decisions through its (unidenti ed) e¤ect on the continuation values, Vj (h), which we do
not model explicitly.
    The third assumption is associated with the LTCHs costs, cl (h), which we assume are given by

                                           cl (h) = creported .                                       (8)

That is, as described in Section 2 and reported in the bottom row of Table 1, we observe the
cost associated with each hospital l, which enters the formula by which it is paid by CMS. We
use the averages reported there (separately for the pre-PPS and PPS periods) as our estimates of
creported . We do not treat these reported costs as the true costs, but we use it to guide our
model of costs in two ways. First, and importantly, we assume that the hospitals cost do not vary
with the patient health h, which is consistent with CMSs treatment of costs and also seems natural
given that LTCH patients are generally stable. Second, we assume that the reported costs are true
up to a monotone transformation, which we assume to be linear. This assumption means that
if hospital l has higher reported costs than hospital k, we will also assume that this also reects
the ranking of their true underlying costs. This seems (to us) reasonable, and could be driven
by a variety of factors, including geographic location. We expect  1, but do not impose this
constraint in estimation.
    The fourth assumption is to parameterize VU (h) and VD (h). We approximate each using a
linear function in h, so that
                                  Vj (h) =  0j +  1j h for j = D; U .                         (9)

Recall from Section 3 that healthier patients (higher h), who are associated with lower mortality, are
discharged to D, while sicker patients (lower h), associated with higher mortality, are discharged to
U . It is therefore natural to expect  1;D > 0 and v1;U < 0. That is, all else equal, facility D becomes
a more attractive discharge destination as health gets better (h is higher) and facility U becomes a
more attractive discharge destination as patients health worsens (h is lower). As explained below,
one of the intercept terms v0;D and v0;U needs to be normalized, so we set v0;U = 0.
    Fifth, as we discussed in Section 2, LTCHs are part of an interlocking post-acute care system,
with changes in LTCH incentives potentially a¤ecting Medicare spending throughout the patients
entire episode of care. In particular, Figure 5 shows sharp changes in both upstream and down-
stream post-discharge payments at the SSO threshold, indicating a relationship between patients
health at discharge and total Medicare spending. To account for this type of spillover e¤ects in
our counterfactuals, we model the relationship between health at discharge and post-discharge
payments as
                                 Pj (h) = exp( 0;j +  1;j h) for j = D; U ,                         (10)


                                                   18
where Pj (h) represents the post-discharge payments for a patient initially discharged to location
j = D; U with health status h at the time of discharge. We allow this relationship to vary by whether
the patient is initially discharged upstream or downstream and use an exponential speci cation so
that predicted post-discharge payments are strictly positive.
     Finally, as is typical in these types of models, we set (rather than estimate) the daily discount
factor to  = 0:951=365 .20 Thus, overall we are left with 19 parameters to estimate: ve parame-
ters (0 ;  0 ; ; ; ) that are associated with the health distribution and the way it evolves over
time in the pre-PPS period, ve corresponding parameters in the PPS period, the cost parameters
( ), four parameters ( 1U ;  0D ;  1D ;   ) associated with the relative value of patients at facili-
ties U and D, and four parameters associated with post-discharge payments in the PPS period
( 0;D ;  1;D ;  0;U ;  1;U ).
    Estimation. An important decision is how to treat heterogeneity across patients, observable
health conditions, and LTCH hospitals. In our baseline speci cation, we abstract from such hetero-
geneity and instead model the average discharge decision as it pertains to the average LTCH
patient and the average payment schedule. That is, we pool all payment schedules observed in
the data, separately for the pre-PPS and PPS periods, measure each day in the schedule relative to
the DRG-speci c SSO threshold in the PPS period (which is normalized to day zero), and construct
the average payment schedule for each day, as shown in Figure 1. We then apply an analogous
exercise to the discharge pattern, and construct the distribution of discharge patterns in a 61-day
window around the SSO threshold (from day -15 to day 45), as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. We
then estimate our model in an attempt to match these average patterns. The dramatic di¤erence
in the payment schedules between the pre-PPS and PPS periods will assist in the identi cation of
some of the parameters and it is an important component of our research design.
    An advantage of this approach of focusing on the average pattern rather than the heterogenous
pattern is that it only requires us to solve the dynamic problem once (for each period, pre-PPS and
PPS), which is computationally attractive. Given that our primary focus is on the aggregate e¤ect
of nancial incentives across the entire LTCH sector, abstracting from the heterogeneity across pa-
tients and hospitals is likely to be inconsequential. That said, motivated by the descriptive evidence
in how for-pro t and non-pro t LTCHs di¤erentially respond to nancial incentives, we separately
conduct a counterfactual analysis to explore the heterogeneous e¤ects of nancial incentives for
these two types of hospitals, which reveals some intriguing patterns. Heterogeneity in the response
is also the focus of the related exercise reported by Eliason et al. (2016).
    We estimate the model using simulated method of moments, by trying to match the daily
mortality and discharge patterns presented in Figure 4, as well as post-discharge payment moments
that are based on Figure 5. Speci cally, we use two sets of moments. First, we use 183 moments
for the pre-PPS payment schedule, reecting the daily discharge and mortality risks within the
61-day window around the SSO threshold. One set of moments is associated with discharge rates
  20
    While having a discount factor so close to 1 might generally create convergence issues, in our Bellman equation
the probability of survival enters jointly with the discount factor so that the e¤ective discount factor  (1  m(h))
is not too close to 1.


                                                          19
to D, another with discharge rates to U , and a third with mortality rates. We then construct
another set of 183 corresponding moments for the PPS period. Because much of the identi cation
is driven by the sharp change to discharge incentives at the SSO threshold, we assign greater weights
to moments that are closer to day zero (the SSO threshold) by making the weights decrease by
a constant amount (1/61) per day away from the threshold. The second set of moments uses
the data on post-discharge payments to allow us to capture spillover e¤ects in our counterfactuals.
Speci cally, we average post-discharge payments for each discharge destination (U or D), separately
for discharges before and after the SSO threshold. We then match them to the model prediction
regarding the health status distribution of discharged patients, thus allowing us to link health and
post-discharge payments.21
    Generating the model predictions requires us to solve the dynamic problem described in the
previous section for each set of parameters. To ease with computation, we approximate the health
process F (jhi;t 1 )with a discrete health space that evolves according to a Markov transition ma-
trix (Tauchen, 1986).22 This eases the solution of the dynamic problem, and at the same time
allows us to read the discharge probabilities directly o¤ the solution, without any need to integrate
(presumably by simulation) over potentially intractable integration regions.
     Intuition for Identi cation. To see the intuition for the identi cation of the parameters,
it is easiest to consider rst a case where health is homogeneous across patients and over time.
Under this assumption, the data can be characterized by daily observations of discharge shares
to U and to D (sU t and sDt , respectively), with the remaining patients staying at the LTCH
(slt = 1 sU t sDt ). The problem resembles a repeated static discrete choice problem, where the
mean utility of each discharge destination is given by the continuation values VU t , VDt , and Vlt . As
is usual in multinomial logit models, the observed daily shares can then be inverted to recover the
values of VU t , VDt , and Vlt , subject to a required level and scale normalizations.
     Let us start with the level normalization, and consider discharge shares after the SSO threshold,
where the model is in a steady state. Setting VU t = 0 allows us to estimate VD from the average
values of VDt and Vlt , up to a scale normalization. To identify the scale parameter   , consider
the discharge shares the day before the SSO threshold: the jump in payments introduces a sharp
change in the continuation values, which identi es the e¤ect of payments on V s, or equivalently
identi es   . Finally, the cost parameter is identi ed o¤ the non-stationarity of the model prior
to the SSO threshold, and the way discharge patterns are changing as the SSO threshold gets
closer. As the SSO threshold nears, the expected (remaining) length of stay of patients shortens,
making the expected life-time costs associated with a given patient gradually decline in a way that
is not proportional to expected payments, allowing us to separately identify the impact of cost.
Loosely, Vlt varies over time as a function of the payment schedule p(t), reported costs scaled by
  21
    Because there is no variation in payments in the pre-PPS period, we do not have the variation in dischargees
health that we need to identify the pre-PPS post-discharge payments model. Since we focus on the PPS period in
our counterfactuals, and therefore do not need these estimates, we do not estimate pre-PPS post discharge payments.
  22
    In particular, we approximate the health distribution with a grid of 250 evenly spaced values that span a range
of +/- three standard deviations around the mean of the steady state health process.


                                                        20
parameter , and the relevant time horizon, which depends on the mortality rate and subsequent,
endogenous discharge decisions. So one can think of the identi cation of the scale parameter  
and as a projection of the values of Vlt on these observables. The sharp change in payments
at the SSO threshold provides a sharp change in the present value of payments and identi es the
scale parameter (or equivalently the coe¢cient on payments when the variance of the error term
is standardized), and the di¤erential change in the present value of payments versus costs as the
patient approaches the SSO threshold identi es . This identi cation can be achieved from the
PPS moments alone, but given that we restrict these parameters to be time-invariant, it is also
aided by variation in discharge patterns between the pre-PPS and PPS periods.
    If health status h were observed, we could make the argument above conditional on health,
and thus identify each object as a non-parametric function of h. In practice h is unobserved, but
identifying the health process is conceptually easy given our assumptions. If there are no discharges,
which is roughly the case during the rst week or so of the LTCH stay, the only attrition from the
sample is due to mortality. With only ve parameters that determine the initial health distribution
and how it evolves from day to day, mortality rates over ve days are su¢cient to identify the
health process parameters, separately in the pre-PPS and PPS periods. Once the unobserved
health distribution is identi ed, we can integrate over h and apply a similar intuition to the one
we described above for the homogenous h case. Moreover, once the health process is identi ed, the
cross-sectional distribution of h varies over time in known ways, so we can also identify how the
key parameters  in particular the V s  vary as a function of h. Finally, the relationship between
the health status h and the post-discharge payments is directly identi ed o¤ the data given that
the model does not impose any restrictions on this relationship.
    Finally, the parameters of the post-discharge payments model ( 0;D ;  1;D ;  0;U ;  1;U ) are identi-
  ed by the sharp change in health of patients discharged on di¤erent sides of the SSO threshold.
That is, they are essentially mapping the models prediction regarding the average health status
of dischargees before and after the SSO threshold to the corresponding average of observed post-
discharge payments, which also exhibit a sharp change around the SSO threshold (as shown in
Figure 5).
    Obviously, as is typically the case, the intuition for identi cation requires us to have substantial
variation in the data. In practice, some of the variation is not as large, and statistical power issues
require us to impose more parametric structure, so the estimable model is not as exible  especially
in terms of the extent to which parameters vary with h  as the identi able structure would be.

4.3    Parameter estimates and model t
Table 3 presents the parameter estimates. We estimate = 0:78 implying that LTCHs actual costs
are 22% lower than their reported value. This is consistent with our prior that reported costs are
inated.
    The  1;U ,  0;D , and  1;D parameters capture the value the LTCH places on the patients utility
from being discharged to U or D relative to remaining at the LTCH, as well as any potential e¤ect


                                                     21
on patient health evolution in the discharge location (relative to remaining at the LTCH). The
estimates imply that LTCHs are indi¤erent between U and D for a patient with h = 2:0, which
is a fairly low health level. For instance, h = 2:0 is the 4.2th percentile of the steady state PPS
health (normal) distribution (with estimated parameters  = 6:2 and  = 2:4) and corresponds to a
daily mortality hazard of 2.1%. Consistent with our description of patients owing downstream
as their health improves, D is relatively better for healthier patients and U is better for sicker
patients. The magnitude of the slope parameter v1;D is about one- fth as large (in absolute value)
as the slope parameter v1;U , which indicates that a given change in nancial incentives will have a
much larger e¤ect on discharges on the downstream D margin. These estimates are consistent with
the descriptive evidence that shows a substantially larger response on the downstream margin at
the SSO threshold.
     Relative to the slope parameters  1;U and  1;D , the scale parameter   on the logit error is
fairly small. The estimates imply that a tenth of a standard deviation increase in the error term
increases the value of discharging a patient to a given location by $71, the product of   = 550
                                                                  p
and a tenth of a standard deviation of the logit error (= 6). In contrast, a tenth of a standard
deviation increase in steady state health index ( = 2:4) raises the value of discharging a patient
downstream by $1; 523 (= 0:1  2:4  6; 330) and lowers the value of discharging a patient upstream
by $7; 274 (= 0:1  2:4  30; 230), indicating that health status is capturing most of the unobserved
heterogeneity in discharge behavior.
     The  0;U ,  1;U ,  0;D , and  1;D parameters capture the relationship between health at discharge
and post-discharge payments in the PPS period. Consistent with our interpretation of Figure 5,
the estimates indicate that post-discharge payments are declining as the patient gets healthier,
with semi-elasticities of  1;U = 0:79 and  1;D = 0:27 on the upstream and downstream margins,
respectively.
     We are cautious not to over-interpret the change between the pre-PPS and PPS periods in the
health process parameters. Because they are the only parameters that are allowed to vary across
the time periods, they capture not only di¤erences in the health of admitted patients but may also
reect other factors that vary over time, such as changes in medical technology or the administrative
capacity of providers.
     The model ts the data reasonably well. Figure 8 presents our discharge moments and the
simulated moments from the estimated model. The left column shows values in the PPS period
and the right column shows values in the pre-PPS period. The top row shows the share of discharges
to U by day relative to the SSO threshold, the middle row shows the share of discharges to D, and
the bottom row shows the share of patients who die at the LTCH. The model does a very good job
  tting the spike in discharges to U and D in the PPS period. This is particularly encouraging
because this variation is our key source of identifying variation. The model t for the mortality
patterns in the pre-PPS and PPS periods is good over the initial days, but less good at longer time
horizons. This is likely due to our fairly parsimonious parameterization of the health process. The
model t is also poorer for discharges to U in the pre-PPS period.
     Figure 9 provides some intuition for how the model operates, illustrating the policy function

                                                   22
at the estimated parameters.23 Healthy patients (higher h) are discharged to D, while sick patients
(lower h) are discharged to U . Consistent with the descriptive evidence, LTCHs work down the
distribution at the jump and lower their discharge threshold on the D margin and conversely work
up the distribution on the U margin and increase the discharge threshold. The larger shift on
the D margin relative to the U margin relates directly to our discussion above on the magnitude
of the slope parameter estimates (v1;D and v1;U ). The relatively small outward shift in the policy
function just before the SSO threshold is consistent with the descriptive results which show limited
evidence on missing mass immediately to the left of the SSO threshold.

4.4    The e¤ects of counterfactual nancial incentives
We use our model to simulate discharge patterns and Medicare payments under a variety of coun-
terfactual payment schedules. Throughout this section, we assume that the initial distribution of
health of admitted patients stays the same but that the subsequent discharge decisions reect the
incentives provided by the counterfactual payment schedules.
    We limit our attention to alternative schedules that maintain the current practice of a cap
on payments after a certain number of days. We do this both because it respects the current
policy approach toward LTCH payments and because an uncapped schedule would lead to a
small number of long hospitals stays, which is outside of the variation in our data. Speci cally,
we consider three main types of counterfactuals: payment schedules that remove the jump while
holding the threshold day constant, payment schedules that eliminate the jump (and allow the
threshold day to vary) while holding LTCHs harmless, and cost-based reimbursement at a constant
per diem, capped at 60 days. We discuss each in turn below.
    Removing the jump. We start by considering two simple modi cations of the baseline pay-
ment schedule that eliminate the jump in payments at the SSO threshold, but, like the baseline
PPS payment schedule, provide no payments on the margin for stays in excess of the SSO threshold.
Figure 10 plots these counterfactual payment schedules and the baseline schedule for comparison.
The top panel shows a counterfactual we call higher rate per day, which eliminates the jump by
increasing the per-diem payment from $1,384 to $2,151 prior to the SSO threshold but holds the
post-threshold payment xed. The bottom panel shows a counterfactual schedule we call lower
cap, which eliminates the jump in payments at the SSO threshold by reducing the PPS payment
from $34,419 to $22,144 but holds the pre-SSO per diem payment xed. The higher rate per
day contract is weakly more generous than the baseline schedule, while the lower cap contract
is weakly less generous.
    We use our model to simulate discharge patterns and Medicare payments under these two
counterfactuals. Figure 11 shows the policy functions under each payment schedule, Figure 12 shows
the discharge patterns, and Table 4 summarizes the impact of each of these payments schedules on
  23
    The policy function is not a deterministic function of h; given the s in the LTCHs keep and discharge ow
payo¤ functions (see equations 1 and 2) , h is related to discharge stochastically. The policy lines in Figure 9 are
drawn so that at that given level of h, 50% of the patients are discharged to the relevant destination.

Medicare payments to the LTCH and to other facilities.
    The black dashed lines in Figure 11 show the policy function under the higher rate per day
counterfactual. During the rst few days, the policy function is similar to that under the observed
schedule. However, as the length-of-stay increases, the elimination of the jump reduces the incentive
to retain patients, and the policy function shifts inwards on the upstream and downstream margins.
The black dashed lines in Figure 12 shows discharge patterns under this counterfactual. Mirroring
the changes in the policy function, the higher rate per day counterfactual increases discharges in
the 10 days prior to the SSO threshold, relative to the observed schedule. As shown in column (2)
of Table 4, these higher discharge rates reduce average length of stay by 1.9 days or 7.2%.24
    Despite the signi cantly higher per-day payments prior to the jump ($2,151 versus $1,384),
Medicare payments to LTCHs increase by a very small amount of $369 or 1%. The small increase
is due to a large behavioral response to the incentives. Holding discharge patterns xed, LTCHs
would get paid about 50% more per day for stays below the SSO threshold, but in response to the
elimination of the jump, patients are now discharged earlier, so overall payments are lower. Holding
discharge patterns xed, we calculate that the mechanical e¤ect of this counterfactual is a $1,767
increase in Medicare payments to the LTCH, implying that the behavioral response to the removal
of the jump reduces Medicare payments to the LTCH by $1,398 per admission. LTCH pro ts per
admission rise by about $2,483 or 37% relative to the observed schedule.
    We next explore the e¤ects of the lower cap payment schedule. The grey lines in Figure
11 show the policy function under this counterfactual. The elimination of the jump in payments
shifts the policy function inwards during the entire pre-threshold period, relative to that under the
observed schedule. The grey lines in Figure 12 show that discharges correspondingly rise, with the
daily share of discharges to D increasing four-fold and the share of discharges to U increasing more
modestly over most of the pre-threshold period. As shown in column (3) of Table 4, average length
of stay is reduced by 4.5 days, and payments to the LTCH are reduced by $11,954 or 43%. The
mechanical e¤ect (holding observed discharge patterns xed) of the lower cap payment schedule
is a reduction in payments of $8,844 or about 74% of the overall reduction, with the remaining 26%
due to the behavioral response. LTCH pro ts per admission fall by over $6,954 per admission and
are estimated to be negative, a point we return to below.
    The remaining rows of Table 4 consider the impact of these counterfactual payment schedules
on Medicare payments throughout the rest of the episode of care. For these counterfactuals, the
spillovers on post-discharge payments are small. For the higher rate per day counterfactual, post-
discharge payments for patients discharged U and D are a¤ected by a few hundred dollars. For
the lower cap counterfactuals, the decrease in post discharge payments is larger but still small
compared to decrease in LTCH payments. Combining the e¤ects on LTCH payments and post-
discharge payments, our estimates indicate that the higher rate per day has virtually no e¤ect
on total Medicare payments ($70 increase) and the lower cap reduces total Medicare payments
  24
    Length of stay is measured from day -15. However, because the average SSO threshold across admissions in our
sample is 22.5 days, values for length of stay need to be increased by 7.5 (=22.5-15) days to match the summary
data.


                                                      24
by a substantial $12,467 or 26%.
   While interesting, neither of the above counterfactuals is fully satisfactory. While the lower
cap counterfactual suggests that alternative payment schedules could substantially reduce Medicare
payments, the large decrease in LTCH revenue (and in estimated pro ts) might have unintended
consequences. For instance, under this payment schedule, LTCHs might cut back on socially valu-
able xed investments or even exit the market. In contrast, the higher rate per day counterfactual,
while clearly making LTCHs better o¤, has virtually no e¤ect on Medicare payments. Yet, these two
exercises suggest that there might be intermediate contracts that generate cost savings without
the risk of unintended consequences. We explore such counterfactuals below.
    Win-win payment schedules. With the above considerations in mind, we now consider a
set of counterfactuals that hold LTCH revenue xed under the observed discharge patterns. Faced
with these contracts, if LTCHs do not change their behavior, they will have identical revenue,
costs, and pro ts as they would under the observed payment schedule. If the LTCH change their
behavior, by revealed preferences, they must be (weakly) better o¤. Therefore, by design, these
contracts should not have a negative impact on LTCHs.
    In the same spirit as the previous counterfactuals, we consider contracts that pay a constant
per-diem amount up to a threshold length of stay, at which point the payments are capped and per
diem payments drop to zero (obviously, with no jump). We consider contracts where the payment
is capped at thresholds in a +/- 10 day range on either side of the current SSO threshold day. Since
the generosity of the contract is strictly increasing in the per diem rate, for a given length of stay
at which payments are capped, there is a unique payment schedule that holds LTCH revenue xed
under the baseline discharge patterns.
    Figure 13 plots a set of these contracts, where to avoid overcrowding the gure, we show payment
schedules for only a subset of the 21 contracts considered. The top panel of Figure 14 plots LTCH
payments against total Medicare payments (including estimated post-discharge payments) for each
of the contracts we consider. The bottom panel of Figure 14 plots estimated LTCH pro ts against
Medicare payments for each contract. For comparison, both plots also show outcomes under the
observed payment schedule.
    The gures indicate that there is a broad set of win-win payment schedules that reduce
total Medicare payments for the episode of care while leaving LTCHs (weakly) better o¤. Every
counterfactual contract with a threshold between -8 and 8 days reduces Medicare spending, although
there is substantial heterogeneity in the reduction. LTCH revenues increase for every contract with
a threshold of 6 to 10 days and declines for contracts with a threshold of -10 to 5 days. Because
LTCHs value both pro ts and patient utility, LTCH pro ts under counterfactuals do not necessarily
increase. LTCH pro ts are higher than their baseline level for contracts with a threshold -10 to
2 days and are lower for thresholds of 3 to 10 days. Counterfactuals that decrease pro ts do not
lower them by a substantial amount.
    The counterfactual with payment threshold of 1 day more than the current SSO threshold results




                                                 25
in the largest reduction in Medicare spending and is a natural contract to focus on.25 Column (4)
of Table 4 shows outcomes for this contract. Under this payment schedule, Medicare payments to
LTCHs are reduced by $1,660 or 5.9%. Accounting for Medicare payments across the entire episode
of care leads to somewhat higher savings of $2,145, or 4.5% of total episode payments. Despite the
reduced payments, LTCH pro ts rise by $344 per stay or 5.1%: the decline in LTCH revenue is
o¤set by lower costs, as length of stay is almost 2 days (9%) shorter.
     Cost-based payment schedules. The last two columns of Table 4 report results from two
additional counterfactuals that explore cost-based reimbursement as a constant per diem rate. The
  rst counterfactual pays LTCHs a constant per diem of their estimated costs, which is $1,107 per
day. The second counterfactual pays LTCHs a constant per diem of $507, which is the average per
day payment to SNFs during the post-discharge period. We think about this counterfactual as a
form of reference based pricing where Medicare pays LTCHs the opportunity cost to Medicare
of the patient  i.e., the amount Medicare would have incurred for the patient at a location that
provides fairly similar care (at least for the marginal patient). To avoid extrapolating too far outside
of our data, for both of these counterfactuals we cap payments after 60 days, which leads LTCHs
to discharge virtually all of their patients within 90 days of the current SSO threshold.
     Paying LTCHs their estimated costs leads to a substantial $7,010 increase in payments to LTCHs
and a smaller $3,530 overall increase in total Medicare payments. Payments increase because LTCH
retain patients for longer time periods rather than discharging them to SNFs where Medicare
payments would be lower, with average length of stay increasing from 19.2 to 32.4 days. Paying
LTCHs the average per-diem for SNFs leads to a massive decrease in LTCH payments and total
Medicare payments, accompanied by a sharp reduction in length of stay. Of course, concerns about
unintended consequences, which we discussed in the context of the lower cap schedule, are also
relevant here.
    For-pro t versus non-pro t LTCHs. At the end of Section 3, we presented descriptive
evidence where we split the sample by whether the LTCH was a for-pro t or non-pro t hospital.
In particular, we showed that while payment schedules were similar for for-pro t and non-pro t
LTCHs, for-pro ts exhibited a larger increase in discharges at the SSO threshold, suggesting that
these facilities are more responsive to nancial incentives. Our model allows us to quantify the
magnitude of the di¤erences in for-pro t and non-pro t behavior, and to adjust for potential di¤er-
ences in the health of the patients admitted to these facilities to more precisely isolate heterogeneity
in their response to incentives.
    To conduct this analysis, we estimate the model allowing all of the parameters except those
governing post-discharge payments to vary by for-pro t status. We force the post-discharge pay-
ments parameters to be the same because, conditional on h at discharge, post-discharge payments
should not depend on whether the patient was discharged from a for-pro t or non-pro t hospital.
In addition, requiring the parameters to be equal helps ensure that the health process has the same
  25
    By contrast, we achieve the highest Medicare dissavings with the counterfactual with the payment threshold of
-10 days, where Medicare spending rises by over 2%.

cardinal interpretation across these di¤erent types of LTCHs.
     Appendix Table A4 shows the parameter estimates. The health process parameters are broadly
similar across the two types of hospitals. The point estimate for costs is somewhat lower for for-
pro t ( = 0:81) than non-pro t ( = 0:91) hospitals, which is consistent with higher operational
e¢ciency by the private sector. The point estimates on the slope parameters (v1;U and v1;D ) are also
smaller in absolute value for for-pro ts than non-pro ts, indicating that for-pro ts are more elastic
to nancial incentives in their discharge decisions. We note, however, that the non-pro t parameters
are less precisely estimated so that the di¤erences are only sometimes statistically signi cant.
     Comparing for-pro ts and non-pro ts parameter by parameter is not particularly insightful.
Therefore, to quantify the di¤erence between for- and non-pro ts over the full set of parameters,
Table 5 conducts the counterfactual of assigning every LTCH for-pro t versus non-pro t status.
For reference, column (1) shows outcomes under the observed organizational form. To construct
column (2), we assign all LTCHs the ,  1;U ,  0;D ,  1;D , and   estimates for for-pro t hospitals
but maintain the heterogenous health process parameters so that there is no change in the health
distribution of the patients. For column (3), we assign all LTCHs the non-pro t estimates for ,
 1;U ,  0;D ,  1;D , and   and hold the health process xed.
     Consistent with the increased responsiveness to incentives, payments to LTCHs are $458 (or
about 1.7%) higher under the all for-pro t than the all non-pro t counterfactual. We estimate
that LTCH pro ts are more than twice as large ($5,681 versus $2,590) under the counterfactual
where they are all for-pro t. Interestingly, the $458 higher payments only accounts for about one-
  fth of the higher pro ts, with the majority of the di¤erence being due to lower estimated costs.
Accounting for post-discharge payments, the estimates imply that the counterfactual of convert-
ing all LTCHs from for-pro t to non-pro t status would reduce total Medicare payments across
the entire episode of care by $1,376 or about 2.9% of their current level, holding the distribution
of patient health xed.
    Robustness. In our baseline model, we made a number of parametric assumptions. In order
to assess the sensitivity of our main results to these assumptions, Table 6 reports the main results
from a subset of the (many) alternative speci cations that we examined. The results appear to be
qualitatively robust.
    In our rst alternative speci cation, we relax the assumption that the health process is stationary
by allowing the auto-correlation parameter  to vary with length-of-stay according to  = 0 +
1 ln(t + 1), where the time index is de ned such that the patient is admitted on date t = 0:26
While in the pre-PPS period 1 is very close to zero, in the PPS period the estimate is slightly
negative 1 = 0:005, which is consistent with health becoming less stable over the course of the
stay. However, as shown in Panel B of Table 6, enriching the speci cation in this manner has
virtually no e¤ect on the counterfactuals. We also speci ed other models of health processes, such
as a random walk and a random walk with a drift, but the ability of these models to t the data
  26
    We assume that the correlation parameter becomes xed after 45 days at a value of  = 0 + 1 ln(46) so that
the dynamic programming problem becomes stationary for t > 45, allowing us to solve the t > 45 problem by value
function iteration and earlier periods by backwards induction.


                                                      27
was much worse than our baseline speci cation.
   The second speci cation reported in Table 6 ts the model using only the PPS moments. The
counterfactuals, shown in Panel C of Table 3, are very similar to the baseline estimates, suggesting
that the sharp jump in payments at the SSO threshold, relative to over-time variation from the
implementation of LTCH-PPS, is the key driver of the results. The limited importance of the over-
time variation presumably stems from the fact that we allow distinct health process parameters in
each period, thereby soaking up much of the over-time variation.


5    Conclusions
In this paper, we examined the impact of provider nancial incentives in post-acute care (PAC),
a setting with large stakes both for the government budget and patient health that has received
scant attention in the academic literature. Within the context of PAC, we examined the impact of
a jump in Medicare payments to long term care hospitals (LTCHs) that occurs after a pre-speci ed
length of stay, when reimbursement shifts from a per diem rate to a lump sum payment. At the
threshold, the payment for keeping an individual another day jumps by about $13,000, with no
marginal payment for additional days beyond the threshold.
    The descriptive evidence shows a large response by LTCHs to the jump in payments. At the
threshold, there is a large spike in discharges. The marginal patient a¤ected by the payment
threshold is relatively healthy. We are unable to detect any impact on patient mortality at the
threshold, even in this high-mortality population.
    To examine the implications of alternative payment schedules, we speci ed and estimated a
stylized dynamic model of LTCH discharge behavior which allows us to model LTCH behavior,
payments, and pro ts, as well as total Medicare payments for the episode of care, under alternative
payment schedules. We used the estimated model to search for win-win contracts that hold
LTCHs (and presumably its patients as well) harmless, while reducing Medicare payments. The
contract with the largest Medicare savings reduced total Medicare payments by 5% while increasing
LTCH pro ts by a similar percentage.
    We also considered more aggressive payment schedules that resulted in substantially higher
Medicare savings but raised the possibility of unintended consequences due to a large reduction in
LTCH pro ts. In particular, in our model we take admission to the LTCH as given and focus on the
impact of counterfactual policies on length of stay and payments to the LTCH and post-discharge
costs for this xed set of patients. However, the large reduction in pro ts brought about in our
more aggressive counterfactuals may a¤ect which patients are admitted to an LTCH and might
have even broader e¤ects on the market, for instance through entry and exit decisions. We consider
an important area for further work to move up the healthcare pathway and model the decision
to discharge from an acute hospital stay to an LTCH or other PAC facilities.
    More broadly, our results indicate how economic models and data can be combined to better
inform contract design. Little other than common sense was needed to see that some alternative
payment schedule should be better for both the Medicare payer and the LTCH. Data and descriptive

                                                28
evidence, however, were important to move beyond this conceptual existence proof to demonstrate
a quantitatively meaningful behavioral response by the LTCH to the current payment schedule. An
economic model and its estimates were necessary to identify speci c contracts that could create a
win-win for the LTCH and Medicare payments given the LTCHs optimizing behavioral response
to alternative contracts. While naturally our results are speci c to our particular setting, we hope
that this type of approach can inform future work examining the impact of provider nancial
incentives not only for the directly a¤ected provider but throughout the healthcare system.

Appendix
Appendix A. Post-discharge payments and days
Our starting point of the analysis is an admission to an LTCH. We can observe all discharge
destinations from an LTCH. Appendix Table A1 shows the share of discharges to di¤erent locations.
In the PPS period, 14% of patients die during their LTCH stay, another 11% are discharged
upstream (with the vast majority going to inpatient care) and 75% are discharged downstream
(with approximately half of these patients going to a SNF/IRF and 40% going home, where they
may receive care from an HHA).
    We de ne a post-discharge episode of care as the spell of almost continuous days following
discharge from an LTCH with Medicare payments to an ACH, SNF/IRF or LTCH. In particular,
the episode ends if there are at least two days without Medicare payments to these institutions.
    Although we can observe all discharge destinations within the episode of care, we only observe
claim-level Medicare payments and days at ACHs, SNF/IRFs, and LTCHs. To address the fact
that we do not observe payments or days at HHAs or hospices, we supplement the MedPAR data
with annual spending and utilization from the Bene ciary Summary File (BSF) Cost & Utilization
 le. For every stay in the MedPAR data, we observe whether the patient was discharged to an
HHA or hospice at some point in the episode of care. For patients who were discharged to an HHA
or hospice, we impute the patients payments and days using the annual BSF data.
    Since these annual amounts include some payments and days that occur before or after the
episode of care, our imputation likely leads us to overestimate post-discharge Medicare payments
and days. However, we think that the approach provides a reasonable approximation. Appendix
Table A2 shows that our estimates of post-discharge payments and facility days are not a¤ected
much if we instead impute 0 costs for HHA and hospice, and 0 days for hospice.


Appendix B. LTCH payment systems
Prior to scal year 2003 (i.e. October 2002), CMS reimbursed LTCHs on a cost-based system. At
the start of scal year 2003, CMS began transitioning LTCHs to a prospective payment system
(PPS). The PPS, which was fully phased in by the start of scal year 2008 (i.e. October 2007), is
the focus of our study. This appendix describes it in more detail, drawing heavily on Kim et al.
(2015), Medicare Reimbursement Reference Guide (2015), and MedPAC (2014).

B.1. LTCH PPS rules
In contrast to the cost-based system, which had reimbursed hospitals based on the estimated cost of
each patients case, the PPS outlined a xed reimbursement amount for each patient, based on the
patients DRG. These DRG-based lump-sum payments were meant to reect the typical resources
consumed by each type of patient. However, in order to discourage short stays in hospitals which


                                                31
were meant to provide long-term care, the PPS includes a short stay outlier (SSO) threshold, with
reduced payments below the full DRG payment for LTCH patients who are discharged before a
DRG-speci c threshold.

Full DRG payment

The full DRG payment is computed as

               Full DRG Payment = Adjusted Federal Rate x DRG Relative Weight,                           (11)

where

 Adjusted Federal Rate        =    (Unadj. Federal Rate x Labor-Related Share x Wage Index) +
                                  + (Unadj. Federal Rate x Nonlabor-Related Share).                      (12)

    This payment structure is similar to the much-studied Inpatient PPS used for (regular) acute
care hospitals (ACHs) that was introduced in 1983, but di¤ers in two ways. First, although the
DRGs are de ned in the same way for the LTCH and Inpatient PPS, the relative weights associated
with DRGs have di¤erent values in LTCH-PPS. Second, the LTCH-PPS unadjusted federal rate is
larger than the corresponding Inpatient PPS value. The result is that LTCH-PPS payments are
substantially greater than Inpatient PPS payments for the same DRG, presumably to reect the
greater costs at an LTCH relative to an ACH.27

Short stay outlier (SSO) payment

If an LTCH stay has a length of stay (LOS) shorter than or equal to ve-sixths of the geometric
average length of stay (ALOS) for the DRG, it is paid as a short stay outlier. We call the smallest
integer greater than ve-sixth of the geometric ALOS the SSO Threshold. The SSO threshold is
constant within a DRG-PPS Rate Year (with the exception of 2009).
    A short stay outlier is paid the lowest of the following:

   1. Full DRG Payment.

   2. 120% of the DRG per diem amount times the length of stay, where the DRG per diem amount
      is de ned as the ratio of the full DRG payment to the geometric average of the LOS for that
  27
    Also, like Inpatient PPS, LTCH PPS o¤ers a High Cost Outlier (HCO) payment for particularly costly stays.
Speci cally, an LTCH can receive a HCO payment if the cost of the case exceeds the HCO Threshold. The HCO
payment is made in addition to the regular payment amount. Importantly, for our purposes, HCO payments can be
made regardless of whether the LTCH stay is considered an SSO outlier or eligible for the full DRG payment. We
therefore exclude HCO payments from our analysis and model. About 9% of LTCH stays in our baseline sample have
HCO payments, and the median HCO payment in our baseline sample is $12,428.




                                                     32
       DRG. This option is roughly equivalent to a linear interpolation of the full DRG payment
       between Day 0 and the SSO Threshold.28

   3. 100% of the cost of the case, which is computed as total charges multiplied by the facility-
      speci c cost-to-charge ratio.

   4. A blend of the Inpatient PPS amount (used at ACH) and 120% of the DRG per diem amount.
      Note that this option converges to option 2 as LOS increases.

B.2. Empirical payment schedules
PPS payment schedule

We use a commercial software o¤ered by the company 3M (the product is called Core Grouping
Software (CGS)) to compute counterfactual Medicare payments for each post-PPS period stay.29
Speci cally, for each stay in the PPS period, we compute the PPS payment for the actual discharge
day and each possible counterfactual discharge day. The inputs into this calculation are the ad-
mission date, estimated hospital charges, principal and secondary diagnoses, procedures, discharge
status, age, and sex of the patient. For counterfactual lengths of stay, we assume that hospital
charges scale linearly with the observed length of stay.
    With this information, the software produces the DRG code, the SSO threshold day, and the
total Medicare payment for each length of stay. To validate the software, we compare the predicted
DRG against the DRG we observe in the data, and the predicted payment against the observed
payment for the observed length of stay. The predicted DRG matches the observed value in 99.9%
stays and the predicted Medicare payment is within one dollar of the observed Medicare payment
in 90% of stays.
    Appendix Figure A1 illustrates the resultant, estimated payment schedules for both the pre-PPS
and PPS periods. Note that this gure di¤ers slightly from Figure 1 in the paper, which depicts
a stylized model of the post-period payment schedules in which the pre-threshold payments are
constant per diem. In practice, the pre-threshold payments appear to be slightly bowed downwards;
we abstract from this in Figure 1 which we use in our model estimates, where we used the average
payment per day for stays discharged before the threshold to construct the slope of the payment
schedule prior to the threshold.
    What features of the payment rule created the jump in payments at the SSO threshold? Recall
that right of the SSO Threshold, short-stay outlier rules do not apply and the payment is just the
full DRG payment, which means the cumulative payment schedule is always a at line to the right
of the threshold. To the left of the SSO Threshold, each stay is paid the minimum of four alternative
  28
    To see this, note that 120% of the DRG per diem amount times the length of stay is approximately equal to 120%
x (Full DRG payment) / ((6/5)SSO Threshold)) x LOS, which is equal to (Full DRG payment) / (SSO Threshold)
x LOS.

payments; the shape of the payment schedules therefore depends on which of the four alternatives
is binding. If options 1, 2, or 4 were binding, we would not see a jump at the threshold. Therefore,
we conclude that cost of the case must be binding in most cases because we observe a jump on
average. Note that the cost of case being binding is necessary rather than the su¢cient condition
for creating a jump in the payment schedule; the costs could theoretically be such that the payment
schedule only has a kink at the SSO threshold rather than a jump. In practice, however, the cost
of the case is on average lower than the other options, and we see a jump at the threshold.

Pre-PPS payment schedule

In the pre-PPS period, LTCHs were paid their (estimated) costs, up to facility-speci c per-day
limit (MedPAC 2014). For most facilities, this limit was binding. For these facilities, we calculate
the LTCH payment schedule as the per-day limit multiplied by the length of the stay. For a small
number of facilities, the payment limit does not appear to bind. For these facilities, we assume that
reported costs are linear in the patients length of stay, and we calculate the payment schedule as
the (imputed) per-day cost multiplied by the length of stay. When we analyze discharge patterns
in the pre-PPS period, we assign each stay the SSO threshold it would have had in the rst year
PPS period, based on the DRG assignments made using the CGS software described above.


Appendix C. Mortality analysis
We formally test for a mortality e¤ect using a regression discontinuity (RD) design. Let i index
individuals and t index days relative to the SSO threshold. Let yit be a mortality indicator. For
our analysis of the 1-day mortality hazard, yit takes a value of 1 if the individual dies on day t and
takes on a value of 0 if the individual is alive. For the 30-day mortality analysis, yit takes on a
value of 1 if the individual dies in the subsequent 30 days and takes on a value of 0 if the individual
does not die over this period. Individuals who have already died are excluded from the analysis.
    In our baseline RD speci cation, we allow for a linear trend in the running variable t and permit
this linear trend to vary on di¤erent sides of the SSO threshold:

                                yit =   0   +   1t   + 1t0 (   0   +   1 t)   + "it .            (13)

The coe¢cient of interest 0 captures the change in mortality at the SSO threshold, conditional
on the linear controls. To con rm the robustness of our ndings, we also estimate a speci cation
with a quadratic time trend that, as before, is also allowed to vary on di¤erent sides of the SSO
threshold:
                        yit = 0 + 1 t + 2 t2 + 1t0 ( 0 + 1 t + 2 t2 ) + "it :                (14)

In both speci cations, we restrict our analysis to observations close the threshold, focusing on
bandwidths of 3, 5, and 10 days within the threshold. We cluster our standard errors at the DRG
level, which allows for correlation in the health process not only within an individual over time but



                                                        34
also within the set of individuals who have the same DRG and therefore may exhibit correlated
mortality pro les. We focus the mortality analysis on the post-PPS period.
    Appendix Table A3 shows the parameter estimates with Panel A focusing on the 1-day mortality
hazard. Column (1) of Panel A, which shows our baseline speci cation with a linear time trend
and a 3-day bandwidth, indicates that 1-day mortality increases by less than 0.01 percentage point
at the threshold. This estimate is tiny in absolute magnitude, small relative to the baseline daily
mortality rate of 0.6%, and is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Columns (2) to (6) show that
this nding is robust to alternative bandwidths and a quadratic time trend. Panel B shows e¤ects
on the 30-day mortality hazard. Column (1) of Panel B, which again shows the baseline speci cation
with a linear time trend and a 3-day bandwidth, indicates an economically tiny and statistically
insigni cant 0.003 percentage point decline in 30-day mortality at the threshold (relative to a
baseline 30-day mortality rate of 13.5%). As before, the e¤ect is robust to alternative bandwidths
and a quadratic time trend.
    Because our standard errors in the regression discontinuity analysis rely on di¢cult-to-test
assumptions about the correlation structure of the error term, we assess the robustness of our
statistical inference using permutation inference (Rosenbaum 1984, 2002; Abadie et al. 2014).
Speci cally, we estimate equation (13) with a bandwidth of 3, replacing the dummy variable for
being to the right of the SSO threshold with a dummy variable for being to the right of placebo
thresholds de ned at t = 12 and t = 42 in the pre- and post-PPS periods. That is, we estimate
an RD e¤ect for a placebo threshold at each day starting 3 days after the start of our sample and
ending 3 days before the end (to allow for a 3-day bandwidth); we also exclude days -3 to 3 in the
post-PPS period since these days might be contaminated by a potential treatment e¤ect.
    Appendix Figure A4 plots the actual e¤ect and the distribution of placebo estimates for the
1-day and 30-day mortality hazards. The plots show that the actual change in mortality at the
SSO threshold is not particularly large relative to the typical day-to-day variation in the mortality
hazard. The distributions of placebo estimates imply a p-value of 0.796 for the 1-day mortality
hazard and a p-value of 0.757 for the 30-day mortality hazard.

Figure shows some examples of the 21 potential win-win contracts we consider. All contracts pay a constant amount
up to a threshold length of stay, where they are capped (so that per diem rate drops to zero) with no jump at the
threshold. We consider threshold days ranging from +/- 10 days of the current threshold, with the unique payment
schedule de ned for each threshold day as the one that would hold payments to the LTCH (i.e., LTCH revenue) xed
if they did not change their discharge behavior under the observed contracts.

a Number of chronic conditions is measured in the calendar year prior to the stay.

b Reports fraction home at least once during the 90 days after admission, where home means alive and not in a

facility (ACH, LTCH, SNF/IRF, or hospice).
c DRG groupings changed between the pre-period and post-period, so for simplicity we report this only for the

post-period.
d Length of stay is censored at 100 days for SNFs, since after that Medicare does not pay and therefore further days

are not observed. This applies to about 2 percent of stays.

a Post-discharge payments and post-discharge days refer to the entire post-discharge episode of care, which we de ne

to begin at the day of discharge and end when the patient spends two consecutive days at home.

Table presents results from the counterfactual payment schedules. Column (1) reports results that are based on
our parameter estimates (reported in Table 3) and the observed payment schedule, and each other column reports
the results from predicted discharge patterns under a di¤erent counterfactual payment schedule. The counterfactual
payment schedules we consider are described in the main text.
a Length of stay is measured from day -15. To make it comparable to the summary statistics reported in Table 1,

all numbers should be increased by 7.5 days (because the average SSO threshold across admissions in our sample is
22.5 days).

Table reports the discharge and payment patterns under the observed payment schedule. Column 1 reports results
under the observed organizational forms, while columns 2 and 3 show two counterfactual scenarios, where we apply
the model estimates from for-pro t hospitals only and from non-pro t hospitals only (see Appendix Table A4) to all
LTCHs. Sample excludes approximately 1 percent of patients at hospitals whose organizational form we could not
categorize.
a Length of stay is measured from day -15. To make it comparable to the summary statistics reported in Table 1,

all numbers should be increased by 7.5 days (because the average SSO threshold across admissions in our sample is

Table reports the main results from Table 4 under two alternative speci cations of the model. Panel A reports
results from the baseline speci cation, which corresponds to the numbers that are already reported in Table 4. Panel
B repeats the analysis, but we allow the AR(1) health process to vary over time by allowing the serial correlation
parameter    to change linearly with the natural logarithm of days since LTCH admission. Panel C re-estimates the
model using only data from the post-PPS period.

of 3, but replacing the dummy variable for being to the right of the SSO threshold with a dummy variable for being
to the right of a placebo threshold; see Appendix for more details. The gure also shows where the actual estimated
e¤ect falls within this range of placebo estimates.

Table shows results from the regression discontinuity mortality analysis described in Appendix C. Columns (1)-(3)
use a linear functional form (see equation (13)) before and after the SSO threshold, while columns (4)-(6) use a
quadratic functional form (see equation (14)). The table reports the estimate of the   o coe¢cient, which captures
the jump in mortality rate at the SSO threshold in the PPS-period. Each column restricts the analysis to a di¤erent
bandwidth number of days before and after the SSO threshold. The 1-day mortality hazard is de ned as the share
of individuals alive at a given day who die by the next day; the 30-day mortality hazard is similarly de ned as the
share of individuals alive at a given day who die in the next 30 days. Standard errors, clustered at the DRG level,
are in regular brackets and p-values in squared brackets.

Table presents estimates of the parameters from a speci cation where we allow all of the parameters, except the post-
discharge payment parameters, to vary by for-pro t vs. non-pro t status of the LTCH. Standard errors are computed
using the asymptotic GMM formula, where the variance-covariance matrix is computed using the bootstrap method,
sampling with replacement from the set of LTCH admissions.
