                                             ABSTRACT

        Studies of the welfare implications of trade policy often do not take account of the potential for
tariff-jumping FDI to mitigate positive gains to domestic producers. We use event study methodology
to examine the market effects for U.S. domestic firms that petitioned for antidumping (AD) relief, as well
as the effect of announcements of FDI by their foreign rivals in the U.S. market on these U.S. petitioning
firms. On average, affirmative U.S. AD decisions are associated with 3% abnormal gains to a petitioning
firm when there is no tariff-jumping FDI, but no abnormal gains if there is tariff-jumping FDI. The
evidence for this mitigating effect is strongest when announcements of the intended tariff-jumping FDI
have already occurred before an AD decision takes place, which happened in a fair number of cases. We
also find evidence that the announcements of plant expansions (and, to some extent, new plants) have
significantly larger negative effects on U.S. domestic firms’ profits than other types of FDI, including
acquisitions and joint ventures.

1. Introduction.

         Tariff-jumping     FDI allows a foreign firm to avoid a trade barrier by locating production

within the destination market. Such activities can thereby substantially mitigate welfare

consequences of the original trade protection policy.1 Theoretically, the likelihood of tariff-

jumping FDI for a given trade barrier and the magnitude of its effect on welfare of various agents

depends on a number of factors, including differential production costs, relocation costs, other

entry barriers, and demand conditions. As Smith (1987) shows for simple monopoly and Cournot

duopoly markets, “tariffs may or may not induce foreign direct investment, they may or may not

change market structure, and they may have pro- or anti-competitive effects.” 2 (p. 96)

         While trade economists find none of the above controversial, it is surprising how often

tariff-jumping is ignored in the academic literature, particularly in the case of strategic trade

policy.3 An exception is a theoretical literature that examines the consequences of tariff-jumping

FDI where governments understand the connection between trade policy and FDI and act

strategically. Ellingsen and Warneryd (1999) find that the optimal tariff for a government

concerned about domestic producers is one that is just low enough so that FDI does not occur. In

addition, VERs may be preferred to tariffs since VERs provide quota rents to the foreign firms,

making FDI less likely. In contrast, Brander and Spencer (1987) show conditions under which a

country with unemployment may wish to induce FDI by setting differential taxes on imports and

local production. Flam (1994) examines the ambiguity of trade policy determination with

the country or have production in the country.

  Motta (1992) extends Smith’s (1987) analysis, by allowing for potential entry by domestic producers and finding
an even wider array of possible outcomes and welfare effects.

  For example, Levinsohn (1989) shows how the literature on the non-equivalence of tariffs and quotas in the
presence of imperfect competition often hinges on the assumption that a quota leads to no foreign supply response,
which is false if tariff-jumping FDI is possible. A second example is the sparse mention in the literature of the large
FDI response by Japanese automakers when assessing the market and welfare effects of the U.S. automobile VER,
though Berry et al. (1999) is an important exception to this.

potential FDI for a government such as the European Union (EU), where some members have

domestic production and others do not. Finally, Haaland and Wooten (1998) examine optimal

government trade policies with potential FDI in the context of a two-country reciprocal dumping

model. These latter two papers present a wide variety of possible equilibrium outcomes

depending on initial conditions and the nature of the strategic game.

       Given this wide range of theoretical market outcomes and welfare consequences, the

empirical evidence on tariff-jumping FDI and its welfare consequences in the context of trade

policies is an important issue. Yet the profession has done little to estimate tariff-jumping

responses or its welfare consequences. Indeed, only a few papers have systematically examined

tariff-jumping FDI occurrences, and none have tried to estimate its welfare implications in any

dimension. Recent papers that have empirically examined tariff-jumping FDI include Belderbos

(1997), Blonigen and Feenstra (1997), Barrell and Pain (1999), which focus on Japanese firms’

responses to antidumping (AD) trade protection in the U.S. and the EU. For various levels of data

aggregation, these studies consistently find substantial tariff-jumping responses. In contrast,

using a more comprehensive dataset of all firms subject to U.S. AD duties, Blonigen (2002) finds

much smaller average tariff-jumping responses and concludes that tariff-jumping is only a

realistic option for multinational firms from industrialized countries.

       A number of papers have estimated the welfare consequences of trade policies,

particularly AD protection, but do not address the effects of tariff-jumping FDI. Murray and

Rousslang (1989), DeVault (1996) and Kelly and Morkre (1998) use computable partial

equilibrium models to examine welfare consequences of dumping (and AD) for separate U.S.

cases. Gallaway et al. (1999) estimate the collective welfare effects of all U.S. AD duties as of

1993 and find a substantial $2-$4 billion annual loss from these trade policies. None of these

studies considers tariff-jumping FDI in their estimates.

                                                  2
         Most closely related to our study, Hartigan et al. (1989), Mahdavi and Bhagwati (1994),

and Hughes et al. (1997) use event study methodology to examine the consequences of AD

investigation events and announced duties on domestic firms’ profits.4 Hartigan et al. (1989)

examines non-steel U.S. AD petitions in the early 1980s and finds statistically significant effects

on domestic firms’ profits, but only when the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC)

ruled that there was a threat of “injury” to the domestic industry, not when they ruled that actual

injury had occurred. Mahdavi and Bhagwati (1994) and Hughes et al. (1997) examine events

surrounding the trade protection actions related to the U.S. semiconductor industry in the mid-

1980s, which began with a series of AD investigations on various types of semiconductor chips.

Mahdavi and Bhagwati find a negative stock market reaction to the AD investigation, but positive

effects of the concluding Semiconductor Agreement of 1986 that supplanted any AD duties.

Hughes et al. find positive effects of the Semiconductor Agreement for both the U.S. producers

and the downstream consumers of semiconductors. They attribute positive impacts to

downstream consumers coming from the benefits of having a strong, innovative domestic

supplier. Neither of these studies considers tariff-jumping FDI responses which, in particular,

occurred with substantial magnitude in the semiconductor industry.

         In this paper, we take the next step of addressing the impact of tariff-jumping FDI on

welfare consequences of trade policies. Due to data considerations, our focus is on the welfare of

domestic firms which apply for import relief under U.S. AD laws. Unique firm-specific data

from U.S. AD cases allows us to focus on tariff-jumping FDI consequences for domestic firms’

profits and compare that with the initial domestic profit effects from the imposition of the AD

duty. For many U.S. AD cases, both the set of AD investigation events (from petition to

  Other examples of studies using event methodology to examine the impact of trade policies on domestic firm
profitability include Hartigan et al. (1986) that examined U.S. escape clause petitions, Lenway et al. (1980) that

imposition of the duty) and the foreign firm’s decision to locate production to the U.S. are

publicly-announced events in prominent media outlets. Using these announcements in

conjunction with stock market returns data, we employ an event study methodology that allows

estimation of profit consequences for publicly-traded domestic firms involved in these AD cases.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the AD investigation

process in the U.S. Section 3 details our empirical results from estimating stock market reactions

to AD and related tariff-jumping announcements using event study methodology. Our second-

stage analysis of the factors that affect the magnitude of these market reactions, including our

hypothesis that tariff-jumping FDI mitigates the gains domestic petitioners experience from AD

protection, is described in section 4, while section 5 highlights our main findings and concludes.



2. A Brief Overview of U.S. AD Investigations.

        The U.S. AD laws are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC) and

the USITC, each with distinct roles in the process. An investigation begins, when a petition is

filed with both agencies by an “interested party” that represents the domestic industry connected

with the product named in the investigation. Interested parties may be domestic firms, labor

unions, a trade association, or the USDOC itself, but is typically one or more domestic firms in

the industry.

        When a petition is filed, the USDOC’s role is to determine whether the subject product is

being sold at “less than fair value” in the U.S. Specifically, they calculate whether firms

exporting to the U.S. are selling the product in the U.S. at less than “normal” or “fair” value,

which is generally defined as the foreign firm’s own home market price for the same good. For

each case, the USDOC calculates an ad valorem dumping margin equal to the percentage


examined various trade policies connected with the steel industry in the late 1970s and 1980s. Ries (1993) examines

                                                         4
difference between the U.S. transaction prices they observe and “fair value”. The USITC

concurrently determines whether the relevant U.S. domestic industry has been materially injured,

or is threatened with material injury, by reason of the imports subject to its investigation.

        The USDOC and USITC each make preliminary and final determinations for each case. If

an affirmative preliminary determination is made by both the USDOC and the USITC, then the

importer must post a cash deposit, a bond or other security for each entry equal to the preliminary

margin determined by the USDOC. This requirement stays in effect until either the USDOC or

the USITC makes a negative final determination. If an affirmative final determination is made by

both the USITC and USDOC, then the USDOC issues an AD order to levy a duty equal to the

estimated dumping margin on the subject product. When a subject foreign product enters the

U.S., the importer must pay U.S. Customs a cash deposit equal to the margin times the value of

the subject product.

        In all cases, the USDOC finds a nonnegative dumping margin by virtue of the

methodologies they use to calculate the dumping margins (see Murray, 1991). Thus, the main

information received from the USDOC decision is the magnitude of the dumping duty should the

case be ruled affirmative. The real hurdle for a final affirmative decision in the case, leading to

imposition of AD duties, is the USITC final determination. The USITC ruled affirmative in their

final decision in only about 40% of the cases from 1980-1993 (USITC, 1995, p. 3-1).

        On a final note, AD cases can be terminated or suspended before a final decision is made

by the USDOC and USITC. Terminations may occur for a variety of reasons, from insufficient

grounds for an AD petition to a decision by the domestic petitioners to no longer pursue the case,

possibly due to a private settlement with the foreign firms (see Prusa, 1992). Suspensions occur

when the domestic and foreign parties agree to a suspension agreement to resolve their dispute, as


the market effects for Japanese automakers and their suppliers from the 1981 U.S. VER on Japanese autos.

3. First-Stage Analysis: Cumulative Abnormal Returns

       Our empirical analysis is in two stages. In this section, we employ an event study

methodology to estimate abnormal stock returns for publicly-traded firms from announcements of

our focus events: AD investigations and tariff-jumping FDI. In the second stage analysis, which

we present in section 4 below, we estimate determinants of these first-stage abnormal returns

obtained from our event study methodology.

       The hypotheses we explore in this section are that 1) AD duties will lead to gains in

domestic firms’ profits, and 2) tariff-jumping FDI by the foreign rival will mitigate these gains

(i.e., lead to loss in domestic profits). There are a number of issues that may complicate the

testing of these hypotheses. The first hypothesis is quite straightforward, particularly for AD

cases which are initiated by domestic firms themselves, and which presumably would not petition

for AD duties unless they expected positive profit gains from the action. Although government

agencies make the ultimate determination of the case, AD actions allow little or no voice for

consumer groups or other agents in the economy in the investigation. Thus, it is clear that the

trade action is solely intended to benefit the domestic producers.

       The second hypothesis, at least the magnitude of the tariff-jumping FDI effect, is perhaps

less straightforward. Foreign firms’ competitive advantages may have been largely connected

with location advantages in their own country. Tariff-jumping may be preferred to exporting, but

the foreign firm’s ability to compete may be nearly as diminished once it tariff-jumps as if they

were to continue exporting. For example, Dofasco and Co-Steel started a joint-venture steel mill

in Kentucky in 1995 in response to the 1992-93 U.S. steel cases against imported steel from

                                                 6
Canada and other import sources. By 1998, the joint venture had never turned a profit and Co-

Steel was trying to sell its $600 million share (Canadian Press Newswire, April 24, 1998). In a

similar vein, U.S. Department of Commerce (1993) reports that U.S.-owned ball bearings plants

were approximately three times more profitable from 1987-1991 than foreign-owned ball

bearings plants in the U.S. (9.0% return on assets versus 2.3%), many of which had recently

located in the U.S. due to AD duty cases. (p. 47) In fact, from a strategic game-theoretic

viewpoint, one might suspect that domestic firms would not petition for relief if they believe

harmful tariff-jumping FDI will occur: i.e., to the extent that we see tariff-jumping, it is in cases

where the domestic industry calculated that the AD actions will not be substantially mitigated.

This obviously assigns substantial information and rationality on the part of the domestic firms.

In addition, government agencies, not domestic firms, determine the level of the import barrier in

AD cases and may set it “too high”, leading to tariff-jumping FDI that is harmful to the domestic

firms.



3.1. Methodology and Data.

         To test these hypotheses, we first employ an event study methodology that estimates

abnormal stock returns for firms from public announcements of our focus events after controlling

for general market movements. Thus, assuming the stock market is efficient, we estimate the

market model:

                                        Rit = α i + βi Rmt + εit                                  (1)

where Rit is the return on security i on day t, Rmt is the market return on day t, and git is the zero

mean disturbance term. Rmt is the broad-based stock index for the market portfolio, the S & P

500 index.



                                                    7
       Equation (1) is estimated for each firm using daily returns 300 days before the event

through 45 days before the event. We then estimate abnormal returns (ARiJ) in our event window

for firm i. Abnormal returns will be indexed in event time using J. Using the market model

parameter estimates from equation (1), we define ARiJ for firm i as:

                                ARiτ = Riτ − α$i − β$i Rmτ                                      (2)

where J measures time relative to the event date, J= 0. Thus, assuming efficient markets, the

abnormal return represents the market’s valuation of the change in the firm’s current and future

expected profitability due to the announced event. An event window typically includes the event

day and the day after the event to allow the information to be fully incorporated into the firms’

return. In addition, the window includes days before the event to allow for possible leakage of the

event’s outcome to some investor’s. The cost of extending the window is the possibility of other

unrelated events confounding the estimated abnormal returns for the focus event (i.e. a firm’s

quarterly earnings announcement could confound the results). For our event window, we use a

3-day window, which includes the day before, the event day, and the day after, but also consider

the sensitivity of the results by examining 1-day, 5-day, 7-day and 9-day windows.

       In order to draw inferences for the focus events, the abnormal return observations must

be aggregated. Using the estimated abnormal return for each day of the event window, we

generate a cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for each firm i and event j:

                                                  L
                                       CARij = ∑ ARijτ                                            (3)
                                                 τ =l


where l is the first day in the event window and L is the last day in the event window. Hartigan

et al. (1986) notes that testing for statistical significance of CARs is potentially problematic due

to the possibility of autocorrelation in the series of abnormal returns. Given that all the abnormal

returns use the same intercept (") and slope ($) parameters, serial correlation may occur.

                                                        8
Following Hartigan et al. (1986) and Ruback (1982), our variance estimate includes an

adjustment for this first-order autocorrelation.5

         We run this first-stage estimation procedure for two types of events. The first type is the

AD investigation events which are comprised of five events (in the chronological order they

follow in U.S. AD cases): 1) the initial petition by the domestic firms, 2) the preliminary decision

by the USITC, 3) the preliminary decision by the USDOC, 4) the final decision by the USDOC,

and 5) the final decision by the USITC. Figure 1 presents the timeline of AD case events for a

standard case.

         It is important to note that for our sample we expect that the five AD events should

primarily yield positive (or, at least, non-negative) abnormal returns for petitioning firms. Firms

would not petition without expectations of positive gains. In addition, all cases in our sample are

cases in which the preliminary AD decisions are ruled affirmative, and many are cases for which

the final AD decisions are also ruled affirmative. As described below, we include some cases

where the final USITC was negative or the case was terminated/suspended when there was tariff-

jumping announcements connected with these non-affirmative cases. We control for these non-

affirmative decisions in our regressions.

         The magnitude of the effect of these AD announcements on the market depends on how

much additional information they reveal. The petition is the first event that begins the

investigation and likely has a surprise element for the market. However, the gains are realized by

the domestic firms only if the petition will be successful. Thus, uncertainty of the final outcome

may mitigate the size of gains from a petition. The USITC preliminary injury decision is almost


5
 Typically, it is assumed that there is no overlap in the event window of the included securities, hence ARiJ and
CARij will be independent across securities. This assumption will cause the covariance terms in the variance to go to
zero. Therefore, the standard error for the CAR is obtained by summing the standard errors over the event window
and dividing by the square root of the number of days in the event window (MacKinlay, 1997).5 By allowing for
serial correlation, the covariance terms will be greater than zero.

                                                          9
always affirmative, as it must occur within 45 days of the petition and only has time to

incorporate information presented by the domestic industry in their petition. Thus, this event may

not convey much new information to the market. The preliminary USDOC decision is almost

always affirmative as well. However, this USDOC decision includes preliminary dumping

margins which provides information to the market of the eventual size of AD duties should the

final case decision be ruled affirmative. The USDOC final dumping margin determination comes

out 75 days later in a standard case. While significant changes can occur in the dumping margin

from preliminary to final stages, they tend to be highly correlated.6 Thus, for many cases, the

final USDOC may not convey very much new information. The final AD case event is the

USITC final decision which, if affirmative, leads to imposition of AD duties. One would expect

this event to have quite a bit of potential to elicit market reactions because it resolves any

uncertainty about the final outcome of the case. On the other hand, as the last event of the case,

many months after the petition in the case, the market may have reasonably certain information

about how the case will be determined. In our results below, we report CARs for all of the five

separate investigation events, as well as a CAR for the combination of the five events. The

second type of events for which we estimate CARs, which is novel in the literature, is tariff-

jumping FDI announcements.

           Our sample data consists of all publicly traded U.S. firms that were petitioners in U.S.

affirmative AD cases between 1980 and 1995. Of these 138 firm-case observations, 44 (32

percent) saw one or more foreign firms locate production in the United States in the product

subject to the AD investigation. There were also a handful of U.S. AD cases that were not ruled

affirmative, but nevertheless saw tariff-jumping FDI. We include these additional firm-case

observations in our sample.

6
    In our sample, the correlation between preliminary and final USDOC margins was 0.64 and significant at the 1%

        Blonigen (2002) identifies all instances of FDI connected with U.S. AD investigations

from 1980 through 1995 and these data also indicate the type of FDI that occurred (i.e.,

acquisition, new plant, joint venture, etc.).7 Using this list, we compiled a database of public

media announcements of these FDI incidents using Lexis-Nexis search engines. We also relied

on Lexis-Nexis for public media announcements of the AD investigation events.8 We next used

Federal Register notices to identify the U.S. domestic firms that were petitioners in the relevant

AD cases with FDI, as well as petitioners in all other affirmative AD cases, and then used

standard search engines to identify if these petitioning firms were publicly traded on U.S. stock

markets. Data on firms’ stock returns, as well as the market return, come from the Center for

Research on Stock Prices (CRSP). Table 1 lists the AD cases that involved tariff-jumping FDI

and the associated publicly-traded petitioning firms. Table 1 also shows the variety of final

outcomes in these cases, with 16 of the 30 affirmative, 5 terminated or suspended, 5 negative, and

4 mixed outcomes, where some of the investigated products received AD duties and others did

not. Again, in addition to the observations listed in Table 1, our sample includes all publicly-

traded firms involved in U.S. AD cases that went affirmative from 1980-1995, but saw no tariff-

jumping activity. This leads to an additional 76 observations to the 62 listed in Table 1 and the

list of such firms and associated cases is available from the authors upon request.



3.2. Empirical Results.

        In stage-one regressions, we estimate 3-day CARs for all five types of AD investigation

event decision dates: 1) petition, 2) preliminary USITC, 3) preliminary USDOC, 4) final USDOC,

  While Federal Register notices report AD investigation events, they do so with a lag. The public announcements
we found with Lexis-Nexis often predated the Federal Register notice dates by about 5-7 days.

and 5) final USITC decision.9 The top half of Table 2, column 1 gives the average CARs of

these five events and a cumulated total CAR for all five events. Following Borenstein and

Zimmerman (1988), we construct a Z-statistic to analyze the statistical significance of these

average CARs. Assuming independent events, a Z-statistic can be constructed that is the sum of

the t-statistics connected with each event divided by the square of the number of events. This Z-

statistic is distributed as a normal variable with a variance equal to the number of observations

and has the following formula:

                                            N

                                           ∑ (CAR     n   / VAR(CAR n ))
                                     Z=    n =1
                                                                                                                 (4)
                                                            N

where CARn is the cumulative abnormal return for event (n), VAR indicates “variance” and N is

the number of events. This method of determining statistical significance has the advantage of

controlling for observations with high standard errors, which get less weight in the Z-statistic.

We report this Z-statistic in the second column of Table 2.10

         The results in the top half of Table 2 show that the AD petition announcement is the one

individual AD event that clearly leads to positive gains for firms, averaging about 1% of firm

equity value. The average CAR cumulated over all five AD events is also positive and

statistically significant, with an average gain of 1.66%. Thus, the AD events besides the petition

also add to the gain to some extent, despite the fact that the average CARs for the preliminary and

final decisions by the USDOC and USITC are close to zero in magnitude individually and not

statistically significant. There is substantial heterogeneity in these AD events. For example,

some cases end in negative AD decisions in our sample and, additionally, some affirmative

  The number of firm-case observations varies by AD investigation events because of varying instances of non-
existent media announcements. Below, we briefly describe results from using alternative event window lengths.
10
   In our case of cumulated totals of CARs from the five AD events, we first construct z-statistics over the five AD
events for each firm-case observation and then construct a z-statistic over all case observations.

                                                           12
decisions yield much smaller dumping margins than others. Our second stage regression analysis

below will be able to examine this heterogeneity further.

        Clearly, there is some support that domestic petitioning firms are receiving positive CARs

from these AD investigations, with the mean CAR for all four of the five events positive and the

cumulated total indicating around a 1.66% gain for these petitioning firms. While this 1.66%

average cumulated abnormal return is statistically significant, it is not very large in magnitude.

One reason for this may be that there are some cases in our sample that were not ruled

affirmative. Another reason may be the mitigating effects of tariff-jumping FDI.

        To control for both of these concerns, the next three rows of Table 2 report the average

cumulated CARs for petitioning firms involved in only affirmative AD cases, and then the

breakdown of this sample into observations where no tariff-jumping FDI occurred and where

tariff-jumping FDI did occur. The average CAR goes up by limiting the sample to only

affirmative AD cases (from 1.66% to 1.98%). However, we also find a substantial difference in

average CARs between the set of firm-case observations where there was tariff-jumping versus

where there was not. Those petitioning firms experiencing affirmative AD decisions and no

tariff-jumping FDI by their foreign rivals average about a 3% gain, while those for which tariff-

jumping FDI occurs experience essentially no gains. The Z-statistics for each of these groups

indicates a statistically significant difference as well, with a Z-statistic of 12.14 for the group not

experiencing tariff-jumping FDI and a Z-statistic of –0.19 for the group that does experience

tariff-jumping FDI. These results confirm our hypothesis that tariff-jumping FDI can mitigate the

positive abnormal gains that U.S. domestic firms experience from AD trade protection. In fact, it

suggests that tariff-jumping FDI by foreign rivals completely eliminates such gains on average.

        The above comparison of means does not control for other relevant factors that may

systematically affect CARs across our focus groups. Thus, section 4 below employs second-stage

                                                  13
regression analysis of our estimated CARs to examine the effect of tariff-jumping FDI on firms’

gains from AD investigations, controlling for other factors.

        The last rows of Table 2 show the summary statistics for the CARs from all tariff-jumping

FDI announcements, as well as a breakdown by the type of FDI indicated in the announcement

(i.e., new plant, plant expansion, acquisition, or joint venture). Our hypothesis is that tariff-

jumping FDI announcements should lead to losses for the domestic petitioning firms. However,

Table 3 shows that the mean CARs for all tariff-jumping announcements is 0.55%, though not

statistically significant.

        The breakdown of mean CARs by FDI type provides some additional information. The

average CAR for plant expansion of existing foreign-owned plants is –1.20%, the average CAR

for joint ventures is 1.78%, while average CARs for new plants and acquisitions is well below

1%. As mentioned earlier, tariff-jumping FDI may not be considered damaging to domestic firms

if the foreign firm is unlikely to be as successful with domestic production as they were exporting

to the U.S. This may be why plant expansion announcements may be the only form to show

correct sign: These firms are already established in the U.S. The positive joint venture sign may

be due to the possibility of knowledge spillovers to the industry from joint ventures with foreign

firms. These average tariff-jumping CARs are generally not statistically significant (except for

joint venture FDI at the 10% significance level), but also do not control for other factors, which

we address in the next section with our second-stage estimation.



4. Second Stage: Explaining the CARs.

        The above analysis provided simple comparisons of means. To more formally examine

our hypotheses, this section presents a regression analysis of the various factors that may

determine the CARs for these events. Thus, we run second-stage OLS regressions of the form:

                                                  14
                               CARij = φ + λ’Xij + µij,                                  (5)

where φ is an intercept, Xij is a matrix of explanatory variables, λ is a vector of estimated

parameters, and µij is an assumed normally-distributed error term. Because our dependent

variable is generated from our first-stage event study regressions, we use a White correction to

adjust our standard errors for heteroskedasticity.11



4.1. Explaining CARs from AD Announcements.

       With respect to the second-stage regressions for the AD investigation announcements, our

focus is the hypothesis that tariff-jumping FDI mitigates the gains domestic petitioners may

experience from the AD case. Thus, we first include a dummy variable that takes the value of “1”

when an investigated foreign firm announces its intention to FDI in the investigated product prior

to an AD event and expect a negative coefficient. This captures known tariff-jumping FDI

effects. However, there may also be a higher expectation in some AD cases that tariff-jumping

FDI may be announced subsequent to an AD event. If the market can anticipate subsequent tariff-

jumping FDI to some extent, then such FDI observed ex post may also mitigate positive abnormal

gains from affirmative AD decisions. Thus, we include a dummy variable that takes the value of

“1” for cases where tariff-jumping FDI is announced after the AD event and expect a negative

coefficient as well.

       We include other explanatory variables as controls. First, positive abnormal gains are

expected to be higher for AD investigation events the greater the amount of trade volume

involved in the cases, particularly relative to the size of the petitioning firm(s). Thus, we include

the log of the dollar value of the subject import volume, expecting a positive coefficient, and the

log of the dollar value of the petitioning firm’s sales in the relevant year, expecting a negative



                                                 15
sign.12 Additionally, a couple AD events yield unique quantifiable information that should affect

the magnitude of the CARs for a firm. For the second-stage regression explaining CARS at the

preliminary USDOC decision, we include the preliminary AD duty (in decimal) form, expecting a

larger duty to be associated with higher CARs. At the final USDOC decision, an increase in the

final dumping margin from the preliminary margin should also increase the CAR for this AD

event, so we include the difference between the final and preliminary dumping margin (in decimal

form) as an explanatory variable for second-stage regression of the CARs for the final USDOC

decision. Finally, provided the AD case has made it to the final USITC decision, this decision is

definitive for the case and becomes the AD case’s final outcome. Therefore, we include a dummy

variable for whether the decision is affirmative or not in the second-stage regression for the final

USITC decision CARs and expect a positive coefficient.13

         In any event study, there is always the possibility of other “confounding” announcements

in the event window, which may bias the estimated CARs. With so many different events in this

study it is difficult to systematically control for these possibilities. However, we hypothesize that

the high profile 1985-86 semiconductor and 1992-93 steel cases are more likely to have such

confounding events, as there were many media announcements connected with these cases

throughout the time period of these AD cases. Thus, we include separate dummy variables for

these two types of cases in our second-stage AD event regressions. Finally, we include year

dummies and dummies for SIC industries 28, 33, 34, and 35, as unobserved macroeconomic

conditions or industry characteristics may affect market investor’s reactions in a systematic way.

Compustat database.

These particular industry dummies are included since they encompass the bulk of U.S. AD

cases.14 The top half of Table 3 reports descriptive statistics for our explanatory variables in the

second stage regressions for the sample of CARs cumulated over all five AD events.

           Table 4 presents our results from running separate regressions to explain CARs for the

five AD events, as well as regression results for the cumulated total CAR. The F-test for the final

three AD events, as well as for the cumulated total CAR is statistically significant with R2s

ranging from 0.16 to 0.32 for these cross-sectional regressions.

           There are a number of results in Table 4 to highlight. First, consistent with comparison of

means in Table 3, tariff-jumping FDI announcements are estimated to have a negative effect on a

domestic firm’s gains from AD events. FDI announcements that occur before the AD event (and

thus represent almost certain tariff-jumping) are large and statistically significant, while the effect

of tariff-jumping FDI that occurs after the event (a proxy for higher likelihood of tariff-jumping

FDI at the time of the event) is smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant. Second,

explanatory power of this second-stage regression analysis is perhaps highest for the preliminary

USDOC decision, where the magnitude of the duty is first revealed, with the size of the duty

leading to larger CARs for petitioning firms and FDI before the event mitigating these gains by

3.9%. The cumulated total regression analysis likewise has decent explanatory power and is

largely consistent with the separate regressions. In particular, FDI before the event continues to be

strongly negative, while log of the petitioning firm’s sales is a statistically important control. The

high R2 in the final USITC regression seems to come primarily from the negative market reaction

to the 1992-93 steel case, confirming press reports at the time that the ruling of negative on many

of the products in that case was a blow to the U.S. steel industry and market expectations.




14
     F-tests of the joint significance of the industry and year dummies were often, but not always statistically

                                                             17
4.2. Explaining CARs from Tariff-jumping FDI Announcements.

         We next turn to second-stage regressions connected with the CARs from tariff-jumping

FDI announcements. In particular, such a regression can indicate whether certain forms of FDI

are more damaging to the domestic petitioning firms than others, controlling for other factors. To

examine this issue, we include dummy variables indicating whether the announced FDI will be a

new plant, joint venture or plant expansion, excluding a dummy variable for acquisition FDI to

avoid perfect multicollinearity.

         We also include dummy variables for whether the associated AD case was ruled

affirmative or terminated/suspended, excluding a dummy variable for a negative decision.

Consistent with our earlier hypotheses tested above, we expect that tariff-jumping FDI

announcements lead to greater losses (negative coefficient) for the domestic firms that were

successful in getting AD protection versus ones that did not receive such protection. Terminated

and suspended cases often lead to public or private settlements by the domestic and foreign firms,

such as voluntary export agreements (see, for example, Prusa, 1992, and Anderson, 1993). These

outcomes may lead to positive CARs for domestic firms that may rival that of the proposed AD

duties or, as shown by Rosendorff (1996), even higher profits for the domestic firms than with

AD duties. Given these arguments, we would also expect a negative coefficient on the

terminated/suspended dummy variable.

         Another FDI-related explanatory variable that we include is a dummy variable for FDI

before the investigation. On the one hand, such pre-investigation FDI may be expected to have

less impact on the domestic firm post-investigation FDI because the AD duties (or

termination/suspension agreement) is not in place for such FDI announcements. On the other

hand, pre-investigation FDI may be by foreign firms that are much stronger rivals in the domestic


significant for the regressions reported in Table 4.

                                                       18
market, since they choose to FDI before any threat from an AD investigation and/or AD duties.

This would suggest a negative coefficient on our pre-investigation FDI dummy variable.

       Finally, as with our second-stage regression analysis of the AD announcements, we

include the log of the dollar value of the subject import volume, the log of the dollar value of the

petitioning firm’s sales in the relevant year, and dummy variables for the 1985-86 semiconductor

cases and 1992-93 steel cases as controls. We do not include year and industry dummies in these

regressions as F-tests reject their inclusion though we get qualitatively identical results to those

reported here when they are included. The bottom half of Table 3 reports descriptive statistics for

our explanatory variables in the second-stage regressions of the tariff-jumping FDI sample.

       Table 5 presents our results for the tariff-jumping FDI announcements. The first column

of results gives estimates when using the entire sample of observations. Many of the regressors

have the correct sign, and the F-test rejects the null of jointly zero slopes at the 1% significance

level. As hypothesized, tariff-jumping events lead to more negative CARs when the final

outcome of the associated AD case was affirmative, though this effect is not statistically

significant at standard significance levels. Terminated/suspended cases do not appear to have any

statistically significant impact on the CARs from tariff-jumping.

       Turning to our FDI variables, there is evidence that plant expansion FDI lead to more

negative CARs than other types of FDI, with a 4.3% lower CAR, everything else equal. This

makes sense because plant expansions add domestic capacity in the industry, unlike acquisitions,

and are by foreign firms that have already established themselves in the domestic market, unlike

new plants or joint ventures.

       The last column of Table 5 displays results when we run our second-stage regressions for

only our affirmative outcome observations. Since this sample is only affirmative cases, we must

necessarily drop the first two regressors for identification. In general, this regression does not

                                                  19
have as good of a fit. However, the results are largely consistent with the full sample results in

column 1. One difference is that plant expansion and new plant FDI are now both estimated to

negatively impact domestic petitioners. Another notable difference is that FDI before the

investigation is now found to significantly lead to lower returns for domestic petitioners, which is

consistent with the hypothesis that it is generally foreign firms that can compete stronger

domestically that announce before AD investigations.

       On a final note, when we examine event windows of 1, 5, 7 and 9 days (rather than 3 days

reported here), we get qualitatively identical results, though less precisely estimated. This is true

for both our second-stage regressions for AD and for tariff-jumping announcements and is

consistent with the notion that a larger window allows the possibility of greater noise from

confounding events.



5. Conclusion

       This paper began with the idea of examining changes in domestic firms profits from AD

investigations and from the subsequent tariff-jumping FDI that may result from such actions. The

initial hypotheses were that AD investigations, particularly those that are ruled affirmative and

lead to AD duties, result in positive abnormal returns to domestic firms, while tariff-jumping FDI

may partially or completely mitigate these effects. The sample we gathered showed substantial

heterogeneity in the circumstances surrounding AD cases with associated FDI, including a variety

of case outcomes, timing of FDI and type of FDI. This led to a variety of hypotheses tested

concerning the variation in abnormal returns we observe from the AD investigation and tariff-

jumping events.

       We find evidence that FDI has a significant negative impact on abnormal gains from AD

investigation events for U.S. domestic petitioning firms. On average, affirmative U.S. AD

                                                 20
decisions are associated with 3% abnormal gains to a petitioning firm when there is no tariff-

jumping FDI, but no abnormal gains if there is tariff-jumping FDI. The evidence for this effect is

strong when announcements of the intended tariff-jumping FDI have already occurred before the

AD event takes place, which happened in a fair number of cases, while there is weaker evidence

for this effect with anticipated subsequent FDI announcements.

        In a related vein, we find evidence that the announcements of plant expansions (and, to

some extent, new plants) have significantly larger negative effects on domestic firms’ profits than

other types of FDI, including acquisitions and joint ventures. This makes sense because plant

expansions add domestic capacity in the industry, unlike acquisitions, and are by foreign firms

that have already established themselves in the domestic market, unlike joint ventures.

        Our analysis also highlights that market reactions are significantly more marked for some

AD events than others. Our ability to explain market reactions (in terms of R2) is highest for the

preliminary USDOC decision where the proposed AD duty is first announced, and the final

USITC decision where the final case outcome is resolved.15 Finally, the negative decision on

some of the products involved in the 1992-93 steel cases, one of the largest set of AD cases ever

investigated in the U.S. led to significantly negative abnormal returns to the U.S. steel petitioners.




15
  The preliminary USDOC decision is often not the focus of event studies of AD decisions, though Hughes et al.
(1997) also find that the preliminary USDOC announcement for the U.S. AD case against Japan in 64k drams had
very large effects on the market.
