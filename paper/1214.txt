                Average Marginal Tax Rates from Social Security
                         and the Individual Income Tax

                                   ABSTRACT


        We extend previous estimates of the average marginal tax rate from
the federal individual income tax to include social security "contributions."
The social security tax is a flat—rate levy on labor earnings (and income
from self—employment) up to a ceiling value of earnings. Our computations
consider first, the tax rates on employers, employees and the self
employed; second the amounts of income that accrue to persons with earnings
below the ceiling; and third, the effective deductibility of employer's
social security contributions from workers' taxable income. We find that
the net impact of social security on the average marginal tax rate is below
.02 until 1966, but than rises to .03 in 1968, .04 in 1973, .05 in 1974,
and .06 in 1979. Thus, since 1965, the overall average marginal tax rate
rises more rapidly than that from the income tax alone. In 1980 this
overall rate is 36%. We note that, in comparison with the income tax, the
social security levy generates 3—4 times as much revenue per unit of con-
tribution to the average marginal tax rate. The social security tax is
relatively ttefficientlt because first, it is a flat—rate tax (rather than a
graduated one) for earnings below the ceiling, and second, there is a zero
marginal tax rate at the top. However, the last feature has become less
important in recent years. The rapid increase in the ceiling on earnings
raised the fraction of total salaries and wages accruing to persons with
earnings below the ceiling from 29% in 1965 to 68% in 1982.

        In our previous paper (Barro & Sahasakul, 1983) we provided estimates

of average marginal tax rates from the federal individual income tax for 1916—80.

Now we supplement these figures to include the social security tax on labor

earnings. With this addition, the included taxes comprise in 1980 72% of federal

and 47% of total government receipts. If some non—tax items are excluded, the

values are 75% and 52%, respectively.1

        In the main the social security levy is a flat—rate tax, paid partly

by workers, partly by employers, and partly by self—employed persons. The

computation of average marginal tax rates is simpler than in the case of the

federal income tax, which has a graduated—rate structure and allows for

numerous deductions from taxable income. The main complications that arise

for the social—security tax are the following:
        •
            For workers and self—employed persons with earnings above a ceiling

value, the marginal tax rate is nil.

       • The tax applies only to labor earnings (and to earnings from self—

employment), rather than to total income.

       •
            The employer and employee parts of the tax differ, because the

employer's payments are not counted as part of the employee's taxable income.

            An individual's future social security benefits depend positively on

that person's history of contributions. This element reduces the effective tax rate

that an individual faces. In fact, Gordon (1982) argues that this consideration

                                                                       If payments
for unemployment insurance and workers' compensation are also treated as non—taxes,
then the percentages become 78% and 54%.

is important for people who are close to retirement age. Generally, the

inclusion of this effect would require forecasts of benefit schedules, as

well as survival        probabilities. It would also be necessary to include

various complexities of the social—security law, such as the declining

marginal effect of past covered earnings on benefits, the exclusion of

some years of earnings from the formula, and the treatment of spouses and

dependents. In any event, our subsequent calculations do not take account

of the effects of social—security contributions on future benefits. Thus,

by including only the tax aspects of these "contributions," we somewhat

overstate the effective marginal tax rates from the social security program.



Theoretical Considerations

       Let s be the tax rate (marginal and average) paid by a firm on

workers' earnings. If profits are taxed at the rate r      ,   then the firm's
after—tax profits are



       (1)         It    = (1—r)[F(L)      —
                                               wL(l+sf)]

where L is the quantity of labor input, w is the real wage rate, and F(L)

is the production function. Maximization of profit implies



       (2)                    F' =   w(l   + Sf)



where F' is labor's marginal product.

      The representative worker's total real income, Y     ,   equals wL + I
where I is non—labor income. As in our previous paper, this income is spent
                                        —3—



 on consumption, C ,   or   income taxes, T •2 In addition, there is now the

 social security tax, Se•WL , where             S        is the employee's (marginal and

 average) contribution rate. Thus, we have




      (3)               YwL+I=C+T+S.wL

As before, income taxes T depend on taxable income, Y —                    D   ,   where   D

is a broad concept of deductions. If utility depends positively on con-

sumption and negatively on work, then the first—ordei- condition for maxi-

mizing utility can be written as



                        -au/aL
                            au/ac
                                    = w(l   —   T        —
                                                             s)

where T' is the marginal income—tax rate.

     Substituting for w from equation (2) into equation ('4) implies



     (5)
                                F'(l —
                       —au/aL = —                   T'   — Se)
                        au/ac          (1   + Sf)




Thus, equation (5) shows how the tax system creates a positive wedge

between labor's marginal product, F'                ,   and the utility rate of substitu-

tion between consumption and leisure, —(atJ/3L)/(aU/3c)

     Let    r be the overall effective marginal tax rate on labor's marginal

product, F' .     Then we have from equation (5)


     2For   present purposes it is unnecessary for us to consider two categories
of consumption——depending on the treatment by the tax law——as we did in the
earlier   paper. We also do not allow here for efforts aimed at avoiding income
taxes.
                                              —4—



                            (1 — T) = (1 —       T'   —   s)/(l + Sf)

which implies



      (6)                                 .(s + 5e + T')
                                  (l+s)


Thus, the tax system effectively               deflates labor's marginal product F' by

the factor, 1 + s (see equation 2), and then applies the marginal tax

rate, Sf + S + T' .          If   the social—security tax is not purely a flat—rate

levy (because of the ceiling on taxable earnings in the U.S. system), then

we can interpret Sf and S             in equation (6) as the marginal social—security

tax rates.

      For self—employed           persons the formula is simpler. Namely, if s      is

the marginal contribution rate to social security, then the effective marginal
                      4
tax rate T       is
             S




      (7)                          r =    s    + V


      Previously, we calculated weighted averages T' of the marginal income—

tax rates T' .    We      weighted either by adjusted gross income (AGI) or by


      3Note that T does not depend solely on the sum,       + s . That's because,
unlike the worker's payments, the employer's payments are not part of the worker's
tax base.

       4If the marginal tax rates I' are equal, then the equation of      from
equation(7) to T in equation(6) requires s     to be less than sç + Se , as was
true in the US. until 1984. For example, i T' = .3 and Sf =        = .0665 (the
1981 value) , then the equalizing value for s   is .106. The actual value of s
for 1981 was .093. The social—security law passed in 1983 and effective in 1984
sets the self—employed rate equal to the sum, s + 5e' but provides for some off-
setting income—tax credits.

numbers of returns, and we computed arithmetic and geometric averages.

Here, we consider only the series that we focused on earlier, which is the

arithmetic average weighted by AGI.

        Equations (6) and (7) tell us the necessary extensions to go from our

previous measures T' to weighted averages, r                         ,   that   include the social—

security tax. Namely,5

                   is the corresponding ratio for self—employed persons, and

     • T" is the (weighted) average marginal tax rate for workers with

     Note that the measure r depends on                         ,   which is the ratio of appli-
cable salaries and wages to aggregate AGI rather than aggregate labor incomes.

Thus, the index r tends to pick up effects of the social—security tax, which

impinges on salaries and wages, on the generation of aggregate real income



     5To get the last te, we approximate T'/(l+Sf)
                                                                                T'(l_sf) in equation(6
This approximation is satisfactory for our data sample.

    6Note that the social—security levy is a flat—rate tax in this range.

(as proxied by AGI).7 In order to study, for example, the choice of work

effort, a different weighting pattern would likely be appropriate. Then

the constructed T' , which was weighted by shares of Ad, would also have

to be modified. Analogous remarks apply to the self—employment part of

equation (8).




Computations of Tax Rates

      Table 1 shows the salaries and wages (column 1) and self—employment

income (column 3) that accrue in each year to persons with earnings below

the ceiling. (In column 4 the table shows the dollar value of the ceiling

for each year.) These data, combined with values of aggregate Ad, which

we used in our previous paper, allow us to calculate the weights           and

      which appear in equation (8). These weights are in columns 5 and 6 of

Table 1.

      For subsequent purposes the important variable is       ,   the ratio to

aggregate AGI of salaries and wages of persons below the ceiling. This ratio

can be divided into two parts——first, the ratio of salaries and wages of

persons below the ceiling to the aggregate of salaries and wages (column 2

of Table 1) and second, the ratio of aggregate salaries and wages to aggre-

gate AGI. The latter ratio is highly stable about its mean value of .84.

Hence,          fluctuates mainly because of changes in the fraction of overall




     7Conceptually, for a family, we would count either one earner's salary and
wages or two earners' salaries and wages, depending on whether one or both had
earnings that were individually below the ceiling. But, for joint tax returns
where total salaries and wages exceed the ceiling, the data do not allow us to
tell whether there were multiple earners, one or both of which were separately
above or below the ceiling. However, we do know the aggregate of salaries and
wages and self—employment income that accrue to persons whose earnings are below
the ceiling. These data are sufficient for most of our purposes.
                                       —7—




 salaries and wages that accrue to persons below the ceiling. This fraction

 depends in turn on the ceiling on earnings for social security in relation

 to the distribution of nominal earnings in the economy. For example, the

 decrease in      from .46 in 1937 to .24 in 1965 corresponds to a decline in

 the ratio of salaries and wages for persons below the ceiling to total salaries

 and wages from .57 to .29. This behavior reflects the relatively slow increase

 in the dollar ceiling on earnings, which increases from $3,000 in 1937 to only

 $4,800 in 1965. However, the ceiling has risen more rapidly since 1965,

 reaching $25,900 in 1980 (and $32,400 in 1982). Hence, the ratio of salaries

 and wages for persons below the ceiling to total salaries and wages goes from

 .29 in 1965 to .65 in 1980 (and .68 in 1982).
                                                       Correspondingly, 21 increases
 from .24 in 1965 to .54 in 1980.

      The values for    s =   s    and s       for each year are also shown in Table 1.
                         f     e           s

 (These are nonzero    only since the start of the social security program in

1937.) Thereby, we can calculate the second term,
                                                           c1(Sf+S)/(l+Sf) , and the
third term,            on the right side of equation (8). The results appear in
               2 s
columns 2 and 3 of Table 2.

     It is more complicated to calculate the final term of equation (8), which

depends on the average marginal tax rate T" for workers with earnings below

the ceiling. From the I.R.S.'s Statistics of Income, Individual Tax Returns

for each year, we approximate the calculation of T"
                                                             by using the marginal
tax rates and associated values of AGI for the following filing units:

and wages per return is below the ceiling value. (For example, for 1980

when the ceiling on earnings is $25,900, we go up to an AGI per return of

$30,000.) Then we include enough additional joint returns from AGI classes

where the average of salaries and wages per return is above the ceiling, so

as to exhaust the known total of salaries and wages that accrues to persons

with earnings below the ceiling. However, we carry out this calculation by

using the lowest possible AGI classes——that is, we assume that low numbers

for individuals? salaries and wages correspond to low numbers for AGI per

return. There is some approximation here, since some of the low values for

salaries and wages may come from either multi—earner families or families

with high non—labor income, which would have high marginal tax rates. But

some experimentation indicates that the potential error is quantitatively

unimportant. Column 4 of Table 2 shows the resulting calculation for the

final term, 1SfT",   in   equation (8) .   Note that this term——which reflects

the exclusion of firms' social security payments from workers' taxable income——

is always below .01 in magnitude.

     Our previous estimates of the average marginal tax rate when weightedby

AGI, T' , appear in column 1 of Table 2. We consider only the values since
1937, because the social security tax is nil for earlier years. The overall

modification to incorporate the social—security tax——the sum of columns 2, 3

and 4 in Table 2——appears in column 5 of the table (labeled SS). Then the

sum of columns 1 and 5 gives us the average marginal tax rate       from the

federal individual income tax and the social security tax. These values are

in column 6 of the table. Figure 1 shows the average marginal tax rate from

the individual income tax T' (column 1 of Table 2), the overall effect from

social security SS (column 5), and the combined average marginal tax rate T

(column 6).

     Consider the overall effects from the inclusion of social security,

as shown in column 5 of Table 2 and in Figure 1. The social security

term SS is in the neighborhood of 1% from 1937 until 1958, reaches 2% in

1960, 3% in 1966, 4% in 1973, 5% in 1974, and 6% in 1979. Thus, the inclu-

sion of this term produces a combined average marginal tax rate       r that
rises more steeply than the income—tax rate T'   ,   especially   since 1965.

Instead of rising from 21% in 1965 to 30% in 1980, we find that the average

marginal tax rate T   goes from 23% to 36%.

      The overail effect from social security on the average marginal tax

 rate, SS, is always much less than the rate on employees below the ceiling,

 (Sf+Se)/(l+Sf) .   Primarily    this difference arises because      ——   the ratio
 of salaries and wages below the ceiling to aggregate AGI— is much less than

 unity. As mentioned before, the variations in        Q1 derive mainly from

 changes in the ratio of salaries and wages below the ceiling to total salaries

 and wages, which appears in column 2 of Table 1. (The ratio of total salaries

and wages to total AGI is relatively stable with a mean value of .84.) In

other words, the key factor is the variations in salaries and wages that accrue

to persons above the ceiling, who face a zero marginal tax rate from social

security.

     For example, in 1965 only 29% of total salaries and wages accrued to

persons below the ceiling. If there had been no ceiling (and unrealistically,

if the rate of tax,   Sf =   S   ,   were unchanged), then the overall effect of

social security, SS, would have increased by a factor of 3.5 from .016 to. .056.

     On the other hand, the rapid increase of the ceiling in recent years has

made this effect less important. In 1980, where the ratio of salaries and

wages to the total is .65, a removal of the ceiling (with contribution rates

held fixed) would have raised the effect from social security, SS, by a factor

of 1.5 from .057 to .086..

     Table 4 compares the social security tax with the federal individual income

tax for selected years. Notice that the ratio of revenues raised by social

security to that from the income tax (shown in column 5) rises from .07       in   1945
to .63 in 1975, but falls somewhat since then.

     Column 6 of the table shows a crude measure of the relative "efficiencies"

of the two types of taxes. This measure is the revenue raised from social

security divided by the contributions of this levy to the overall average

marginal tax rate,8 expressed as a ratio to the corresponding figure for

the income tax. On this basis the social security tax looks strikingly

more efficient——specifically, in 1980 it generates almost 3 times as much

revenue per unit of average marginal tax rate as that for the income tax.

In 1965 the corresponding number was 4.3. The main reason for the decline

in thi number since 1965 is the sharp rise in the ceiling on earnings,

which has a positive effect on the average marginal tax rate from social

security, relative to the re1.enue generated.

     The social security levy turns out to be relatively "efficient" because

it combines two features of a tax—rate schedule that have been stressed in

the literature on optimal taxation. First, it is flat—rate levy (on labor

earnings and income from self—employment) in the range where the tax rate is

positive. The shift to a flat—rate income tax has been proposed by, among

others, Friedman (1962, Chapter X) and Hall and Rabushka (1983). (Surprisingly,

these authors do not seem to mention that, in the social—security tax, we

already have a close approximation to the flat—rate income tax.) In compari-

son with a graduated—rate system, the flat—rate levy generates the same amount

of revenues at a lower average marginal tax rate.9 Second, as advocated on

theoretical grounds by Mirrlees (1971), the social—security tax has a zero

marginal rate at the top. However, as noted before, the rapid increase of the

ceiling in recent years has made this feature less important than it used to be.


         is unclear how to allocate the cross—term, P1Sf•T" (column 4 of Table
2), between the two levies, although this term is quantitatively unimportant.
The figures shown in Table 4 allocate half of this term to each type of tax.

     9A "simple" way to shift to a flat—rate tax on labor income would be the
following: (1) abolish all social security benefits, (2) abolish the federal
individual income tax, and (3) retain the social security tax but at a higher
rate (in the neighborhood of 10% for firms and employees, rather than the
present 7%).
