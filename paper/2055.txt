                Management Ownership and Corporate Performance:

                             An Empirical Analysis




                                    ABSTRACT




         We investigate the relation between management ownership and corporate per-
    formance, as measured by Tobin's Q. In a cross-section of Fortune 500 firms,
    Tobin's Q first increases and then declines as board of directors holdings rise.
    For older firms there is weak evidence that Q is lower when a firm is run by a
    member of the founding family than when it is run by an officer unrelated to the
    founder.

 1.   Introduction

      Many large American corporations are not run by the people who own them.

As stressed by Berle and Means (1932), when managers hold little equity in the

firm and shareholders are too dispersed to enforce value-maximization, corporate

assets may be deployed to benefit managers rather than shareholders. According

to Jensen and Meckling (1976), these costs of deviation from value-maximization

decline as management ownership rises. As their stakes rise, managers pay for a

greater share of the costs of their on-the-job consumption1 and are less likely

to squander corporate wealth. According to this "convergence of interestst'

hypothesis, corporate performance improves with increases in management ownership.

      More recently, Oemsetz (1983) and Fama and Jensen (1983) have pointed out

offsetting costs of significant ownership by management. These writers

recognized that, when a manager owns only a small stake, market discipline (e.g.

the managerial labor market (Fama, 1980), the product market (Hart, 1983), and

the market for corporate control (Jensen and Ruback, 1983)) may still force him

toward value maximization. In contrast, a manager who controls a substantial

fraction of his firm's equity may have enough voting power to guarantee his

future employment with the firm at an attractive salary2. He may then indulge

his tastes for on-the-job consumption, although perhaps to a more limited extent

than if he had effective control of the firm but did not have any claim to its

cash flows3. This "entrenchment" hypothesis predicts that performance declines

as management's stake increases beyond the point where control challenges are

still effective.

      As the above discussion suggests, theoretical arguments alone cannot unam-

biguously predict the relationship between management ownership and corporate

performance. While the "convergence of interests" hypothesis predicts a uni-
                                 —2-



formly positive relation, the "entrenchment" hypothesis predicts a decline in

performance for sufficiently high management stakes. In this paper, we study

the relation between managerial ownership and performance empirically.

     In section 2, we look at the relation between two measures of the firm's

performance (Tobin's Q and profit rate) and the shareholdings of its board of

directors. A related study was conducted by Demsetz and Lehn (1985), who esti-

mated a linear relationship between profit rate and ownership by large share-

holders (as opposed to just management), and found no correlation. We estimate

a nonlinear relationship between management ownership and performance to capture

the possible presence of both the "convergence of interests" and "entrenchment"

effects. We also attempt to evaluate a number of reasons why the observed rela-

tionship might be spurious.

     Section 3 takes a more disaggregated look at the relation between manage-

ment ownership and performance. First, we segregate ownership by top corporate

officers from that of other board members and evaluate the impact of ownership

by these two distinct groups on performance. In part, this is done to address

a frequently made claim that outside board members are puppets of top offi-

cers. Second, we evaluate the impact on corporate performance of having a

founding family on the board of directors. We do this because we are

interested in the possibility that a management team can become entrenched for

reasons other than the number of voting shares it controls.

    Section 4 summarizes our findings.

 2.   The Relationship Between Board Ownership and Performance.

      In this section, we evaluate the relationship between board ownership and

performance in a sample of large industrial firms. For this purpose, we use a

December, 1980 listing of the names and stakes of large shareholders of 456 of

the Fortune 500 firms supplied by Corporate Data Exchange (CDE). The CUE

identified shareholders who were members of the board of directors, with the

exception of those whose stakes were below .2%. While this means that, in large

firms, positions worth millions of dollars are not reported, the CUE numbers are

still very useful for examining issues of corporate control, since board members

holding less than .2% are never among our firms' largest shareholders.

      To measure performance, we rely mainly on average Tobin's Q, equal to the

ratio of the firm's market value to the replacement cost of its physical

assets. Tobin's Q   is   high when the firm has valuable intangible assets in

addition to physical capital, such as monopoly power (Lindenberg and Ross,

1981), goodwill, a stock of patents, or good managers. While Q    is   undoubtedly a

very noisy signal of managerial performance, we believe that it is well-suited

to our purpose. Because we are interested in the predictable effects of a

firm's ownership structure on its value, it seems natural to look at the

cross-sectional relation between ownership and value. One alternative might be

to study events that represent large unexpected changes in ownership structure

for which there is no accompanying news to contaminate the experiment. But

large changes in ownership structure are fairly rare, except for those

accompanying control challenges, where there is clearly much more going on. For

this reason, we feel justified in concentrating on a cross-sectional analysis of

measures such as Q and the profit rate.
     The measure of Q we employ was obtained from the Griliches R & D master

file (Cummins, Kall and Laderman, 1982) for 1980. The numerator of Q is the

firm's market value, defined as the sum of the actual market value of common

stock and estimated market values of preferred stock and debt4. The denominator

of Q is the replacement cost of the firm's plant and inventories, A, also taken

from the R & D master file. Values of Q are not available for 85 firms, pri-

marily because of difficulty in obtaining values of long term debt, and, in some

cases, the replacement cost, A. While we cannot be sure that such sample selec-

tion does not bias our results, the omitted firms do not appear to be very dif-

ferent from the included ones in any observable respect5. Our final sample

consists of 371 firms.

     In this sample, the mean combined stake of all board members is 10.6%. The

median stake, however, is only 3.4%, suggesting that the distribution is skewed.

Indeed, in 103 firms (28% of the sample), total board holdings added to no more

than 1% of outstanding equity, and in 46 of our firms (12% of the sample), no

board member owned more than 0.2% of the firm. Nonetheless, in 31% of our

sample the board owned more than 10% of the firm; and in 20% of the sample the

board owned more than 20% of the firm. These numbers accord with the findings

of Lewellyn (1971) and Denisetz and Lehn (1985) who also document the prevalence

of significant managerial ownership in the United States. These results also

corroborate the hypothesis of Fama and Jensen (1983) that firms in which

management owns over 50% of the equity (and thus has complete control) should

have a hard time surviving as organizations. In fact, there are only 14 such

firms in our sample6.

    Table 1 presents means of Q for different levels of the board's percentage
                                     —5—



ownership (the mean Q in the sample is .85, with a standard deviation of .67).

It suggests that, at low levels of ownership, higher stakes are associated with

higher Q's.   It also records a decline of Q for substantial ownership positions,

although outliers strongly affect average Q in some cells. In particular, the

35%-40% ownership cell includes Hewlett-Packard with Q=3.21 and Searle with

Q=1.72, which together account for the mean Q in that cell being 1.06.

Similarly, Dow-Jones alone, with Q=2.58, accounts for the mean Q of 1.46 in the

60-65% cell. While Table 1 suggests that the relationship between ownership and

Q might be nonlinear, it also highlights the need for controlling for some sour-

ces of heterogeneity across firms, particularly industry.

     In our econometric work, it would be impractical to use as many cells of

ownership levels as appear in Table 1, primarily because of the scarcity of

observations in some cells. Instead, we consider only four categories of

ownership levels, and estimate regressions using dummies for these categories.

Specifically, we define:

     BOARDOO =   1   if holdings of no board member exceed .2%
              = 0 otherwise

     BOARDO5 =   I
                 if total reported board holdings are between 0% and 5%
             = 0 otherwise

     BOARD2O = 1 if total reported board holdings are between 5% and 20%
             = 0 otherwise

     BOARD99 = 1 if total reported board holdings exceed 20%
             = 0 otherwise


     Partitioning ownership levels at 0%, 5%, and 20% can be justified as

follows. Firms with close to no board ownership are probably a special group in

which the convergence of interests effect might be the weakest, except for

possible ownership-mimicking incentive contracts. The choice of 5% as the
                                  -6-



dividing line between low and moderate ownership is arbitrary, motivated pri-

marily by the benefits of having a large number of observations in both the

BOARDO5 and BOARD2O categories. The choice of 2O as the cutoff for high

ownership stems from our prior belief that bona fide entrenchment should become

important in the 2O-3O range (Weston, 1977), balanced against the need to have

enough observations in that cell. Later in the paper, we consider alternative

specifications.

      The first column of Table 2 presents the regression of Tobin's Q on the

board dummies (BOAR000 is omitted). This regression is essentially equivalent

to a comparison of means of Q across ownership cells; the only differences from

Table 1 are the coarser categorization and the calculation of White-consistent

standard errors for the parameter estimates. The regression confirms the

nonlinear pattern of Table 1, with Q's first rising and then declining as board

ownership rises. A simple comparison of means, however, runs into the problem

of omitting other determinants of Q that are correlated with board ownership.

To deal with this problem, we estimate a model that explicitly incorporates

variables that might be correlated with both ownership and Q.

      The first type of controls we use are observable measures of intangible

assets that affect Q7. These are (divided by A, to make them compatible with

Q):

• RD/A — 1980     R & 0 expenditures (COMPUSTAT).

• ADV/A —    1980 advertising expenditures (COMPUSTAT)8.

In addition to observed assets, we consider several variables that might be

correlated with unobserved intangible assets, as well as with board ownership:

• 0/A — the       ratio of the calculated market value of a firm's long-term debt
                                      —7-



               to A. This variable may in part capture the value of corporate tax

               shields. Alternatively, according to the pecking-order theory, debt

               is negatively correlated with the profitability of the firm, and

               hence with Q. Managers of the more leveraged firms might hold a

               higher fraction of equity, on average, for the same Q.
• A        —   replacement cost of assets.       'A' measures size; and unobserved

               intangible assets of a firm might be correlated with size. Also, it

               is hard to own a large part of a bigger firm, raising the possibi-

               lity that a large board stake proxies for small firm size.

• S1C31 —      three   digit SIC code dummies, used to control for possible spurious

               correlation between ownership and Q operating through industry

               effects (Demsetz and Lehn, 1985).

The final equation, hereafter equation (1), takes the form:


                        RD    ADV            0
Q = Ea •SIC3 +         . — + .—   +         •— +        •A +   y BOARDO5÷y BOARDO5i-y BOARD99
       I       I   1     A     2A           3A      4           1         2         3


The estimated coefficients and their heteroskedasticity-consistent standard

errors are shown in the second column of Table 2, while Table 3 presents

t-statistics for the pairwise null hypotheses that the coefficients on the board

ownership dummies are equal.

      Tables 2 and 3 suggest that, all other things equal, firms in which

management owns between 5 and 20% have the highest Q's, which exceed the Q's of

firms with negligible board ownership by .206 (t=3.06), the Q's of firms with

negligible to 5% ownership by .085 (t=.91), and the Q's of firms with dominant

ownership by .13 (t=1.61). The second best performing are firms with negligible
                                   -8-



to 5% ownership, whose Q's exceed those of firms with negligible ownership by

.201 (t=2.77) and those of firms with dominant ownership by .045 (t=.62). One

interpretation of these findings is that the convergence of interests hypothesis

is the key to understanding the data at lower ownership levels, while the

entrenchment hypothesis is operative for large board ownership.

     Some potential difficulties with these regressions concern 1) the arbitra-

riness of the specification, 2) the stability of results over time, 3) the

effect of wealth constraints on managerial ownership, and 4) the omission of a

measure of growth opportunities from the right hand side of equation (1). We

presently address these issues.

     To some extent, our choice of where to partition ownership cells is

arbitrary. To judge the robustness of our results, we estimated equation (1)

using different cutoff levels.    In particular, in addition to separating low

from moderate ownership at 5%, we did so at 2.5% and at 7.5%; and in addition to

separating moderate from high ownership at 20%, we did so at 15% and 25%. The

results of these regressions, with and without controlling for other variables,

support the following conclusions9. If the range of low ownership is defined as

either 0-2.5% or 0-5%, then Q's in the low ownership cell are significantly

lower than Q's in the moderate ownership cell (i.e., 2.5—20% or 5—20%).

However, there is no support for an increase in Q as ownership rises from 7.5%

to 20%. Further, there is evidence of a significant decline in Q as board

ownership increases from somewhere between 15-20% to about 25%. The decline

seems essentially complete when board ownership reaches 25%.

    Because we only have ownership data for 1980, the stability of our results

over time is in question. As a crude test of stability, we obtained 1979 and
                                  -9-



1981 Q's for the firms in our 1980 sample, and ran the regression in the second

column of Table 2 with Q for 1979 and with Q for 1981 as the dependent

variables, but with 1980 values of all the independent variables. Because

ownership is relatively stable over time, these regressions should be at least

suggestive of the stability of our results over time. The results in fact are

quite similar to the findings in Table 2.10

     The next issue is the effect of wealth constraints on managerial ownership.

If a management team is wealth constrained, it can only afford to own a large

proportion of the equity if average Q, and hence the market value of the firm,

is low. That is, the managers might only be able to afford to own a large stake

in a poorly performing firm. This argument predicts that there will be a

spurious negative correlation between the proportion of equity owned by the

board and Q.   It therefore only strengthens our finding of the positive correla-

tion of Q and ownership at lower ownership levels. On the other hand, this

spurious negative correlation might account for our finding that Q falls as

board ownership becomes very large.

     To subject this issue to some empirical scrutiny, consider the relation

between board ownership and the replacement cost of the firm, A. Holding

leverage constant, market value can be lower either because Q is low or because

the firm has fewer assets, i.e., A is low. If lower market value facilitates

larger board ownership, we should see a negative correlation between replacement

cost and the fraction of equity owned by the board. Table 4 presents the values

of A at various levels of board ownership. The relationship is not monotonic,

especially in the range of high board ownership. For firms for which the board

ownership is at least 5%, the correlation between board ownership and A is only
                                               -10-


-.02. This correlation points against the view that size is a strong deterrent

to management ownership. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that our

finding of low Q's for firms with very high board ownership is spurious,

evidence on the replacement cost of capital points against this possibility.

           Our omission of measures of firm growth rates from Q equations also raises

some important issues. A high Q may in part reflect the value of future growth

opportunities of the firm. If managers own large stakes in younger,

faster-growing firms which tend to have high Qs, then the positive association

between board ownership and Q that we observe might be spurious. On the other

hand, given that fast growth is itself an important component of performance

that depends on the actions of the management, we are probably understating the

effect of management ownership on performance if we focus only on the effect of

management ownership on Q holding growth constant. That is, much of the

variation in Q across different board ownership structures may be due to the

differing values of growth prospects that are achieved by managements with

different incentives to maximize value. With this reservation in mind, we

include the growth rate of the firm's labor force, 6L11, into the regression.

The result is as follows:

GL enters significantly into the regression and reduces somewhat the size and

statistical significance of the other estimated coefficients. The basic pattern

of increases and subsequent declines in Q's as ownership rises nonetheless
                                 —11—


remains, and the estimated coefficients on BOARDO5 and BOARD2O are still

significant at the 95 level.

     Finally, we look at the profit rate as an alternative measure of perfor—

mance. The profit rate is defined as the ratio of the firm's net cash flows

(less the inflation-adjusted value of depreciation) to the previously defined

replacement cost of its capital stock, A. The board ownership regressions which

parallel those for Tobin's Q are presented in the right panel of Table 2.

Although the qualitative pattern of the estImated coefficients on the ownership

dummies is the same as in the Q regressions, the statistical significance of the

estimates is much lower. Only the estimated coefficient on BOARD2O is signifi-

cant at the 95 level. The point estimate for BOARD2O implies that, all other

things equal, firms with 5—20 board ownership have profit rates .017 higher

than those of firms with negligible board ownership, and .012 higher than those

of firms with dominant board ownership. To gauge the magnitudes of these

effects, note that the mean profit rate of the sample is .055 with a standard

deviation of .035.

    The above results appear at odds with the finding of Demsetz and Lehn

(1985) of no association between large shareholder ownership and performance.

The important differences between our procedures seem to be twofold. First, we

focus only on the equity stakes of the board of directors, while Demsetz and

Lehn measure concentration of ownership weighting ownership by members of the

board and by other large shareholders equally. To the extent that large

shareholders without board seats represent competing managerial teams, they may

be attracted to firms with poorly performing incumbent management. This

selection effect would tend to reduce the observed correlation between ownership
                                   —12—


concentration and performance.

      Second, Demsetz and Lehn estimate a linear relationship between ownership

concentration and performance. When we estimate a linear relationship between

their measure of performance (profit rate) and our board stake variable, we get


                            11 =    .055   -   .005   •

                                   (.002) (.014)

which is consistent with their result. Even controlling for SIC codes and other

factors In this regression does not yield a significant estimated coefficient

on the board stake variable. We are led to conclude that Demsetz and Lehn's

failure to find a relationship between ownership concentration and profitability

may have been due to their use of a linear specification that does not capture

what appears to be an important nonlinearity.

3. The Composition of the Board

     So far we have assumed that the impact of the board's ownership stake on

performance is independent of who owns that stake. This might not always be

appropriate, for at least two reasons. First, ownership by officers and by

outside directors might have different effects. Second, at any given level of

ownership, leadership by the firm's founders or by their descendants might

have different effects on performance than leadership by officers who are not

related to the founders. In this section, we examine these two hypotheses.

     The distinction between officers and outside board members might be

important for several reasons. While it is the fiduciary duty of all direc-

tors to represent the interests of shareholders, outside directors in par-

ticular must oversee the performance of the firm's officers. But monitoring

the performance of top officers requires time and effort.   In addition, an

outside director serving on a board dominated by officers with more expertise

and influence over votes, risks losing his position if he objects to these

officers' choices. Without a personal financial interest in the firm or

control over a large block of votes, an outside director may be reluctant to

second guess poor corporate decisions. Presumably, the extent of the outside

directors' role in disciplining officers is positively related to the equity

stakes of the former.

     For officers, the ownership stake is only a partial indicator of their

interest in the financial success of the firm. Officers also get significant

salaries, bonuses and incentive plans (Murphy, 1985) and may be subject to the

discipline of the managerial labor market (Fama, 1980)12. In addition, top

officers sometimes exercise virtually complete control over their firms with
                                    -14--



only small stakes, since their familiarity with the business and tenure with

the firm enables them to dominate the board regardless of their personal equity

ownership. These considerations suggest that the equity holdings of officers

and outside board members might have different effects on performance.

    Our analysis here parallels that of the previous section. By examining

the 1980 annual reports of our 371 firms, we identified the two senior cor-

porate officers of each firm. Returning to the CDE's listing of stock holdings,

we constructed a new variable (OFFICER) giving the holdings of these top offi-

cers, who were usually the chairman and the president13. The holdings of the

remainder of the board of directors are denoted OUTBOARD. That variable there-

fore includes the holdings of junior officers, such as vice—presidents. Since

junior officers generally own very little stock, this classification is unlikely

to make much difference.

     The two top officers owned 6.3% of their firms on average. In 117 firms

(32% of our sample), however, their stake was negligible; and their median

stake was approximately one half of one percent. In 60 firms (16% of our

sample) their holdings were in excess of 10%, and in 43 firms (12% of our

sample) their stake exceeded 20%.

     The mean value of the OUTBOARD variable was 4.4%, with only 97 firms

(26% of the total) having negligible outside board ownership. The median -for

OUTBOARD was just under one percent, and was thus greater than that of the

OFFICER variable. In 50 firms (13% of the sample) the outside board's holdings

exceeded 10%, and in 24 firms (6% of the sample), its stake surpassed 20%.

     Column 1 of Table 5 contains the results of regressions of Q on ownership

variables alone as in Column 1 of Table 2, but with a separate set of dummy
                                   —15—


variables for the top two officers' stake and for the stake of the rest of the

board. In Column 2 of Table 5, we report the results of controlling for

industry effects and other determinants of Q. Although the pattern of point

estimates in columns 1. and 2 is consistent with firm value being maximized at

moderately high levels of ownership, the estimates are not reliable enough to

draw any solid conclusions. Still, it is worth noting that the results for the

outer board more closely resemble the results for the board as a whole than do

the top officer results. The pattern of point estimates for top officer holdings

may reflect the absence of significant unexploited gains from raising their

holdings. This is not the case for outside board holdings. This difference is

consistent with the importance of non-ownership-based compensation for top offi-

cers, but not for outside directors. It is also consistent with the argument

that officers and free-riding shareholders will make it difficult for outside

board members to profitably increase their stakes (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986).

        In the previous discussion, we have explored share ownership as a means

to managerial entrenchment. But managers can become entrenched even without

control over a large block of votes, especially in firms where the founder is a

top officer14. Since founders presumably have a special claim to control of their

firms, they might be instrumental in selecting the board or otherwise become

entrenched even with small stakes. At the same time, the entrepreneurial abi-

lity of the founder can be a valuable asset, at least early in the life of the

firm.

        To discriminate between firms in which the founding family might supply

entrepreneurial talent, and firms in which such families might only reduce

corporate wealth, we estimate different founder effects for old and young
                                            —16-


firms. In particular, we reestimate the Tobin's Q regressions including a dummy

variable that is equal to 1 if a member of the founding family15 is one of the

top two officers and another dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the founding

family is top management and the firm was first incorporated in 1950 or later16.

This specification aims to capture the impact of the founding family on the

firm's performance independent of its stake. The results for the combined board

holdings regression provide some confirmation of the expected founder effects:


                         RD                 ADV                         D

     For pre-1950 firms, the presence of the founding family at the top of the

management team is associated with a Tobin's Q that is .125 lower on average.

However, the t-statistic for this difference is only -1.58, so the result must

be interpreted with caution. The estimated coefficient on FOUNDER5O indicates

that the effect of the founding family on Q is .351 greater in newer firms than

it is in older firms. This difference is reliably different from zero with a

t—statistic of 2.10. On the other hand, one cannot confidently conclude that

the net effect of the founding family in newer firms (the sum of the two dummy

coefficients), estimated to be .226, is different from zero (t=1.24).

     Unfortunately, results for the regression in which we segregate the

holdings of top officers and other board members are plagued by
                                                 —17-


multicollinearity. For example, of the 40 firms with top officer stakes between

5 and 20%, 31 have a founding family member as a top officer, and of the 43

firms with top officer stakes of more than 20%, 38 have a founding family

member as a top officer. Finally, these two groups account for 69 of the 88

firms with FOUNDER=1. The regression results are:

     4. Conclusion.

     In this paper, we examined two well-known hypotheses concerning the impact

of managerial ownership on a firm's performance. The "convergence of interests"

hypothesis suggests that agency costs should fall, and performance should

improve, as the management's stake rises. We found support for this hypothesis

in the O-1O range of ownership by the board of directors, although our results

seem to be driven more strongly by holdings of the outside board members than by

holdings of top officers. The "entrenchment" hypothesis predicts a decline of

performance when managers are protected against the discipline of the market and

are thus free to pursue their own objectives instead of value-maximization. We

find evidence for this hypothesis based on lower levels of performance for firms

with very large management holdings and on the finding that founding families

have a negative impact on performance of older firms.

     We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that our results can be

explained by factors other than the "convergence of interests" and

"entrenchment" hypotheses. Alternative explanations may have to do with the

joint behavior of performance and management holdings over the corporate

life-cycle, a spurious correlation between fraction of equity owned by

management and market value induced by wealth constraints, or signalling

hypotheses such as that of Leland and Pyle (1977). In addition, a theory

predicting a nonlinear relationship beween management ownership and performance

of the type that we have found has been proposed by Stulz (1986).    In his

theory, management's preference for control and consequent refusal to tender

their shares forces acquirers to pay higher premia to gain control when the

management's stake -is higher, and may lead to an increase in the target firm's
                                  -19-


 ex ante value. When the management stake is so large that no takeover can be

 profitable, however, the ex ante firm value includes no takeover premium, and is

 therefore low. While Stulz's story differs from Jensen and Meckling's at the

 lower end of management ownership, it is closely related to the "entrenchment

 hypothesis" at the higher end.

     Because of the nature of our data, this paper has not dealt with several

 important issues that might be fruitfully pursued in future research. First,

we have focused on very large (and therefore usually older) corporations. In

newer, faster growing firms, managerial holdings may play a more important

signalling role than they are likely to play for our firms. Moreover, as our

results have suggested, founders of younger firms might have an important

leadership role to play. Research on ownership structure can doubtless benefit

from considering smaller firms as well. Second, a better analysis of the

impact of officers' stakes on performance would incorporate other compensation

data. Important work in this area is Murphy (1985). Finally, on both a

theoretical and empirical level, it is very important to learn how members of

boards of directors with different individual ownership positions interact, and

how the distribution of ownership among board members affects performance.   Our

work essentially assumed a good deal of unanimity on the board; a more complex

story is surely appropriate.

1• On-the-job consumption is a generic term that can refer to shirking and

taking managerial perquisites, but also encompasses pursuit of non-value-

maximizing objectives such as sales maximization (empire building), clean

environment, or the maximization of employee welfare.

2 Numerous studies have shown that control is valued. For example, DeAngelo

and DeAngelo (1985) find that, among 45 large corporations with dual classes of

common stock entitled to identical cash flows but carrying different voting

rights, top managers own a median of 56.9 of the votes but only 24 of the com-

mon stock cash flows. Loderer and Zimmerman (1985), using Swiss data, find that

non-voting issues are priced lower than voting issues.

3.   In line with this point, Walkling and Long (1984) find that the larger is

the officers' financial gain from a takeover, the less likely they are to

resist a bid. At the same time, managerial ownership lessens the firm's

vulnerability to a hostile takeover: Weston (1977) reported that no firm where

insiders owned over 3O had ever been acquired through a hostile takeover.

4. The market value of common stock is taken from the Standard and Poor's

Compustat tape. The market value of preferred stock is estimated by dividing

the preferred stock dividend figure (reported in Compustat) by the Moody's

preferred dividend rate for median risk companies. The market value of the

firm's debt is taken as the value of its short term liabilities net of its short

term assets (from Compustat) plus an estimate of the market value of its long

term debt. Estimates of long term debt for our firms were obtained from the

N.B.E.R.'s R & 0 Master File (Cummins, Hall and Laderman, 1982). These estima-

tes are constructed on the assumption that all long term debt has an original

maturity of twenty years, and using a matrix of bond prices in year t for bonds
                                     —2—



    due in year s from the Moody's corporate BAA bond price series. The age struc-

    ture of corporate debt is estimated from changes in the firm's book value of

    long term debt in each of the twenty previous years on the Compustat tape.

Using this age structure estimate and the bond price matrix, Cummins et al

    (1982) calculate the value of each firm's long term debt.

       We have calculated some descriptive statistics on the sample of 85 firms for

which we have ownership data, but do not have market-value-based measures of Q

(omitted firms). The mean board stake for these firms is 12.0% (it is 10.6% for

the sample of 371 firms we study). Among omitted firms, 25% are run by founding

families; among included firms, this number is 24%. From the viewpoint of

ownership, therefore, omitted firms do not appear exceptional.      As a further

check that omission from the sample is not systematic, we calculated the ratio

of the replacement cost of the omitted firm to the mean replacement cost in its

(3-digit SIC) industry. The average of this ratio among omitted firms is .95.

Finally, we calculated the ratio of the book-value-based Q of the omitted firm

to the mean book-value-based Q in its (3-digit SIC) industry. The mean of this

number for the 51 omitted firms that we can calculate it for is .98. Again,

omitted firms do not appear exceptional.

       Virtually all Fortune 500 firms are listed on the New York Stock Exchange,

where listing rules require sufficiently dispersed ownership. This might

explain why very few firms in our sample are more than 50% owned by management.

       In a previous draft, we also included the value of the firm's unfunded

vested pension liabilities. This substantially reduced the sample because of

missing data. While the inclusion of this variable "improved" our results, it

turned out that it was missing systematically for newer, high Q, relatively high
                                                    —3—


board ownership firms, and that the improvement was therefore spurious.

Excluding the pension debt variable thus gives us a larger and less biased

sample.

8         For 17 observations, data were not available on the firm's advertising

expense either for 1980 or for adjacent years. In those cases, we took the

firm's advertising to asset ratio to be the industry average (at the 3—digit SIC

level).

          For each regression, define new board ownership variables by analogy with

the way they are defined in the text. The negligible ownership dummy is omitted

in each case. Using the same control variables as in equation (1), we obtain

the following point estimates and White-consistent standard errors for our

sample of 371 firms:

11       The growth rate in the firm's labor force is a geometric mean of the per-

cent change in its labor force from one year to the next from 1970 to 1980.

For 62 firms, this calculation could not be made. For 59 of those, we set GL

equal to the mean rate of growth in the firm's 3-digit SIC industry. Three firms

are omitted from the regression because GL could not be imputed in this way.

12       Lewellen (1971) nonetheless reports that top managers get four times as

much of their income from ownership income as from other forms of compensation.

13       In a few cases, either only one of the positions of Chairman and President

existed for that firm, or the same person occupied both positions. In those

cases, the OFFICER variable is the stake of the one top officer.

14    Consistent with this hypothesis, Johnson et al. (1985) find that sudden

deaths of chief executives are accompanied by price increases in their firms'

stocks when those executives are founders, but not otherwise.

15    We identified the founders and their families using a history of annual

reports dating back to either the incorporation of the firm or the turn of the

century, whichever was more recent.

16    Year of incorporation is in most cases taken to be the year of the first

incorporation of the firm obtained from Moody's Industrial Manuals. In a few

cases, Moody's noted a large discrepancy between the year the business was

established and the year of first incorporation. The establishment year was

used in those cases.
