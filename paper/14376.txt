Efficiency bounds for missing data models with semiparametric restrictions

NBER Working Paper No. 14376
October 2008, Revised October 2010
JEL No. C1,C14,C21

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper shows that the semiparametric efficiency bound for a parameter identified by an unconditional
moment restriction with data missing at random (MAR) coincides with that of a particular augmented
moment condition problem. The augmented system consists of the inverse probability weighted (IPW)
original moment restriction and an additional conditional moment restriction which exhausts all other
implications of the MAR assumption. The paper also investigates the value of additional semiparametric
restrictions on the conditional expectation function (CEF) of the original moment function given always-
observed covariates. In the program evaluation context, for example, such restrictions are implied
by semiparametric models for the potential outcome CEFs given baseline covariates. The efficiency
bound associated with this model is shown to also coincide with that of a particular moment condition
problem. Some implications of these results for estimation are briefly discussed.

1           Introduction

Let Z = (Y10 ; X 0 )0 be vector of modelling variables, fZi g1
                                                             i=1 be an independent and identically
distributed random sequence drawn from the unknown distribution F0 ,                        aK       1 unknown para-
meter vector and             (Z; ) a known vector-valued function of the same dimension.2 The only prior
restriction on F0 is that for some                 0   2B     RK

                                                            E [ (Z;           0 )]   = 0:                                  (1)

Chamberlain (1987) showed that the maximal asymptotic precision with which                       0   can be estimated
                                                                                                        0       1
under (1) (subject to identi…cation and regularity conditions) is given by If ( 0 ) =                   0   0        0,   with
    0   = E [@ (Z;       0 ) =@
                                  0]   and   0   = V ( (Z;    0   )) :3
            Now consider the case where a random sequence from F0 is unavailable. Instead only a selected
sequence of samples is available. Let D be a binary selection indicator. When D = 1 we observe Y1
and X, when D = 0 we observe only X.4 This paper considers estimation of                         0   under restriction
(1) and the following additional assumptions.

Assumption 1.1 (Random Sampling) fZi ; Di g1
                                           i=1 is an independent and identically distributed
random sequence from F0 .

Assumption 1.2 (Observed Data) For each unit we observe D; X and Y = DY1 :

Assumption 1.3 (Conditional Independence) Y1 ? DjX:

Assumption 1.4 (Overlap) Let p0 (x) = Pr(D = 1jX = x), then 0 <                                  p0 (x)             1 for all
x2X              Rdim(x) :

            Restriction (1) and Assumptions 1.1 to 1.4 constitute a semiparametric model for the data.
Henceforth I refer to this model as the semiparametric missing data model or the missing at random
(MAR) setup. Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994, Proposition 2.3, p. 850) derived the e¢ cient
in‡uence function for this problem and proposed a locally e¢ cient augmented inverse probability
weighting (AIPW) estimator (cf., Scharfstein, Rotnitzky and Robins, 1999; Bang and Robins, 2005;
Tsiatis, 2006). Cheng (1994), Hahn (1998), Hirano, Imbens and Ridder (2003), Imbens, Newey and
Ridder (2005), and Chen, Hong and Tarozzi (2008) develop globally e¢ cient estimators.
            The ‘MAR setup’has been applied to a number of important econometric and statistical prob-
lems, including program evaluation as surveyed by Imbens (2004), non-classical measurement error
        2
      Extending what follows to the overidenti…ed case is straightforward.

      Throughout upper case letters denote random variables, lower case letters speci…c realizations of them, and
calligraphic letters their support. I use the notation E [ Aj c] = E [ Aj C = c], V ( Aj c) = V ar ( Aj C = c) and
C ( A; Bj c) = Cov ( A; Bj C = c) :

      An earlier version of this paper considered the slightly more general set-up with (Z; ) = 1 (Y1 ; X; )
  0 (Y0 ; X; ) with (X; Y ) observed where Y = DY1 + (1     D) Y0 : Results for this extended model, which contains the
standard causal inference model and the two-sample instrumental variables model as special cases (cf., Imbens, 2004;
Angrist and Krueger, 1992), follow directly and straightforwardly from those outlined below.


                                                                          1
(e.g., Robins, Hsieh and Newey, 1995; Chen, Hong and Tamer, 2005), missing regressors (e.g.,
Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao, 1994), attrition in panel data (e.g., Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao,
1995; Robins and Rotnitzky, 1995; Wooldridge, 2002), and M-estimation under variable probability
sampling (e.g., Wooldridge, 1999, 2007). Chen, Hong and Tarozzi (2004), Wooldridge (2007) and
Egel, Graham and Pinto (2008) discuss several other applications.
      The maximal asymptotic precision with which                          0   can be estimated under the MAR setup has
been characterized by Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994) and is given by

                                                                       0           1
                                                      Im ( 0 ) =       0       0       0;                                           (2)

                                                                   0
with     0   =E       0 (X) =p0 (X)      + q (X;     0 ) q (X;   0)    , where              0 (x)   = V( (Z;    0 )j x)   and q (x; ) =
E [ (Z; ) jx] :
      The associated e¢ cient in‡uence function, also due to Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994), is
given by
                                                 1      d                              q (x; 0 )
                              (z;   0)   =   0               (z;       0)                        (d   p0 (x))                       (3)
                                                      p0 (x)                            p0 (x)
for    = (p; q 0 ;   0 )0 :

      The calculation of (2) is now standard. Knowledge of (2) is useful because it quanti…es the
cost – in terms of asymptotic precision – of the missing data and because it can be used to verify
whether a speci…c estimator for              0   is e¢ cient. To simplify what follows I will explicitly assume that
Im ( 0 ) is well-de…ned (i.e., that all its component expectations exist and are …nite, and that all its
component matrices are nonsingular).
      This paper shows that the semiparametric e¢ ciency bound for                                    0   under the MAR setup, co-
incides with the bound for a particular augmented moment condition problem. The augmented
system consists of the inverse probability of observation weighted (IPW) original moment restric-
tion (1) and an additional conditional moment restriction which exhausts all other implications of
the MAR setup. This general equivalence result, while implicit in the form of the e¢ cient in‡uence
function (3), is apparently new. It provides fresh intuitions for several ‘paradoxes’ in the missing
data literature, including the well-known results that projection onto, or weighting by the inverse
of, a known propensity score results in ine¢ cient estimates (e.g., Hahn, 1998; Hirano, Imbens and
Ridder, 2003), that smoothness and exclusion priors on the propensity score do not increase the
precision with which          0   can be estimated (Robins, Hsieh and Newey, 1995; Robins and Rotnitzky,
1995; Hahn, 1998, 2004) and that weighting by a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score
results in an e¢ cient estimator (Hirano, Imbens and Ridder, 2003; cf., Hahn, 1998; Wooldridge,
2007; Prokhorov and Schmidt, 2009; Hitomo, Nishiyama and Okui, 2008).
      This paper also analyzes the e¤ect of imposing additional semiparametric restrictions on the
conditional expectation function (CEF) q (x; ) = E [ (Z; ) jx]. If                                    (Z; ) = Y1          , as when the
target parameter is           0   = E [Y1 ] ; then such restrictions may arise from prior information on the
form of E [Y1 jx]. Such restrictions may arise in other settings as well. For example, if the goal
is to estimate a vector of linear predictor coe¢ cients in the presence of missing regressors, then


                                                                  2
a semiparametric model for the CEFs of the missing regressors given always-observed variables
generates restrictions on the form of q (x; ) (cf., Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao, 1994).5
       Formally I consider the semiparametric model de…ned by restriction (1), Assumptions 1.1 to 1.4
and the additional assumption.

Assumption 1.5 (Functional Restriction) Partition X = (X10 ; X20 )0 , then

                                        E [ (Z;     0 ) jx]   = q (x;   0 ; h0 (x2 ) ;   0)


where q (x; ; h (x2 ) ; ) is a known K            1 function,       aJ       1 …nite dimensional unknown parameter,
and h ( ) an unknown function mapping from a subset of X2                           Rdim(X2 ) into H   RP .

       To the best of my knowledge the variance bound for this problem, the MAR setup with ‘func-
tional’ restrictions, has not been previously calculated. In an innovative paper, Wang, Linton
and Härdle (2004) consider a special case of this model where                             (Z; ) = Y1    . They impose
a partial linear structure, as in Engle et al (1986), on E [ Y1 j x] such that q (x;                   0 ; h0 (x2 ) ;   0)   =
x01 0   + h0 (x2 )   0.   In making their variance bound calculation they assume that the conditional
distribution of Y1 given X is normal with a variance that does not depend on X. They do not
provide a bound for the general case but conjecture that it is “very complicated”(p. 338). The re-
sult given below extends their work to moment condition models, general forms for q (x; ; h (x2 ) ; )
and, importantly, does not require that                (Z; ) be conditionally normally distributed and/or ho-
moscedastic.
       Augmenting the MAR setup with Assumption 1.5 generates a middle ground between the fully
parametric likelihood-based approaches to missing data described by Little and Rubin (2002) and
those which leave E [ (Z;        0 ) jx]   unrestricted (e.g., Cheng, 1994; Hahn, 1998; Hirano, Imbens and
Ridder, 2003). Likelihood-based approaches are very sensitive to misspeci…cation (cf., Imbens,
2004), while approaches which utilize only the basic MAR setup require high dimensional smoothing
which may deleteriously a¤ect small sample performance (cf., Wang, Linton and Härdle, 2004;
Ichimura and Linton, 2005). Assumption 1.5 is generally weaker than a parametric speci…cation
for the conditional distribution of           (Z;    0)   given X, but at the same time reduces the dimension
of the nonparametric smoothing problem. Below I show how to e¢ ciently exploit prior information
on the form of E [ (Z;       0 ) jx].   I also provide conditions under which consistent estimation of                   0   is
possible even if the exploited information is incorrect.
       Section 2 reports the …rst result of the paper: an equivalence between the MAR setup and
a particular method-of-moments problem. Equivalence, which is suggested by the form of the
e¢ cient in‡uence function derived by Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994), was previously noted for
special cases by Newey (1994a) and Hirano, Imbens and Ridder (2003). I discuss the connection
between their results and the general result provided below. I also highlight some implications of
the equivalence result for understanding various aspects of the MAR setup. Section 3 calculates
   5
    The formation of predictive models of this type is the foundation of the imputation approach to missing data
described in Little and Rubin (2002).


                                                                3
the variance bound for            0   when the MAR setup is augmented by Assumption 1.5. I discuss when
Assumption 1.5 is likely to be informative and also when consistent estimation is possible even if it
is erroneously maintained.

2       Equivalence result

Under the MAR setup the inverse probability weighted (IPW) moment condition

                                                      D
                                                E          (Z;        0)      = 0;                                          (4)
                                                    p0 (X)

is valid (e.g., Hirano, Imbens and Ridder, 2003; Wooldridge, 2007). The conditional moment
restriction
                                                 D
                                           E             1 X = 0 8 X 2 X;                                                   (5)
                                               p0 (X)
also holds and nonparametrically identi…es p0 (x) : While the terminology is inexact, in what follows
I call (4) the identifying moment and (5) the auxiliary moment.
        Consider the case where p0 (x) is known such that (5) is truly an auxiliary moment. One e¢ cient
way to exploit the information (5) contains is to, following Newey (1994a) and Brown and Newey
(1998), reduce the sampling variation in (4) by subtracting from it the …tted value associated with
its regression onto the in…nite-dimensional vector of unconditional moment functions implied by
(5):6

                                      D                             D               D
                     s (Z;   0)   =        (Z;      0)       E           (Z; 0 )                         1; X
                                    p0 (X)                        p0 (X)         p0 (X)
                                      D                      q (X; 0 )
                                  =        (Z;      0)                 (D p0 (X)) :
                                    p0 (X)                    p0 (X)

That this population residual is equal to the e¢ cient score function derived by Robins, Rotnitzky
and Zhao (1994) strongly suggests an equivalence between the GMM problem de…ned by restrictions
(4) and (5) and the MAR setup outlined above. One way to formally show this is to verify that the
e¢ ciency bounds for         0   in the two problems coincide.7 The bound for                    0   under the MAR set-up is
given (2) above, while under the moment problem it is established by the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1 (GMM Equivalence) Suppose that (i) the distribution of Z has a known, …nite

    The notation E [ Y j X; Z] denotes the (mean squared error minimizing) linear predictor of Y given X within a
subpopulation homogenous in Z:
                                                                                     1
                             E [ Y j X; Z] = X 0 (Z) ;       (Z) = E XX 0 Z              E [ XY j Z] :

Wooldridge (1999b, Section 4) collects some useful results on conditional linear predictors. See also Newey (1990) and
Brown and Newey (1998).

     An alternative approach to showing equivalency would involve verifying Newey’s (2004) moment spanning condi-
tion for e¢ ciency.

hold (cf., Chamberlain (1992b), Section 2), then Im ( 0 ) is the Fisher information bound for                                            0:


Proof. See the supplemental materials.
    The proof of Theorem 2.1 involves only some tedious algebra and a straightforward application
of Lemma 2 of Chamberlain (1987). Assuming that Z has known, …nite support makes the problem
fully parametric. The unknown parameters are the probabilities associated with each possible

of X,   0   = ( 1; : : : ;   L) ,     and the parameter of interest,                        0:
    The multinomial assumption is not apparent in the form of Im ( 0 ), which involves only condi-
tional expectations of certain functions of the data. This suggests that the bound holds in general
since any F0 which satis…es (4) and (5) can be arbitrarily well-approximated by a multinomial dis-
tribution also satisfying the restrictions. Chamberlain (1992a, Theorem 1) demonstrates that this
                                                        1
is indeed the case. Therefore Im ( 0 )                      is the maximal asymptotic precision, in the sense of Hájek’s
(1972) local minimax approach to e¢ ciency, with which                                           0   can be estimated when the only prior
restrictions on F0 are (4) and (5). Since this variance bound coincides with (2) I conclude that (4)
and (5) exhaust all of the useful prior restrictions implied by the MAR setup.8
    The connection between semiparametrically e¢ cient estimation of moment condition models
with missing data and augmented systems of moment restrictions has been noted previously for
the special case of data missing completely at random (MCAR). In that case Assumptions 1.1 to
1.4 hold with p0 (X) equal to a (perhaps known) constant. Newey (1994a) shows that an e¢ cient
estimate of      0   can be based on the pair of moment restrictions

                                         E [D (Z;        0 )]      = 0;             C (D; q (X;        0 ))   = 0;

with q (X; ) as de…ned above. Hirano, Imbens and Ridder (2003) discuss a related example with
X binary and the data also MCAR. In their example e¢ cient estimation is possible with only a
…nite number of unconditional moment restrictions. Theorem 2.1 provides a formal generalization
of the Newey (1994a) and Hirano, Imbens and Ridder (2003) examples to the missing at random
(MAR) case.
    The method-of-moments formulation of the MAR setup provides a useful framework for un-

     A referee made the insightful observation that the moment condition model (4) and (5) and the MAR setup are
equivalent in the stronger sense that they impose identical restrictions on the observed data. This, of course, also
implies that they contain identical information on 0 . The complete data vector is given by (D; X; Y1 ), with only
(D; X; Y ) = (D; X; DY1 ) observed. Since Y1 is not observed whenever D = 0 we are free specify its conditional
                                                                                            D
distribution given X and D = 0 as desired. Choosing Y1 j X; D = 0  Y1 j X; D = 1 ensures conditional independence
(Assumption 1.3). Manipulating the identifying moment (4) we then have, writing (Z; 0 ) = (X; Y1 ; 0 ),

                           D                                                  D
                     E                (X; Y;   0)   = E p0 (X) E                         (X; DY1 ;     0)   X; D = 1
                         p0 (X)                                             p0 (X)
                                                    = E [E [       (X; DY1 ;        0 )j X; D   = 1]] = E [E [   (X; Y1 ;   0 )j X]] ;

which yields (1). Finally, the auxiliary restriction (5) ties down the conditional distribution of D given X and ensures
Assumption 1.4 is satis…ed. I thank Michael Jansson for several helpful discussions on this point.

derstanding several apparent paradoxes found in the missing data literature. As a simple example
consider Hahn’s (1998, pp. 324 - 325) result that projection onto a known propensity score may
be harmful for estimation of    = E [Y1 ]. Formally he shows that, for p0 (x) = Q0 constant in x
                                                        0
                                              P           P
and known, the complete-case estimator, bcc = N Di Y1i = N Di ; while consistent, is ine¢ cient.
                                                                                         i=1                     i=1
Observe that for the constant propensity score case bcc is the sample analog of the population so-
lution to (4). It consequently makes no use of any information contained in the auxiliary moment
(5). However, that moment will be informative for                  = E [ Y1 j x]  0 varies with x,     0   if q (x;    0)
                                                                               b
consistent with Hahn’s (1998) …nding that the e¢ ciency loss associated with cc is proportional to
V (q (X;      0 )).   Similar reasoning explains why weighting by the (inverse of) the known propensity
score is generally ine¢ cient (cf., Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao, 1994; Hirano, Imbens and Ridder,
2003; Wooldridge, 2007). The known weights estimator ignores the information contained in (5).
     That smoothness and exclusion priors on the propensity score do not lower the variance bound
also has a GMM interpretation. Consider the case where the propensity score belongs to a para-
metric family p (X;                  0) :   If      0   is known, then an e¢ cient GMM estimator based on (4) and (5) is
given by the solution to

with qb(x; b) a consistent nonparametric estimate of E [ (Z;                                                          0 )j x].   Now consider the e¤ect of
replacing    with the consistent estimate b. From Newey and McFadden (1994, Theorem 6.2),
                0
this replacement does not change the …rst order asymptotic sampling distribution of b because
E [@s ( 0 ; q0 ;                0]
                      0 ) =@
                    = 0: Furthermore, if the known propensity score is replaced by a consistent
nonparametric estimate, pb(x), then the sampling distribution of b is also una¤ected (Newey 1994b,
Proposition 3, p. 1360). Since the M-estimate of                                               0       based on its e¢ cient score function has the
same asymptotic sampling distribution whether the propensity score is set equal to the truth or
instead to a noisy, but consistent, estimate, knowledge of its form cannot increase the precision with
which     0   may be estimated.
     Another intuition for redundancy of knowledge of the propensity score can be found by in-
specting the information bound for the multinomial problem. Under the conditions of Theorem
2.1 calculations provided in the supplemental materials imply that the GMM estimates of                                                                        0   and
 0   (recall that        0     contains the values for the propensity score at each of the mass points of the
distribution of X) have an asymptotic sampling distribution of
                                     "          #       "         #!                 "       # "                                           #!

block diagonality sampling error in b does not a¤ect, at least to …rst order, the asymptotic sampling
properties of b. While block diagonality is formally only a feature of the multinomial problem, the

result nonetheless provides another useful intuition for understanding why prior knowledge of the
propensity score is not valuable asymptotically.
    Finally the combination of redundancy of knowledge of the propensity score, and the structure of
the equivalent GMM problem, suggests why the IPW estimator based on a nonparametric estimate
of the propensity score is semiparametrically e¢ cient (Hirano, Imbens and Ridder, 2003): when a
nonparametric estimate of the propensity score is used the sample analog of both (4) and (5) are
satis…ed. In contrast the IPW estimator based on a parametric estimate of the propensity score will
only satisfy a …nite number of the moment conditions implied by (5), hence while it will be more
e¢ cient than the estimator which weights by the true propensity score (e.g., Wooldridge, 2007), it
will be less e¢ cient than the one proposed by Hirano, Imbens and Ridder (2003).


3   Semiparametric functional restrictions

Consider the MAR setup augmented by Assumption 1.5. To the best of my knowledge, the maximal
asymptotic precision with which                0   can be estimated in this model has not been previously char-
acterized. In order to calculate the bound for this problem I …rst consider the conditional moment
problem de…ned by (4) and (5) and

                                               E [ (Z;   0 ; h0 (X2 ) ;         0 ) jX]     = 0;                                          (6)

with (Z;      0 ; h0 (X2 ) ;   0)   =    (Z;    0)   q (x;   0 ; h0 (x2 ) ;      0) :   I apply Chamberlain’s (1992a) approach
to this problem to calculate a variance bound for                          0.   I then show that this bound coincides with
the semiparametric e¢ ciency bound for the problem de…ned by restriction (1) and Assumptions
1.1 to 1.5 using the methods of Bickel, Klaassen, Ritov and Wellner (1993). The value of …rst
considering the conditional moment problem is that it provides a conjecture for the form of the
e¢ cient in‡uence function, therefore sidestepping the need to directly calculate what is evidently a
complicated projection.
    To present these results I begin by letting q0 (X) = q (X;                              0 ; h0 (X2 ) ;   0) ;   (Z;   0)   =   (Z;   0)

   Theorem 3.1 implies that Assumption 6 can be exploited to more e¢ ciently estimate                                                        0.   However
its use also carries risk, if false, yet nevertheless erroneously maintained by the data analyst, an
inconsistent estimate of               0   may result. This tension, between e¢ ciency and robustness, is formalized
by the next two Propositions which together provide guidance as to whether prior information of
the type given by Assumption 1.5 should be utilized in practice.

This is the population analog of the …tted value from a generalized least squares regression in a subpopulation
homogenous in Z and with D = 1:

weighted least squares regression in the D = 1 subpopulation. The average of these di¤erences,
E [G0 (X)], is taken across the entire population; it will be large in absolute value when the dis-
tribution of X1 conditional on X2 di¤ers in the D = 1 versus D = 0 subpopulations. This will
occur whenever X1 is highly predictive for missingness (conditional on X2 ). In such situations the
e¢ ciency costs of sampling uncertainty in b are greater (relative to the known 0 case) because
estimation of         0   requires greater levels of extrapolation.
       An example clari…es the discussion given above. Assume that                                (Z;    0)   = Y1        0   with

                                      q (X;    0 ; h0 (X2 ) ;   0)   = X10    0   + h0 (X2 )        0:


This is the model considered by Wang, Linton and Härdle (2004). In addition to being of importance
in its own right, it provides insight into the program evaluation problem (where the means of two
missing outcomes, as opposed to just one, need to be estimated). Wang, Linton and Härdle’s (2004)
prior restriction includes the condition that V ( Y1 j X) =                       2   is constant in X: For clarity of exposition
                                                                                  1
I also assume homoscedasticity holds, but that this fact is not known by the econometrician. Let
e0 (X2 ) = E [ p (X)j X2 ] = Pr ( D = 1j X2 ) ; specializing the general results given above to this model
and evaluating (8) gives

which shows that the e¢ ciency gain associated with correctly exploiting Assumption 1.5 re‡ects

three forces. First, substantial convexity in p (X)                           , which will occur when overlap is limited,
increases the e¢ ciency gain.10 This gain re‡ects the semiparametric restriction allowing for extrap-
olation in the presence of conditional covariate imbalance. The next two e¤ects re‡ect the fact that
the …rst source of e¢ ciency gain is partially nulli…ed by having to estimate                                 0.   If X1 varies strongly
given X2 in the D = 1 subpopulation then the information for                                 0   is large which, in turn, increases
the precision with which             0   may be estimated. On the other hand if there are large (average) dif-
ferences in the conditional mean of X1 given X2 across the D = 1 and D = 0 subpopulations, then
estimating        0   requires greater extrapolation which –when                       0   is unknown –decreases the precision
with which it may be estimated.
       Proposition 3.1 provides insight into when correctly imposing Assumption 1.5 is likely to be infor-
mative. A related question concerns the consequences of misspecifying the form of q (X; ; h (X2 ) ; ).
Under such misspeci…cation the conditional moment restriction (6) will be invalid. Nevertheless the
e¢ cient score function may continue to have an expectation of zero at                                    =        0.   This suggest that
an M-estimator based on an estimate of the e¢ cient score function may be consistent even if As-

    When some subpopulations have low propensity scores E [ 1=p (X)j X2 ]                        1=E [ p (X)j X2 ] will tend to be large
(Jensen’s Inequality).

1.1 to 1.4      f   (Z; ;   0)   is mean zero if either (i)               =        0;      =     0   and Assumption 1.5 holds or

  0 (x)   =    0 (x2 )   for all x 2 X , and (c) at least one element of h (x2 ) enters linearly in each row
of q (X) :

       Note that there is a tension between the robustness property of Proposition 3.2 and the e¢ ciency
gain associated with Assumption 1.5. Mean-zeroness of                          f   (Z; ;        0)   under misspeci…cation requires
that those variables entering q (X; ; h (X2 ) ;                 0)   parametrically do not a¤ect either the probability
of missingness or the conditional variance of the moment function (1). Under such conditions an
estimator based on          f   (Z; ;   0)   will perform no better, at least asymptotically, than one based on
the e¢ cient score function derived by Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994). In particular we have:

Corollary 3.1 Under the conditions of part (ii) of Proposition 3.2

                                                            1         f        1
                                                Im ( 0 )             Im ( 0)        = 0:

Proof. See the supplemental materials.
       Collectively Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 suggest that estimation while maintaining Assumption 1.5
will be most valuable when the econometrician is highly con…dent in the imposed semiparametric
restriction.

              E¢ ciency bounds for missing data models
    with semiparametric restrictions, supplemental material: proofs

    This appendix contains proofs of the results contained in the main paper. All notation is as de…ned in the main
text unless explicitly noted otherwise. Equation numbering continues in sequence with that established in the main
text. To simplify notation let denote the true parameter value 0 unless explicitly stated otherwise (similarly the
‘0’subscript is removed from other objects, such as the propensity score, when doing so does not cause confusion).

A    Proof of Theorem 2.1

The proof closely follows that of Theorem 1 in Chamberlain (1992) and consists of three steps.

Step 1: Demonstration of equivalence with an unconditional GMM problem The …rst step is to show that
restrictions (4) and (5) are, in the multinomial case, equivalent to a …nite set of unconditional moment restrictions.
Under the multinomial assumption we have X 2 fx1 ; : : : ; xL g for some L: Let the L 1 vector B have a 1 in the lth
                                                                       P
row if X = xl and zeros elsewhere and l = Pr (X = xl ) (observe that L    l=1 l = 1). Denote the value of the selection
probability at X = xl by l and de…ne = f 1 ; : : : ; L g0 ; this vector gives the values of p ( ) at each of the mass
points of X. Using this notation we can write p (X) = B 0 :
     Under the multinomial assumption restrictions (4) and (5) are equivalent to the L + K 1 vector of unconditional
moment restrictions                                                  "               #
                                                  m1 (Z; )             B BD0      1
                            E [m (Z; ; )] = E                   =E      D
                                                                                       = 0:
                                                 m2 (Z; ; )              0    (Z; )              B

To verify that this is the case note that by iterated expectations

                                                              1 X = 0 for all X 2 fx1 ; : : : ; xL g : We also have

The application of Chamberlain’s result requires that M has full column rank and that V is non-singular. The
calculations made in Step 3 below demonstrate that these conditions are implied by the assumption that has full
column rank, p (X) is bounded away from zero and non-singularity of :

B   Proof of Theorem 3.1

The …rst two steps of the proof of Theorem 3.1 are analogous to those of Theorem 2.1 and therefore omitted. The
actual calculation of the bound, while conceptually straightforward, is considerably more tedious. Details of this step
are provided here.
    Assume that the marginal distributions of X1 and X2 have I and M points of support with probabilities 1 ; : : : ; I
and &1 ; : : : ; &M . Let L = I M and im denote the joint probability Pr X1 = x1;i ; X2 = x2;m . Let = ( 1 ; : : : ; M )0
be the values of h ( ) at each of the mass points of X2 (for simplicity I assume that dim (h (x2 )) = P = 1 in the
calculations below, but the results generalize). Let C be a M 1 vector with a 1 in the mth row if X2 = x2;m and
zeros elsewhere. Finally it is convenient to use the shorthand = q (X) q (X)0 : In what follows I use both the single
and double subscript notation to denote a point on the support of X as is convenient. We can map between the two
notations by observing that xim = xl for l = (i 1) M + m.

dancy of knowledge of the propensity score for : However the structure of the bound does indicate that knowledge
of the …nite dimensional parameters and nonparametric portions of the CEF of (Z; ) given X does increase the
precision with which can be estimated.

    We can now use the explicit expressions for V0 and M0 give above to generate an interpretable bound. The

C   Proof of Theorem 3.2

In calculating the e¢ ciency bound for the semiparametric missing data model de…ned by restriction (1) and Assump-
tions 1.1 to 1.5 above, I follow the general approach outlined by Bickel, Klaassen, Ritov and Wellner (1993) and,
especially, Newey (1990, Section 3). First, I characterize the nuisance tangent space. Second, I demonstrate pathwise
di¤erentiability of the parameter of interest, : The e¢ cient in‡uence function for this model equals the projection
of the pathwise derivative onto the tangent space. In the present example the direct calculation of this projection
appears to be particularly di¢ cult. However inspection of the variance bound associated with the conditional moment
problem de…ned by restrictions (4), (5) and (6) provides a conjecture for the form of the e¢ cient in‡uence function.
The third and …nal step of the proof therefore involves demonstrating that (i) this conjectured in‡uence function lies
in the model tangent space and (ii) that it is indeed the required projection (i.e., that it satis…es equation (9) in
Newey (1990, p. 106)). The result then follows from an application of Theorem 3.1 in Newey (1990).

Step 1: Characterization of the nuisance tangent space                                              Recalling that Y = DY1 , the joint density function
for (Y; X; D), making use of Assumption 1.3, is given by

                                        f (y; x; d) = f ( y1 j x)d p (x)d [1                            p(x)]1    d
                                                                                                                      f (x) :

Assumption 1.5 also requires that f ( y1 j x) satisfy the restriction
                                                Z
                                                         (z;     0 ; h0 (x2 ) ; 0 ) f           ( y1 j x) dy1 = 0;




                                                                                   20
where    (z; ) =    (x; y1 ; ) and

                                        (z; ; h (x2 ) ; ) =          (x; y1 ; )      q (x; ; h (x2 ) ; ) :

    Consider a regular parametric submodel with f (y; x; d; ) = f (y; x; d) at                            =       0.   The submodel joint density is
given by
                            f (y; x; d; ) = f ( y1 j x; )d p (x; )d [1 p(x; )]1                      d
                                                                                                         f (x; )                                 (15)

and satis…es the restriction             Z
                                               (z; ( ) ; h (x2 ; ) ;        0) f   ( y1 j x; ) dy1 = 0:                                          (16)

    The submodel score vector equals

                                                                         d p (x; )
                          s (y; x; d; ) = ds ( y1 j x; ) +                              r p (x; ) + t (x; ) ;                                    (17)
                                                                    p (x; ) [1 p (x; )]

where

         s (y; x; d; ) = r log f (y; x; d; ) ;         s ( y1 j x; ) = r log f ( y1 j x; ) ;                  t (x; ) = r log f (x; ) :

By the usual mean zero property of (conditional) scores we have

                                                 E [ s ( Y1 j X)j X] = E [t (X)] = 0;                                                            (18)

where suppression of in a function means that it is evaluated at its population value (e.g., t                                  (x) = t (x; 0 )).
    Condition (16) imposes additional restrictions on s ( Y1 j X) beyond conditional mean                                      zeroness. To see the
structure of these restrictions di¤erentiate (16) with respect to through the integral and                                     evaluate the result at
  = 0:
                  @q0 (X) @ ( 0 )    @q (X) @h (X2 ; 0 )
                                   + 0 0                 = E (Z; 0 ; h0 (X2 ) ; 0 ) s ( Y1 j X)0                                X :
                    @ 0      @ 0       @h        @ 0
The conditional covariance between (Z; 0 ; h0 (X2 ) ; 0 ) and s ( Y1 j X) has a particular structure induced by the
semiparametric restrictions on the form of E [ (Z; )j x] :
    From (17), (18) and the above equality the tangent set is evidently

                                             T = fds ( y1 j x) + a (x) [d           p (x)] + t (x)g ;                                            (19)

where a (x) is unrestricted and t (x) and s ( y1 j x) satisfy

                                                            E [t (X)] = 0
                                                  E [ s ( Y1 j X)j X] = 0
                                                                0                  @q0 (X)           @q0 (X)
                      E     (Z;   0 ; h0 (X2 ) ; 0 ) s ( Y1 j X)     X =                      c+                         k (X2 ) ;
                                                                                     @ 0               @h0

with c a constant matrix and k (x2 ) an unrestricted matrix-valued function of x2 :

Step 2: Demonstration of pathwise di¤erentiability Under the parametric submodel                                               ( ) is identi…ed by the
unconditional moment restriction
                                        E [ (Z; ( ))] = 0:

Di¤erentiating under the integral and evaluating at                 =   0   gives
                                                                                                          0
                                       @ ( 0)               1                     @ log f (Y1 ; X;   0)
                                              =         0       E    (Z;     0)                               :
                                        @ 0                                               @ 0

To demonstrate pathwise di¤erentiability of            we require F (Y; X; D) such that

                                               @ ( 0)
                                                      = E F (Y; X; D)s (Y; X; D)0 :
                                                @ 0


                                                                        21
      It is easy to verify that the function

                                                             1       D
                          F (Y; X; D) =                  0                (Z;          0 ; h0 (X2 ) ; 0 )       + q (X;       0 ; h0 (X2 ) ; 0 ) ;
                                                                   p0 (X)

satis…es this condition (cf., Hahn 1998).

Step 3: Veri…cation that conjectured e¢ cient in‡uence function equals the required projection Inspec-
tion of the variance bounds associated with the conditional moment problem suggests the candidate e¢ cient in‡uence
given by (7) in the main text. I …rst verify that f (Z; 0 ; 0 ) lies in the model tangent space. The last term in (7)
plays the role of t (x). A zero plays the role of a (x) [d p (x)]. Finally the …rst two terms in (7) play the role of
ds ( y1 j x) : To see this note that in addition to being both conditionally mean zero we have

By the conditional independence of Y1 and D given X (Assumption 1.3) and conditional mean zeroness of (Z; 0 ) it
                                   f
is easy to show that F (Y; X; D)     (Z; 0 ; 0 ) is orthogonal to any functions of the form a (x) [d p (x)] and t (x) :

E [G0 (X)] = 0: This implies that the second part of                                                      (Z;         ;       0 ) is mean zero. The third part of                                  (Z;     ;    0)
has mean E [q (X)]. The result follows as claimed.

F   Proof of Corollary 3.1

From the proof to Proposition 3.2 we have E [G0 (X)] = 0. So the result follows if

                                                     0 (X)                       h       1

                                                    p0 (X)

Under conditions (a) and (b) of part (ii) of Proposition 3.2 we have
