Intensive Medical Care and Cardiovascular Disease Disability Reductions

JEL No. I1, J1

                                           ABSTRACT

There is little empirical evidence to explain why disability declined among the elderly over the past
20 years. In this paper, we explore the role of improved medical care for cardiovascular disease on
health status improvements over time. We show that the incidence of cardiovascular disease
hospitalizations remained relatively constant between 1984 and 1999 at the same time that post-event
survival improved and disability declined. We find that use of appropriate therapies, including
pharmaceuticals such as beta-blockers, aspirin, and ace-inhibitors, and invasive procedures, explains
up to 50% and 70% of the reductions in disability and death over time, respectively. Elderly patients
living in regions with high use of appropriate medical therapies had better health outcomes than
patients living in low-use areas. Finally, we estimate that preventing disability after an acute event
can add as much as 3.7 years of quality-adjusted life expectancy, or $316,000 of value.

          Disability among the elderly has declined markedly in the United States in the past two

decades. In 1984, 25 percent of the elderly population reported difficulty with activities

associated with independent living.1 By 1999, the share had fallen to 20 percent, a decline of

one-fifth.

          Although these basic facts are well known, the interpretation of these facts is not clear. Is

the reduction in disability a result of improved medical care, individual behavioral changes, or

environmental modifications that allow the elderly to better function by themselves? Will the

trend continue, or is it time limited? What does the reduction in disability mean for years of

healthy life and labor force participation? We explore these issues in this paper.

          To make progress, we focus on disability caused by a specific set of medical conditions:

cardiovascular disease. Focusing on one condition is helpful because it allows us to analyze

health shocks and their sequellae in some detail. Cardiovascular disease is a natural condition to

pick because it is the most common cause of death in the US (and most other developed

countries), and more is spent on cardiovascular disease than any other condition. Thus, this is a

case where medical care could really matter.

          Our analysis has three parts. In the first part, we examine basic trends in disability

associated with cardiovascular disease. We show that reduced disability for people with

cardiovascular disease incidents is a major part of reductions in overall disability, accounting for

between one-fifth and one-third of the total reduction in disability. The second part of the paper

considers the role of advances in medical care in reducing disability from cardiovascular disease.

We show that medical technology in the treatment of cardiovascular disease is a major factor in

reduced disability. We estimate that use of recommended treatments for heart attacks, including

prescriptions of beta-blockers, aspirin and ace-inhibitors at discharge, as well as use of

reperfusion and other surgical procedures increased the probability that elderly patients survive

an acute cardiovascular event in a non-disabled state by 13 to 22 percent between 1984 and

1994. The third part of the paper considers the long-run health and financial impacts of improved

care for people with cardiovascular disease.



I.     Background on Cardiovascular Disease

       Cardiovascular diseases are diseases of the heart and blood vessels which carry oxygen to

the body’s major organs. Ischemic heart disease is the most common manifestation of

cardiovascular disease. When the arteries supplying blood to the heart become occluded, the

heart does not get enough oxygen. Like any muscle, oxygen is essential for the heart’s

performance. Constriction of the coronary arteries will result in chest pain on exertion, or

perhaps at rest. A person with such constriction might be unable to engage in activities such as

walking for a prolonged period (for example, to get to a grocery store) or engaging in light or

heavy housework (cleaning, cooking, etc.)

       A blockage of the arteries to some or all of the heart is termed a myocardial infarction, or

heart attack. The equivalent in other extremities, especially the legs, is termed peripheral

vascular disease. Heart attacks can be fatal, and can lead to substantial disability if survived. A

person who survives a heart attack might be unable to shop or cook, might have difficulty

walking up stairs or entering a raised bathtub, and might have difficulty keeping house.

Peripheral vascular disease can lead to the same types of impairments.

       Medical advance has made tremendous strides in preventing and treating coronary events.

Several risk factors for heart disease are well known. Traditional risk factors include smoking;




                                                 4
hypertension or high blood pressure; high cholesterol; obesity; family history, age and diabetes.

Since the early 1970s, standard recommendations for people at risk have been behavioral

changes (stop smoking, reduce weight, cut back on fat intake, and exercise) combined with

medical therapy (antihypertensive medication, and more recently cholesterol-reducing

medications). (Cutler and Kadiyala 2003) show significant reductions in the incidence of heart

disease over time attributable to reductions in these risk factors, especially reduced smoking and

better blood pressure control.

       There have also been technological changes in the treatment available for people with

severe heart disease. Bed rest was once standard therapy for people with heart attacks. Today,

therapy for a heart attack, and often heart disease in earlier stages of progression, generally starts

with drugs such as aspirin help dissolve clots and restore blood flow to the heart. Beta-blockers

are also given to reduce the workload of the heart, and thus reduce the demand for oxygen. In

addition, ace-inhibitors are prescribed to help reduce the workload of the heart by lowering blood

pressure Statins are prescribed to help process and break down cholesterol in the arteries

(American Heart Association 2006).

       Finally, there have been significant advances in acute care and invasive surgical

procedures for treating coronary blockage. Thrombolytics are a class of drugs that may be used

to help dissolve the clot. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is used to clear out blockages

of the coronary arteries. These procedures are now frequently accompanied by use of a stent to

keep the occluded artery open. A more invasive option is coronary artery bypass grafting

(abbreviated CABG, and pronounced like the vegetable).

       Each of these technologies has been shown to increase survival after a heart attack among

patients without contraindications for treatment (Krumholz, Radford et al. 1995; Hennekens,




                                                  5
Albert et al. 1996; Krumholz, Radford et al. 1996; Soumerai, McLaughlin et al. 1997; Gottlieb,

McCarter et al. 1998; Krumholz, Radford et al. 1998; Freemantle, Cleland et al. 1999; Shlipak,

Browner et al. 2001; Braunwald, Antman et al. 2002; Antman, Anbe et al. 2004; Vitagliano,

Curtis et al. 2004; Stukel, Lucas et al. 2005). They have an ambiguous effect on disability,

however, with the increase in survival among those with serious heart damage possibly offsetting

the improved health among traditional survivors (Crimmins, Saito et al. 1989; Crimmins,

Hayward et al. 1994; Waidmann, Bound et al. 1995).

       Cerebrovascular disease, or stroke, is the second major form of cardiovascular disease.

Ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke, and are similar to heart disease: an artery

in the brain becomes blocked, and a part of the brain is denied oxygen. Disability is quite

common after a stroke, particularly among the elderly (Pohjasvaara, Erkinjuntti et al. 1997;

Prencipe, Ferretti et al. 1997; Zhu, Fratiglioni et al. 1998). Recent studies report that 39% to 54%

of stroke survivors are disabled 3-months after the stroke (Henon, Godefroy et al. 1995; Zhu,

Fratiglioni et al. 1998; Glader, Stegmayr et al. 2003). The high level of disability can persist

among survivors. One study found 37% of stroke survivors were disabled one year after the

event (Appelros, Nydevik et al. 2003). In addition, stroke is associated with increased odds of

cognitive impairment, both with and without dementia (Pohjasvaara, Erkinjuntti et al. 1997;

Prencipe, Ferretti et al. 1997; Zhu, Fratiglioni et al. 1998).

       Thrombolytic medication might be given after a stroke, but the benefit is far less certain

than in heart disease. Clinical trials show that thrombolytics are effective only if given in the first

three hours after an acute event (Group 1995; Clark, Wissman et al. 1999; Adams, Adams et al.

2005). Revascularization procedures such as carotid endarterectomy may be performed in

patients with certain types of stroke, including transient ischemic attacks, after the patients have




                                                   6
recovered from the acute phase of the stroke. A small share of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes,

where a blood vessel bursts and there is bleeding in the skull. Little therapy is generally

available in such cases, and death is common.

       Heart failure and arrhythmias are other types of cardiovascular disease that cause

substantial morbidity and mortality among the elderly. Heart failure occurs when the heart’s

ability to pump blood is impaired. Patients may experience breathlessness and fatigue that makes

it difficult to keep up usual activities, fluid retention and edema, coughing, memory loss and

heart palpitations. An arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that can cause the heart to pump blood

less effectively. Patients with heart failure and/or arrhythmias may also be at substantial risk for

stroke and other complications (American Heart Association 2006). Treatment for heart failure

includes ace-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics.

Appropriate patients may also undergo valve replacement surgery or other revascularization.

Patients with arrhythmias often receive pacemakers and occasionally receive implantable

cardioverter defibrillators along with antiarrhythmic drugs and blood thinners.

       Other cardiovascular diseases, generally with smaller prevalence, include rheumatic heart

disease, aneurysms, acute pulmonary heart disease, other diseases of the endocardium, capillary

diseases, and problems with veins (e.g. varicose veins).



II.    The Importance of Cardiovascular Disease for Reductions in Disability

       Like every multidimensional concept, there is no perfect measure of disability. We

follow the lead of most researchers in measuring disability as the presence of impairments in

Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). Our data

source, the National Long-Term Care Survey of 1984-1999 – abbreviated NLTCS – includes




                                                  7
information on 6 ADL measures: eating, getting in or out of bed, walking around inside,

dressing, bathing, and getting to the toilet or using the toilet. Questions are also asked about 8

IADL measures: doing light housework, laundry, preparing meals, shopping for groceries,

getting around outside, managing money, taking medications and making telephone calls.

       The NLTCS is a nationally-representative longitudinal survey of the health and disability

profile population aged 65 and over. The first NLTCS survey wave was conducted in 1982 and

subsequent surveys were administered in 1984, 1989, 1994 and 1999. Each survey wave began

with a screener that collected information on whether the respondent reported difficulty

conducting the 6 ADLs and 8 IADLs without help (i.e. help from another person or special

equipment), and whether any difficulty had lasted or was expected to last at least 3 months. The

screener also collected demographic information on marital status, race and age.

       Respondents who reported difficulty with any ADLs or IADLs for at least 3 months on

the screener were asked to complete a detailed survey. Disability status was determined by

responses to questions about use of help and inability to conduct the ADLs and IADLs on the

detailed survey. Sampling and weighting issues are described fully elsewhere (Manton, Corder et

al. 1993; Manton, Corder et al. 1997; Manton, Stallard et al. 1997; Singer and Manton 1998;

Manton and Gu 2001).

       We obtained Medicare-linked data for all NLTCS participants, including data on date of

death from the denominator files. We used inpatient claims for all analyses, because Medicare

claims files for part B and other non-hospital services were incomplete prior to 1991. We also

obtained data on zip code of residence at the most recent interview for all NLTCS survey

respondents.




                                                  8
         Basic data on disability among the elderly population is shown in Figure 1. For reasons

that will become clear briefly, we report disability for the population that is aged 70 and older in

each of three years: 1989, 1994, and 1999. The share of the elderly population that is disabled

declined markedly in the decade of the 1990s. The cumulative decline was 6.3 percentage

points, or 2.1 percent per year.

         To examine the role of cardiovascular disease in explaining this reduction in disability,

we form a population sample likely affected by the condition. We start by looking at the

population aged 70 and older in the 1989, 1994, and 1999 surveys. For each of these cohorts, we

group all hospitalizations over the preceding 5 years into one of 32 categories (the five year look

back is the reason for the restriction to people over 70). These categories were designed to pick

up relatively homogenous clinical conditions that would be predictive of disability. The set of 32

categories is shown in Table 1, along with the rate of disability for people hospitalized with each

condition from the 1989 survey cohort. The relevant categories for cardiovascular disease are

stroke, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure and arrhythmia, peripheral vascular

disease, and other circulatory diseases.2

         Figure 2 reports the share of people with a hospitalization for any of these conditions.

Twenty-two percent of people were admitted to a hospital with some cardiovascular disease.

Ischemic heart disease is the most common admission, accounting for 8 percent of admissions.

Stroke and heart failure are also common, as are other circulatory diseases. Admissions for

peripheral vascular disease and hypertension are much less common.



2
  ICD-9 codes are as follows: stroke: 362.34, 430, 431, 432.9, 433-436; hypertension: 401-402, 405, 437.0, 437.9;
ischemic heart disease; 4.10-4.14, 429.5-429.7, excluding 414.11 and 414.19; heart failure and arrhythmia: 425,
427.1, 427.3-427.5, 428, 429.1, 429.3; peripheral vascular disease: 440, 442, 443.0 - 443.1, 443.8 - 443.9, 444, 446,
447.0-447.5, 447.8-447.9, 451, 453.1; and circulatory diseases: 391-400, 406-409, 414.11, 414.19, 415-424, 426,
427.2, 427.6, 427.8, 427.9, 429.2, 429.4, 429.8, 429.9, 432.1 – 432.8, 437.1 – 437.8, 439, 441, 443.2, 445, 447.6,
448 – 450, 452 – 453.0, 453.2 – 459, 786.5, V717.


                                                          9
        A person who had a hospital admission for cardiovascular disease and is disabled may or

may not have been disabled because of that condition. The NLTCS does not reliably determine

the precise condition that leads to each disability (Landrum and Stewart 2006). We make two

alternative assumptions about the probability of being disabled by cardiovascular disease. The

first assumption, a less restrictive assumption, labels someone as disabled from cardiovascular

disease if they were admitted to a hospital with cardiovascular disease in the previous five years.

The more restrictive assumption subsets this group to those for whom the most disabling

condition was cardiovascular disease3 – where the list of conditions by disability status is

reported in Table 1. Thus, a person who had a stroke and hip fracture would be termed disabled

because of cardiovascular disease by the first measure, but not by the second measure.

Fortunately, our results are very similar regardless of the definition used

        Figure 3 shows the probability of being disabled by cardiovascular disease. Using the

less restrictive measure, the decline in disability is 1.4 percentage points, or 22 percent of the 6.3

percentage point total reduction in disability. Using the more restrictive measure, the decline is

0.9 percentage points, or 14 percent of the total decline. In each case, cardiovascular disease is a

substantial share of the total decline.

        As noted above, the conclusion that cardiovascular disease is a substantial share of

disability decline contradicts an earlier literature that suggested that ‘marginal survivors’

contribute to an increase in disability. If more people survive strokes, the argument went, the

share of the elderly with disabilities would rise. The finding of a reduction in disability suggests,

in contrast, two other hypotheses: either fewer people are suffering cardiovascular disease

events; or those who have always survived such events are less disabled now than they were

3
 Note even this more restrictive assumption may underestimate the importance of disabling diseases, such as
arthritis or dementia, that are not common causes of hospitalizations.



                                                       10
formerly, i.e. the incidence of disability among cardiovascular disease patients is falling. These

possible effects are demonstrated in equation (1):



(1)      Pr[Disabled from CVD] = Pr[Had CVD Incident] * Pr[Survive | Had Event] *

                                             Pr[Disabled | Had Event, Survival]



The first term on the right hand side is the incidence of events. The second term is the survival

rate, and the third term is the health effect among survivors. The change in disability rates is

arithmetically related to the change in one or more of these factors.4 The marginal survivors

theory focuses on the second term: the change in the probability of survival after an acute event,

i.e. as more patients survive acute events, the pool of people at risk of disability expands. The

other theories focus on the first and third terms, i.e. either reduced incidence of disease or better

health among survivors.

         Table 2 shows cardiovascular disease event probabilities, survival rates, and conditional

disability rates for each of our three time periods. To measure the cardiovascular disease event

rate, we consider the population surveyed at the beginning of the 5-year interval, and look at

events in those five years. For example, the cardiovascular disease event rate for the 1989 cohort

is the share of the population aged 65 and older in 1984 that had a cardiovascular disease

hospital admission in the subsequent five years.5




4
  There are covariance terms as well, but these are generally small.
5
  Were the NLTCS a fixed panel survey, the sample of people at the starting year (for example 1984) would be only
those for whom the disability status is known five years later plus those who died in the interim. The NLTCS did
not interview the entire sample every year, however, so some people are lost to follow-up. To generate a nationally
representative sample, we analyzed only those people whose health and mortality status were known at follow-up
for each survey year, and re-weighted the sample weights to reflect the age-sex distribution of all respondents to the
1999 survey.


                                                         11
         The first row shows that the share of people who had a hospitalization for cardiovascular

disease was relatively constant over the time period, at about 26 percent. This is somewhat

surprising given the reduction in event rates noted in other surveys such as the Framingham

Heart Study (Sytkowski, D'
                         Agostino et al. 1996) and the Minnesota Heart Survey (McGovern,

Pankow et al. 1996; McGovern, Jacobs et al. 2001). It may be that some of the admissions

among the later cohorts in our study were done explicitly to perform surgical operations such as

angioplasty or bypass surgery, and thus contribute to an increased reporting of cardiovascular

disease. However, another recent U.S. study of subjects aged 35 to 74 reported little change in

the incidence of first myocardial infarction between 1987 and 1994 (Rosamond, Chambless et al.

1998). Alternatively, it may be that less severe cases of these conditions are being diagnosed

over time.6

         In addition, the Framingham and Minnesota studies included patients younger than 65,

and results from these studies may have been driven by a decline in heart disease among the

younger population. A Finnish study of coronary heart disease between 1978-1980 and 2000-

2001 reported decreased prevalence of coronary heart disease among men and women aged 45 to

64 years, no change in prevalence among men and women aged 65 to 74 and increased incidence

among people aged 75 and over (Kattainen, A. et al. 2004). Our results may reflect similar trends

in age-related incidence of heart disease.

         The second row of the table shows a significant increase in the survival rate to the next

survey for people admitted to a hospital with cardiovascular disease. The survival rate increased

by 4.3 percentage points, or about 7.5 percent. By itself, this would have led to an increase in

disability from cardiovascular disease. This effect is overwhelmed, however, by the substantial

6
  Clinical trials published in 1996 showed that a blood test for troponin, a protein released from damaged heart
tissue, can be used to diagnose heart attacks. This likely led to greater diagnosis of smaller heart attacks, and may
also have led to increased hospitalizations, depending on how frequently these patients were previously admitted.


                                                          12
reduction in disability among survivors, shown in the third row of the table. The share of CVD

survivors who are disabled fell from 48 percent in 1989 to 39 percent in 1999, a 19 percent

reduction. It is this massive reduction in event-specific disability that needs to be explained.



III.    Medical Care and CVD-Related Disability

        Before estimating formal statistical models to address the role of medical care in reduced

CVD-related disability, we consider a less structural analysis of the role of medical care.

Specifically, we look at how disability changed in the period shortly after the cardiovascular

disease event relative to the period several years later. If the reduction in disability followed

immediately after the cardiovascular event, it strongly suggests that medical treatment of the

acute event was the major factor responsible for the reduction in disability. A disability

reduction further out in time might be attributable to medical intervention, but other factors, such

as better coping with limitations due to improved environmental factors, could be important as

well.

        Figure 4 shows the change in disability rates for people whose cardiovascular disease

event happened within 6 months of the survey, by type of event. The rate of disability declined

from 1984-1989 cohort to the 1994-1999 cohort for people with hospitalizations for ischemic

heart disease, heart failure and arrhythmia, stroke and other cardiovascular disease. For heart

failure and arrhythmia patients as well as other cardiovascular diseases, there were increases in

the disability rate from the 1984-1989 to 1989-1994 cohorts that need further explanation7.

Overall, though, it seems that medical advances could have some role in this change decline in

disability between 1984-1989 and 1994-1999.


7
 For example, the average severity of heart failure hospitalizations may have increased over time if physicians and
patients were better able to manage heart failure in the outpatient setting.


                                                        13
       Empirical Methodology

       To examine the role of medical technology changes in event-related reductions in

disability more formally, we estimate regression models for the health of patients who have been

admitted to a hospital with cardiovascular disease. Our sample is formed from each of the three

cohorts. We select people who were admitted to a hospital with cardiovascular disease in the

1984-89 period, the 1989-94 period, and the 1994-99 period. In each case, the sample includes

all people for whom we know health status at the beginning and end of the 5-year period. There

are three possible health states at the end of each period, i.e. at the time of follow-up survey:

dead; alive and non-disabled; and alive and disabled. We denote these possible outcomes with

the subscript k.

       Consider for the moment a single measure of medical treatments, which we wish to relate

to the change in disability. For concreteness, assume that the variable is the share of people in an

area who receive a surgical procedure that has been shown to be effective in improving health for

people with that condition. The treatment rate for area j in time period t is denoted Tj,t. We

model the probability that person i will be in health state k using a multinomial logit formulation:



(2)     Pr[health state k]i,j,t =

             exp(Xi,t   k   +   k   Tj,t +   k   cohortt) / (1+exp( Xi,t   l   +   l   Tj,t +   l   cohortt)



where Xi,t is a set of demographic variables,           k’s   are the coefficient of interest. Our demographic

variables include age/sex (five year age groups differentiated by gender); dummy variables for

other cardiovascular disease hospitalizations, a modified Charlson index (i.e. without




                                                          14
cardiovascular disease diagnoses) (Deyo, Cherkin et al. 1992) marital status at the beginning of

the five year window (married; widowed; and divorced/separated); and race (white and non-

white).

          One issue that comes up in any estimation involving an equation like (2) is the issue of

causality. If treatments are not randomly assigned, estimates of will be biased. We address

this issue in several ways. The most important is to use area-level variation in treatments, rather

than individual-level variation. Whether any individual receives a treatment is dependent on the

physician’s perception of that patient’s underlying health. If the underlying severity of disease is

relatively constant across areas and over time, however, variations in treatment at the area level

will be good markers for exogenous changes in the use of medical care. As is standard in the

literature (O'
             Connor, Quinton et al. 1999; Fisher, Wennberg et al. 2003; Fisher, Wennberg et al.

2003; Stukel, Lucas et al. 2005), we group individuals into areas based on the Hospital Referral

Region (HRR) they live in. HRRs are groups of zip codes where the bulk of patients go to the

same set of hospitals and include at least one hospital with a tertiary cardiovascular or

neurological surgical center. For example, the HRR for Chicago includes zip codes 60601-

60712; within this area, the vast majority of people who are hospitalized get admitted to a

hospital in that region.

          To facilitate interpretation of the results, we center all demographic and HRR-level

covariates. This allows us to interpret the coefficients on the survey year dummy variables as the

change in the log-odds of disability and death relative to being alive and non-disabled for the

average person living in the average area across survey cohorts. We also begin our analyses with

models that include only survey year dummy variables and demographic and health status

covariates. We compare these models to models that include cardiovascular disease medical




                                                  15
treatments to evaluate whether including treatment in the models changes the association

between survey year and the likelihood of death and disability for the average patient.



       Measures of Medical Treatment

       We use several measures of medical care to predict disability. The first variable is the

share of people who receive surgical interventions. To define relevant procedures, we identify

treatments for each specific diagnosis that the medical literature has identified as being

efficacious (generally in reducing mortality) for at least some subsets of patients with that

diagnosis. These procedures are detailed in table 3. For hypertension, there are no generally

accepted surgical therapies. There are one or more therapies for the other conditions, of which

the most common appropriate procedures are “other operations on the heart and blood vessels”

(CPT code 37), which includes PCI (angioplasty), heart replacement procedures and insertion of

pace-makers, and “incision, excision and occlusion of vessels” (CPT code 38), which includes

endarterectomies. CABG procedures for ischemic heart disease patients are coded under CPT

code 36, “Operations on vessels of heart”.

       Table 4 shows the average rate of procedure use over time across hospital referral

regions, for all cardiovascular disease patients and by specific conditions. In the 1984-89 cohort,

the average procedure rate was only 21 percent across regions. The average procedure rate was

highest for other circulatory diseases (30%), followed by ischemic heart disease (23%), stroke

(13%) and heart failure and arrhythmia (11.3%). By 1994-1999, the average procedure rate for

all patients across all regions increased to 34%. The average procedure rate for ischemic heart

disease patients jumped to 48%. Average procedure rates increased to 43% for other circulatory




                                                 16
diseases, 25% for stroke and 14.2% for heart failure and arrhythmia. These increases reflect the

greater belief among physicians about the efficacy of therapy, and advances in the therapy itself.8

        Our other measures of medical technology involve use of pharmaceuticals for patients

with acute myocardial infarction. As noted in the previous section, these pharmaceuticals have

been shown to improve survival, although the overall effect of pharmaceutical treatment on both

improved survival and disability in the elderly has not been well-established. Randomized

studies comparing various treatments for ischemic heart disease on functional status and quality

of life reported improvements for most outcome measures for both medical and surgical

therapies (Rogers, Coggin et al. 1990; Strauss, Fortin et al. 1995; Hlatky, Rogers et al. 1997;

Pocock, Henderson et al. 2000; Borkon, Muehlebach et al. 2002; Pfisterer, Buser et al. 2003). .

However, most of these studies included patients under age 65 who may be more likely to

improve than elderly patients (Rogers, Coggin et al. 1990; Strauss, Fortin et al. 1995; Hlatky,

Rogers et al. 1997; Pocock, Henderson et al. 2000; Borkon, Muehlebach et al. 2002). A recent

trial comparing medical and surgical management of elderly patients with coronary artery

disease reported improved quality of life at one year for both treatment arms (Pfisterer, Buser et

al. 2003), suggesting that treatment likely reduces disability in the elderly population. However,

no studies to date have estimated the effect of increased use of appropriate pharmaceutical

treatments over time on disability rates in the elderly population.

        Pharmaceutical use is not captured in Medicare claims, since Medicare does not pay more

for use of pharmaceuticals. Thus, we do not have time series data on the use of pharmaceuticals

by area. We do have a snapshot of data on pharmaceutical use, taken from a survey of medical

records in the mid-1990s. The cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP) abstracted medical

8
  For example, catheters used in surgery have improved, and stents were developed for use in angioplasty in the mid
1990s.



                                                        17
record data on 186,800 Medicare patients hospitalized for an AMI between February 1994 and

July 1995 including data on appropriateness for and receipt of guideline recommended

treatments (Marciniak, Ellerbeck et al. 1998).

       Use among patients most suited for treatment ranged from 51% for beta-blockers in the

immediate post-myocardial infarction treatment to 76% for aspirin. Average utilization rates for

the mid-1990s are shown in table 4. Researchers at Dartmouth have calculated the average use

rate of each of these pharmaceuticals at the HRR level, which we employ in our analysis

(O'
  Connor, Quinton et al. 1999).

       While not known at the area level, use of these pharmaceuticals did increase during our

study timeframe. Reported use of aspirin for heart attack patients in 1985 and 1995 was 30% and

75%, respectively, and over the same time, use of beta blockers was 48% and 50%,

thrombolytics was 9% and 31%, and ace-inhibitors was 0% and 21%, respectively (Heidenreich

and McClellan 2001). The change in ace-inhibitors use from this study was based only on

changes in the Worcester, Massachusetts area and may not reflect changes in use nationally.

       For patients with heart failure and stroke we employed published data on state-wide use

of evaluation of ejection fraction (heart failure) and use of warfarin for patients with atrial

fibrillation and prescription of antithrombotics at discharge for patients with acute stroke or

transient ischemic attack (stroke) from 2000-2001 (Jencks, Huff et al. 2003).

       The lack of time series data on pharmaceutical use at the area level requires us to make

one change in the analysis. Equation (2) assumes that the procedure has the same effectiveness

over time. Since use of pharmaceuticals increased over time, we would expect that the

coefficient on pharmaceutical use would be greater for the 1994-99 cohort than for the 1984-89




                                                  18
cohort; more patients, after all, would have been treated with the technology. To account for this

phenomenon, we interact each treatment variable with the survey year dummy variables.

       From our models, we estimate the likelihood of being disabled, dead and alive and non-

disabled at follow-up if all respondents lived in HRRs that provided relevant procedures and

pharmaceuticals at the 10th and 90th percentiles of care, holding all other covariates constant. We

develop separate estimations for relevant procedures and pharmaceuticals to better understand

the effect of each treatment type on changes in death and disability over time.



Estimation Results

       Table 5 shows demographic characteristics of our cohort by year of baseline survey. The

proportion of respondents disabled at baseline declined over time, from 32% in 1984 to 25.9% in

1994. This 6 percentage point decline in disability at baseline is consistent with other analyses

using the NLTCS (Manton and Gu 2001). In addition, there was a slight increase in the mean

modified Charlson index score from 0.94 in 1984 to 1.07 in 1994.

       Coefficients and standard errors from our estimation results are shown in tables 6-10 for

models with all cvd patients, ischemic heart disease patients, stroke patients, heart failure

patients and other circulatory disease patients. Each table includes a model with only survey year

and demographic characteristics as well as a model with area-level relevant procedures,

appropriate pharmaceutical use and interactions between year and time-invariant treatment

covariates.



All-CVD




                                                 19
       In the all-cvd models, the average respondent from the 1994 survey was significantly less

likely to be disabled and dead compared to the average respondent to the 1984 survey, when

adjusting for only demographic and health status covariates (Table 6). When we include

treatments covariates, the average respondent living in an area with average treatment rates in the

1994 survey was significantly less likely to experience disability and death at follow-up survey

compared to the average respondent in an average area in 1984, but inclusion of treatment

covariates moderated the associations. In particular, area-level use of treatments explains

approximately 3.5% and 29% of the difference in disability and death outcomes, respectively,

between the 1994 and 1984 cohorts. Relevant procedures were significantly associated with a

decreased likelihood of death (p= 0.044), but not disability (p=0.756), while all AMI treatments

together were significantly associated with disability (p= 0.001) and death (p=0.020).

       Predicted event rates for all cvd patients in areas at the 10th and 90th percentiles are shown

in Figures 5 and 6. For relevant procedures, the probability of death is lower at all time points for

90th percentile areas, and due to increasing rates of procedure use, it decreases faster for the 90th

compared to 10th percentile over time. When examining time invariant AMI treatment variables

together, we find that the probability of disability declined 6 percentage points from 28% in 1984

to 22% in 1994 for the 90th percentile and increased approximately 3 percentage points from

23% to 26% in 10th percentile areas.



Ischemic Heart Disease

       As described in more detail in (Stewart, Landrum et al. 2006), treatment covariates

explain between 50 and 70% of the association between disability and death over time in the




                                                  20
IHD cohort. Relevant procedures were significantly associated with death, but not disability, and

pharmaceutical care was significantly associated with disability but not death.



Stroke

         Stroke patients in 1994 were significantly less likely to experience disability and death

compared to patients in the 1984 survey in the model with only demographic and health status

covariates (Table 7). Including treatment covariates explains approximately 42% and 23% of the

association between 1994 survey year and disability and death, respectively. The coefficient on

1994 survey year for disability is not statistically significant in the model with treatments,

suggesting that in areas with average levels of treatment there were no significant declines in

disability. The coefficient on 1994 survey year for death remains statistically significant,

suggesting that additional factors are important in explaining the decreased probability of death

in 1994 relative to 1984.

         Use of relevant procedures for stroke patients is significantly associated with lower

likelihood of disability (p = 0.010), but not with death (p=0.157). Use of AMI treatments

measured at the HRR-level from the CCP data and increased use of warfarin and anti-

thrombolytics measured at the state level are together significantly associated with death (p =

0.001) but not disability (p=0.175). These results are apparent in predicted outcome rates

displayed in Figures 7 and 8. The predicted probability of disability for stroke patients in 90th

percentile areas of relevant procedures falls from 29% in 1984 to 25% in 1994 (?) and the

probability of disability in 10th percentile areas rises from 33% in 1984 to 36% in 1989 and back

to 33% in 1994 (Figure 7). In areas at the 90th percentile for AMI and stroke treatments, the

probability of death declines from 48% in 1984 to 35% in 1989 and then increases to 40% by




                                                  21
1994 (Figure 8). The trend is opposite in 10th percentile areas, with the probability of death

increasing from 43% in 1984 to 51% by 1989 and then decreasing to 42% by 1994.



Heart Failure and Arrhythmia

       Table 8 shows that the heart failure and arrhythmia patients in 1994 were significantly

less likely to die by follow-up compared to patients in 1984 in the model with only demographic

and health status covariates. Including treatment covariates strengthens the association between

survey year and death, i.e. the average respondent in the average area is even less likely to die in

1994 compared to 1984. Relevant procedures for heart failure and arrhythmia are not associated

with either disability (p = 0.903) or death (p = 0.574). Use of AMI treatments and evaluation of

ejection fraction are significantly associated with disability (p=0.043) but not death (p=0.087).

As expected based on estimation results, there is little difference in the probability of death and

disability between 10th and 90th percentile areas of relevant procedures (Figure 9). In

examination of the AMI and heart failure treatments (Figure 11), the probability of disability is

higher in 90th percentile areas in 1984 and 1989 compared to 10th percentile areas. By 1994, the

probability of disability is much lower in the 90th percentile areas (19%) compared to the 10th

percentile (26%).



Other Circulatory Diseases

       In the model with demographic and health characteristics, circulatory disease patients in

the 1994 survey were significantly less likely to be disabled and dead at follow-up compared to

the 1984 survey (Table 9). When we include treatment covariates, we explain approximately

18% of the association between 1994 survey year and death, and the 1994 survey year coefficient




                                                 22
on death is no longer statistically significant. The 1994 survey year coefficient on disability

becomes more negative with the inclusion of treatment variables, i.e. -0.38 vs. -0.37, and remains

statistically significant. Relevant procedures are not associated with either disability or death in

this model. AMI treatments are associated with disability (p=0.044), but not with death

(p=0.146). Predicted outcomes rates by AMI treatments show that the probability of disability

declines by 13 percentage points in 90th percentile areas from 32% to 19% and increases by 8

percentage points from 25% to 33% in 10th percentile areas (Figure 12).



IV.    Interpreting the Results

       Use of effective treatments contributed to the decline in disability and death among

cardiovascular disease patients. The association between treatment use and reduced disability

and death was strongest in the ischemic heart disease model, explaining over half of the decline

in disability for the 1994 cohort and 65-70% of the decline in mortality for the 1989 and 1994

cohorts. With the exception of the stroke model, use of AMI treatments was significantly

associated with declining disability. In the all-CVD and stroke models, AMI treatments were

significantly associated with reductions in mortality. Increased use of relevant procedures

resulted in lowered disability among stroke patients as well as lowered death in the all-cvd and

ischemic heart disease models.

       Improved medical treatment after an acute cardiovascular event resulted in improved

survival and reductions in disability. It may also affect medical spending. While we cannot do a

complete evaluation of the impact of these changes, we can provide some information. We

begin with the change in quality-adjusted life expectancy. To consider how reductions in

disability in one year translate into long-term changes in quality-adjusted life expectancy, we




                                                 23
estimate regression models for future survival and disability status as a function of disability in a

base year. For a cohort in year t, we estimate linear probability models of the form:



(3)    Pr[Alive in year t+k]i = Xi,t + Disabilityi,t + ei,t



       The coefficient indicates how changes in disability in year t affect long-term health

outcomes. Xi,t is a set of demographic and health status variables. The identifying assumption in

equation (3) is that people who are not disabled because of medical treatment are subsequently

equivalent in their health to those who never had an incident. This may or may not be the case.

If this is not true, and survivors of events are less healthy, conditional on disability status, we

will overstate the benefits of reductions in disability. Thus, one should properly view these

estimates as an upper bound on the impact of medical interventions to reduce disability.

       Figure 13 shows the survival rate by year, conditional on disability status in the base

survey year. We report the results for the 10 years after the survey for the 1989 cohort, and the

five years after the survey for the 1994 cohort due to data limitations on long-term follow-up.

Not surprisingly, survival for the disabled is below that for the non-disabled, by a large margin.

The difference is about 20 percentage points, and remains at that level throughout the decade.

To forecast mortality beyond the 10 year observation window, we assume that the mortality

hazard estimated in 1997-99 prevails in all subsequent years. Making this assumption, we

estimate that those not disabled in 1989 have an average life expectancy of 7.8 years while those

disabled in 1989 were expected to live only another 5.1 years on average (Table 11).

       The above calculation, does not account for the difference in subsequent disability in the

next decade. Table 10 shows the disability rate for the 1989 cohort in the 1994 and 1999




                                                  24
surveys, and the disability rate for the 1994 cohort in 1999. In each case, we condition disability

status on being alive at the end date. Seventy-nine percent of people who were disabled in 1989

and still alive in 1994 were also disabled in 1994, compared to 31 percent of those not disabled

in 1989. This pattern repeats itself in 1999, and is true for the 1994 cohort as well.

        To estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy, we interpolate disability rates between 1989

and 1994, and 1994 and 1999. In each case, we assume that disability rates change at a common

rate each year of the interval. We also extrapolate disability rates after 1999 using the annual

change between 1994 and 1999. As a rough approximation, we assume that 1 year in a disabled

state is equivalent to 0.5 quality-adjusted life years.

        As the second row of table 11 shows, quality-adjusted life expectancy is lower in each

case than is life expectancy, but the difference between the disabled and non-disabled is similar

to the unadjusted estimates. The increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with not

being disabled is 3.7 years.

        The value of this improvement in life expectancy depends on the value of a year of life.

Following a substantial recent literature (Viscusi and Aldy 2003), we assume that a year of life in

good health is worth $100,000 (in 1992 dollars). We also assume that future values are

discounted at a 3 percent real rate of interest. Using these assumptions, we estimate the value of

disability prevention to be $316,000.

        These benefits need to be weighed against the cost of reducing disability. These costs

have two parts. The first is the initial treatment cost that led to the reduction in disability. To

measure these costs, we use data on hospitalization spending for the 1989 cohort in the year after

the CVD admission9. The one year interval is relatively common in studying the acute treatment


9
 By definition all participants in the 1989 cohort had at least one CVD admissions between 1984 and 1989. We
averaged costs across all CVD hospitalizations for respondents with multiple relevant hospitalizations.


                                                      25
for cardiovascular disease (Cutler and McClellan 2001; Skinner, Staiger et al. 2006). The

limitation to hospital costs is because only those data are reliable prior to 1991. We inflated all

costs to a common year of 1992 using the implicit GDP Price Deflator (Economic Report of the

President 1997). We estimate that in the year after the CVD event, hospital spending averages

$8,610 for patients who do not receive relevant procedures and $16,332 for patients receiving

relevant procedures.

       Although treatment costs are approximately twice as high for respondents receiving

appropriate treatments, these costs may be offset by lower yearly spending in subsequent years

among survivors. A previous study of 1982 and 1984 NLTCS respondents found annual per

capita spending by Medicare for respondents without any ADL or IADL limitations was

approximately $3,275, compared to $7,400 for respondents with at least 4 ADL and 5 IADL

impairments and $13,100 for institutionalized respondents. These data suggest that the costs of

intensive medical treatments that prevent or delay disability may be offset by lower annual

average spending among healthier beneficiaries.

       More recent studies using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey found similar

lifetime spending between non-disabled and disabled 70 year olds (Lubitz, Cai et al. 2003), but

life expectancy was approximately 2.7 years longer among the non-disabled (Lubitz, Cai et al.

2003). This provides further evidence that average annual spending may be lower among the

non-disabled relative to the disabled. However, another recent study found spending on the non-

disabled is growing faster than spending on the disabled (Chernew, Goldman et al. 2005).

Whether increased spending on intensive medical care treatments, such as those for

cardiovascular disease, continues to increase life expectancy and reduce average annual yearly

spending among the non-disabled relative to the disabled will require further investigation.




                                                 26
V.     Conclusions

       Examining disability associated with cardiovascular disease leads to several important

results. Reduced disability associated with cardiovascular disease accounts for a significant part

of the total reduction in disability – between 19 and 22 percent. The evidence suggests that

improvements in medical care, including both increased use of relevant procedures and

pharmaceuticals, led to a significant part of this decline. Areas with higher use experienced

substantial reductions in mortality and disability.

       While precise data on the implications of reduced disability are lacking, the possible

impact of disability reductions is staggering. We estimate that preventing disability after an

acute event can add as much as 3.7 years of quality-adjusted life expectancy, or perhaps

$316,000 of value. The cost of this change is much smaller. The initial treatment costs range

from $8,610 to $16,332, depending on procedure use. Further, recent cost analyses reported that

annual Medicare spending was lower for the non-disabled compared to the disabled, which

suggests that higher treatment costs may be offset by lower future spending among a more

healthy population. By virtually any measure, therefore, medical technology after acute

cardiovascular episodes is worth the cost.

       The major issue raised by our results is whether these conclusions extend to other

conditions. Disability reductions are complex, and will certainly involve medical as well as non-

medical factors. Sorting these out for other conditions is a high priority for future research.

*Models also adjust for age and sex interactions, marital status, race (white vs. other), Charlson co-morbidity score,
and hospitalizations for stroke, hypertension, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and circulatory diseases.
**All treatment and demographic covariates were centered at their means. As a result, the coefficients on the year
covariates in Models 1 (and 2) can be interpreted as the change in outcome for an average person (in an average
area).
