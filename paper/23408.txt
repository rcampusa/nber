Male Earnings, Marriageable Men, and Nonmarital Fertility: Evidence from the Fracking
Boom

                                          ABSTRACT

There has been a well-documented retreat from marriage among less educated individuals in the
U.S. and non-marital childbearing has become the norm among young mothers and mothers with
low levels of education. One hypothesis is that the declining economic position of men in these
populations is at least partially responsible for these trends. That leads to the reverse hypothesis
that an increase in potential earnings of less-educated men would correspondingly lead to an
increase in marriage and a reduction in non-marital births. To investigate this possibility, we
empirically exploit the positive economic shock associated with localized “fracking booms”
throughout the U.S. in recent decades. We confirm that these localized fracking booms led to
increased wages for non-college-educated men. A reduced form analysis reveals that in response
to local-area fracking production, both marital and non-marital births increase and there is no
evidence of an increase in marriage rates. The pattern of results is consistent with positive income
effects on births, but no associated increase in marriage. We compare our findings to the family
formation response to the Appalachian coal boom experience of the 1970s and 1980s, when it
appears that marital births and marriage rates increased, but non-marital births did not. This
contrast potentially suggests important interactions between economic forces and social context.

I. INTRODUCTION

        There is widespread interest among social scientists and policy observers in the declining

rates of marriage among less-educated individuals and the concomitant rise in non-marital

childbearing. In 2014, over 40 percent of all births in the U.S. were to an unmarried mother, with

an even higher rate of 62 percent among non-college educated mothers.1 A leading conjecture as

to why so many less-educated women are choosing motherhood without marriage points to the

weak economic prospects of their male partners. The idea is that changing labor market

structures and economic conditions have adversely affected the economic prospects of less

educated men, making them less “marriageable” from the perspective of the women with whom

they sexually partner. This concept was first posited in the seminal work of Wilson and

Neckerman (1986) and Wilson (1987) who were writing about the rise in non-marital

childbearing among African American women in urban settings. But the rise in non-marital

childbearing is now much more widespread, reflecting a dramatic, steady shift over the past 50

years, and it is no longer a distinctly urban or minority experience.

        Though conceptually compelling and generally consistent with empirical patterns, there

is scant empirical evidence about the causal link between male economic status and rates of

marriage or non-marital childbearing. It is very difficult to empirically isolate the causal

relationship of interest because high earning men might be more likely to marry for other

reasons, and places with better male economic opportunities might also be places where more

marriage- or family-inclined individuals choose to live for other reasons. A recent working paper

by Autor, Dorn, and Hansen (2017) provides a notable exception. Exploiting trade shocks during

the period 1990 to 2010, the authors find that a decline in male employment opportunities driven

by import shocks leads to a decline in births, a decline in marriage, a rise in births to teen

mothers, and an increase in the number of children being raised in single-mother families.2

        We attempt to shed additional light on the causal relationship between improved labor

market opportunities for less educated men and subsequent fertility and marriage outcomes using

the “fracking boom” as a source of improved wage prospects for less educated men. We

investigate a reverse marriageable men hypothesis, asking if an improvement in the economic

position of men associated with local fracking production leads to a positive effect on marriage

and a corresponding decrease in non-marital birth rates. The notion underlying this empirical

approach is that fracking production occurred in some areas and not others due to pre-existing

geological factors that but for the fracking boom, would not otherwise have had a determinant

effect on subsequent marriage and birth trends.

        Our empirical analysis examines the relationship between annual local-area fracking

production between 1997 and 2012 and family formation outcomes among 18 to 34 year olds.

Our baseline models define a local area as a Census Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) and

econometrically control for fixed PUMA effects, state by year effects, and a set of time-varying

PUMA level characteristics. We use a continuous measure of simulated fracking production

from new wells (described in detail below) at the PUMA/year level as our measure of the extent




2
  Earlier work offered some corroborating support for the notion. For example, work by Charles and Luoh (2010)
finds that increased rates of male incarceration due to policy shifts led to decreased rates of marriage in affected
marriage markets. McLanahan and Watson (2011) document that for a given earnings level, men who are lower
ranked among their peers are less likely to be married, perhaps because they view themselves as less “marriageable”.
Kearney and Levine (2014) find that conditional on becoming pregnant, low-socioeconomic status young women
are less likely to marry before having the baby if they live in a place with a greater level of income inequality,
consistent with a story of them being less likely to find their (presumably low-SES) male partners to be desirable
marriage partners. Cherlin et. al (2016) finds that part of that documented relationship appears to be due to fewer
middle-skill male jobs in more unequal places. The ethnographic work of Edin and Kafalas (2011) suggests that
among their sample of interviewed single mothers, an important factor in their decision not to marry the child’s
father relates to a perceived lack of economic security that he would bring to the family.
                                                                                                 4


of the localized boom. In the years we study, 611 PUMA in the United States – out of a total of

2,057–had positive fracking production from new wells.

       A key element to the strategy of using this context to advance our understanding about

the link between improved male economic opportunity and family formation is that the localized

fracking boom had a first order effect on the earning potential of less-educated males. We begin

by documenting this relationship. We then conduct a reduced form analysis documenting the

relationship between PUMA/year level simulated new fracking production and birth and

marriage outcomes. This analysis does not indicate a shift toward marriage in response to an

increase in the potential wages of less-educated men associated with localized fracking booms.

But, both marital and non-marital births increase significantly. This is consistent with the notion

that children are “normal goods,” offering further support for Becker’s (1960) observation and

confirmation of what previous empirical papers have found (e.g., Black et al, 2013; Dettling and

Kearney, 2014; Lindo, 2010; Lovenheim and Mumford, 2013). We confirm that the results do

not appear to be driven by two potential confounding factors: the sex composition (male/female

ratio) and house prices.

       For the sake of comparison, we revisit the family formation response to the Appalachian

coal boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s, building on the work of Black, Kolesnikova,

Sanders, and Taylor (2013). The data indicate that the increased earnings associated with the coal

boom during those earlier decades led to an increase in marriage rates, an increase in the marital

birth rate, and a decrease in the non-marital birth rate. This contrast in findings between periods

might suggest that as non-marital births have become increasingly common, individuals are more

likely to respond to increased income with increased fertility, whether or not they are married,

and not necessarily with an increased likelihood of marriage. We conclude by speculating that
                                                                                                5


social norms play an important role in determining the response of family formation outcomes to

economic conditions.

II. BACKGROUND ON FRACKING

       The exogenous economic shock of fracking production underlying our empirical

approach arises from the technological advancements over time in the mining of shale gas and

tight oil, combined with predetermined geological differences across place in fracking potential.

For thousands of years, shale plays have trapped deposits of natural gas and oil far below the

surface of the earth. It wasn’t until the mid-2000’s that the technology behind hydraulic

fracturing and horizontal drilling made extraction of oil and natural gas from these shale plays

economically profitable, resulting in an explosion of growth and well drilling starting around

between 2004 and 2007. The geographic variation in fracking potential is dependent on the

predetermined location of shale plays and fuel deposits that took shape thousands of years ago.

As these deposits had no economic value and were relatively unknown for many years,

communities and economies grew and developed largely independent of shale play location.

       Hydraulic fracturing (also fracing, fracking, hydrofracturing or hydrofracking) is a well-

stimulation technique in which the rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid. The process involves

the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water, containing sand or other

thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations that will release

natural gas, petroleum or brine. This technology has been in use since the 1950s, but

experimentation with the fracking fluid formulation in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to

cheaper, more cost effective applications that were capable of splitting shale rock and releasing

the oil and gas reserves (Gold, 2014). Because shale plays trap oil and gas at a molecular level

(rather than in a pool or pocket) conventional vertical drilling to extract resources from shale
                                                                                                                   6


plays was not economical. Horizontal drilling was first introduced in the 1980s, allowing wells to

be drilled at an angle following layers of fuel deposits, rather than vertically pass through the

deposits.

        Together these two technologies made oil and gas extraction from shale plays both

feasible and economical, resulting in a flurry of drilling and production, and the widely

publicized (in both good and bad terms) “fracking boom”. In the popular press this boom has

been touted as creating tens of thousands of jobs and providing starting salaries at $50,000 for

recent high school graduates, with average earnings in oil and gas between $70,000 and

$80,000.3

Recent papers on the economic impacts of fracking

        There are a number of recent papers and working papers investigating the impact of

fracking on wages and employment. Freyer, Mansur, and Sacerdote (2017) show that wage gains

not only accrue in oil and gas extraction industries and the counties where wells are located, but

in other industries and neighboring counties as well. Their estimates imply that every million

dollars of new oil and gas extracted produces $80,000 in wage income, $132,000 in royalty

payments and business income, and 0.85 jobs within the county in the year production occurs.

They find that total economic impacts in the region are three times larger than the county-

specific estimates. They also document that the impacts of new production on wages are

persistent, with 2/3 of the wage income increase persisting two years after the initial shock.

Working papers by

Allcot and Keniston (2014), Eliason & Timmins (2014), Fetzer (2014), and Maniloff and

Mastromanaco (2014) also reveal large wage gains associated with fracking, on the order of 5 to

24 percent. A working paper by Cascio and Narayan (2015) suggests that by increasing the

wages of less educated men, fracking has led to an increased propensity among high school age

males to drop out of school.

       Wilson (2016) examines the migration response to the higher wages brought about by the

fracking boom. His paper finds a substantial wage migration response in North Dakota, but much

smaller migration elasticities in other states involved in fracking in the West, South Central, and

Rust Belt. Migration increased the population of fracking counties in North Dakota by 12-25

percent, but by less than one percent in fracking counties in other states. His paper explores

potential explanations for the difference. Given the large migration response to the Bakken

region, we exclude North Dakota and Montana from our analysis and focus on states that where

the changes in the population composition was minimal.

       There are also a few papers looking at outcomes other than labor market related

outcomes. Muehlenbachs, Spiller, & Timmins (2015) estimate hedonic models of property value

impacts of shale gas development in Pennsylvania and New York. They find that there are

negative impacts on the property valuation of groundwater-dependent homes close to wells, but

small positive impacts for piped-water dependent homes, which they interpret as consistent with

benefits from lease payments. Using data from a fracking county in Pennsylvania,

Gopalakrishnan & Klaiber (2014) also document heterogeneous impacts of shale gas exploration

activity on property values, with a modest reduction in property values for houses within one

mile of a shale well. A recent working paper by Bartik, Currie, Greenstone, and Knittel (2017)

estimates that households’ willingness to pay for allowing fracking ranges from $1,300 to $1,900

per household annually, reflecting a positive net valuation of improved economic conditions over
                                                                                                8


amenity losses (e.g., increased crime and noise.) The current paper fits into this new, innovative

line of research examining the economic and social consequences of the fracking boom.


III. EMPIRICAL APPROACH


       We exploit cross-sectional, time-series variation in PUMA-level fracking production to

estimate a causal relationship between local economic shocks and subsequent family formation

outcomes among less-educated individuals. As described above, prior to the technological

innovations of the early 2000s, the oil and gas deposits extracted from shale plays through

fracking were previously unattainable and had no existing economic value. The sudden shock to

local economies when fracking came to their area led to increased labor demand, putting upward

pressure on wages, including the wages of less educated individuals. We thus use the fracking

boom of the late 2000’s as an exogenous positive shock to the potential wages of less-educated

men living in counties that cover a shale play. This gives us an opportunity to estimate a causal

relationship between a local economic shock and family formation decisions, and under certain

assumptions, interpret this as a response to an increase in male earnings.

       Following Feyrer et al. (2017) we capture the extent of the fracking boom in county c by

assigning to that county a share of shale play j’s production, based on the existence of

geographic overlap and information about actual oil and gas production measured in dollar

terms. (We subsequently map counties to PUMAs.) The data on well location and production

was provided from a private company DrillingInfo through a special use agreement, as described

in Section IV below.      Because actual production might be correlated with unobservable

characteristics related to economic and demographic conditions, we simulate production using

only geographic variation in county exposure to a shale play interacted with year effects. The
                                                                                                9


year interaction serves to adjust production amounts for time-varying changes in relevant prices

and technology. We estimate equation [1] for all counties over shale plays, and then take the

exponential of the predicted value.




                                                                                               [1]




The main explanatory variables are a set of interactions between an indicator that equals one if

county c intersects shale play j (measured using ArcGIS software, as described below) and an

indicator that equals one in year y. This estimates the average impact of being in shale play j on

new production and allows this relationship to vary over time, as technology and prices change.

The variable new productioncy is the dollar value of oil and gas production from wells drilled in

the current year located in county c. This simulated measure is then aggregated up from the

county/year level to the PUMA/year level. The observed correlation between actual new

production and simulated new production is p=.69, suggesting that geological constraints and

temporal variation play an important role in determining production intensity. To better capture

the intensity of treatment on population outcomes, we divide our measure of simulated new

production by the baseline population in 2000, and scale the measure to represent simulated new

production per capita, in thousands of dollars.

       We conduct our analysis at the PUMA-level rather than the county-level for several

reasons. First, public-use Census data on annual level marriage outcomes are not available at

areas smaller than the PUMA. Second, PUMA are constructed to encompass geographic areas

that will maintain a total population over 100,000 between 2000 and 2010. By conducting our
                                                                                               10


analysis at the PUMA-level, we thus avoid comparing sparsely populated counties to more

populous counties. We also avoid the issue of having observation cells with zero or close to zero

marital or non-marital births in any given year. Finally, previous work has suggested that the

labor market impacts of fracking propagate beyond county borders, and this is especially true

among less populated counties. PUMA-level analysis captures these cross-county spillovers.

       To begin our analysis, we first estimate “first stage” effects of simulated new production

on the wages of men and women, separately by gender and education. Our baseline specification

is not a two-stage least squares model (2SLS) because of concerns about the exclusion restriction

(as we describe below), so this is not formally a first-stage model in a 2SLS estimation. The

model is described by the following equation:


                                                                                              [2]


The subscript p refers to PUMA and y refers to calendar year. The matrix      is a vector of time-

varying PUMA-level controls which includes the ratio of 18 to 34 year old females to males, the

log average house price, gender specific shares of 18 to 34 year olds Non-Hispanic black,

Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic other, and gender specific shares of 18 to 34 year olds with less than

high school, some college, or a four year college degree. Age specific sex ratios and race by

gender shares are calculated from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program

(SEER) population data, which are derived from the U.S. Census population estimates. The

housing price data is obtained from the Federal Housing Finance Agency three digit zip code

housing price index, which we then link to counties and PUMA and convert to dollars using the

median house value from the 2000 Census. We aggregate up the county level estimates from the

2000 Census and the ACS to calculate PUMA-level age specific gender by education shares.
                                                                                                                           11


          The model also includes controls for time-invariant PUMA effects                             and state-specific

year effects,        , to account for fixed differences across PUMA and time trends or shocks in

wage outcomes experienced at the state level.4 As described below, the data show a strong

positive relationship between simulated fracking production and the wages of men, and

especially non-college educated men, in the PUMA. We are not literally estimating this as a first

stage relationship because our main analysis is a reduced form analysis. This is an important

motivating equation, however, showing that the fracking boom had a first order effect on male

wages.

          Figure 1 presents a map showing where shale plays are located and plots the total

production value from new wells per capita between 2000 and 2012, in bins, by county.

Production values were uniformly high in North Dakota. Of the 16 counties in North Dakota

with any new production, seven produced over one hundred thousand dollars per capita from

new wells between 2000 and 2012, with an average of $244 thousand per capita over the entire

period. This massive amount of production is due to the large oil reserves in the Bakken shale

play. The other locations with the highest levels of simulated production – over twenty five

thousand dollars per capita between 2000 and 2012 – include counties in Arkansas, Colorado,

Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. As

noted above, we exclude North Dakota and Montana from our analysis. With that exclusion in

place, there are 88 PUMA with total simulated new production above $25 thousand per capita,

and an additional 516 with positive total simulated new production below $25 thousand per

capita.

  We do not include PUMA-specific trends in the model because these will (over)control for the response to the
shock, an econometric point discussed by Wolfers (2006). When we do estimate the models with PUMA-specific
trends included, there is still a statistically significant increase in marital birth rates, albeit the point estimate is much
smaller, and there is no longer a discernible increase in the non-marital birth rate. There is still no discernible change
in marriage related outcomes.
                                                                                                12


       We then estimate the reduced-form relationship between simulated fracking production

from new wells and subsequent birth and marriage outcomes:




                                                                                  [3]

The key outcome variables of interest (   ) are defined at the level of a PUMA p and year y. We

separately examine the non-marital birth share, total births, married births, and non-marital

births. The year is the year of conception. We then consider a set of marriage related outcomes.

Simulated new productionpy is measured in thousands of dollars per capita. The matrix        is the

same vector of time-varying PUMA-level controls included in equation [2]. Again, the model

also includes controls for time-invariant PUMA effects     and state-specific year effects     , to

account for fixed differences across PUMA and time trends or shocks in birth and marriage

outcomes experienced at the state level. Estimation of equation [3] yields estimates of the

reduced-form impact of simulated fracking production on birth and marriage outcomes.

       We are ultimately interested in identifying the effect of potential male earnings – an

indicator of the “marriageability” of men, in the conceptual framework of Wilson (1987) –

on family formation outcomes. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation of the relationship

between family formation outcomes and male earnings would likely yield a biased estimate of

the causal parameter of interest as there are almost certainly unobserved changes across time

within a county that affect both male wages and family formation outcomes. That is why we

instead attempt to gain insight from the reduced form effect of a localized economic shock that

increased the potential wages of men without a college degree.

       For this reduced form approach to be informative about the relationship between male

economic prospects and family formation outcomes, it must be true that simulated fracking
                                                                                                   13


production only, or at least primarily, affects subsequent trends in birth and marriage outcomes

through its effect on male economic prospects, as captured by measured wages. This condition

might not be satisfied if the fracking induced by the existence of shale play affected other factors

that might affect family formation, such as house prices. (Kearney and Dettling (2014) and

Lovenheim and Mumford (2013) have documented a relationship between house prices and birth

rates.) For this reason, our model includes house prices directly as a control variable. If the

estimated reduced form relationship changes with the inclusion of this variable, it would indicate

that such variables are potentially driving part of the observed relationship between the local

fracking boom and subsequent family formation outcomes. As it turns out, the data do not

indicate that to be the case.

        Under strong assumptions, we can use simulated fracking production as an instrument for

male wages, and then relate predicted wages to birth and marriage outcomes. Two potential

confounders that we worry about are an increase in female wages and an increase in unearned

income from land leases and royalties from mineral rights. Nonetheless, for the sake of

comparison to existing studies, in particular Black et al. (2013), and to gauge what the implied

responsiveness would be if all of the effect on family formation came through the channel of

male earnings, we report the results of such an IV analysis below.

IV. DATA

        This analysis requires detailed information on local level fracking production, wages, and

birth and marriage outcomes. In this section we provide an overview of the various data sources

we draw upon for our analysis. More detailed information is available in the Data Appendix.

Data on fracking production
                                                                                                               14


        To construct PUMA level measures of fracking production, we overlay shale play

boundary shapefiles from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) onto U.S. Census

Bureau county boundary shapefiles. ArcGIS software is used to if counties and shale play

intersect.5 These geographic measures are then combined with well level quarterly oil and gas

production data obtained through a restricted access agreement with DrillingInfo, a private firm

that collects lease, permit, and production data on all wells drilled in the United States.6 Relevant

to our data needs, the DrillingInfo data file indicates drill date, quarterly production amount,

reservoir name, drilling direction (vertical or non-vertical), and latitude and longitude, which

allows us to identify the county location of the well. Oil and gas production is reported in barrels

and thousands of cubic feet respectively. We use average annual national prices for oil and gas,

recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), to convert production amounts into

dollar amounts. We then use the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index

calculated by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis to adjust all dollar amounts to year

2010 dollars. Actual production values as well as simulated production described above are then

aggregated up to the PUMA-level using county to PUMA mappings from the U.S. Census. In

large urban counties that contain multiple PUMA, production values are assigned according to

the population share.

Data on wages

        We use the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) as our primary source of wage data.

The QWI is aggregated from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) micro-

level data collected from unemployment insurance earnings data from participating states and

several other sources (U.S. Census, 2014). The QWI is aggregated to the county level, and can

be tabulated by firm characteristics (industry, size) or worker characteristics (gender, age,

education). When tabulating by worker characteristics, only two levels of tabulation are feasible:

gender by age or gender by education. Because the QWI is constructed from firm employment,

all measures are constructed for jobs, not individual people. Ideally we would have a measure of

potential wages to test the hypothesis that an improvement in male economic prospects

positively affect marriage rates and negatively affect non-marital birth rates. What we observe in

the data – e.g., job-level quarterly wages for jobs held by men or women with various levels of

education – is an imperfect proxy for potential wages of a particular group.7 As with the

production data, the wage data is aggregated up to the PUMA-level by summing total wage

earnings for a given group across all counties in the PUMA and dividing by the total number of

jobs for that same group.

Data on birth outcomes

        We use restricted access Vital Statistics data obtained from the National Center of Health

Statistics to construct PUMA level measures of birth outcomes. These files provide the universe

of births between 1997 and 2013 with county identifiers, which we then aggregate to the PUMA-

level. We date births back to the time of conception by subtracting the length of gestation from

the fifteenth of the month of birth. We do this to consider the time the pregnancy decision was

made, or more accurately said, the time the decision was made to contracept or not. Our analysis

sample thus consists of live births that were conceived between 1997 and 2012. For most of our


7
  It is conceptually appealing to use a measure of potential wages to test the hypothesis that male economic
prospects are a key driver of marriage and birth decisions. An alternative measure would be actual earnings, which
would account for employment, hours, and wages. This data could be obtained from the American Community
Survey (ACS), but public-use data from the ACS does not include information on geographic units smaller than a
Public Use Micro Area (PUMA), which rules out a county-level analysis. For the sake of exploration, we have
experimented with a commuting zone level analysis using ACS data on actual earnings; the results are generally in
line with what we find in our county level analyses, but less precise.
                                                                                                   16


analysis we focus on births to women, ages 18 to 34. During our period of analysis over 71

percent of these births were to single women, consistent with the general finding that births to

young women are births to less-educated women. To construct age specific birth rates, we divide

the number of births by the number of 18-34 year old women in each county from the SEER

gender by age population estimates. We then multiply this by 1000 to be interpreted as birth per

1000 women.

       Given our interest in the labor market opportunities and family formation decisions of

low-income, less-educated men and women, we would ideally examine births to non-college

women specifically. Our baseline analysis focuses on total births to 18 to 34 year old women

largely for data reasons. The non-reporting of maternal education in some state/year cells is a

well-known issue with using the natality files for group-level analyses. The NCHS began

requiring states to report maternal education according to a 2003 classification starting in 2009.

For the 20 states that did not comply with this requirement, maternal education is not recorded in

2009. Starting in 2010, some of these states’ education measures were included again. To limit

our sample to states with consistent reporting of maternal education severely limits the sample.

We thus do not limit the sample by education level in our main sets of analysis, but in a

subsequent analysis we examine birth and marriage outcomes for women separately by education

group for the restricted sample.

PUMA level data on marriage outcomes

       We use the 2000 Decennial Census and 2005-2011 American Community Survey (ACS)

microdata to construct the PUMA-level share of 18 to 34 year old women who are never

married, married, divorced, and cohabitating (Ruggles, 2015). Recently, many partners that do

not marry still cohabitate, which is imperfectly captured in the Census and ACS. To measure
                                                                                                          17


cohabitation we expand the method use previously and count women 18-34 as cohabitating if

they are either the head of the house and an unmarried partner is present, or if they are listed as

an unmarried partern (Shenav, 2016). The 2005-2011 ACS also includes an indicator that equals

one if the individual was married in the last year, which allows us to measure PUMA-level

marriage rates

Analysis sample construction

        Our analysis is estimated at the level of PUMA by year. There are 2,057 total PUMA in

the lower 48 states (as compared to 3,109 counties). Two sample restrictions reduce our sample

to 2,044 PUMA. First, given the unique context of fracking in the Bakken region, in particular

the migration response documented in Wilson (2016), we exclude the 12 PUMA in North Dakota

and Montana. Second, we exclude the PUMA with the highest level of simulated new

production, which corresponds to Webb County, TX. Simulated production in this PUMA was

over 125 percent larger than the second highest producing PUMA, and it is excluded to limit the

influence of outliers.

        The final sample consists of a balanced panel of 2,044 PUMA observed over the 16 years

from 1997 to 2012.8 PUMA in our analysis sample with any simulated new production are

located in the following 26 states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,

Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey,

New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia,

West Virginia, and Wyoming. Eight of these states (Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,

Maryland, Missouri, NJ, and Tennessee) do not have any actual fracking production, but wind up

with predicted fracking production because they have land that overlaps with a shale play. For

 When looking at marriage outcomes from the Census and ACS, we use PUMA-level measures created from the
2000 Census and 2005-2011 ACS.

the PUMA with positive simulated fracking that are in states with no actual production (,

simulated production is less than $30 per capita. Recall that our simulation method is intended to

create a measure that is a function of geological attributes, not choice variables like local

ordinances.

Summary Statistics

        In Table 1 we present mean values from the year 2000 (before the fracking boom) for our

birth and marriage outcomes, labor market characteristics, and several population characteristics

for both non-fracking and fracking PUMA, where a fracking PUMA is defined as a PUMA with

positive simulated production at any point between 2000 and 2012. The statistics reported in this

table indicate that the fracking counties in our sample are not substantively different from other

counties in the country along the dimensions on which this paper is focused. In particular, pre-

boom birth rates and non-marital birth shares are quite similar across county groups. The non-

marital birth share in 2000 for women age 18 to 34 was 34.2 percent in non-fracking PUMA and

33.4 percent in fracking PUMA. Marriage outcomes are also similar across non-fracking and

fracking PUMA at baseline, although women age 18 to 34 in fracking PUMA are slightly more

likely to have been married at some point in time (1.1 percent less likely to be never married,

one percent more likely to be married, 0.3 percent more likely to be divorced). The share of

women age 18 to 34 married was 37.6 percent in non-fracking PUMA and 38.6 percent in

fracking PUMA. Overall, labor markets and population characteristics were similar between

non-fracking and fracking PUMA, though fracking PUMA had a lower share of college educated

individuals (18.0 versus 15.5 among men and 21.5 versus 18.4 among women, with both

differences being statistically significant.)
                                                                                                          19


        The number of PUMA with active wells increased dramatically over the sample period.

The count of PUMA in our analysis sample with active fracking wells in a given year rises from

331 in 2004 to 581 in 2012. Summary statistics about fracking production are reported in

Appendix Table A1. Fracking production is highly skewed across fracking PUMA. For instance,

in the year 2012 (the end of our sample period), annual simulated new production for the median

fracking PUMA is three dollars per capita; but the PUMA at the 90th percentile of the production

distribution has simulated production of 71 dollars per capita. Annual simulated new production

among the top 10 percent of producing PUMA averaged between 500 and 600 dollars per capita.


IV. RESULTS
    A. Effect of localized fracking boom on labor market outcomes
        We begin our empirical analysis by verifying that local fracking activity led to an

increase in potential earnings for non-college educated men. Table 2 reports the results of the

estimation of OLS equation [2], specifying log average earnings in a PUMA/year cell (from the

QWI files) as a function of PUMA/year simulated fracking production. There are 29,471

PUMA/year cell observations in this regression, coming from 45 states.9 The coefficient of

interest in column (1) indicates that an additional thousand dollars of simulated new production

per capita is associated with a statistically significant 3.8 percent increase in average earnings for

men. If we separately look at earnings by educational attainment we see that this increase is

concentrated among non-college men, where an additional thousand dollars of simulated new

production per capita is associated with a statistically significant 4.4 percent increase in average

earnings.




9
 Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Massachusetts are excluded. During this period
earnings data from South Dakota and Massachusetts was not available through the QWI.
                                                                                                   20


       The increase in earnings is not limited to oil and gas extraction jobs. Column 2 reports

that one thousand dollars per capita of fracking production is associated with a 2.6 percent

increase in average earnings for men in jobs outside those industries, with impacts slightly larger

for non-college men (2.9 percent). This is consistent with positive spillover effects on other

earning opportunities. That is, the fracking boom leading to a localized economic boom that

extends beyond the new fracking jobs created. This finding is consistent with the findings of

Feyrer et. al (2017). In column (3) we see that fracking production is also associated with an

increase in the jobs to population ratio. Specifically, one thousand dollars per capita of fracking

production is associated with a 5.2 percent increase in the number of jobs (standard error 0.2).

This increase in jobs was experienced by both non-college and college educated men. Columns

(4), (5), and (6) report analogous results for regressions estimated for women. In earnings

specifications, the data indicate similar signed effects, with roughly half the estimated magnitude

as for men. However, non-college women do not observe an increase in jobs and college

educated women actually observe a small decrease in average earnings. This will be important to

keep in mind when we return to interpreting the results below.

   B. Effect of localized fracking boom on birth and marriage outcomes

       Having established that local fracking production has a positive effect on the economic

prospects of non-college educated men, as captured by earnings and jobs, we turn to an

estimation of the reduced form relationship between simulated fracking production and birth and

marriage outcomes. We start by looking at the impact on the non-marital birth share, defined as

the share of births that are born to an unmarried mother. A reduction in the non-marital birth

share would be consistent with a reverse marriageable male hypothesis, suggesting that a

localized economic shock that raises male earnings is associated with a decrease in the non-
                                                                                                       21


marital birth share. However, to interpret this reduction as a response along those lines, it is

necessary to consider what happened to total births and to marriage rates. If the number of total

births remained constant, then a reduction in the non-marital birth share would reflect a shifting

from non-married births to married births, driven by an increase on the extensive margin of

marriage. As shown in Table 3, this is not what the data reveal.

         Table 3 column (1) indicates that an additional thousand dollars of simulated fracking

production per capita leads to a statistically insignificant 0.11 percentage point decrease in the

non-marital birth share. The result in column (2) indicates that a localized fracking boom leads to

an increase in total births. The point estimate implies that one thousand dollar of fracking

production per capita is associated with an increase of 5.96 births per 1000 women (standard

error of 0.96). In the peak years of the boom, simulated production per capita in the most

intensive fracking counties was between $500-$600 per capita, which would suggest that total

births increased by 3-3.6 births per 1000 women, or around three percent. This is consistent with

a positive income effect of income on fertility, as has been found in previous work (for example,

Black et al, 2013; Dettling and Kearney, 2014; Lindo, 2010).

         Results reported in Table 3 columns (3) and (4) show that both marital and non-marital

births increased. The point estimates imply a greater proportional increase in marital births, but

the estimated effects are not statistically different. The estimated coefficients are, respectively,

3.57 (standard error of 1.0) and 2.39 (standard error of 0.6). Though this is a reduced form result

and not a direct measure of the elasticity of fertility with respect to income, we know of no

previous work directly comparing marital and non-marital birth responses to the same economic

shock.
                                                                                                    22


       In Appendix Table A2 we explore the robustness of the estimated birth effects. The

response of both marital and non-marital birth rates is robust to excluding house prices and the

sex ratio in the regression model (column 2). It is also robust to estimating the model unweighted

(column 3), including year fixed effects rather than state by year (column 4), including shale play

by year fixed effects rather than state by year (column 5), and defining the outcome as the natural

log of birth rates (column 6).

       We also investigate heterogeneous effects by demographic groups. The results are

reported in Appendix Table A3. Column (1) considers older women, and the results do indicate

that for women ages 35-44, there is an increase in the marital birth rate and a decrease in the non-

marital birth rate. The point estimates in columns (2) through (5) imply that the main effects are

being driven by non-Hispanic whites. There is a sizable increase in both the marital and non-

marital birth rate for non-Hispanic whites, whereas for other race/ethnic groups the effects are

not statistically different from zero. But, for those groups, the birth effects are imprecisely

measured and racial/ethnic differences cannot be confirmed. The final two columns in the table

show that for both the marital and non-marital birth rate, there is an increase in both first and

higher-parity births.

       The pattern of results is consistent with a positive income effect on fertility for both

married and unmarried couples, but no obviously with a reverse marriageable men hypothesis.

To gain more insight into this, we look directly at marriage outcomes. Table 4 reports the results

from estimating equation [3] with the dependent variable defined as the percent of women 18 to

34 who are never married, married, divorced, cohabitating, or newly married (married in the last

year). The data give no indication that the economic activity associated with fracking production

led to a reduction in the percent never married (column 1) or an increase in the percent married
                                                                                                           23


(column 2) or newly married (column 3). Nor does the data give any indication that divorce fell

(column 4). In fact, although the point estimates are small and not statistically different from

zero, they are all of the opposite sign of what the reverse marriageable men hypothesis would

predict; the direction of the point estimates suggest that the share married and newly married fell

and the share never married and divorced rose. 10 Given the rising secular trend in cohabitation,

we also test to see if the share of women cohabitating rises with simulated production. We find

no evidence of such an effect (column 5).11

        We next consider whether the effect of the localized economic shock on fertility and

marriage outcomes varies by social context. In particular, we investigate whether the estimated

effects vary with the baseline non-marital birth share. If a higher rate of non-marital births is

associated with a more accepting social norm than in places where non-married births are less

common, we might expect to see a larger increase in non-marital births in response to the




10 A positive effect on non-marriage and divorce in this context is inconsistent with a reverse
marriageable men hypothesis, and also inconsistent with the predictions of a bargaining model based on
relative wages. The standard model of marriage in the economics literature posits that as female wages
rise relative to male wages, there will be a reduction in marriage, because the returns to marriage are
lower (Becker, 1974). Furthermore, there will be an increase in divorce because the female outside option
has increased (Browning et al, 1994). Shenhav (2016) provides empirical support for this prediction for
the time period 1980 and 2010. Exploiting demand shifts in industry/occupation employment cells as an
exogenous shock to sex-specific wages, she finds that increases in the relative wage of women led to a
decline in the likelihood of marriage for those on the margin of a first marriage. But, here we see that a
local economic shock that had the effect of decreasing the female/male wage ratio potentially led to an
increase in non-marriage and divorce, the opposite of what the bargaining model would predict. A
positive point estimate on divorce is consistent with prior evidence of the pro-cyclicality of divorce (e.g.,
Hellerstein and Morrill, 2011; Amato and Beattie, 2011; and Schaller, 2013).
11
   As another check on specification, we consider whether the results are sensitive to using the simulated
production measure versus actual production. The results of using actual production are reported in
Appendix Table A4. The table shows that the pattern of results are similar to our baseline findings: there
is a significant increase in marital and non-marital birth rates with no significant impacts on marriage.
But, the magnitude of the point estimates is greatly attenuated because the simulated measure is much
lower than actual production; an additional one thousand dollars of simulated new production per capita is
associated with a five thousand dollar per capita increase in actual production.
                                                                                                         24


positive economic shock associated with fracking in places with higher baseline non-marital

birth shares. As reported in Table 5, the data is consistent with this prediction.

        In Table 5, we report the results of estimating equation [3] separately for counties with a

high or low non-marital birth share, where we define those categories as relative to the median

non-marital birth share among women age 18 to 34 in the year 2000, which is 33.6 percent of

births. The results indicate a pattern that is consistent with the social norms prediction stated

above. The impacts on marital and non-marital birth rates are more similar in places where non-

marital births were a larger share of all births and the point estimate on non-marital birth rates is

larger in “high” non-marital birth share PUMA than in “low” non-marital birth share PUMA.

However, some of these relationships are imprecisely estimated and we cannot rule out that

births responded similarly across “high” and “low” places. To push on this further, we also ran

the analysis at the county level (not reported in the table); in that case, the data indicate that the

response of non-marital births in “low” non-marital birth share counties is close to zero and

significantly different than the marital birth response as well as the non-marital birth response in

“high” non-marital birth share counties.12 Though not conclusive of social norm effects, these

patterns of responses are consistent with the notion that social context partially determines the

family formation response to a positive income or earnings shock. We return to this notion when

we explicitly compare the findings from the current fracking context to the experience of the

Appalachian coal boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s.


12
   In specifications not reported in the table, we also estimate the model with an interaction term
between simulated new production and a continuous variable measuring year 2000 county level
non-marital birth share. That specification yielded a statistically insignificant coefficient on the
interaction term of interest. In addition, we estimated the model with an interaction of simulated
new production and year 2000 measure of percent religious, as measured from the Association of
Religion Data Archives county level church membership. That interaction term did not enter the
model with statistical significance for any of the birth or marriage outcomes.
                                                                                                     25


   C. Alternative specifications

       One possible explanation for the lack of a finding of a marriage effect is that any effect of

the positive economic shock associated with fracking on marriage rates might occur with a lag.

This could be because women need time to update their expectations about male economic status

or perhaps to observe whether economic improvements are persistent. (Recall that Freyer et al.

2017 document that the wage increases associated with fracking production show persistence.)

To allow for this possibility, we alternatively specify the regression analysis model as a long

difference. We define the outcome variables to be the difference in the birth or marriage

outcome of interest from 2000 and 2011 and estimate that as a function of total simulated

production in the PUMA between 2000 and 2011. This definition of fracking production is

meant to proxy for the total size of the economic shock during this extended period.

       The results of this long-difference specification are reported in Table 6. As with the

annual specification of the regressions, the data indicate a sizable and statistically significant

increase in both the marital and non-marital birth rate. But now the marital birth effect is

statistically larger than the non-marital birth effect. An additional one thousand dollars of

simulated production per capita increased the marital birth rate by 0.8 births per one thousand

women age 18 to 34 and the non-marital birth rate by 0.2 births per one thousand women.

Counter to the marriageable men hypothesis, the long-difference results show an increase in the

percent never married, though there is no discernible change in the percent married, divorced, or

cohabiting. We are hesitant to draw too strong a conclusion from this one coefficient on percent

never married (column 3) and say that marriages fell. But, given the weight of the evidence in

Tables 2 through 6, we are fairly confident in concluding that there is no evidence to suggest that

the economic activity associated with fracking led to an increase in marriage, but there is
                                                                                                       26


evidence that the positive income effects associated with the fracking boom led to an increase in

births among both married and unmarried women.

        Another possible explanation for the lack of evidence of an increase in marriage is that

the effect is concentrated among less educated women, and since our analysis sample includes all

women age 18 to 34, we are unable to detect the group-specific changes. In Table 7 we report the

results of estimating our baseline birth and marriage regressions separately for women age 18 to

34 with and without a college degree. To do this requires limiting the sample to the subsample of

states that record maternal education in the vital statistics natality files for all years. This results

in a much smaller sample of 31 states plus the District of Columbia, yielding observations from

1,393 PUMAs. Panel A reports the results for all women estimated on this restricted sample.

Panel B reports the results for non-college women and Panel C reports the results for women

with a college degree.

        As found with the full sample in the earlier tables, the results in Panel A show

statistically significant increases in the marital birth rate and the non-marital birth rate. Very

similar point estimates are found when the regressions are estimated for non-college educated

women (reported in Panel B). In contrast, for college educated women, the effect on the marital

birth rate is much smaller and the effect on the non-marital birth rate is small and negative. The

estimated impacts in columns (1) and (2) for marital and non-marital birth rates are statistically

different for non-college and college educated women. There are no statistically significant

effects on the marriage related outcomes for either non-college or college educated women.

    D. Comparison to the effects of the Appalachian coal boom in the 1970s and 1980s
                                                                                                    27


       In a paper titled “Are Children Normal?” Black, Kolesnikova, Sanders, and Taylor

(2013) analyze how fertility among married couples responded to the increase in male earnings

in the Appalachian coal-mining region of the United States in the mid-1970s. The Appalachian

coal boom began in the 1970s when energy prices spiked and continued through the 1980s until

energy prices plummeted. Black et al. (2013) exploit variation in county level coal reserves and

yearly energy prices to estimate the causal effect of changes in earnings on marital birth rates.

Specifically, they estimate an IV regression of the marital birth rate in a county as a function of

total county earnings, where county earnings are predicted as a function of the value of coal

reserves in the county. (They estimate the model in first differences.) They motivate and interpret

their analysis as an empirical test of Becker’s (1960) contention that children are normal goods,

meaning that the demand for children increases in response to rising income. Black et al.

estimate that a 10 percent increase in county earnings associated with the coal boom leads to a 7

percent increase in the marital birth rate.

       During the time period studied by Black et al., non-marital birth rates were much less

common than they are today. It is thus interesting to consider whether the non-marital birth

response to the coal boom might have been different than what we are observing in the context

of the localized fracking boom. In Table 8, we revisit the fertility response to the Appalachian

Coal Boom by looking at both married and unmarried births. This extension builds directly on

the reduced form results reported in Table 5 which suggested that places with low non-marital

birth shares saw a larger increase in marital births than non-marital births associated with

fracking production, but places with above-median rates of non-marital birth shares saw

similarly large impacts on both marital and non-marital births.
                                                                                                    28


        We follow the approach of Black et al. in estimating an IV regression of birth rates as a

function of earnings, but define earnings to be per capita and look specifically at PUMA-level

births to women age 18 to 34. For the sake of comparison, we estimate an analogous IV

regression of the relationship between PUMA-level earnings and birth and marriage in the

context of the localized fracking periods using simulated fracking production as a source of

exogenous variation in earnings (using all earnings, not just those recorded for jobs held by

men).

        The IV specification requires the strong exclusion restriction assumption that the only

channel through which a localized fracking boom affected marriage and birth outcomes is

through earnings, an assumption which is almost surely violated. Two obvious threats to this

assumption are changes in house prices and changes in sex ratios. But, recall that these variables

are controlled for in our model, so the IV estimate is conditional on those variables. Results

reported in Appendix Table A2 confirm that the inclusion or exclusion of those variables does

not alter the reduced form estimated effect of fracking production in birth outcomes, which

suggests that these factors are not the mechanism through which fracking production is affecting

family formation outcomes. Other potential threats to the validity of the exclusion restriction are

changes in unearned income, changes in female earnings as opposed to male earnings, and

changes in the male/female wage ratio. Conceptually, all of these variables could have a direct

effect on marriage and birth outcomes and are affected by local fracking booms. Without

additional instruments, we are unable to adequately control for these confounding factors. The

estimated effects from this IV analysis should thus be interpreted with caution. Caveats

notwithstanding, we report the results of this IV analysis because it provides a useful benchmark

estimate that can be compared to estimates from the context studied by Black et. al (2013).
                                                                                                    29


       To conduct this analysis we use PUMA-level per capita earnings, which are aggregated

up from county-level measures provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The

QWI data used in our earlier analyses only extends back to the 1990s and hence cannot be used

to revisit the context of the Appalachian Coal Boom. To implement the IV strategy, we use coal

reserve and price measures provided by Black et al. (2013) to instrument for the natural log of

earnings per capita. By looking at the natural log of our outcome measures and the natural log of

earnings we are able to interpret the coefficient as an elasticity estimate.

       The estimates reported in Table 8, Panel A, Column (2) imply that a 10 percent increase

in earnings led to a 7.5 percent increase in the marital birth rate among women age 18 to 34. This

is comparable in magnitude to the estimated relationship during the fracking boom, as reported

in Panel B, Column (2). The IV estimate of the relationship between per capita earnings

associated with fracking and marital births implies that a 10 percent increase in earnings led to a

12.4 percent increase in the marital birth rate.

       The non-marital birth response is very different between contexts. As reported in Table 7,

Panel A, Column (3), the estimated relationship between earnings and non-married births during

the Appalachian coal boom is negative and significant. A 10 percent increase in earnings

associated with the coal boom led to a 25.5 percent reduction in the non-marital birth rate. Off of

a mean of 12.8, this represents a reduction of 3.3 non-marital births per 1000 women. This

contrasts sharply with the estimated relationship identified from variation in fracking production

in the 2000s. As reported in Panel B, the IV results imply that a 10 percent increase in earnings

associated with fracking production led to a 12.4 percent increase in non-marital births. The data

also indicate a very different marriage response in the earlier and later periods. Column (4)

reports the results of estimating the IV model for the dependent variable “share of women age
                                                                                                                  30


15-34 never married”. The data suggest that in the earlier period, a 10 percent increase in per

capita earnings was associated with a 9.6 percent reduction in the share of women age 15 to 34

who were never married.13 The point estimate from the later period implies a statistically

insignificant 1.7 percent increase for a 10 percent increase in per capita earnings.

           To make a more direct comparison, we estimate these regressions for a common set of

Appalachian PUMA in both periods. Unfortunately sample size limitations precludes a useful

analysis along these lines. The coefficients from estimating the regression model on the three

states from the Black et al. (2013) sample, suggest that during the fracking boom a 10 percent

increase in earnings increased the marital birth rate by an insignificant 5.4 percent (s.e. = 3.7);

increased the non-marital birth rate by a marginally significant 12.5 percent (s.e. = 6.3); and had

no impact on the share never married. The results from estimating the model for the sample of

Appalachian counties during the fracking boom are imprecisely estimated, but are consistent

with an increase in non-marital births and no increase in marriage during this more recent

context. (The point estimates on simulated new production for the key set of outcomes are as

follows: 0.54 (s.e. 0.37) for the marital birth rate; 1.25 (s.e. 0.63) for the non-marital birth rate;

and 0.03 (s.e. 0.59) for the female share never married.)

           The contrast of findings between the context of the cool boom and bust of the 1970s and

1980s and the fracking boom of the 2000s is consistent with the notion that social context

matters. In the earlier period, when non-marital births were still far from the norm, couples

responded to the increase in earnings with increased rates of marriage and increased marital

births, but no increase in births outside of marriage. In the later period, both marital and non-

marital births increased significantly in response to the positive economic shock. And unlike

13
     We use this modified age range because in the 1970 census there are two age groups available: 15-24 and 25-34.
                                                                                                     31


during the Appalachian coal boom, there is no discernible increase in marriage in response to the

positive local economic shock associated with fracking.

       Although this evidence is consistent with changing social norms, it is not definitive.

There are other potential explanations for the differential responses observed between periods.

For instance, the coal boom and bust particularly impacted male earnings (per Black et al, 2013).

But, as we saw in Table 2, fracking increased the potential earnings of women as well, albeit to a

lesser extent than for men. An increase in female earnings could mute the positive effect of male

earnings on marriage rates, leading to the null effect found in the later period, and also make it

more financially feasible for an unmarried woman to have a child without a spouse. It might also

be the case that fracking jobs are particularly onerous, so that an increase in earnings for men

directly employed in fracking-related jobs would make them less desirable marriage partners

than would an increase in earnings for men employed in other jobs. We thus view the

comparisons and contrasts of results between Panels A and B in Table 6 interesting, but our

interpretation of them is necessarily speculative.

V. CONCLUSION
       The fracking boom of the post 2005 period led to sizable improvements in the earnings

potential of non-college educated men in counties located over geological shale plays. We use

this context as a rare opportunity to investigate whether an increase in the employment and

earnings potential of less educated men leads to an increase in marriage rates and a

corresponding decrease in non-marital births. Our analysis is motivated by an interest in testing

whether the reverse of the marriageable men hypothesis holds – as the economic prospects of

less educated men improves, are couples more likely to marry and are women less likely to have
                                                                                                     32


a child outside a marital union? The data suggest that at least in the short term, if we extrapolate

from the experience of the fracking boom, the answer is likely no.

       The results of our analysis suggest that local area fracking production led to an increase

in both marital and non-marital births, and no increase in marriage rates. The finding of a

positive birth response is consistent with a positive income effect on births as found in the

previous literature, and yields additional insight by considering marital and non-marital births

separately in the same context. The data also suggest that the marital birth response is larger than

the non-marital birth response in areas with relatively low non-marital birth shares at baseline,

while the marital and non-marital responses are similar in areas with high non-marital birth

shares at baseline. This would be consistent with a role of social norms in driving the family

formation response to a local economic shock.

       To further investigate the possibility that social context matters, we have compared the

family formation response to the fracking boom of the 2000s to the family formation response to

the Appalachian coal boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s. The data indicate that the increased

earnings associated with the coal boom during those earlier decades led to an increase in

marriage rates and marital births, and no increase in non-marital births. In contrast, the increase

in earnings associated with fracking in more recent years led to an increase in both marital and

non-marital births, and no increase in marriage rates. This contrast is consistent with the notion

that the family formation response to economic circumstances depends on social context. The

patterns of results we observe might suggest that as non-marital births become increasingly

common, individuals are more likely to respond to increased income with increased fertility, but

not necessarily with marriage.
                                                                                                    33


       In conclusion, we find no evidence to support the proposition that as the economic

prospects of less educated men improves, couples are more likely to marry before having

children, as a reverse marriageable men hypothesis might predict. Crucially, this does not imply

that the decline in the economic position of men in certain communities and demographic groups

over the past four decades has not been a primary driver of the increase in non-marital birth rates

and decrease in marriage rates in these communities and groups. It is quite possible that the

reduction in male marriageability among less educated men in earlier decades was the driving

force that led to a decline in marriage and a corresponding rise in non-marital childbearing, but

now that non-marital childbearing has become so commonplace, a new social norm has been set

and an increase in male economic prospects does not have the same effect as it would have in a

different time or place. In other words, economics might have led to a new social structure such

that now we are in a new paradigm. The proposition that individuals respond to economic

circumstances in ways that are shaped by prevailing social norms warrants further empirical

examination.

Notes: Birth data from U.S. Vital Statistics Natality Files. The unit of analysis is the public use microdata area (PUMA)/year,
including 2,044 PUMA from 1997 to 2012. In 2000, approximately 76 percent of births to women ages 18-34 were to women with
less than a college degree. Sixty seven percent of marital births and 94 percent of non-marital births were to women with less than a
college degree. The impact of simulated new production on marital and non-marital birth rates is not statistically different. All
monetary values are inflation-adjusted to 2010 dollars, using the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index. All regression
models include controls for the natural log average house price, the male/female sex ratio age 18-34, gender by race shares for 18-34

   Notes: Birth data from U.S. Vital Statistics Natality Files. Puma-level marriage outcomes are constructed from the 2000 Decennial
   Census and 2005-2011 American Community Survey (ACS) microdata. The unit of analysis is the long difference between 2000 and
   2011 for 2,044 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA). In the ACS three PUMA in New Orleans were disbanded after Hurricane
   Katrina. The share cohabitating is defined (imperfectly) as the share of women 18-34 who are either recorded as an unmarried partner,
   or as the household head with an unmarried partner present. The impact of total simulated production on marital and non-marital birth
   rates is statistically different (p=.02). All monetary values are inflation-adjusted to 2010 dollars, using the PCE index. All regression
   models include controls for the change in the natural log average house price, the male/female sex ratio age 18-34, gender by race

          Notes: All birth data from Vital Statistics. Share never married is calculated from the 1970 and
          1980 censuses (provided by National Historical Geographic Information System) as well as the
          2000 decennial census and 2011 5-year ACS. We use coal reserve values to instrument for the
          natural log of total earnings per capita (from the BEA) for the Coal Boom, similar to Black et al.
          (2013). Data on coal reserves for 1969-1988 are constructed using data provided by Black et al.,
          (2013). Sample for the Coal Boom period includes 134 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA).
          Sample for the fracking boom period includes 2,044 PUMA. All regression models include
          controls for the female population 18-34, male/female sex ratio age 18-34, gender by race shares,
          and stateXyear and county fixed effects. In Panel B we also control for the natural log average
          house price. This measure is not available for the earlier period. Estimates are weighted by the
          total number of births to 18-34 year olds in 1970 and 2000 respectively. Standard errors are
          adjusted for clustering at the PUMA level. *** p<.01, ** p<.05, * p<.1. ***

Data Appendix
Fracking Production Data
        To construct measures of fracking production, we overlay the latest shale play boundary
shapefiles available at the time from 2015 (provided by the Energy Information Administration
(EIA)) onto county boundary shapefiles (provided by the U.S. Census Bureau). ArcGIS software
is used to determine if a shale play and county intersect.14 Although there are 48 unique shale
plays in the US, some of these plays are small and cover only a few counties. We combine small
shale plays that cover less than nine counties into an “other” category so that total play level
production is not driven by any one county. We first generate simulated production at the county
level, as there are many counties in each play. We then aggregate both actual new production and
simulated new production up from the county level to the PUMA level. For the most part, a
county will be completely contained within a PUMA. Some densely populated counties, are
divided into multiple PUMA, in which case we use the share of the county population in 2000 in
each PUMA to assign production values. Only 35 counties with production are partitioned into
two or more PUMA.
        These geographic measures are then combined with quarterly well level production data
provided through a restricted access agreement with DrillingInfo, a private firm that collects
lease, permit, and production data on wells drilled in the United States. These data are
proprietary, and obtained through an academic use agreement with DrillingInfo, available
through their academic outreach initiative. Oil and gas production are reported in barrels and
thousands of cubic feet respectively. We use annual national prices provided by the Energy
Information Administration (EIA) to convert output metrics into dollar amounts, and we then use
the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index calculated by the United States Bureau
of Economic Analysis to adjust all dollar amounts to year 2010 dollars. DrillingInfo does not
indicate if a well is a fracking well, as fracking is a means of stimulating production, but it does
report whether a well is horizontally or vertically drilled. We assign non-vertical wells drilled in
counties that intersect with shale plays as fracking wells and then aggregate this production to
the PUMA level.
Jobs and Earnings Data
        We use the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) as our primary source of wage data.
The QWI is aggregated from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) micro-
level data collected from unemployment insurance earnings data from participating states and
several other sources (U.S. Census, 2014). The QWI is aggregated to the county level, and can
be tabulated by firm characteristics (industry, size) or worker characteristics (gender, age,
education). When tabulating by worker characteristics, only two levels of tabulation are feasible
(gender by age or gender by education). For this reason, we consider gender by education level

measures for all workers over the age of 25. The QWI data is constructed through a state sharing
process, and as such, only states that have made agreements with the Census have reported data.
Many of the states began participating in 2000 with most participating by 2003.
        The main measure we use is the beginning of quarter earnings for all jobs. This measures
the quarterly earnings for all jobs that existed at the beginning of the quarter. Other options (not
used) include stable jobs (spanning multiple quarters) or total jobs (employed at any time during
quarter). We take the implied average annual earnings across all four quarters, accounting for
differences in employment levels by weighting by the reported quarter specific job count. To do
this we aggregate up the total number of jobs as well as the total earnings from the county level
to the PUMA level, and then calculate the earnings per worker. We also construct a jobs to
population ratio by taking the total job count, averaged across quarters, and dividing it by the
estimated population 18 and older from the SEER population estimates.
        Because the QWI is constructed from firm employment, all measures are constructed for
the job count. This means that average quarterly earnings are the average earnings of all jobs in a
given quarter. Individuals who are unemployed are not considered, and individuals who hold two
jobs will be treated as two separate individuals. In general, average earnings levels in the QWI
are higher than those calculated elsewhere, as it records average earnings conditional on
working. Also, because some workers might hold jobs for less than the full year, the average
annual earnings constructed from the QWI will be higher, because the construction implicitly
assumes the job lasts the entire year. This measure of earnings is relevant as it captures the
“potential earning” opportunity available to a man.
        Alternative labor market measures could be constructed from the Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages (QCEW) or the 2000 Census and ACS microdata. The QCEW provides
county level employment and wage measures, but it does not separately identify jobs by the
gender or education of workers. Because we are particularly interested in looking at non-college
educated workers, we rely on the QWI. The ACS microdata would allow us to construct PUMA
level measures based on the individual, rather than the job, and more closely corresponds to
realized earnings rather than potential earnings. The ACS also presents several data constraints.
Consistent PUMA geo-codes are only available in 2000 and 2005-2011, and the ACS is a one
percent survey of households, which likely would yield less precise estimates than the QWI
which draws from the near universe of jobs.
Birth Outcomes
        We use restricted access Vital Statistics data provided by the National Center of Health
Statistics to construct county level measures of birth outcomes, which are then aggregated to the
PUMA level. The restricted files provide the universe of births between 1998 and 2013 with
county identifiers. We focus our analysis on mothers between 18 and 34. In theory, we are
interested in fertility decisions of less educated women. However, a limitation of the Vital
Statistics data is its measurement of mother’s educational attainment. Starting in 2009, the Vital
Statistics required states to updated measures of maternal education to the new 2003
classification. States that did not comply did not have maternal education recorded. As a result,
                                                                                                  52


in 2009, 20 states are missing measures of mother’s education. Starting in 2010, some of these
states’ education measures were included again. As educational attainment is potentially
endogenous, and to maintain all states in our analysis we focus on births to women 18 to 34, in
2000, 76 percent of births to women 18 to 34 were to women with less than a four year college
degree.
        We convert births to conceptions leading to a live birth by subtracting the length of
gestation from the fifteenth of the month of birth. This shifts the timing to the time of
conception. We do this to consider the time the pregnancy decision was made. Our analysis
sample thus consists of live births that were conceived between 1997 and 2012. To construct age
specific birth rates, we divide the number of births by the number of women 18-34 in each
PUMA, constructed from the SEER gender by age population estimates, which are derived from
the intercensal population estimates. We then multiply this by 1000 to be interpreted as birth per
1000 women in the age group of interest.
Marriage Outcomes
        PUMA level marriage outcomes are constructed from the 2000 Census and 2005-2011
ACS microdata (Flood, 2015). Over these years consistent PUMA geo-codes are available,
allowing us to estimate the share of 18 to 34 year old women who are never married, married,
divorced, cohabitating, and married within the past year (share newly married). We use the
population weights provided to do this. Never married, married, and divorced are created using
the marital status variable. To construct the share cohabitating, we assign all women who are (1)
the head of household with an unmarried partner present in the household, or (2) listed as
unmarried partners in the household roster. The variable indicating if an individual was married
in the past year is not available in the 2000 Census, so the share married within the past year is
only available from 2005-2011.
