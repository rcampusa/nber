           RESK, INFLATION, AND THE STOCK MARKET




                         ABS TRACT



     Most explanations for the decline in share values over the past

two decades have focused on the concurrent increase in inflation.

This paper considers an alternative explanation: a substantial

increase in the riskiness of capital investments. We show that

the variance of firms' real gross marginal return on capital has

increased significantly, increasing the relative riskiness of

investors' returns on equity, and that this can explain a large

part of the market decline. We also assess the effects of in—

crease in the mean and variance of the inflation rate, and a

decline in firms' expected return on capital.

1.   Introduction

          From January 1965 to December 1981 the New York Stock Exchange Index declined

     by about 68 percent in real terms. Including dividends, the average real return

     as measured by this index was close to zero. Most explanations of this perfor-

     niance focus on the concurrent increase in the average rate of inflation.1 For

     example, Modigliani and Cohn (1979) suggested that investors systematically con-

     fuse real and nominal discount rates when valuing equity,2 Fama (1981) associates

     higher inflation rates with changes in real variables that reduce the return on

     capital, and Feldstein (198la) argues that increased inflation reduces share

     prices because of the interaction of inflation with the tax system.

          Feldstein (198la,b) and Summers (l981a,b) claim that this last effect can

     explain a large fraction of the decline in share prices. The main sources of

     the effect are the "historic cost" method of depreciation and the taxation of

     nominal capital gains, both of which cause the net return from stock to fall when

     inflation rises. However, inflation also reduces the real value of the firm's

     debt, and reduces the net real return on bonds. The size and direction of the

     overall effect has been debated, and it clearly depends on the values of tax and

     other parameters.3 I will argue that increases in expected inflation --   together
     with concurrent increases in the variance of inflation --   should have had a small

     and possibly positive effect on share values.

          Malkiel (1979) suggested another reason for the decline in share prices:

     changes occurred in the U.S. economy during the 1970's that substantially in-

     creased the riskiness of capital investments.4 This paper elaborates on and

     supports Malkiel's suggestion. It shows that the variance of the firm's real

     gross marginal return on capital has increased significantly since 1965, that

     this has increased the relative riskiness of investors' net real returns from

     holding stocks, and that this in turn can explain a large fraction of the

     market decline.

     The volatility of stock returns has indeed increased, as illustrated by Figure

1,.which shows the variance of the total monthly nominal return on the New York

Stock Exchange Index, exponentially smoothed around a linear trend line (o =

     + •9&i),   for 1950-1981. (The computation of the sample variance is discussed

in Section 3.) Also shown is the linear trend line       .000764 +   4.369xl06t,
which was fitted to the unsmoothed data. Observe that the variance has fluctuated

widely, but has roughly doubled over the past twenty years. If shares are

rationally valued, this reflects an increase in the variance of firms' gross mar—

ginal return on capital, and/or an increase in the variance of inflation.

     Volatility in the firm's gross marginal return on capital comes from the

stochastic nature of the instantaneous marginal product of capital (e.g. crop

harvests, worker productivity, and physical depreciation all have random com-

ponents), and from the capital gains and losses caused by unforeseen events that

alter the expected future flow of marginal revenue product from existing capital

(e.g. the effects of unanticipated regulatory change, exchange rate fluctuations

that alter the competitive positions of goods produced abroad, etc.)    Because

the capital gains and losses are largely unrealized, the firm's gross marginal

return on capital cannot be measured directly However, its variance can be

estimated indirectly from stock market data (assuming rational share valuation).

As we will see, that variance has grown significantly, in a way consistent with

Malkiel's suggestion that the business environment has become much more uncertain.

     Increases in the expected rate of inflation have been accompanied by in-

creases in the variance of that rate, and this can also affect the variance of

stockholders' returns. First, inflation affects net real returns directly

through the tax system, so that volatility of inflation causes volatility in

these returns. Second, there is a well known negative correlation between

unanticipated inflation and stock eturns.5 We do not explain that correlation;

 as Fama (1981) has shown, it may in part be an indirect one occurring through
                                   -3-



correlations with real economic variables. However, it implies a negative cor-

relation between unanticipated inflation and the gross marginal return on

capital, so that volatility of inflation will be associated with volatility in

that gross return.6

     On the other hand, an increased volatility of inflation also increases the

riskiness of nominal bonds. The relative size of the effect again depends on

tax rates and other parameters, but we will see that overall it makes bonds

relatively riskier, and should therefore increase share values.

     The next section of this paper shows how investors' net real returns on

equity and bonds depend on taxes, inflation, and the gross marginal return on

capital. The specification of those returns extends Feldstein's (l980b) model

so that risk is treated explicitly. In Section 3 we discuss the data and para-

meter values, estimate the variance of the gross marginal return on capital and

its covariance with inflation, and examine their behavior over time. In Section

4 a simple optimal portfolio model is used to relate changes in the price of

equity to changes in the mean and variance of inflation, and the mean and vari-

ance of the marginal return on capital. Section 5 shows how changes in these

means and variances over the past two decades can explain a good part of the

behavior of share values.

     Before proceeding, the main argument of this paper can be illustrated with

two simple regressions. Summers (1981a) used a "rolling ARIMA" forecast to

generate an expected inflation series, e() and then (using quarterly data

for 1958-78) regressed the real excess returns on the NYSE Index on the change

in the expected inflation, Fe(). He obtained a negative coefficient for

supporting his argument that increases in inflation cause decreases in share

values.

     I computed a similar series fr rrt),   using   annual averages of a rolling

ARIMA forecast of monthly data.7 The corresponding OLS regression, for the
                                              -4-


   period 1958-81, is shown below (t- statistics in parentheses):


               ER = .00335 -   3615e                                      R2 = .193
                                                                         SER = .0137
                    (1.19)      (-2.29)
                                                                        D.W. = 1.93


   As in Summers' regression, the coefficient of e is negative and significant.

   But now let us add another explanatory variable, the change in the variance of

   stock returns, Aa2:


               ER = .00258 +    1481e     -   8.936&T2                     R2 =   .488
                                              (348)S                      SER     .0112
                    (1.12)      (0.76)
                                                                         D.W. = 1.85


   Observe that the coefficient of             is negative and highly significant, while the

   coefficient of        is   now insignificantly different from zero.8 This simple

   regression suggests that increased risk and not increased inflation caused share

   values to decline. The analysis that follows explores that possibility.


2. Asset Returns
         For simplicity, portfolio choice in this paper is limited to two assets,

   stocks and nominal bonds.       I treat the rate of inflation as stochastic, so that

   the real returns on both of these assets are risky. Trading is assumed to take

   place continuously and with negligible transactions costs, and asset returns

    are described as continuous-time stochastic processes. As we will see, this

    provides a convenient framework for analyzing the effects of risk. In this
                                                                investors' real after-tax asset
    section we derive and discuss expressions for

    returns. All of the parameters and symbols introduced here and throughout the

    paper are summarized in Appendix A.


    A.   The Return on Bonds

         We describe inflation and bond returns as in Fischer (1975). The price level
                                                                instantaneous rate of inflation is
    follows a geometric random walk, s that the

    given by
                                    dP/P =    rdt   +
                                                        o1dz1
                                                                                              (1)
                                                5-



where dz1 =
              c1(t)V,   with c1(t) a serially uncorrelated and normally distributed

 random variable with zero mean and unit variance, i.e. z1(t) is a Wiener process.

Thus over an interval dt, expected inflation is Trdt and its variance is odt.

     Bonds are short-term, and yield a (guaranteed) gross nominal rate of return

R. We can view this return as an increase in the nominal price of a bond, i.e.


                                       dPB/PB = Rdt                          (2)


The gross real return on the bond is therefore:9


                 d(PB/P)/(PB/P) = (R -               +
                                                         a)dt   -
                                                                             (3)
                                                                    a1dz1

Interest payments are taxed as income, so the investor's net nominal return on

bonds is (l-)Rdt, where e is the personal income tax rate. The net real return

on bonds over an interval dt is therefore:


                        =
                            [(l-o)R     -   +
                                                a]dt       -
                                                               a1dz1         (4)


                        =          -
                            rbdt

     This   characterization of bond returns contains the simplifying assumption

that stochastic changes in the price level are serially uncorrelated.1° If

inflation actually followed (1), the real return on long-term bonds would be

no riskier than that on short-term bonds. In reality stochastic changes in

the price level are autocorrelated, so that long-term bonds are indeed riskier.

Our model could be expanded by adding long-term bonds as a third asset and

allowing for autocorrelation in price changes, but the added complication would

buy little in the way of additional insight, and would not qualitatively change

any of the basic results.


B.   The Return on Stocks

     To derive an expression for investors' net real return on stocks, we begin

with a description of the firm's gross marginal return on capital. Following
                                        -6-

Feldsteifl    (1980b), we then introduce the effects of inflation and taxes.

      Over a short interval of time dt, the gross real return to the firm from

holding a marginal unit of capital will consist of two components: the instan-

taneous marginal product of the unit, and the instantaneous change in the

present value of the expected future flow of marginal product. This second

component is just a capital gain or loss. However, it will generally be an

unrealized capital gain or loss, so that the firm's gross marginal return on

capital is not an accounting return.

        Both components will be in part stochastic. The current marginal product

of capital will have a stochastic element arising from random shocks in the

production process: the weather in farming, random discovery rates in response

                                                  random week-to-week fluctuations in
to natural resource exploration, strikes,
                                                and losses are almost entirely sto-
labor productivity, etc. Capital gains
                                                  alter the expected value of the future
chastic, and occur when unforeseen events
                                                   OPEC oil shock that reduces the value
flow of marginal product: for example, an
                                                         the value of drilling equipment,
of factories producing large cars while raising

an exchange rate fluctuation that gives certain domestically produced goods a
                                                 regulatory change that makes some
competitive advantage or disadvantage, a

 existing capital obsolete or raises the cost of using it, etc.
                                                         assume that the stochastic part
        On an aggregate basis, it is.reasonable to
                                                       is normally distributed. We can
 of the real gross marginal return on capital

 then   write that return as
                                                                                      (5)
                                 m = cdt   +
                                               a2dz2


 where    c   is the expected return (largely the expected current marginal product).

 As   Fama (1981)    and others have stressed, this return is likely to be negatively

 correlated with the rate of inflation.12 The magnitude and significance of
                                                                                        =   pdt.
 this correlation will be addressed shortly; here we simply denote E(dz1dz2)
                                                —7—


      Although both the current and expected future marginal products of
                                                                                       capital
 contribute to the stochastic term in eqn. (5), most of the variance is due to

 the capital gain component.13 Since these capital gains and losses are largely

 unrealized, they are not taxed directly. However they are taxed indirectly in

 that the corresponding future marginal products are taxed. We can therefore

 treat the corporate income tax as applying to both the deterministic and sto-

 chastic components of rn.14 Letting                be the statutory corporate income tax

 rate, and Te the effective corporate income tax rate (Te < T5 because of accel-

erated depreciation and the investment tax credit), and denoting corporate

borrowing per unit of capital by b, the firm's net real return on capital in the

absence of inflation is then (l_Te)adt -                (l-T)bRdt   +
                                                                        _T2cIZV
     Following Feldstein (1980b), we can adjust this net return for the effects

of inflation. First, inflation reduces the real value of the firm's debt, so

that the net after-tax cost of borrowing is (l-T)bRdt - b(dP/P).15                Second,

because the value of depreciation allowances is based on original or "historic"

cost, inflation reduces the real value of depr.eciation and increases real tax-

able profits. We use Feldstein's linear approximation that a 1-percent increase

in the price level reduces net profits per unit of capital by an amount A. Then

letting q denote the price of a share (representing a unit of capital), the

firm's real net earnings per dollar of equity over an interval dt,ib, is given by:

     (l_b)qli =                  —                  +
                  (l_Te)adt            (l-t5)bRdt        -t)a2dz2 + (b-A)(dP/P)          (6)




   (1—b)qp5


    Now   consider
                  '
Substituting eqn. (1) for dP/P, we then have:

                      the after-tax return to investors. Let d be the fraction of
                                                                                         (7)




net earnings paid out as dividends, and 0 the effective tax rate on capital

gains. Then in the absence of inflation, investors' net real return per dollar
                                                         -8-


of equity would be ip              [(l-o)d     +
                                                   (l_e)(l_d)q].            Inflation creates nominal capital

gains at a rate (dP/P)q per share, or (dP/P)q(l-b) per unit of capital. Thus

investors' net real return per dollar of equity,                                 is given by:

                          =                +                          -
                               p5[(l_o)d       (l_e)(l_d)q]                O(dP/P)                            (8)


Again, we can substitute for dP/P, and for                                   Letting

                                 a =   {(l-o)d     +

C.             Inflation and Asset Returns

               Feldstein (1980a,b) has argued that increased inflation has reduced the

expected real net return to investors from holding stocks, thereby depressing

share values. As Friend and Hasbrouck (1982) have shown,                                   that argument depends
on tax rates and other parameter values. It also                               depends     on the way the nominal

interest rate R changes in response to changes in the expected inflation rate it.

The conventional wisdom is dR/dr = 1, at least in long—run equilibrium. As

Summers (1983) shows, in theory dR/dir should be about 1.3 (if savings are interest

inelastic) because of the taxation of nominal interest payments. Summers pro-

vides convincing evidence that dR/dr has historically been much less than                                    1——

at most about 0.6 -- even in the long run.                             I take the true value of dR/dir to be

an unresolved empirical question,16 and denote it by the parameter R. We can

then examine how changes in it                     should affect share values for alternative values

of R
         •7T




               To see how inflation affects asset returns, numerical values are needed

for the tax rates U and                                as well as the parameters b, X, and d. All of

the parameters are discussed in Appendix B, and reasonable values are: U =                                      .30,
                                                    -9-




   =   .05,    =   .48,   b =       .30,   A =   .26,    and d =    .43.       Setting q = 1, we have a =   1.2.

       As can be seen from eqns. (4) and (10), an increase in ir reduces investors'

expected return on equity as long as R is positive, but it also reduces the

expected return on bonds as long as R < 1.43.                           What is relevant is the differ-

ential effect on expected stock returns versus bond returns. The parameter

values above imply that



                   - [E()           -
                                        E(b)]/dt     =    - .887R       +    .998       ,            (11)

which is positive as long as R >                  1.13.       Since most estimates put R well below

1.13, it seems doubtful that increases in expected inflation depressed share

values by differentially reducing the expected return on equity; in fact the)'

could have worked to increase share values.

       Asset demands also depend on the variances of these net returns. As shown

shortly,       the variance of the gross marginal return on capital m, has in-

creased significantly over time, and this can explain much of the decline in

share values. The variance of inflation, a, also increased in the 1970's.

This increased the variance of bond returns, but to what extent did it contribute

to the variance of investors' net return on equity? Observe from eqn. (10) that

the variance of that return is:

(1/dt)Var() = [a(b-A)           -
                                                 + a2(l-t)2cr       +       2a[a(b-A)   -


                                                                                                     (12)
Using the parameter values from above, this becomes:

       (1/dt)Var() = .000004a +                           -                                          (13)
                                                 .5l8a         .0029po1a2

Thus any increases in the variance of inflation would have had a negligible

direct effect on the variance of the net real return on equity.17 Of course

increases in       could have also affected share values by shifting the demand

for bonds, but as shown in Section 4, the magnitude of any such effect is small.

3. Inflation and the Marginal Return on Capital Over Time

        The variance of the real gross marginal return on capital,           and its co-

   efficient of correlation with inflation, p, cannot be observed directly. However

   they can be inferred from 2, the variance of nominal stock returns, 1            ,   the
                               S                                               sp

    covariance of nominal stock returns with inflation, the inflation variance

    and the tax and financial parameters. Here we estimate these variances and co-

   variance, infer values of       and p, and examine their behavior over time.

        We use a crude method to estimate the mean and variance of the monthly infla-

    tion rate, and the monthly variance         and covariance Assuming the true
                                                                  .

                                           S             .sp
    values of these parameters are slowly varying over time (i.e. are roughly con-

    stant over intervals up to a year, but may vary over periods of several years),

    we compute a moving 13-month centered sample mean, and sample variances and

    cotrariance. This yields estimates that are rough, but at least as accurate as

    available estimates of the various tax and financial parameters.

         The mean inflation rate 11 is computed as a moving, 13-month centered sample

    mean, using the CPI as the price index:
                                     6
                               =          log                                            (14)



    Similarly, a monthly sample variance is computed for


                        a12(t) =         ( log        -
                                                          )2/12                          (15)

                                 j=-6
    Trends in    and cm(t) over the period 1953-81 are illustrated in Figures 2 and

    318 Observe the clear upward trend in          from 1965 to 1981; the average annual

    inflation rate for 1953-68 was 2%, compared to 9% for 1973-81. Increases in

    the variance of inflation were roughly confined to the oil shocks and recessions

    of 1973-75 and 1979-82; o had an average 1953-68 value of 2.6x106, and an

    average 1973-81 value of 6.9xl06.

         Monthly total (nominal) returns data for the New York Stock Exchange Index

    were obtained from the CRISP tape. The sample variance            was computed using a
                                                            —11—


constant value of 0.71% for the monthly expected return:'9

                                         a2(t) =
                                                             2(x.           -
                                                                                .0071)2/12                              (16)


where x is the logarithmic return at time t.                                    (See Figure 1.) Finally, the

covariance                is computed as:

                                         =                   -
                                                                      .0O7l)(    log           -

                                                                                c,       and the various parameters,

note that nominal net earnings per dollar of equity, , are given by:

                                         =       + dP/P       +       (dP/P)                                            (18)


Substituting eqn. (1) for dP/P and eqn. (7) for p yields:


(1-b)q =              [(lTe)a      -   (l-t)bR       +    (b-X)        +   (l-b)q    +
                                                                                          (b-X)a   +
                                                                                                       (lTe)paia2Jdt

we will assume that shares are rationally valued,20 so that                                            =   (l/dt)Var   (ij'),

and             =    (1/dt)Covar(),dP/P).                Thus,


      =
          {(l-T)2a         +   [(b-x)    +
                                              (l-b)q]2o
                                                                  +    2(l-T)[(b-A)        ÷
                                                                                               (l-b)q]pG1cY2}/(1-b)2q2          (20)


and             =    {[(b-A)   ÷
                                   (l-b)q]a      +
                                                          (l-t)pG1a2}/(l-b)q                                            (21)



These equations are solved simultaneously for                                     and p, given values for the tax

and financial parameters. Most of these latter parameters have been estimated

by others, or can be roughly calculated in a straightforward way. Values for

all of them are discussed in Appendix B, and are summarized in Appendix A.

          The calculated series for                       is shown in Figure 4, together with a fitted

trend line.21 Observe that movements of                                     closely parallel those of                  with

a clear positive trend beginning about 1960. The average value of                                               for 1953-

68 was .0017, and for 1973-81 it was .0036, more than a doubling. o was sharply

higher during the oil and                    agricultural             price of shock of 1974 and recession of
                                           -12


   1975, but a strong positive trend remains even if these years are excluded; its

   average value for 1976-81 was .0027, a large increase from the 1950's and 1960's.

            It is also interesting to compare     with the variance of the marginal pro-

   duct of capital. Holland and Myers (1980) estimated the latter to be about

   .000576 on an annual basis, or 4.8x10         on a monthly basis. This is roughly two

   percent of our average estimates of           confirming that most of the variance of

   the marginal return on capital is due to capital gains and losses.

          The monthly estimates of the correlation coefficient p fluctuate considerably

   over time, and are shown exponentially smoothed (
                                                            =      + t-)     in Figure 5.

   Observe that p was not always negative. One might expect p to increase or turn

   positive during periods when economic fluctuations are driven by demand shocks.

   This is consistent with its behavior during the 1950's, and with a 1953-68

   average value of - .092, as compared to a 1973-81 average value of - .244.

            To summarize, over the past 15 or 20 years there have been large increases
                                                                         there is evi-
   in it,        and ct, and a decrease in p. We should add to this that

   dence from the research of others that c, the expected gross marginal return on

   capital, has declined from about .12 to about .10 at an annual rate.        In order

                                                       for share values, we need a model
   to determine the implications of these trends

   of asset demands.


4. Asset Demands and Share Values
                                                                        we can use the

                                                                  to determine asset
   solution to the investor's consumption/portfolio problem

    demands, and thereby determine how share values change in response to changes

                          To do this, we assume that future income streams are certain

       This is similar to the consumption/portfolio problem in Merton (1971),

       Observe that we can also write the portfolio rule (24) in terms of the

deviation from equal shares (                     = 1/2):

                         *    i     E( S              -   y[Var( S ) - Var(Eb)]

Thus the share of wealth held in stocks depends in an intuitively appealing way

on the relative expectations and variances of the returns. The amount by which

that share exceeds one-half is proportional to the difference in the expected

returns less the difference in the variances of the returns (adjusted by the

index of risk aversion).23 Finally, note that this portfolio rule is also the

one that maximizes the weighted sum ER) -                                            where        =        +

         Formulas for dlogq/d, dlogq/da, dlogq/d, dlogq/da, and dlogq/dy are

given in Appendix D. The numerical values of these derivatives will of course

depend on the values of it,
                                    a,    o, etc., as well as the tax and financial para-

meters. Here we calculate values for the derivatives using the following average

values for the 1965-81 time period:                     .00539,     = .00625,      =   4.6x106,
     =    .0030, p = - .22, a = .00858.          (Note that these are monthly means and vari-

ances.) The values of the tax and other parameters are those listed in the

summary table of Appendix A, and discussed in Appendix B.24
         The derivatives (28) are calculated around a base value of B. We take

to be the ratio of the value of equity to the value of equity plus debt, both

long- and short-term.            (To keep the model simple we are assuming separability

of such assets as human capital, housing, land, money, etc., and ignoring the

risk differentials across various debt instruments.) The derivatives also

depend on the value of y, the index of relative risk aversion. Taking the other

parameter values as given, one can choose y so that the calculated value of

is equal to 0.67, its average for the 1965-81 period as given by the National

Balance Sheets. That value of -y is 5.8, which may appear large, but is consis-

tent with Friend and Blume's (1975) estimates showing y to be "in excess of two,"

and Grossman and Shiller's (1981) indi.ng that y appears to
                                                                                be about 4. We

take the true value of y to be an unresolved empirical question, and calculate
                                           -15-


numerical values of the derivatives for alternative values of y. These are shown

in Table 1.

     Observe that the sign of dlogq/d7r depends on the value of R. Changes in rr

affect only expected returns and not their variances or covariance, so from eqn.

 (11) dlogq/di >(<) 0 if R <(>) 1.13. The numbers in Table 1 indicate that

changes in ir should have a small effect on share values --        unless R is around
 .6 or less, as Summers (1983) findings indicate may be the case. If              =   1.0,
an increase in the expected annual inflation rate from 5% to 10% (           = .0039)
implies a 7% increase in 2 if y = 5, and a 10% increase if y = 3.          However, if

R     .6, the result is a 30% increase in q if y = 5, and a 44% increase if y = 3.

     The sign of dlogq/dcY depends on y (see eqn. (D.2) in the Appendix). For

our parameter values, d1ogq/da >(<) 0 if              >(<) .987. An increase in

increases the relative riskiness of bonds, but it also increases their expected

return (see eqn. (4)). If 'y' is small enough, the second effect increases the

demand for bonds more than the first reduces it, so that q falls. Since y is

probably greater than one and possibly greater than four, we would expect

dlogq/do1 >        However, this derivative is small given the average size of a1.

In 1973-75 a roughly quadrupled from a pre-OPEC average value of about 2x106.

(See Figure 3.) This (tc =        6x106)   implies only a 0.4% increase in q if y = 5

and a 0.3% increase if y = 3.

     As we have noted, there is some evidence that cx, the expected real gross

marginal return on capital, declined somewhat during the 1970's, perhaps from

.12 to .10 at an annual rate.25 This decline in cx (& = .0015) would imply

an 18% decline in q if y =   5,   and a 26% decline if y = 3.      This is clearly a

large effect, so even a perceived (as opposed to actual) decline in cx could

explain a significant amount of the market's performance.

    As we saw in the preceding section, there is evidence that over the past

two decades a has more than doubled from an average 1953-68 value of about

    .0017 (monthly) to an average 1973-81 value of .0036. This increase in            would

    imply a 54% deline in q if y = 5, a 48% decline if y = 3, and a 31% decline if

    y = 1.   If    (or investors' estimates of a) indeed doubled, this would explain

    a large part of the market's decline for any reasonable value of y.

          Finally, observe that an increase in y would also have a large negative effect

    on share values. For example, an increase in y from 4 to 5 would imply a 29%

    decline in q. However, we have no evidence that y has changed over time one way or

    the other, so our focus in the next section is only on changes in it,
                                                                               a,   a, ard a.


5. Explaining the Decline in Share Values

          In Section 3 we observed differing patterns of change in ii,    a, a, and
   but in all cases there have been reasonably clear shifts from the period 1953-68

   to the period 1973-81. To summarize those shifts, it    increased from a 1953-68
   average value of 2% annually to a 1973-81 average value of 9% annually (sir =

    .0056 on a monthly basis), a fell from about a 12% annual rate to about a 10%

   annual rate (a -.0015), and the average monthly variances             and

   increased from 2.6xlO6 to 6.9x106 and .0017 to .0036, respectively. Table 2

   and Figure 6 show the effects of these changes on share values, individually

   and in combination, as a function of y', and assuming R =   1.0.

         Observe that the relative importance of changes in it,   a,   and     depends on

   the index of risk aversion y. For very small values of y, changes in it and a

   have large effects on q, but if 'y exceeds 2 or 3, the change in o clearly

   dominates. The model developed in this paper suggests a value of y around 5 or

   6, and the work of Friend and Blume (1975) and Grossman and Shiller (1981) sup-

   port values that are at least in excess of 2.

         The increases that occurred in      should have had a negligible direct effect

   on share values. Of course we have ignored the fact that unanticipated price
   changes are autocorrelated, which in the 1970's caused a pronounced increase in
   the   riskiness of longer-term bonds. For example, for 1973-81 the variance of

6. Concluding Remarks

        We have found that much of the decline in share values can be attributed to

   the behavior of the gross marginal return on capital. Others have shown that the

   expectation of that return has fallen (although there is some controversy over

   how much), and this paper has shown that its variance has approximately doubled.

   The relative importance of these two changes depends on investors' index of risk

   aversion; if that index exceeds 2, increased risk is the dominating factor.

        These results are based on a very simple model of asset returns, asset

   demands, and share price determination. Some of the model's limitations have

   already been mentioned: the reliance on rational share valuation for the esti-

   mation of     the assumption of a deterministic income stream in the consumption!

   portfolio problem, and the inclusion of only two assets in investors' portfolios.

   Even more limiting is the use of a partial equilibrium framework, which ignores

   the fact that as q falls the capital stock will begin to fall, and the expected

   return a will begin to rise, pushing q back up. Accounting for this would reduce

   the magnitude of the derivatives in Table 1, at least for the longer term.

       Another issue that requires more attention is how investors' perception of

  capital risk should be measured. We estimate capital risk from the sample vari-

  ance of stock market returns, but the use of survey data might yield better

  estimates of investors' perceptions of that risk. For example, if investors

  believe that there is a non-negligible probability of economic catastrophe,

  capital would be quite risky, even if stock returns are not very volatile.

       Finally, we have implicitly assumed that increases in the estimated values

  of    reflect actual increases in the riskiness of capital as an aggregate.

  Other interpretations are possible once we recognize that the capital stock is

  heterogenous. For example, suppose technological change caused the expected

  return on riskier capital (i.e. the shares of high-tech growth firms) to rise.

  The demand for these riskier stocks would then rise, increasing the variance

  of the returns on a value-weighted aggregate stock index, and possibly causing

  share values on average to rise.

 B.     Tax and Financial Parameters

        The relevant tax parameters are the statutory and effective corporate tax

rates       and t   (the   latter accounts for accelerated depreciation and the

investment tax credit), the marginal personal tax rate 8, and the effective tax

rate on capital gains 8. Over 1960-82, the statutory corporate tax rate has

varied from a high of .528 in 1968-69 to a low of .46 since 1979. We use a con-

stant average value of .48. Because the effects of inflation are explicitly

included in our model, to avoid double counting we must remove those effect when

computing the effective tax rate           To do this we utilize Feldstein and Sum-

ners' (1979) estimates of the excess tax due to inflation. As can be seen in

Table 3, the effective rate         has fluctuated, but has had an average value of

.41 for 1962-77. Given the lower values for 1975-77, we use a constant value of

.40 in the model. Feldstein and Summers (1979) also estimate the effective tax

rate on capital gains and find it to be about .05, the value that we use.

Finally, we use a value of .30 for the personal tax rate 8.

      A rough value for b, corporate borrowing per unit of capital, can be com-

puted by dividing the total debt of non-financial corporations by the total

value of their capital, using data from the National Balance Sheets. That ratio

was .26 to .28 during 1962-66, but from 1967 to 1981 it remained between .29 and

.31. We use a constant average value of .30 for b. Similarly, a rough value

for d, the fraction of net earnings paid out as dividends, can be computed by

dividing aggregate dividends by aggregate after-tax profits, using data from the

Survey of Current Business. That ratio has declined from about .48 in 1962 to

about .34 in 1980; we use a constant average value of .43. Finally, a value is

needed for X, which measures the reduction in, net profits per unit of capital

resulting from a 1% increase in the price level. We use a value of 0.26, as esti-

mated by Feldstein (l980h).

      One parameter remains, and it is an important one: a, the expected real

gross marginal return on capital. There has been some debate over whether a has

where         and E are defined by eqns. (25) and (26). The first-order conditions
are:

D.   Calculating Changes in Share Values

     Based on the partial equilibrium relationship (28), one can calculate how

the share price q changes in response to changes in i,                            c*,         or ',   as in

Table 1.          Note that         is given by eqn. (24),                and E by eqns. (25) and (26),

and rb, r, Si, and 2 by eqns. (4) and (10). The relevant derivatives are:

1. Of course we could argue that no explanation is needed, i.e. the performance of

     the market was simply an "unlucky" realization of a stochastic process.

2.   It seems hard to believe that such a confusion would persist, particularly during

     a decade of high inflation. Also, as Summers (1981a) points out, such confusion

     should also have lead to declines in prices of owner-occupied housing.

3. See Friend and Hasbrouck (1982) and Feldstein (1982). Hendershott (1981) shows

     the effect is reducedconsiderably if debt and equity yields are made endogenous.

4. Changes cited by Malkiel include the return of severe recessions (viewed as a

     thing of the past during the 1960's), a higher and more variable inflation rate

     (treated explicitly in this paper), and an increase in both the extent and un-

     predictability of government regulation.

5. See Bodie (1976), Nelson (1976), and Faina and Schwert (1977).

6. There are good reasons to expect this. For example, supply shocks create unantic-

     ipated inflation and at the same time reduce the current and expected future

     marginal products of capital. Also, as Parks (1978) has shown, unanticipated

     inflation increases the dispersion of relative prices. This increases the dis-

     persion of profitsacross finns (increasing risk for each firm), and if adjustment

     costs are significant, reduces expected profits overall. Related is Friedman's

     (1977) suggestion that unanticipated inflation reduces economic efficiency by

     magnifying the distortions caused by regulation and long-term contracting, and

     reducing the signal-to-noise ratio in the messages transmitted by relative prices.

7. At the end of each year an ARIMA(4,0,0) model is estimated using monthly CPI data

     for the preceding .10 years, and is used to forecast the inflation rate for the

     next 12 months.   I calculate ire each year as an average over those 12 months.

     Note that ER and e are both measured as monthly rates.

8. The results are qualitatively the same if my estimated series for the variance of

     the maiginal return on capital is used instead of cr. The data are described in

     Section 3.   Black (1976) has shown earlier that stock returns tend to be contem-

     poraneously negatively correlated with changes in price volatility.
•   Equation (3) is obtained by use of Ito's Lemma. Fischer (1975) derives eqn. (3),

    and also provides a brief introduction to Ito processes such as (1), and Ito's

    Lemma and its use. Observe that the greater the variance                 of the inflation rate,

    the greater the expected real return on the bond. This is just a consequence of

    Jensen's inequality; the bond's real price B' is a convex function of P.

•   I also assume the nominal interest rate is non-stochastic, so all of the risk from

    holding bonds (apart from default risk) comes from uncertainty over inflation. As

    Fama (1975) has shown, this assumption is roughly consistent with the historial data.

•   Note that a pure discount bond that pays $1 at time T has a present value at time

    tof                                T       2            T
                             exp [-   f t(R_TtJi)dt   + 5
                                                            odz]
    and therefore a real instantaneous return of (R-rr+cr)dt -                     as in eqn. (3)
                                                                          a1dz1,
    for the short-term bond.

    Note that this is apart from the effects of inflation on investors' net real return

    that are brought about by the tax system, as explained by Feldstein (1980a,b).

    In Section 3 we show that the variance of the current marginal product of capital

    only accounts for about two percent of the variance of m.

•   This is an approximation, first because losses may more than offset taxable profits,

    and second because depreciation allowances are calculated on an ex ante basis.

    For an analysis of the risk-shifting effects of the corporate income tax, see

    Bulow and Summers (1982).

•   I ignore non-interest bearing monetary assets, which are small relative to

    interest-bearing debt.

    In addition to Summers (1983), see Fama (1975) and Nelson and Schwert (1977).

•   This is because a(b—A)            Of course the variance of inflation could have had

    a significant indirect effect on the variance of stock returns by partially "ex-

    plaining" increases in C7, the variance of m.               (See Footnote 6.) We account for

    inflation when estimating         in Section 3.

    Inflation was extremely volatile during the Korean War, exceeding 8° during the

    first 6 months after the outbreak of the war in July 1950, and dropping to less

    than 1% in 1952.

19. This is the mean return for the period 1960-81, and is close to Merton's (1980)

     estimate of 0.87% obtained using data for 1926-78. In fact, the expected return

     on the market will change if corporate tax rates change, if IT changes, or if the

     expected real gross marginal return on capital a changes. However, as Merton

     (1980) shows, even if we took this expected return to be zero, it would bias our

     estimates of a2 only slightly. Similarly, using a moving sample mean (as in the

     computation of o) makes a negligible difference; for 1948-81, the monthly series

     for a computed in this way has a correlation coefficient of .981 with the cor-

     responding series computed from eqn. (16). Finally, note that a should ideally

     be computed using daily data, but such data are not available before 1962.

20. As Shiller (1981) has shown, the validity of this assumption is questionable.

21. The trend line is:
                            2                 4               6         2
                           2 (t) = 7.51xl0        + 6.88x10 t.        (R = .157)
                                    (3.31)          (8.56)
22. Friend and Blume (1975) provide empirical support for this assumption.

23. Because the real gross marginal product of capital is correlated with inflation,

    there is no feasible value of p that makes stocks and bonds perfect substitutes

     in this modeL The assets are perfect substitutes of i2 = 0, but this would

    require p =   [s   + (s1+a1)2]/2s2(s1+a1) < -1.

24. These values of p, a, a, R, 1T,a, and the tax and financial parameters imply an

    expected after-tax return to the firm £(),         of    .629% monthly, or 7.8% annually.

    This is well within the range of estimates of the after-tax real rate of return.

25. The evidence is mixed. See Feldstein and Summers (1977), and Feldstein, Poterba,

    and Dicks—Mireaux (1981). Holland and Myers (1980) shows a larger decline, from

    about 15% to 11%, but do not adjust for cyclical variation.

26. See Bodie, Kane, and McDonald (1983).
