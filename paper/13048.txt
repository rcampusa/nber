                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper identifies a causal effect of openness to international trade on growth. It does so by using
tariff barriers of the United States as instruments for the openness of developing countries. Trade liberalization
by a large trading partner causes an expansion in the trade of other countries. Trade expansion induced
by greater market access appears to cause a quantitatively large acceleration in the growth rates of
developing countries. Eliminating existing developed world tariffs would increase developing country
trade to GDP ratios by one third and growth rates by 0.6 to 1.6 percent per annum.

1    Introduction

The correlation between openness to international trade and both income and growth
depicted in Figures 1 and 2 has triggered a lively debate as to whether international
trade causes better growth outcomes. On one ‘side’ of the debate are advocates
of free trade such as Arvind Panagariya (2004) who argue that countries perform
better with outward orientation than with import substitution. On the other side
are those who take a more skeptical view of the evidence on the relationship between
trade and growth, most systematically expressed in Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000)
and Rodrik et al. (2004). The skeptical view is that the quality of institutions
“trumps” anything else and that integration has essentially no independent eﬀect on
growth. This paper provides some evidence against the skeptical view by showing that
increased developing-country openness caused by declining developed world tariﬀs
raised developing-country growth.

    An endogeneity problem traditionally hinders investigations of the eﬀect of trade
on growth. Trade openness is likely to be in part caused by growth or by other
factors that may have a direct eﬀect on growth such as the quality of institutions.
Openness measures based on trade shares therefore suﬀer from the likelihood that
countries experiencing fast growth rates for reasons other than trade may more rapidly
expand their trade (Jeﬀrey Frankel and David Romer, 1999). Use of trade policy
measures does not overcome the problem, because countries that adopt more liberal
international trade policies may also adopt other market-friendly policies.

    This paper uses measures of access to developed country markets to identify
whether increased exposure to international trade causally aﬀects countries’ growth
rates. The measures are derived from US Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariﬀ rates,
which declined substantially in the post-war period in line with declines in the tariﬀs
of other developed countries. The paper recognizes that how internationally inte-
grated a country is depends both on its policies and on the policies of its trading
partners. Countries can become more integrated by liberalizing their own trade poli-
cies, but such liberalizations may not be independent of other policy changes or
economic prospects. But countries also become more exposed to trade when their
trading partners liberalize their trade regimes. Demand shifts produced by developed
country liberalization expose developing countries to more trade, but do not entail

                                          2
adverse eﬀects on often shaky developing country public finances or on their terms of
trade. This may have an important eﬀect on growth outcomes.

       Developed country liberalization may provide useful instruments for regressions
of developing country growth on trade. Since developed country liberalization is a
consequence of decisions taken outside of developing countries it is less susceptible to
the endogeneity problems that arise when developing countries themselves liberalize
trade as part of a package of reforms. Liberalizations by developed countries may be
unaﬀected by the economic polices of developing countries that for most of the post-
war period remained on the fringe of world trade negotiations. These liberalizations
are arguably exogenous to most developing countries. To benefit from US MFN
tariﬀ reductions, developing countries merely had to remain oﬀ a list of disfavored
communist countries together with a handful of other disfavored regimes.1 Critically,
trade liberalizations by large countries should only aﬀect developing countries through
their impact on actual or potential international transactions. US MFN tariﬀ data
may provide good instruments for the openness of developing countries in regressions
of growth on openness.

       Figure 3 captures some of the history of market access since 1960 as measured
by the evolution of US most-favored-nation (MFN) tariﬀs. The simple average of US
tariﬀs by product has been calculated from detailed tariﬀ data from 1974 to 2000 and
extended back to 1960 using aggregate USITC (2004) data on the ratio of import
duties to imports. Because US MFN tariﬀ reductions were negotiated during trade
negotiations with other developed economies, US tariﬀ reductions coincided with
similar tariﬀ reductions by other developed economies.2 The openness of developing
countries measured by current-price trade to GDP ratios and exports to GDP ratios
expanded as developed world tariﬀs fell (Figures 3 and 4). Some of the measured
expansion of trade to GDP ratios in the 1970s may have been due to the temporary
increase in commodity prices - openness measured at constant prices does not greatly
increase until later (Figure 5).

       What is evident from Figures 3 to 5 is that a large increase in developing-country
   1
       While some communist countries received the US MFN tariﬀ, most were subjected to a much
higher tariﬀ. Other developed countries were much less prone to imposing punitive import taxes on
imports from communist countries.

trade since the late 1980s has been associated with relatively modest reductions in the
average US MFN tariﬀ. A non-linear relationship between tariﬀs has been studied
before, and one of the leading explanations of this relationship is that very low tariﬀs
facilitate vertical specialization whereby countries specialize in particular stages of a
good’s production (Kei-Mu Yi, 2003). Small reductions in tariﬀs can cause a surge
in international trade. Figure 6 shows that the proportion of US MFN tariﬀs that
might be labeled as “low” increased substantially in the 1980’s and 1990’s, including
a large proportion of items that were scheduled to become tariﬀ-free by 2005. The
proportion of low tariﬀs also seems to be associated with the growth in developing
country openness. This suggests an alternative set of instruments for developing-
country openness - the proportions of US MFN tariﬀs that fall into arbitrary ranges.

   This paper considers whether developed country trade liberalization (proxied by
US MFN tariﬀs) induced an expansion in the openness of developing countries. It
concludes that it did. This paper also asks whether that induced trade expansion
caused an acceleration in the growth rates of developing countries. This paper also
concludes that it did.

   The theoretical eﬀect of increased trade on developing country growth is ambigu-
ous since, for example, poor countries might end up more specialized in commodities
that experience slow productivity growth (Alwyn Young, 1991), or research in the de-
veloping country might be dampened (Gene Grossman and Elhanan Helpman, 1991).
But there are many channels through which access could increase growth. James
Tybout (2001) presents evidence that trade causes the markets for the most eﬃcient
plants to expand and that exposure to foreign competition improves intra-plant eﬃ-
ciency. Liberalization by wealthy countries may facilitate technological transfers to
poor countries and it enlarges the market that the typical developing country firm
operates in, potentially though not necessarily spurring innovation (Grossman and
Helpman, 1991). Daron Acemoglu et al. (2002) suggest that greater access to trade
may facilitate growth by inducing the adoption of institutions that protect property
rights. Increased market access is also equivalent to a positive terms of trade shock to
poor countries. Acemoglu and Jaume Ventura (2001) suggest that an increase in the
terms of trade may encourage factor accumulation and growth by increasing factor
prices. Christian Broda (2002) shows empirically that shocks to the terms of trade
have prolonged eﬀects on a country’s GDP. Economic geography literature suggests

                                           4
that market access may give rise to agglomeration benefits, leading to higher income
levels (see for instance Paul Krugman and Anthony Venables (1995) for theory and
Mary Amiti and Lisa Cameron (2004) for empirical confirmation).

   Empirical studies of the eﬀect of trade on growth are usually either cross-country
studies using aggregate data, or within-country studies using plant- or firm-level data.
This paper has two main diﬀerences from most existing cross-country studies of the
eﬀect of trade on growth. Firstly, it exploits an exogenous variation in the openness of
developing countries - variation caused by demand shifts following developed-country
trade liberalization. The paper is therefore most similar to Frankel and Romer (1999)
who use geography as an instrument for trade in a cross-country regression of income
levels on openness - market access might be viewed as a trade-policy equivalent of
geography. But since market access has more time variation than does geography, this
paper has greater flexibility to control for the eﬀect on growth of persistent factors
such as the quality of institutions using a panel of growth rates.

   The conclusion of most of the cross-country studies is that countries with lower
trade barriers grow faster. Dollar (1992) finds that growth in 95 developing coun-
tries over the period 1976-1985 is negatively correlated to two indices of how closed
developing economies are to trade; an index of real exchange rate distortion and an
index of real exchange rate variability. Sachs and Warner (1995) find that growth is
positively related to an openness indicator based on a number of policies that aﬀect
international economic integration. Edwards (1998) regresses his estimates of total
factor productivity growth on a range of pre-existing indicators of openness to trade,
and finds that most indicators are strongly positively correlated with productivity
growth, Greenaway et al. (2002) perform a similar analysis for GDP growth rates in
developing countries, and find that growth responds with a lag to trade liberalization.
Ben-David (1993) finds that trade liberalization reduces income dispersion amongst
the liberalizing countries. Frankel and Romer (1999) find that countries that trade
more due to favorable geography grow more quickly after World War II, a result that
was extended to the early 20th century by Irwin and Tervio (2002). Dollar and Kraay
(2001) find that more trade promotes growth but has no eﬀect on income distribution,
therefore trade increases the incomes of the poor. Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000) take
issue with all of these papers, arguing that the measures of openness are often poor
measures of trade barriers, or are highly correlated with other causes of economic

                                           5
performance, or have no link to trade policy. Rodrik et al. (2004) find that more
favorable geography aﬀects income levels through the quality of institutions and not
through trade integration.

    Within-country studies note that gains from trade are driven by a reallocation of
resources to relatively productive uses and examine whether greater openness causes
such reallocations. Extensive plant- and firm-level evidence of this reallocation has
been found and is surveyed in Tybout (2001). Tybout uses his own research and his
survey of other evidence to conclude that trade rationalizes production by expanding
the markets for the most eﬃcient plants and by improving intra-plant eﬃciency.
Exporting firms, which tend to be larger and more productive, expand, though large
import-competing firms contract. Bolaky and Freund (2004) exploit the idea that
reallocation is likely to be more feeble in heavily regulated economies and show that
the positive relationship between trade and growth is stronger when conditioning on
country regulation measures. A strand of literature commencing with Robert Feenstra
et al. (1999) focuses on an idea central to some endogenous growth models by finding
that productivity is enhanced by an increase in product (export) variety. Christian
Broda and David Weinstein (2006) show the contribution of product (import) variety
to US welfare.

    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical specification.
Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical results.
Section 5 concludes.


2    Empirical Strategy

Developed country tariﬀs have been substantially reduced in the post-war period after
successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariﬀs and Trade (GATT). Of particular note is the substantial reduction in tariﬀs
achieved at the conclusion of the “Kennedy Round” of trade negotiations in 1967.
The reduction in US tariﬀs evident in Figure 3 was mirrored in other developed
countries. As developed world tariﬀs began to decline, the trade of some developing
countries quickly expanded. The empirical strategy is to examine whether the increase
in openness induced by greater market access caused faster growth in developing


                                           6
countries. I use US MFN tariﬀ data as instruments for the openness of developing
countries in a regression of growth on openness. The regression will pool IV regressions
of growth on openness for individual countries, where the pooling assumption is that
the causal eﬀect of openness on growth - β in Equation 1 - is the same for each
country. I choose the following simple specification for the growth equation:



                   ∆ ln rgdppcct = Dc + Dt + αc t + βopenct + ε1ct                  (1)


where rgdppc is real per-capita GDP, open is the ratio of trade to GDP, subscripts c
and t respectively denote country and time, and Dc and Dt are full sets of country and
year dummies respectively. Growth is simply modelled as the sum of a country fixed-
eﬀect, a year fixed-eﬀect, a country-specific trend and a function of each country’s
openness to international trade. Even though the dependant growth rate variable is an
annual growth rate, the specification allows a permanent increase in openness (above
its trend) to have a permanent eﬀect on growth rates. Openness to international
trade depends on market access and is modelled according to:



                      openct = Dc + Dt + γ c t + δc accesst + ε2ct                  (2)


where access is market access at time t that I proxy with US MFN tariﬀs. Since
access is going to be used as an instrument for open it is not of immediate concern
that the US MFN tariﬀ is an imperfect measure of access, the important concern is
the exogeneity of the US MFN tariﬀ to developing country growth in the sample. The
presence of the trend in the specification is motivated by the concern that country
growth rates and openness to international trade may exhibit trends that are unrelated
to market access developments. This is of concern since market access also displays
a clear trend in Figures 3 to 6. A feature of the specification is that Equation 2
allows openness in each country to respond diﬀerently to market access. There are
three main reasons for this. The trade of more open countries or countries closer
to the US may be more sensitive to reductions in the US MFN tariﬀ. Furthermore,
not all tariﬀs have come down equally - some exporters will be more aﬀected by the
tariﬀ reductions than others. Finally, the presence of preferential access for some
developing country exports to developed country markets means that some exports

                                           7
of developing countries can be harmed by MFN tariﬀ reductions (Mary Amiti and
John Romalis, 2006). The instruments are therefore summary measures of US MFN
tariﬀs interacted with a full set of country dummies. Allowing diﬀerent responses of
openness to the US MFN tariﬀ also enables the inclusion of year fixed-eﬀects in the
regression, which would otherwise completely absorb the instruments. The year fixed
eﬀects should help control for factors such as the business cycle.

      Equation 1 is estimated by both OLS and IV using diﬀerent annual measures of
growth and openness sourced from the Penn World Tables 6.1 and the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators for a sample of up to 135 developing countries for the
period 1960 to 2000.


2.1       Data

Income Data

      I source 5 measures of real income from 1960 to 2000 from the Penn World Tables
6.1 (PWT). There are two measures of per capita GDP: rgdpl is real GDP per capita
constructed using a Laspeyres Index, and rgdpch that is constructed using chained
weights. I also use real GDP per equivalent adult rgdpeqa, real GDP per worker
rgdpwok, and real GDP that has been adjusted for trading gains or losses stemming
from movements in the terms of trade rgdptt. I define a country to be developed in
1960 if it had per capita GDP that was at least 50 percent of US levels - this is the
variable y in the PWT. I added Japan to this list because of its role in multilateral
trade negotiations.3 All other countries are classed as developing. Only developing
countries are included in the sample.

      Openness

      I obtain two measures of openness from the PWT: openc is the ratio of exports
plus imports to GDP at current prices; openk is that ratio at constant prices. I add
to these the ratio of exports to GDP at current prices sourced from the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators (WDI).

      US MFN Tariﬀs

      This adjustment had minimal impact on the results.

                                                8
        US trade data from 1974 classified by country of origin and import program at the
tariﬀ-line level is available from the Center for International Data at UC Davis. From
this data I calculate the Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariﬀ for each product using the
customs value of imports from countries enjoying MFN status and the tariﬀs collected
on such imports. The data are extended back to 1960 using annual USITC (2004)
data on the ratio of total duties collected to total imports. Almost all US tariﬀs
from 1960 to 1974 were calculated on an MFN basis, apart from some automotive
products from Canada and products from most communist countries. Movements in
the ratio of duties to imports prior to 1974 will mostly reflect changes in MFN tariﬀs,
but will also include some movement due to changes in trade composition. The ratio
of total duties to total imports declined from 7.2 percent in 1960 to 3.8 percent in
1974. I then calculate several summary measures of the US MFN tariﬀ schedule:
the simple average MFN tariﬀ; and the proportions of US MFN tariﬀs that fall into
several arbitrary ranges - 0 percent; greater than 0 but less than 5 percent; greater
than 5 but less than 10 percent; and greater than 10 but less than 20%.4


3        Results and Discussion

All regressions use annual data from 1960 to 2000 and only include developing coun-
tries.

        OLS Results

        Table 1 summarizes the OLS estimates of β in Equation 1 - the eﬀect of openness
on growth. Because openness may be endogenous to growth OLS need not identify
β, and the results themselves give little ground for concluding anything about the re-
lationship between openness and growth. The OLS estimates vary greatly depending
on which measure of openness is used, and to a lesser extent they vary depending on
the measure of growth used. When openness is measured by the current price ratio
of exports plus imports to GDP there is usually no significant relationship between
openness and growth, with the slight exception of when growth has been adjusted
for movements in the terms of trade so that it measures real output rather than real
    4
        There is no need to include the proportion of tariﬀs that exceed 20 percent since this proportion
is simply 1 minus the sum of the other proportions.



                                                     9
income. A significant negative relationship is usually apparent when openness is mea-
sured by the constant-price ratios of trade to GDP, with the exception again being
when growth is adjusted for the terms of trade. Finally, when openness is measured
by current price exports to GDP, a significant positive relationship exists between
openness and growth.

   Table 2 reports OLS results from a slightly diﬀerent specification where the log of
the openness ratios have been used rather than their levels. The results are broadly
similar to Table 1, though there has been some increase in the significance of some
estimates obtained using trade to GDP ratios measured at current prices.

   “First Stage” Results

   Since Equation 2 allows the openness of each country to respond diﬀerently to
the instrument it is not practical to report the actual first-stage results. Figures 3
to 6 provide a visual summary of the first stage - they exhibit a strong correlation
between US MFN tariﬀs and developing country openness. These Figures diﬀer from
the regressions in two main respects though. The Figures have not been detrended,
whereas the regressions include trends, and the figures are GDP-weighted while the
regressions do not weight observations by GDP. A better summary is provided in
Tables 3 and 4, which reports an average response of openness to market access
measured by US MFN tariﬀs by running the following regression:



                           openct = Dc + γ c t + δaccesst + ε3ct                   (3)




   Table 3 reports results where openness is measured as a ratio of each trade measure
to GDP, while Table 4 reports results where openness is measured as the log of
those ratios. A decrease in the average MFN tariﬀ causes an expansion in developing
country openness. There is some evidence that conditional on the average MFN tariﬀ,
an increase in the proportion of low tariﬀs also causes an expansion in developing
country openness. The “first stage” results are stronger for the current-price openness
measures than for the constant-price measure, consistent with Figures 3 to 6. The
first stage results are also consistent with more detailed analysis of NAFTA in Romalis

                                            10
(2005) showing that Mexican trade is very responsive to modest increases in access
to US and Canadian markets.

   Instrumental Variables Results

   The IV results in Table 5 provide a stark contrast to the OLS results. The
IV results generally suggest a significant positive relationship between openness and
growth regardless of the measures of openness and growth used. The magnitude of
the eﬀect is also relatively consistent across the measures of openness, accounting for
the fact that the ratio of exports to GDP is typically about half the ratio of trade
to GDP. The eﬀect is also large. For this sample of mostly very small developing
countries, moving from being a closed economy to a relatively open one with a trade
to GDP ratio of 1 adds between 2 to 5 percentage points to the annual growth rate.
Over a period of 40 years this could amount to much of the diﬀerence between what
Arvind Panagariya (2004) would label a growth ‘debacle’ and a growth ‘miracle’.

   Table 6 contains IV results from a slightly diﬀerent empirical specification - the
log of the openness measures have been used as the explanatory variable in place of
their level. The results are similar to Table 5. The eﬀect of openness is still large -
a doubling of openness for this sample of countries increases the annual growth rate
by about 1.5 to 2 percentage points.

   Tables 7 to 10 report IV results obtained using alternative sets of instruments.
In Tables 7 and 8 only the average US MFN tariﬀ has been used to construct the
instruments. The results are similar to Tables 5 and 6. One diﬀerence is that in
Table 7 the point estimates increase when the constant price trade to GDP openness
measure is used, so that these estimates are now very similar to the estimates obtained
using the current price openness measures. The other diﬀerence in Table 7 is that the
estimates are now usually only marginally significant when exports to GDP is used as
the openness measure, while in Table 8 the estimates are usually insignificant when
openness is measured as the log of trade to GDP at constant prices.

   Tables 11 and 12 report IV results excluding high-openness, high-growth Hong
Kong and Singapore to ensure that the results are not driven by these countries.
Since the regressions include country fixed-eﬀects there is no prior reason to believe


                                          11
that the results are driven by Hong Kong and Singapore. This is confirmed by the
results, which are very similar to those reported in Tables 5 and 6.

   Implications

   These results suggest that increases in developing country trade induced by better
access to developed country markets could have a meaningful eﬀect on economic
outcomes in developing countries - at least for those willing and able to expand
their trade. The simple correlation between US MFN tariﬀs and developing country
openness evident in Figures 3 to 6 and the results in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that
developing country trade responds to market access. Further reductions in tariﬀs
and, perhaps more importantly, reductions in the non-tariﬀ barriers that routinely
aﬄict developing country exports would almost certainly lead to a substantial increase
in the trade of developing countries - a simple policy prescription that will help some
developing countries grow. There appears to have been some conversion of developed
country governments towards this view in recent years, at least in relation to the 48
UN-designated Least Developed Countries (LDCs). One move in this direction is the
EU’s ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative approved in 2001 (UNCTAD 2001). The EU
eliminated duties and quotas on “essentially all” products in March 2001, with the
exception of bananas, rice and sugar. The US has made more modest reductions of
duties under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade
Partnership Act, but still levies tariﬀs or imposes quotas on thousands of products
exported by developing countries.

   The regression estimates enable a simple calculation of the impact that eliminating
existing developed world tariﬀs would have on the openness and growth of developing
countries. The first stage estimates enable a crude calculation of the eﬀect of such
tariﬀ elimination on developing country openness. Although the instrument was US
MFN tariﬀs, these tariﬀs were reduced in line with tariﬀs in the entire developed
world as a result of trade negotiations under the GATT. US MFN tariﬀs are arguably
proxying for developed world tariﬀ reductions as a whole. Furthermore, the tariﬀs
of other major developed countries are now very similar in magnitude to those in
the US. Applying the first stage estimates to a simulated removal of developed world
tariﬀs (proxied by the US tariﬀ schedule) suggests that the trade to GDP ratio of



                                          12
the typical developing country would increase by about one third.5 Multiplying this
increase in openness by the estimated eﬀects of openness on growth in Tables 5 and
6 generally suggest an increase in growth of between 0.6 and 1.6 percent per annum.
This is a large eﬀect, but not implausibly large given that the median developing
country in the sample had a GDP of just $9 billion in 2000, and therefore might have
much to gain from being more open. The fact that the regression estimates have been
obtained from forty years of growth data also suggest that this growth dividend could
be very prolonged.

        What the results do not say is through what channels market access increases
developing country growth - for example whether it is through reallocation of resources
to more productive uses, technological transfer, innovation, agglomeration, or terms
of trade improvements leading to factor accumulation. While persistent institutions
should be accounted for by the country fixed eﬀects and country-specific trends, it
is also possible that the results are driven by improved market access causing the
quick reform of institutions to forms more favorable to growth. In the absence of
extensive panel data on institutional quality it is impossible to exclude that possibility.
In this case, access to developed country markets still appears to be a good thing
for developing countries. But whatever the causal mechanism developing countries
also need to play their part. Strictly interpreted, the results only suggest positive
growth outcomes for countries that expand their trade when market access improves.
Trade depends on all countries’ barriers. While improved access to developed country
markets can expand developing country trade, it can do little for an economy that is
essentially closed.


4        Conclusion

This paper examined whether improved access to developed countries’ markets raises
developing country growth. The paper concludes that it does. Decreased developed
country trade barriers increase developing world trade. This induced trade expansion
causes an acceleration in the growth rate of developing countries. Developing coun-
tries that expanded their trade the most in response to improved access to developed-
country markets saw their growth rates increase relative to other developing countries.
    5
        The simple average trade to GDP ratio in 2000 was 0.90.


                                                  13
This suggests that developing country growth rates will accelerate if the developed
world lowers its remaining trade barriers. Despite tariﬀ reductions since 1960, trade
policy in developed and developing countries still greatly restricts developing country
trade, which may substantially harm growth in poor countries.

Notes: The table reports the coefficient on openness from OLS regressions of developing
country growth rates on developing country openness to international trade – the coefficient
β in Equation 1. Different measures of income growth and openness have been employed in
each regression. The growth measure used in the regression is reported in the first column.
The openness measure employed is reported in the top row. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent levels respectively.
I report the number of observations and the number of developing countries in the sample.
Growth data comes from the Penn World Tables 6.1 (PWT), while openness comes from
either the PWT or the World Development Indicators.

Notes: Each openness measure reported in the top row has been regressed on summary
statistics for US MFN tariffs for each year from 1961 to 2000. The summary statistics are the
simple average MFN tariff and the proportion of tariff lines that fall into the specified ranges:
MFN(a,b] is the proportion of US MFN tariff lines that are greater than a% but not over b%.
Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5 and

US MFN tariffs.

Notes: Each openness measure reported in the top row has been regressed on summary
statistics for US MFN tariffs for each year from 1961 to 2000. The summary statistics are the
simple average MFN tariff and the proportion of tariff lines that fall into the specified ranges:
MFN(a,b] is the proportion of US MFN tariff lines that are greater than a% but not over b%.
Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5 and
10 percent levels respectively. Openness data comes from either the Penn World Tables 6.1
(PWT) or the World Development Indicators. See the data description for the construction of
US MFN tariffs.

with country fixed effects have been used as the instruments for openness. Different
measures of income growth and openness have been employed in each regression. The
growth measure used in the regression is reported in the first column. The openness measure
employed is reported in the top row. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and

Notes: The table reports estimates of the impact that eliminating developed world tariffs
would have on the openness and annual growth rate of developing countries. The impact of
complete removal of developed country tariffs on developing country openness is first
estimated by applying the first-stage estimates in the corresponding column of Table 3 to the
2005 US MFN tariff schedule. These estimates are reported in the second row of Table 13.
For example, the first-stage estimates obtained using current price trade to GDP ratios
suggest that the average trade to GDP ratio would increase by 0.24. These estimated
openness increases are then multiplied by the coefficients on openness from IV growth
regression results reported in the corresponding columns of Table 5. For example, the
estimates obtained by using trade to GDP ratios at current prices and per capita GDP growth
measured using Laspeyres indexes suggest an increase in developing country growth rates of
1.1 percent per annum. The US MFN tariff schedule was obtained from the USITC’s
DataWeb at www.usitc.gov, and specific tariffs have been converted to ad-valorem
equivalent tariffs using tariff-line level data on import unit values.

Figure 3 plots the average US MFN tariff and the GDP-weighted average of trade to GDP
ratios for developing countries. Figure 4 plots the average US MFN tariff and the GDP-
weighted average of export to GDP ratios for developing countries. See the data description
for the details of the construction of the average MFN tariff. Trade to GDP is from the
Penn World Tables 6.1 and is measured at current prices. Exports to GDP is from the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators and is measured at current prices.

Figure 5 plots the average US MFN tariff and the GDP-weighted average of trade to GDP
ratios for developing countries measured at constant prices. Figure 6 plots the proportion of
US MFN tariffs that are less than or equal to 5 percent and the GDP-weighted average of
trade to GDP ratios for developing countries measured at current prices. See the data
description for the details of the construction of MFN tariffs. Trade to GDP is from the
Penn World Tables 6.1.
