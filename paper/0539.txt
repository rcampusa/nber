           TIME PREFERENCE AND HEALTH: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY



                                ABSTRACT


        This paper reports the results of an exploratory survey

designed to measure differences in time preference across individuals

and to test for relationships between time preference and schooling,

health behaviors, and health status. Approximately 500 adults age 25—64

were surveyed by telephone. Time preference was measured by a series of

six questions asking the respondent to choose between a sum of money

now and a larger sum at a specific point in the future. Approximately

two—thirds gave consistent replies to the six questions. The implicit

interest rate revealed in their replies is weakly correlated with years

of schooling (negative), cigarette smoking (positive), and health status

(negative). Family background, especially religion, appears to be an

important determinant of time preference.

 Introduction

         This paper reports the results of an exploratory effort in a new

 area——the relationship between intertemporal choice, health behavior, and

health status. Intertemporal choice (or time preference) is, of course,

a subject much discussed by economists and psychologists.' There is also

a large literature on individual behavior (e.g., cigarette smoking, diet,

exercise) and health status.2 This paper, however, seems to be the first

to attempt to bring these subjects together and to test.empirically for

possible interrelations.

        The first section of the paper reviews briefly some of the con-

siderations that suggest that an investigation of time preference might

throw light on health behavior and health status. These include empirical

studies of the relation between schooling and health, epidemiological

investigations of the health effects of cigarette smoking, diet, exercise,

and the like, and theoretical issues concerning investment in human

capital, imperfections in capital markets, and optimizing behavior.

        The second section considers the critical problem of the measure-

ment of time preference and reviews some recent efforts by other investi-

gators to measure time preference in contexts other than health. I then

describe a pilot questionnaire given to 500 men and women and present

the results of correlation and regression analyses of their replies. The

paper concludes with a discussion of questions raised by this exploratory

research.
                                   2




Background

        Empirical considerations. Cross—sectional studies of the determinants

of health status in the United States usually report a strong association

between health and years of schooling. This result typically appears

regardless of whether health is measured objectively (e.g., mortality rates)

or subjectively (e.g., self—evaluation), and is equally robust in studies

of differences across groups (e.g., states or cities) or across individuals

(e.g., household survey data). Simple correlations between health and

years of schooling are usually significant in both the statistical and

the practical sense. Furthermore, the relation remains strong after

controlling for other variables such as income.

        Probably the most thorough investigation of this relationship has

been carried out by Michael Grossman in "The Correlation between Health

and Schooling" [1975]. This study of middle—aged men is particularly

notable for two reasons.

        First, a statistically significant effect of schooling on health

remains after controlling for a large number of other variables, including

family background, health status in high school, income, job satisfaction,

and scores on physical and mental tests taken by the men when they were

in their early twenties.

        Second, all of the men had at least a high school diploma; the

mean level of schooling was over 15 years. Grossman's finding that the

favorable effects of additional schooling persist even at high levels of

schooling is in sharp contrast to the relation between income and health,

which is positive at low levels of income but seems to be much weaker or

nonexistent at average or high levels [Auster, Leveson and Sarachek, 1969].
                                       3




        While the relationship between schooling and health seems well

established, the mechanism(s) through which schooling affects health is

less clear. Grossman has interpreted the empirical results as support

for a household production function model; additional years of schooling

make the individual a more efficient producer of health. This efficiency

may come through wiser use of medical care or, what is more likely,

through differences in cigarette smoking, diet, and other elements of

"life style."

        The view that "the greatest potential for improving the health of

the American people . .   . is   to be found in what people do and don't do

to and for themselves" [Fuchs, 1967] has gained widespread acceptance in

recent years as the result of numerous studies by epidemiologists and

social scientists interested in health.2 These studies report significant

differences in health status and in life expectancy associated with such

factors as cigarette smoking, diet, and exercise. Not only is a statistical

correlation well established, but in many instances there is some under-

standing of the causal mechanisms as well, e.g., the role of diet and

exercise in the prevention of atherosclerosis. What is not understood

at all well is the cause of individual variation in health—related behavior.

        From an economic point of view many of these behaviors have a

common characteristic——they involve trade—of fs between current costs and

future benefits. The costs may be purely psychic, such as the loss of

pleasure from not eating a rich dessert or not smoking a cigarette. They

may involve time, such as time for jogging, or they may involve other

costs including financial and nonfinancial resources. The expected

benefits typically take the form of reductions in the probability of

morbidity and mortality from one or more diseases sometime in the future.
                                   4




        Theoretical considerations. The acceptance of a current cost for

a future benefit constitutes an investment. Becker's development of the

theory of investment in human capital [Becker, 19641 and Grossman's

application of this theory specifically to health [Grossman, 1972] provide

a convenient framework for thinking about these health behaviors. Suppose

individuals differ in their willingness or ability to undertake investments,

i.e., they have different time preferences. Such differences might help

to explain variations in cigarette smoking, diet, and the like. Further-

more, this approach suggests possible links with the health—schooling

relationship that has been found by so many investigators.

        There are at least two ways that individual variation in time

preference could explain the correlation between schooling and health.3

First, suppose that differences in time preference are established early

in life, are relatively stable, and affect subsequent behavior.4 These

differences might be due to differences in the education or income of

parents, the stability of the family, the values associated with different

religions, or to other background characteristics. Given variation in time

preference, it would not be surprising to observe that individuals with

low rates of time discount would invest in many years of schooling and

would also invest in health—enhancing activities. On this view schooling

has no direct effect on health; the observed correlation is due to both

schooling and health being functions of time preference.

        A second possibility (.the two explanations are not mutually

exclusive) is that schooling actually affects time preference; those with

more schooling are more willing to invest at a lower rate of return.5

Thus more schooling could result in better health by increasing investments
                                   5a



in health. The empirical portion of this paper, based on a single cross—

section survey, cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses, but we

can test for possible relations between schooling and time preference.

        Empirical investigation of time preference through survey questions

designed to elicit marginal rates of time discount depends critically on

capital markets being "imperfect." If capital markets were "perfect"

(i.e., if individuals could borrow and lend without limit at a single

market rate of interest) marginal rates would be equal for all regardless

of time preference. Differences across individuals in time preference

might still result in differences in non—tradeable health—related

activities, but these would not be predictable from the replies to

interest rate questions. However, if capital markets are not "perfect"

(an assumption of this paper), individuals may well have different rates

of interest at the margin and these may be related to health behavior

and health status.


        Let us imagine a two—period world. Suppose utility in each period

depends upon consumption of goods (G). Utility in the first period also

is a function of some activity C1 (for simplicity assumed to be free with

respect to G) which affects health (and therefore utility) in period two.

For example, C1 might be cigarette smoking:


            U1 = U1(G1,    C1)


            U2 = U2(C2,    H2) where H2 = H(C1)


       A wealth compensated increase in the rate of interest (r) will,

ceteris paribus, alter the allocation of wealth between C1 and C2. But if
                                     5b




the marginal utility of C1 depends on the quantity of G1 (and the marginal

utility of H2 depends on the quantity of C2), the change in r will also

affect C1 (and H2). If C1 and C1 (and C2 and H2) are substitutes, an

increase in r will lead to an increase in C1 and a decrease in H2.     If the

relationship is complementary (which seems less plausible to me), the

reverse would be true.

          It should be eniphasized that (given imperfect capital markets)

differences across individuals in marginal rates of interest can be the

result of differences in underlying preference functions (indifference

curves) or differences in opportunities to borrow and lend.6 In general,

it will not be possible to distinguish between these sources empirically,

although controlling for family income (as a proxy for "opportunities")

may move the analysis somewhat closer to a focus on preference functions

per Se.

          Because time preference is probably only one of many factors

affecting the demand for cigarettes, jogging, etc., we can hardly expect

perfect correlation among these activities. Differences in time preference

across individuals, however, should result in some positive correlations

among various health—related behaviors.
                                  6




Measurement of Time Preference

        In recent years there have been several attempts to measure time

preference through household survey techniques. The objectives of the

investigators have varied greatly, but the general approach has been similar.

The respondent is typically confronted with a hypothetical situation

involving different sums of money at different points in time and is asked

to express a preference which will implicitly reveal a rate of time dis-

count. A brief review of four such studies follows.

        Thomas and Ward [1979]. Psychologists Ewart A. C. Thomas and

Wanda E. Ward were interested in looking for relations between time prefer-

ence and various psychological measures of temporal orientation? and

measures of optimism or pessimism. They were also interested in possible

effects of time preference on saving and spending behavior. Their sample

consisted of 63 college students who were asked 24 "open ended" time

preference questions of the following type:

         If offered $100 now or X dollars in six months, what would
         be the smallest amount of money (X dollars) you would accept
         rather than the immediately available $100?

Some questions gave the future amount and asked the respondent to choose

a current value; others gave both amounts and asked for the time period

that would make them commensurate. Still others were formulated as payments
                                    7




rather than as receipts, and some were expressed in terms of goods rather

than simply dollar amounts.

        Implicit discount rates were found to be negatively correlated

with future time orientation and positively correlated with "big spending."

The group results were considered satisfactory, but the measurement of

time preference was "disappointing" to the authors because of the "high

instability of parameter estimates for individual subjects."

        West (SRI) (1978). Economists involved in the Seattle—Denver

income maintenance experiment were interested in time preference because

the bias introduced by the finite length of the experiment (compared to a

national program of indefinite life) would vary depending upon the house-

hold's rate of time discount [Metcalf, 1974]. The families in the

experiment (more than 1500 in each city) were asked a large number and

variety of time preference questions. Some were open—ended, similar to

those of Thomas and Ward. Some were "cascades" of the following type:

        Suppose you had a choice between a cash bonus of $100 today
        and $200 a year from now; which would you choose?

If the respondent chooses $200, the question is repeated, with $175 substi-

tuted for $200, and so on until the respondent chooses $100. Some cascade

questions go up instead of down; some involve payments rather than receipts;

and some involve different time periods.

        The mean interest rates implicit in the replies of these low income

respondents were typically quite high, but the correlation between questions

was typically low (r =   about .1 or .2). The author (Richard W. West)

expressed some concern that "the measures are not reliable" (p. 23).

        Maital and Maital [1978]. A paper by an economist and a psycholo-

gist, Shlomo Maital and Sharona Maital, reviews some of the economic
                                     8




and psychological literature on time preference and reports the results

of a survey of 515 Israeli adults. The Maitals' focus is on the role of

time preference in the intergenerational transmission of income inequality.

They asked one cascade question involving choice between a sum of money

now and higher sums one year from now. A similar question in which gift

certificates for a week's shopping at a supermarket were substituted for

money was asked in an attempt to measure the "real" as opposed to the

nominal implicit rate of interest.

        The implicit interest rate was negatively correlated with years of

schooling (r = — .08) and with a dummy variable which took a value of one if

the subject and the subject's father were born in Israel (r = —.12).     The

nominal rate was negatively correlated with income (r = —.14), but the

real rate was not. The authors concluded that the ability to defer

gratification is part of the process of socialization and that "after

adolescence the propensity to delay gratification is quite stable" (p. 192).

This may be correct, but it is not clear that the conclusion follows from

their results.

        Thaler (1979). In a questionnaire administered8 to approximately

75 college students, Richard Thaler posed a large number of open—ended

money choices primarily to learn how the implicit interest rate varies

with the amount of money involved, the time period, the starting point of

the comparison, and whether the choice involves receipt or payment. He

found that the implicit rate was lower the larger the amount of money and

the longer the time period.   Also, choices involving two points both in

the future typically invoked a smaller implicit interest rate than choices

involving the present versus the future. He concluded that there is a
                                   9



"psychic fixed cost" to waiting, as well as a cost that varies with amount

and time.

        I included a few questions on health status in the Thaler question-

naire and found a significant negative correlation between health and

median implicit interest rate across individuals. This result led me to

undertake a larger pilot survey described in the next section.




The Pilot Survey

        A pilot survey was conducted in November 1979 under the direction

of Stephen and Ann Cole with the objective of measuring time preference,

health status, and health behavior as well as a large number of family
                                               9
background and current socioeconomic variables.    Telephone interviews

approximately 20 minutes in length were conducted with 508 individuals

living in Nassau and Suffolk Counties (on Long Island just east of New

York City). Respondents were selected through a random sample of telephone

numbers;10 interviews were completed with 58 percent of the eligible

respondents. The characteristics of the respondents conformed closely to

Census data for those two counties, but the possibility of selection bias

remains, especially with respect to some of the family background variables.

        The sample was restricted to individuals aged 25—64, and inter-

viewers were instructed to obtain an approximately equal distribution

between female and male respondents. The respondents differ from a national

sample with respect to religion (55 percent Catholic and 17 percent Jewish),

race (3 percent Black), and schooling (about one year above the national

average). They are also somewhat more affluent and in slightly better
                                   10




health. Allowing for the predominantly suburban middle—class character

of the two counties, the distributions of replies on the health, health

behavior, family background, and socioeconomic variables conform closely

to those obtained in national surveys.

        The principal approach to the measurement of time preference was

through a series of six questions asking the respondent to choose between

a sum of money now and a larger sum at a specific point in the   future,
e.g., "Would you choose $1500 now or $4,000 in five years?" The amount

and the time period varied, as did the interest rate implicit ikn each

question. The lowest implicit rate was 10.1 percent per annum (continu-

ously compounded); the highest was 51.1 percent. This dichotomous choice

type of question was used because it was deemed simpler for the respondent

than the open—ended or cascade type questions discussed previously.12

        In addition to the implicit interest rate series of questions, a

cascade type question with an explicit interest rate (beginning at 6 per-

cent and rising to 50 percent) was asked. The survey also included four

attitudinal questions, e.g., "Do you agree or disagree with this statement:

It makes more sense to spend your money now rather than saving it for the

future." Also, each respondent was asked to choose an expected rate of

change of prices for the coming year. The final time preference questions

dealt with the respondent's use of credit when purchasing a car or through

unpaid balances on bank credit cards.

        The questions dealing with family background, socioeconomic status,

health behavior and health status are similar to those usually asked in

household surveys. Only some of these variables have been analyzed thus

far. They will be discussed in the next section on empirical results.

Empirical Results

        One of the purposes of the pilot survey was to determine whether

respondents would, in a brief telephone interview, give sensible answers

to hypothetical money choice questions when the interest rates implicit

in the questions are far from transparent. The data presented in Table 1

suggest that many respondents do give sensible replies; some do not. The

six implicit interest rate questions ask the respondent to choose between

taking a smaller prize now or waiting for a larger prize. A priori we

expect the fraction of respondents taking the prize now to diminish as

the implicit interest rate rises. Table 1 shows that this did occur.

For the sample as a whole, 76 percent chose "now" for the question with

an implicit interest rate of 10.1 percent per annum, and only 33 percent

did so when the implicit interest rate was 51.1 percent.

        Not only do the group results conform to a priori expectations,

but almost two—thirds of the respondents gave replies which were internally

"consistent" for each individual. A set of replies was defined as consistent

if the respondent never answered "now" to a question with an implicit inter-

est rate thatwas higher than the rate in another question to which the answer

was "wait."13 The last three columns of Table 1 show results for the

sample divided into three groups: those with consistent answers, those

whose answers would be consistent if one reply were reversed (about one—

fourth of the sample), and those respondents whose replies require two

or three reversals in order to achieve consistency (about 10 percent of

the sample).14 The relation between the fraction taking the prize now

and the implicit interest rate is much weaker for those respondents with

inconsistent answers and much stronger for those with consistent answers.

Most of the results reported in this paper are based on analyses limited

to those respondents with consistent replies.

        Table 2 presents the results of regressions in which each question

to each individual is treated as an observation. When the regressions are

run OLS, the dependent variable is dichotomous, taking a value of 1 if the

reply is "now" and 0 if it is "wait." The right—hand—side variables are

the compound interest rate implicit in each question, the simple implicit

interest rate, and the individual's explicit interest rate given in reply

to the cascade question mentioned in the previous section. We see that

the probability that a given individual will reply "now" to a given

question falls sharply as the interest rate implicit in the question rises,

and rises rapidly as the individual's explicit interest rate rises. These

results hold for the entire sample and are particularly strong for those

respondents classified as consistent, but do not hold for the other

respondents. Logistic regressions estimated by a maximum likelihood

procedure give similar results when evaluated at the mean probability

of taking "now." (See marginal effects in brackets.)

        The contrast between the compound interest rate and the simple

interest rate coefficients, depending upon the consistency class, suggests

one possible reason why some respondents give inconsistent replies)5 The

two interest rates are, of course, highly correlated, but not perfectly so.

Those giving consistent replies seem to have been influenced by the implicit

compound rate, while those with the most inconsistent replies seem to have

been influenced primarily by the simple rate. We also see that there is

a close connection between the explicit rate and the probability of choosing

"now" for the consistent individuals, but not for those whose replies to

the implicit rate questions were inconsistent.

        Inasmuch as these results are based on replies to only six ques-

tions, they can only be suggestive, not definitive. It would be desirable

to see if the distinction between the compound and simple interest rate

holds up in a survey based on a large number of questions. For this

sample, this distinction gives stronger results than do regressions based

on Thaler's hypotheses about the effects of length of time or amount of

money on the willingness to wait.

        Table 3 reports the results of regressions similar to those in

Table 2, but designed to measure the effects of individual characteristics

on the probability of the individual choosing "now" in response to the

implicit interest rate questions. The regressions are limited to

respondents with consistent replies and are run separately for females

and males because preliminary analysis revealed significant interaction

effects for some variables. A brief discussion of the additional

variables follows:

     AGE: Respondents placed themselves in one of four age categories:

           25—34, 35—44, 45—54, or 55—64. The mid—point of each category

           was used to   construct   a continuous variable. There was no

           a priori expectation for this variable. Maital and Maital had

           found a positive correlation between age and the "real" interest

           rate (r =   .10),   but no relation with the nominal rate.

   PARED: Parents' education is the mean of the years of schooling of the

           respondent's mother and father. The separate schooling

           variables are highly correlated, and do not yield any signif i—

           cant information when included separately. A priori I expected

           a negative coefficient for PARED, at least prior to inclusion

          of other variables that are also affected by PARED, e.g., the

          respondent's own years of schooling.

 LIVPAR: This is a dummy variable taking a value of 1 if the respondent

          lived with both parents until age 16; 0 otherwise. Some of

          the psychological literature suggest that this coefficient

          should be negative, i.e., should work much the same way as PARED.

CATH,JEW: These are dummy variables taking a value of 1 if the respondent

          is Catholic (or Jewish), and 0 if Protestant or other.

 EXINFL: Expected inflation is a continuous variable derived from the

          respondent's reply to the question about expected price change

          during the coming year. A positive coefficient is expected

          when the implicit interest rate is held constant. At any given

          nominal rate, the respondent should be less willing to wait if

          prices are expected to rise rapidly because the implicit "real"

          rate of interest is lower.

 l2YRS These are dummy variables for the respondent's own years of
   and
 l6YRS: schooling. The omitted class is those with 13 to 15 years. A

          positive coefficient is expected for l2YRS, and a negative

          one for l6YRS, for reasons discussed in the first section of

          this paper.

 ADJINC: Adjusted family income is a continuous variable derived as

          follows. The respondent placed total family income in one of

          the following categories: under $15,000, $15,000 to $25,000,

          $25,000 to $35,000, or over $35,000. Values of 10, 20, 30 and

          40 were assigned to each category. Sixty of the respondents

          did not answer the income question. An income category was
                                        17




           assigned to them on the basis of their reply to a social class

           question and a regression of income on social class. Total

           family income was divided by "adult equivalents" to create

           adjusted family income. "Adult equivalents" is the weighted sum

           of the number of adults and the number of children in the house-

           hold with the following weights: respondent = 1; each addi-

           tional adult =   .8;   first child =   .5;   second child =   .4;   each

           additional child =     .3.   A negative coefficient was expected for

           ADJINC both because of a possible effect of income on time

           preference, and an effect of time preference on income.'6

        Three alternative OLS specifications (for each sex) allow us to

look first only at the background variables (controlling for the implicit

interest rate and expected inflation), then at the effects of schooling

(which is probably affected by the family background variables and may be

a route through which they affect time preference), and finally at the

effect of family income. The regressions were also estimated in logistic

form by maximum likelihood; the results are similar to those for OLS. The

coefficients from the logistic version of the third specification, converted

to marginal effects at the mean probability of taking "now" are shown in

column (3L).

        In the first specification, AGE and PARED are statistically

significant for males in the expected direction, while JEW is highly

significant for females. A coefficient of —.22 indicates that, ceteris

paribus, a Jewish female respondent has .22 lower probability of answering

"now" than does a Protestent (or other) female. The sign of the LIVPAR

coefficient is opposite to that expected, perhaps because of sample
                                   18



selection bias. It may be that most persons from broken homes do have

high rates of time discount, but those who "make it" to a middle class

suburban community are probably atypical and may have low rates of time

discount.

        The schooling variables behave as expected for females and are

highly significant. For males, the 12YRS coefficient is as expected,

but the l6YRS coefficient has the "wrong" sign and is statistically

significant. It is not obvious why men with 16 years of schooling or more

should be, ceteris paAibus, more eager to take the prize now than men with

13 to 15 years; possibly the former have better opportunities to invest

the money.

        The income variable works as expected for females and is signifi-

cant; it has the wrong sign for males but is not significant. In the

fullest specification, LIVPAR and PARED are statistically significant for

females with signs opposite to that expected. Some of the background and

socioeconomic variables are highly correlated with one another (see

Appendix Table A for the zero order correlation matrix) and multicollinearity

may explain some of the perverse results. EXINFL is statistically signifi-

cant in the expected direction and has approximately the same effect as

the nominal implicit interest rate on the probability of taking the prize

now.

        The model underlying the regressions reported in Table 3 treats

time preference (as reflected in the choice between "now" and "wait") as

dependent on years of schooling. As previously discussed, some writers

believe that differences in time preference are established early in life

and are stable. They would treat years of schooling as dependent on time
                                    19




preference. Table 4 presents the results of regressions in which years

of schooling is regressed on time preference and other variables. The

new variables are:

        IMPINT:   An implicit interest rate is calculated for each

respondent who gave consistent answers to the six implicit interest rate

questions. Those respondents who answered "now" to some questions and

"wait" to others were assigned a rate equal to the mean of the highest

implicit rate to which they answered "now" and the lowest to which they

answered "wait."17 Those respondents who always chose to "wait" were

assigned a rate of 5 percent and those who always chose "now" were assigned

60 percent. The higher the respondent's IMPINT, the lower should be the

years of schooling. The variable EXINFL (described previously) should

work in the opposite direction.

        HSRANK: The respondent's scholastic performance in high school

was inferred from replies to the question: "When you were in high school

were you: (percent of sample in each category shown in parentheses)

        1) an excellent student (10%)

        2) an above average student (28%)

        3) an average student (57%)

        4) a below average student (5%).

Grade averages of 95, 85, 75, and 65 were assigned to the four categories

respectively, and the variable is treated as a continuous variable. A

positive coefficient is expected.

        HSHLTH:   Health in high school was treated as a dummy variable

taking a value of 1 if the respondent recalled his or her health as being

"better than most of the other kids" (26%), and 0 if it was "about average"

(70%) or "worse than most of the other kids" (4%). A positive coefficient

is also expected for this variable.

        The results of these regressions again give weak support for the

view that there is a relation between time preference and schooling, but

leave open the question of the direction of the causality. In the first

specification the coefficient of IMPINT is highly significant for females

and is still significant when the family background variables are introduced.

EXINFL has the wrong sign and is not significant. For males the reverse

is true. EXINFL is significant with the expected sign, but IMPINT shows

no effect.

        The background variables work as expected, with PARED and LIVPAR

both raising years of schooling. HSRANK has a very strong effect, but the

causality may be partly the reverse of that assumed in this regression,

i.e., persons who plan to go on to college may exert more effort to do

well in high school. HSHLTH shows practically no effect on years of

schooling. In general, this variable has very low correlations with other

socioeconomic or health variables, suggesting that it may be poorly

measured.

        One of the purposes of the pilot survey was to determine the

correlation among alternative measures of time preference. These correlation

coefficients, shown in Table 5, indicate a weak but statistically signifi-

cant correlation between the implicit and explicit interest rates and

between the implicit rate and replies to the two simple attitudinal

questions ("spend now" and "don't worry"). The other two attitudinal

questions, which are more complex because they introduce considerations

such as life insurance and the education of children, do not correlate
                                   22



well with either the implicit or explicit rates, although they are correlated

with each other. The fact that the credit card debit and car loan dummy

variables are not significantly correlated with the interest rate variables

would be disturbing, but given the timing of the pilot survey, there may

be an easy explanation. The interest rates on these loans were legally

restricted to unrealistically low levels, given the high interest rates

prevailing at that time and given the high rates revealed by the respondents

in replies to the implicit rate questions.

         Explanations aside, the low correlations across time preference

questions must be a source of some concern. They suggest the need for

further refinement in the survey techniques and the need to understand

better how the specific context of a decision affects intertemporal choice.

        Do differences in time preference affect investments in health?

Some crude measures of these investments were obtained by asking the

respondents about their cigarette smoking, dental visits, exercise,

weight (as a proxy for diet) and seat belt usage.

      The correlation between favorable health behaviors is positive for every

possible pair (reversing signs where appropriate), but the coefficients

are quite low and only some are statistically significant (see Table 6).

The correlations with seat belt usage suggest that individual differences

with respect to health in general may be more important than differences

in time preference. Moreover, the generally low correlations underscore

the fact that even if there is a common factor at work across behaviors,

there are also other factors that are specific to particular behaviors.

The low coefficients may also be attributable to the rough approximations

used to measure the variables.

        In order to test for possible effects of time preference, the

health behavior variables were regressed on IMPINT, EXINFL, and several

other variables. The results for cigarette smoking are reported in

Table 7. They confirm the expectation that cigarette smoking does increase

with higher IMPINT, and decrease with higher EXINFL, but the size of the

effect of IMPINT is quite small. We also see an effect of schooling on

cigarette smoking as expected; the difference between the coefficients

for l2YRS and 16YRS is statistically significant for males. The overall

explanatory power of the regression is low; most of the variation in

cigarette smoking is not explained by these variables and the addition of

ADJINC was of little value.

        Regressions for the other health behaviors were even less satis-

factory. The total explanatory power was low, and IMPINT was not

statistically significant except for EXER for males, where the sign was

the opposite of that expected.

        In the first section of this paper questions were raised about

whether difference in time preference could help explain health status or

throw light on the relation between health status and schooling. Table 8

reports the results of regressions addressed to these questions. Panel A

uses as the dependent variable LnHLTH, the same variable used by Grossman

[1975] in "The Correlation between Health and Schooling." It is obtained

by taking the logarithms of values given to replies to the question "In

general, would you consider your health to be

                     Poor                   86.7             3


Grossman obtained these values from a regression of work—loss weeks due

to illness on self evaluation of health status.'8

        The results support Grossman's finding of a strong effect of

schooling on health and it appears that the effect is equally strong for

females and males.'9 The coefficients for EMPINT have the expected negative

sign, but are not statistically significant. When time preference and

schooling are entered simultaneously, the latter clearly dominates the

former. When ADJINC is added to the regression, its coefficient is not

significant, and the other results are unchanged.

        Three other sets of health status questions were asked in addition

to the subjective self—evaluation. One used a checklist of symptoms and

diagnoses; a second requested information on utilization of hospitals,

drugs, and physicians' services; and the third asked about the respondent's

ability to walk or jog a mile. These measures are significantly correlated

with each other and with self—evaluation of health status, even after
                                    27




controlling for age and sex (partial correlation coefficients are typically

about .20). A composite health status variable MNEXHLTH was calculated

from the four measures by assigning a value of .25 to respondents for each

of the following:      (1) Self—evaluation excellent (44%)
                       (2) Zero symptoms (47%)
                                                             20
                       (3) Very low medical care utilization      (64/a)

                       (4) Able to jog a mile (61%)

        This "mean proportion of excellent health measures" is the dependent

variable in the regressions reported in Part B of Table 8. They indicate a

stronger effect for time preference and a relatively weaker effect for

schooling.21 IMPINT actually achieves statistical significance for males.

It appears that the choice of health status measure makes a difference.




Unresolved Questions

        This exploratory study leaves unresolved many empirical and

theoretical questions concerning time preference, health behavior, and

health status. The attempt to measure implicit interest rates through a

series of six dichotomous choices between "money now" and "money in the

future" produced answers that are clearly not all "noise," but neither

are they completely satisfactory. About one—third of the respondents had

at least one inconsistent reply. Moreover, one—half of those who were

"consistent" answered all the questions the same way (either all "now"

or all "wait"). An extension of the range of the implicit interest rates

might yield more information about this group. An increase in the number

of questions would be desirable for many reasons, but the directors of

the survey believe that six is about all the respondents will tolerate

as part of the total telephone interview.

        At a time of sharply rising prices, the measurement of "real"

vs. "nominal" interest rates presents a major problem which is solved

only partially by including a question on expected inflation. The EXINFL

variable usually works as expected——opposite to INPINT——but the

coefficients are not always equal, and sometimes the signs are

inconsistent.

        The mean implicit interest rate in this survey of 30 percent per

annum is substantially lower than the rates reported in surveys by other

investigators. This rate is still high, however, compared to current

borrowing and lending rates, and high compared to the mean response to

the explicit interest rate question (14 percent). Wh the difference?

Also, although the implicit and explicit rates are significantly

correlated (r = .23 for the two—thirds of the sample with consistent

replies), why isn't the correlation higher?

        The pilot survey confirms our a priori expectation of a correla-

tion between schooling and time preference, but other types of data are

needed if we are to learn something about the direction of the causality.

The effect of time preference on health behavior and on health status is

usually in the expected direction, but is not always statistically

significant, and even when statistically significant the size of the

effect is frequently small. This may be partly the result of errors in

the measurement of time preference but may also indicate weaknesses in

specification of the model.

        For instance, the assumption that investment behavior is affected

only by time preference is probably unrealistic. Investments typically

involve uncertainty as well as time preference because future values of
                                   30




any variable, whether it be the price of a stock or the state of health,

cannot be known with certainty. Thus, individual attitudes toward risk

will also affect investment behavior. The uncertainty element is

probably particularly large in the case of investments in health such as

giving up cigarettes, eliminating fatty foods, jogging, and the like.

Even the best information available indicates only the average expected

benefit from such health investments; the return to any individual is

highly uncertain. Only a minority of cigarette smokers will actually

contract lung cancer, while giving up cigarette smoking does not provide

a guarantee against the disease. Therefore, individual differences with

respect to uncertainty can also affect health investment and health status.

        Psychologists Kahneman and Tversky, In their highly original and

provocative work on prospect theory [1979], have suggested that most

individuals prefer certain to uncertain gains, but prefer uncertainty to

certainty with respect to losses. For example, most individuals, when

offered a choice between A) a certain gain of $500 or B) an equal chance

to win $1,000 or nothing, will choose A. The same individuals, when

offered a choice between A) a certain loss of $500 or B) an equal chance

to lose $1,000 or nothing, will choose B.

        Such asymmetry in risk aversion, if applicable to health—related

behavior, could be important. Consider a person contemplating giving up

some current pleasurable activity or undertaking an unpleasant one in

return for the chance of an improvement in health status sometime in the

future. The immediate action involves a loss with a high degree of

certainty, but the future gain Is quite uncertain for the individual even

though it may be highly predictable, on average, for a large population.
                                    31




Thus, the stronger the individual's asymmetry with respect to uncertainty

(as described by Kahneman and Tversky), the less likely will he or she

undertake the health—enhancing action. This conclusion is unaltered if

one reverses the "framing" of the decision and thinks of the current

activity such as cigarette smoking as a "gain" (where certainty is

preferred) and the possibility of ill health in the future as the "loss."

Thus, individual differences in risk aversion may confound attempts to

measure time preference or to analyze the effects of time preference on

health.

          This survey and the analyses reported here also highlight problems

of measurement of health status and health investment. When health is

measured by subjective self—evaluation, the results are different from

those that are obtained when a composite health measure based on self—

evaluation, medical care utilization, symptoms and physical ability is

used. Problems in the measurement of health investment surface when we

examine a variable like exercise. It seems as if exercise is undertaken

for many reasons other than to improve health. These other reasons may

swamp an effect of time preference.      Perhaps more detailed questions

concerning the type and intensity of exercise would help.

          I conclude this report of exploratory research on a note of

cautious optimism. Crude but useful measures of time preference, health

investment, and health status can be obtained, even through very inexpensive

telephone interviews. Time preference is related to schooling, and also

shows some relation to health investment and health status. However,

none of the relationships found in these data are particularly strong.

Whether improvements in survey design, more accurate measurement of

variables, and better specification of models will produce more significant

results remains to be determined.

        3. There are, to be sure, many other possible explanations for

the correlation between schooling and health. For instance, persons with

better health endowments may be more efficient in schooling activities,

or their expected rate of return to schooling may be higher because of

their greater life expectancy. Conversely, the rate of return to

investment in health may be greater for those who have had more schooling.

This paper does not address all possible explanations; it focuses on

differences in time preference.

        8. The questionnaire was administered by psychologists at

Perceptronics in Eugene, Oregon.

        9. Stephen Cole also made many contributions to the design of

the questionnaire.

        10. A digit—raising technique was used to insure inclusion of

unlisted numbers.

        11. See Appendix A for a list of time preference questions.

        12. I am grateful to Amos Tversky for advice on this point.

       13. Approximately one—quarter of the respondents classified as

consistent chose "now" for all six questions and another one—quarter always

chose to wait. Their replies, while not inconsistent, are not as informa-

tive about consistency as the replies of those respondents who chose "now"

for some questions and "wait" for others.

        14. Given six questions, every possible set of replies can be

made consistent with a maximum of three reversals.

        15. This hypothesis was suggested by Phillip Farrell.

        16. Ceteris paribus, individuals with low rates of time discount

might accumulate more savings, might choose occupations with larger

on—the—job investment opportunities, etc.

        17. For example, a respondent who answered "now" to the first

four questions in Table 1 and "wait" to the next two, was assigned a rate

of 35.35 percent.

        18. A different set of values, based on a regression with a

different sample, yielded almost identical results to those reported here.

        19. Grossman's regression (for middle—aged males) comparable to

Regression 2 in Table 8, Part A, had a coefficient of .035 for schooling

and —.017 for age.

        20. No hospitalization in past year, no prescription drugs in

past week, no medical condition requiring regular visits to physician,

and fewer than three visits to physician in past six months. To be sure,

medical care utilization may reflect factors such as income and insurance

coverage as well as health status.

        21. The weak effect of schooling is attributable to the "symptoms"

and "utilization" measures of health status. When these measures are used

as dummy dependent variables in regressions equivalent to (3) in Table 8,

schooling is negatively (albeit not significantly) related to good health.

37. A working man should have life insurance equivalent to at
     least three times his annual income even if paying for
     this insurance means he would have to live on a tight                    _____
      budget.                                                                  37
38.   Most people spend too much time     worrying about the future           _____
      and   not   enough time enjoying themselves today.                       38
