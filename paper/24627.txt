Agents signal their type in a principal-agent model; the principal seeks to retain good agents.
Types are signaled with some ambient noise. Agents can choose to add or remove additional
noise at a cost. It is shown that monotone retention strategies, in which the principal keeps the
agent if the signal crosses some threshold, are generically never equilibria. The main result
identifies an equilibrium with a bounded retention zone, in which the principal is wary of both
excessively good and excessively bad signals: she retains the agent if the signal is “moderate” and
replaces him otherwise. The equilibria we uncover are robust to various extensions: non-normal
signal structures, non-binary types, interacting agents, costly mean-shifting, or dynamics with
term limits. We discuss applications to risky portfolio management, fake news and noisy
government statistics.

A BSTRACT. Agents signal their type in a principal-agent model; the principal seeks to retain
good agents. Types are signaled with some ambient noise. Agents can choose to add or remove
additional noise at a cost. It is shown that monotone retention strategies, in which the principal
keeps the agent if the signal crosses some threshold, are generically never equilibria. The main
result identifies an equilibrium with a bounded retention zone, in which the principal is wary of
both excessively good and excessively bad signals: she retains the agent if the signal is “mod-
erate” and replaces him otherwise. The equilibria we uncover are robust to various extensions:
non-normal signal structures, non-binary types, interacting agents, costly mean-shifting, or dy-
namics with term limits. We discuss applications to risky portfolio management, fake news and
noisy government statistics.

                                             1. I NTRODUCTION

We study a model of deliberately noisy signaling. An agent who privately knows his type (good
or bad) seeks to be retained by a principal. The principal wishes to retain a good type, and to
remove a bad type. The agent generates a noisy but informative signal centered on his type. He
can choose to amplify or reduce the precision of this process. But there are restrictions. First,
such actions are costly. Second, the signal structure is constrained by the type; specifically,
the mean of the signal is given by the type. Third, signals cannot be tampered with ex post:
specifically, the signal realization cannot be augmented nor reduced: there is no “free disposal.”
The principal observes the signal, and makes a retention or replacement decision.
A study of the equilibria of such a game is the subject matter of our paper.
Minimal though this model might be, it has several applications. An obvious setting is a political
campaign, in which candidates use debate, political platforms and advertising to signal their
competence or integrity relative to their opponents.1 Relatively incompetent candidates might use
innuendo, shows of strength or exaggerated claims (fake news!) as a way of pushing themselves
or denigrating the opposition: there is always the hope that the claims might catch on, as well as
the risk they could be debunked. Another setting is money management, in which an incompetent
money manager might overload on risk in the hope of scoring big. The principal — his client —
might be able to verify the portfolio at any one point of time, so that there is no chance of ex-post
“disposal” of financial returns, but may not be aware ex ante when a risky strategy is adopted.

A lawyer in danger of losing a case might call a high-risk witness, a government under pressure
might inject noise into official statistics or issue optimistic forecasts, an individual might make
outrageous claims about his own competence at a job interview which may or may not hold up
under further scrutiny, and so on.
In this setting, it might seem natural to study equilibria in which the principal uses a “monotone”
or threshold strategy; that is, she retains the agent when the signal realization is above some bar
and replaces him otherwise. Our first result (Proposition 1) is that such monotone strategies can
never be equilibria except for non-generic values of the parameters. Indeed, a generic equilib-
rium must invariably involve either bounded retention or bounded replacement; that is, bounded
intervals of signals in which retention or replacement occur (Proposition 2). Under the former,
bad agent types choose higher noise than their good counterparts. That noise can then generate
(possibly with low probability) very good and very bad signals. The principal therefore treats
both kinds of excessive signals with suspicion, and retains the agent if and only if the signal falls
in some intermediate bounded set. In short, she follows the maxim: “if it’s too good to be true,
it probably is.”
In contrast, under bounded replacement, a principal retains the agent if the returns are extreme.
In this equilibrium, a good type chooses higher noise, so a moderate signal is viewed with sus-
picion. This is a strange outcome, but it could happen; we provide examples. That said, we will
argue that of these two types of equilibria, bounded retention is the more reasonable and more
likely outcome. Indeed, for a wide range of parameters, a bounded retention equilibrium exists
(Proposition 3), and there is also an identifiable range in which it is the only kind of equilibrium
(Propositions 4 and 5): a bounded replacement equilibrium does not exist.
As already mentioned, there is no “free disposal” of signals. That is, the signal realization cannot
be manipulated ex post, neither “upward” nor “downward.” Consider two settings to illustrate
this. First, imagine the politician’s campaign or debate speech. Claims and promises are made,
some possibly verifiable and others not. This is the choice of noise: whether to be unflinchingly
precise and correct, or insinuatingly ambiguous. The noise then falls on the ears on the public,
which makes collective sense of it (or not). That collective sense — the realization — cannot be
taken back, or “freely disposed of.” Second, consider the money manager who looks after your
funds, takes possibly undue risk, and ends with a good outcome. If you are aware of his choice
of portfolio, then you have access to all realized rates of return, high or low, even though you do
not know ex ante what the right decisions are. So that realized rate cannot be manipulated, either
upward or downward, by the money manager, though in a setting where the portfolio cannot be
observed, a different assumption would be more natural.
The equilibria we uncover are robust to various extensions: non-normal signal structures that
satisfy a strong version of the monotone likelihood ratio property (Propositions 6 and 7 in Section
7.1), non-binary agent types (Proposition 8 in Section 7.2), interacting agents each with privately
known types (Proposition 9 in Section 7.3), or situations in which the agent can shift the means
of their signals, presumably at an additional cost (Section 7.4). We also introduce a simpler
variant of the model with costless choice of noise (Section 7.5 and Proposition 10), and apply
this variant to a dynamic version of the model with agent term limits, in which the principal’s
outside option from a new agent is endogenously determined (Proposition 11 in Section 7.6). We

discuss applications to risky portfolio management (Section 7.7), to the generation of noise via
fake news (Section 7.8), and to noisy government statistics (Section 7.9 and Proposition 12). We
end by relating and contrasting our model to Bayesian persuasion (Section 7.10).


                                    2. R ELATED L ITERATURE

While our main results are (to our knowledge) new, we are far from the first to study models
of deliberate vagueness or noise. The cheap talk literature beginning with Crawford and Sobel
(1983) can be thought of as a leading example of noisy communication. In that example nothing
binds the sender, because talk is cheap. In contrast, as explained above, our chosen communica-
tion structures must have mean equal to the true state, and the choice of structure is costly. It is
central to the analysis that each individual chooses a distribution over signals, rather than an an-
nouncement, and cannot hide the outcome ex post. This is related to the constraints in Kamenica
and Gentzkow (2011), on which more below; Section 7.10.
Dewan and Myatt (2008) examine a model of leadership in which an individual’s clarity in
communication is a virtue, in that it attracts attention and thereby generates influence. But clarity
also requires lower processing time from the audience, leaving more time for the audience to
listen to others. Therefore zero noise is not chosen, because a leader might wish to hold on to an
audience for longer, effectively dissuading them from listening to others.
Edmonds (2013) also studies the obfuscation of states (say by a dictatorial regime). While such
obfuscation occurs through the shifting of the mean signal with the use of a costly action, he also
considers the case in which the state is communicated in a deliberately noisy way, with mean
unchanged. The noise prevents coordination by receivers against the interests of the regime.
Edmonds restricts attention in his analysis (by assumption) to receiver-actions that are monotone
in the signal realization. In contrast, in our setting, the non-monotonicity of receiver actions is a
fundamental and robust outcome of the model.
Hvide (2002) studies tournaments with moral hazard where two risk-neutral agents compete for
a prize. The contractible variable is output, which is the result of their effort and a random
component. A risk-neutral committee wants to ensure that agents exert high costly effort. If
agents can costlessly increase noise in the random component of output (assumed to be normally
distributed), rewarding the agent with the highest realization of output will lead to an equilibrium
with low effort and high noise. If agents are rewarded depending on who gets closer to some
pre-stipulated, finite level of output, a high effort low noise equilibrium is achieved. To our
knowledge, Hvide’s is the only contribution that emphasizes this kind of non-monotoncity.
Finally, there is a literature on policy uncertainty (see, for example, Shepsle 1972, Alesina and
Cukierman 1990, Glazer 1990, Aragones and Neeman 2000, and Aragones and Postlewaite
2007), often referred to as “strategic ambiguity.” Candidates offer policy platforms which can be
more or less ambiguous, and this ambiguity generates uncertainty about the policies the candi-
date could implement were she to win the election. (An empirical analysis of strategic ambiguity
can be found in Campbell 1983.) Ambiguity here is the result of the trade-off faced by the can-
didate between winning the election and implementing a certain policy (either his ideal policy or
the most expedient one).

3.1. Baseline Model. An agent works for a principal. The agent can be good (g) or bad (b). He
knows his type. The principal doesn’t. She has a prior probability q ∈ (0, 1) that the agent is
good.2
At the end of a single round of interaction, to be described below, the principal decides whether
or not to retain the agent. Retention of an agent of type k = g, b yields an expected payoff of
Uk to the principal, with Ug > Ub . Non-retention yields the principal V ∈ (Ub , Ug ). The type-k
agent gets a payoff that we normalize to 1 if he is retained and 0 otherwise. The agent therefore
prefers to be retained regardless of type, while the principal prefers to retain the good agent.
The principal receives a signal from the agent, which is presumably indicative of his type. Based
on the realization of that signal, the principal decides whether or not to retain the agent. The
agent has some control over this signal, nor can he alter in any way the realization of the signal,
but he can affect its precision. Specifically, suppose that the signal is given by
                                                   x = θk + σk ,
for k = g, b, where θk is a type-specific mean with θg > θb ,  ∼ N (0, 1) is zero-mean normal
noise, and σk is a term that scales the noise. That is, the agent cannot shift the mean of his signal,
but he can modulate its precision. The principal does not observe σk , but observes the realization
of the signal. She then decides whether to retain or replace the agent.
There is a cost to modulating precision. That is, there is some “natural” baseline degree of noise,
but deviations from that baseline are costly in either direction. Specifically, we assume that there
is a smooth, strictly convex cost function c(σ), which reaches its minimum value (normalized
to zero) at some positive noise level σ = σ. So cost increases as we depart from σ in either
direction. Assume that c(0) = c(∞) = ∞; that is, it is extremely costly at the margin to be fully
precise or fully noisy. The former restriction is presumably self-explanatory. To understand the
latter, note that σ large implies that very good (and very bad) signals are generated with positive
probability, or equivalently, that the public evaluation of agent actions can be excellent or dismal.
In effect, we assume that it is costly to disguise one’s true characteristics and intentions in an
attempt to generate some chance that the evaluation will be positive.
Because V is the payoff to the principal from non-retention, the variable p ∈ (0, 1), defined by
(1)                                          pUg + (1 − p) Ub ≡ V ;
is interpretable as an “outside option probability” that leaves the principal indifferent between
retaining and replacing. How might this compare with q, the prior probability that the agent is
good? A salient benchmark case is p = q, but there may be systematic departures of p from q.
In a dynamic context, where the possibility of retaining a good agent is an option, p should not
be smaller than q, and may well be strictly larger.3 If, on the other hand, our current agent is an
ongoing hire about whom some (positive) information has already been received, then p could
    2On multiple types, see Section 7.1.
    3Let V be the equilibrium value of restarting an interaction in an infinite horizon setting, normalized by a discount
factor δ. Assume the principal gets utility from the agent in every period, though payoffs cannot be used as signals.
Once an agent is replaced, the principal gets V again. By (1), we have V = pUg + (1 − p) Ub . However, since

be smaller than q. We leave this issue open for now, though in a simple dynamic extension of our
model with term limits, in which V is endogenous, we will be able to pin the comparison down.

3.2. Equilibrium. Agent k chooses noise σk . The principal does not observe the choice of
noise, just some realization or signal x with distribution N (θk , σk2 ). The principal uses Bayes’
Rule to retain the agent if (and modulo indifference, only if)

                       4. P RELIMINARY R EMARKS ON R ETENTION R EGIMES

Recall that a retention regime is given by a set X of signals for which the principal will want to
retain the agent.

4.1. Trivial Retention Regimes. Two examples of retention zones are (a) “always retain,” so
that X = R, and (b) “always replace,” that is, X = ∅. As far as equilibrium regimes are
concerned, these are of little interest. Both generate complete indifference across the two types
as to the noise regime. If the cost function for noise is strictly increasing away from σ, then
σg = σb = σ in such an equilibrium. But then the expression in (4) must alter sign over different
values of x, knocking out either regime. Thus trivial equilibria do not exist in our setting.

4.2. Monotone Retention Regimes. An equilibrium regime is monotone if there is a finite
threshold x∗ such that the principal replaces the agent for signals on one side of x∗ , and retains
him for signals to the other side of x∗ .4 See Figure 1.

“replace the agent no matter what” is a feasible move for the principal at any date, we also have V ≥ (1 − δ)[qUg +
(1 − q) Ub ] + δV when our agent is a new hire, which implies that p ≥ q.
   4Whether x∗ is included or not doesn’t matter.

                                   F IGURE 1. The Symmetric Threshold x∗ (σ)

A monotone retention regime arises (and can only arise) when both types transmit with the same
noise σb = σg = σ.5 Then (4) reduces to the condition
                                                     θg + θb     σ2
(5)                                x ≥ x∗ (σ) :=             −         ln (β) ,
                                                        2      θg − θb
and in particular, the retention zone in a monotone equilibrium must be of the form X = [x∗ , ∞).
Loosely, x∗ (σ) is the threshold above which the principal deduces that a signal from two possible
noisy sources of equal variance is more likely to be coming from the higher-mean source. In fact,
this is the exact interpretation of x∗ (σ) when p = q, for then β = 1 and
                                                   θg + θb
                                                x∗ (σ) =    ,
                                                       2
which is the mid-point between the two means. Notice that x∗ is entirely insensitive to σ in this
case. When p = q, the decision to retain is just a matter of comparing two likelihoods, and
Panel A of Figure 1 makes it clear that the likelihood for the good type dominates to the right of
(θg + θb )/2. However, when p 6= q, retention is not simply dependent on relative likelihoods, but
also on how pessimistic or optimistic the principal feels about future agents, which is measured
by the ratio of q to p, as proxied by β. For instance, if q < p, then β is smaller than 1, and better
performance is required for the principal to retain the current agent; x∗ (σ) is higher for each σ
as β falls. Panel B of Figure 1 depicts the possible consequence of q < p (or β < 1) pushing
x∗ (σ) to the right of the midpoint between θb and θg , and possibly even to the right of θg .

4.3. Non-Monotone Retention Regimes. When agents of different types transmit at different
noises, the corresponding best response for the principal is never a monotone regime. For in-
stance, when the bad type chooses higher noise than the good type, there cannot be a single
threshold for retention. Good news — but only moderately good news — offer the best likeli-
hood ratios in favor of the good type, and will generate retention. But an extremely good signal
will be regarded as too good to be true: for those signals, the higher chosen variance of the bad

    5To see this, recall the retention condition (4), and notice that if σ 6= σ , then the resulting retention regime is
                                                                          g    b

type will dominate the lower mean, leading to a high likelihood that the signal was emitted by
the bad type. Panel A of Figure 2 illustrates this (the Figure presumes that β = 1).
On the other hand, if the bad type transmits at lower noise than the good type, the retention rule is
flipped. Now replacement occurs in some bounded interval of signal realizations, but elsewhere
the principal will actually retain. See Panel B of Figure 2. We make these observations more
formal in Proposition 2 of Section 6.3.

              5. M ONOTONE R ETENTION IS (A LMOST ) N EVER AN E QUILIBRIUM

Monotone retention is a natural focal point of inquiry. The types in our model are ordered, so
that all other things being the same, the good type is more likely to generate larger signals. In
this sense larger signals appear to be prima facie evidence that the type emitting them is good.6
Indeed, in our model, an equilibrium can involve monotone retention; see Online Appendix for
a specific example. But the example isn’t robust: in “almost all” cases, the answer is no:
Proposition 1. Generically, a monotone equilibrium can not exist. Specifically, given model pa-
rameters, there is at most one common value of σ that both players must choose in any monotone
equilibrium, and this value is pinned down independently of the cost function for noise choice.

For some intuition, consider any single retention threshold as in Figure 1. In this figure, the
threshold lies strictly between the types of the two agents. As already discussed, both agent types
must choose a common noise σ. But the incentives for each type push in opposite directions away
from σ: with the cost of noise disregarded, the good type benefits from lower noise, while the
bad type wants to amplify noise. Of course, the noise cost must be factored in, but the cost of
the desired move must be non-positive for one of the two types.7 It follows that at least one
   6For instance, in the context of a global game in which a sender can manipulate the noise with which signals
are emitted and seeks to prevent a coordinated attack against the sender, Edmond (2013) restricts his attention to
monotone responses. We should add, though, that noise manipulation is only one of several extensions that Edmond
studies in his paper, and it is not his main focus.
   7The common value of σ is either weakly to the left or to the right of σ, and the cost function is smooth.

equilibrium can exist in this case.
But it’s possible that both types lie on the same side of the threshold. We need to dig deeper to
handle such cases. Type k seeks to maximize

where x∗ is given by (5). Recall that both types need to choose the same value of σ for a

Equation (7) tells us that we will need to study the function φ(z)z; Figure 3 does so. Denote

∆ ln (β) − 2σ by z1 and ∆ ln (β) + 2σ by z2 . Given the shape of φ(z)z, Figure 3 indicates how
z1 and z2 must be located relative to each other: they must both have the same sign and generate
the same “height.” If ln(β) < 0, then both z1 and z2 are negative; see Panel A. If ln(β) > 0, then
both z1 and z2 are positive, as in Panel B. In each case, there is only one value of σ that can solve
this requirement; i.e., just one value that fits the first equality in (7). It is entirely independent of
the cost function for noise, and so the second equality cannot generically hold. (The Appendix
formalizes the argument.)

                  6. B OUNDED R ETENTION AND R EPLACEMENT R EGIMES

6.1. Two Possible Regimes. With monotonicity out of the way, we are left with equilibria in
which the two types choose different noise levels. In Section 4.3 we suggested that there could
only be two possibilities:
1. Bounded Retention. In a bounded retention equilibrium, the good type transmits with lower
noise than the bad type, and Panel A of Figure 2 applies. In this regime, the principal retains the
agent if the signal is good but not “too good.”
2. Bounded Replacement. In a bounded replacement equilibrium, the good type transmits with
higher noise than the bad type, and Panel B of Figure 2 is relevant. In this case, the principal
replaces the agent if the signal has moderate values, and retains him if the signal is extreme.
The reason that there are just these two possibilities, but no more, is evident from (4). Retention
or replacement zones are demarcated by values of the signal that solve a quadratic equation,
which has at most two real roots. The absence of a real root is indicative of a trivial “always-
retain” or “always-replace” regime that we have already ruled out. So there must be two real
roots, and therefore one of the two zones of retention or replacement must be a bounded interval,
with the other zone obviously being the complement of that interval.
Now, the quadratic criterion for replacement or retention is a feature of the normal distribution, so
we won’t make too much of it. It is perhaps possible that with more general signal distributions,
there is alternation between replacement and retention. But the general point is that one of the
two decisions must be guided by a bounded zone of signals (see Section 7.1 for more).

6.2. Equilibrium Conditions. It will be convenient to use the notation [x− , x+ ] to denote the
relevant interval when bounded retention occurs, and by [x+ , x− ] to denote the interval when
bounded replacement occurs. Figure 4 illustrates this by folding the real line on itself in a circle
so that the ends −∞ and +∞ are identified with each other. The zone of retention can then
10                              FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

always be thought of as the arc of the circle starting from x− and moving to x+ in a clockwise
direction. The Figure also depicts the weighted relative likelihood of good versus bad types given
their strategies; see the irregular ovals. If that likelihood lies “outside” the circle, the good type
is more likely; if inside, the bad type is more likely. Any such  equilibrium

which depicts the relative likelihoods for all realizations x. The principal is indifferent between
retaining and replacing at the points x− and x+ . Third, the weighted likelihood for the good type
must have a higher slope in x relative to that for the bad type, evaluated at x− , so that retention
occurs to the right of x− (again consult Figure 4). That means

6.3. Bounded Retention and the Type-Specific Choice of Noise. We now use these equilib-
rium conditions to make a case for bounded retention as the “more natural” outcome. Begin by
using (9) for x = x− in equation (10) to obtain
                                 σb2 − σg2 x− < σb2 θg − σg2 θb .
                                          

In the same way, use (9) for x = x+ in equation (11) to see that
                                 σb2 − σg2 x+ > σb2 θg − σg2 θb .
                                          

Combining these two inequalities, we must conclude that
                                   σb2 − σg2 (x+ − x− ) > 0

                        F IGURE 5. How Choice of Noise Varies With Agent Type


In light of this proposition, we ask which type has the incentive to use greater noise. Intuitively,
it would seem that this should be the bad type — after all, if the good type could communicate
with infinite precision, she would, while the bad type would seek to disguise her characteristics.
Proposition 2 states that in that case, a bounded retention equilibrium must obtain. And yet
matters are more complex than that. Infinite precision is not available except at infinite cost, and
within the realm of positive noise choices, the good and bad types may have marginal preferences
for noise that criss-cross each other. An analysis of these two possible equilibrium regimes is
therefore closely related to an understanding of noise choices.
Optimally chosen noise moves in a subtle and quite complicated way as a player’s type moves
relative to the retention zone. Figure 5, Panel A, illustrates this for a monotone retention thresh-
old. When a player’s type is outside the retention zone and far away from the threshold, it takes a
large amount of noise to create a significant probability that a signal will be generated within the
retention zone. That’s costly, so noise converges to σ as the type moves far from the retention
zone. Moving closer to the zone, noise increases, but reaches a maximum when the type is still
some distance away. The easiest way to understand this is to think of what happens when the
type is on the edge of the zone, at which point noise makes no difference to the chances of reten-
tion, so that the noise level is back to σ again. Now continue the process by moving the type into
the retention zone. In this case, noise can throw the player out of the zone, so she seeks to lower
it. Her optimum choice therefore falls below σ. But the downward movement does not continue
forever. Deep in the retention zone, the type is confident of remaining there, and so noise goes
up again, converging again to σ, but this time from below.
With bounded retention zones, the choice function exhibits even more non-monotonicities.8
Panel B of Figure 5 shows that there will generally be five turning points. There is one each
for either side of the retention zone, for the same reason as in the earlier discussion. There are
three more within the retention zone: noise initially falls as an agent with type close to the edge
avoids escape from the zone; then rises in the middle of the zone as the risk of escape falls, then
falls again as the risk goes up, and finally rises as we approach the edge. (The noise choice at the
edges is below σ, because the retention zone is bounded.)

6.4. Existence of Equilibrium With Bounded Retention. In what follows, we retain the com-
plexities discussed above as they are not merely technical but intrinsic to the economics of the
problem. But there are other complications that we did not emphasize. The single-peakedness
of the noise distribution generates a non-convexity in the agent’s optimization problem, which
raises the possibility that an agent’s choice could be multi-valued. For monotone or bounded
retention regimes, such multivaluedness is more a technical nuisance than a feature of any eco-
nomic import,9 and we rule it out by assumption:
[U] For every monotone or bounded retention zone and for each agent type, the optimal choice
of noise is unique.
It is possible to deduce [U] by placing alternative primitive restrictions on the parameters of the
model. One is that the curvature of the cost function is large enough. The Appendix shows that
a sufficient condition for [U] is
                                            κ
(13)                              c00 (σ) > 2 for all σ ∈ [σ∗ , σ ∗ ],
                                           σ
where κ ≈ 0.6626.
While [U] is a technical restriction of little economic import, the next assumption we impose
is substantive. To discuss it, begin by noting that there are distinct lower and upper bounds on
noise, call them σ∗ and σ ∗ , such that c(σ∗ ) = c(σ ∗ ) = 1. Obviously, σ∗ < σ < σ ∗ . Recalling
that we normalized the agent’s payoff from retention to equal 1, and from replacement to equal
0, it is obvious that no agent would ever choose a level of noise outside the interval [σ∗ , σ ∗ ].
Imagine that both agents transmit common noise equal to the upper limit σ ∗ . We know already
that the principal would respond by choosing a single threshold x∗ (σ ∗ ) for retention, described
by equation (5), reproduced here for convenience:
                                                  θg + θb      σ ∗2
                                    x∗ (σ ∗ ) =           −          ln (β) .
                                                     2      θ g − θb
We ask that this threshold must lie in [θb , θg ].
This implies a restriction on the parameters of the model; specifically, on β. The assumption
states that when the agent chooses common noise (equal to σ ∗ ), the principal will “start retaining”
from a threshold smaller than θg , and replace when a realized signal lies below θb . This requires
the weighted relative likelihood for the type being good or bad to flip sign at some intermediate
point between θb and θg . It should be noted that this condition is automatically satisfied when
β = 1, because in that case, as already observed, x∗ (σ ∗ ) = (θg + θb )/2. More formally, we can
write this condition as a set of restrictions on the extent to which β can depart from 1 “on either
side.” Do so by subtracting the formula for x∗ (σ ∗ ) from θb and then θg to obtain
                                                ∆2              ∆2
(14)                                       −         ≤ ln(β) ≤       .

Proposition 3. Under Conditions (14) and [U], there is an equilibrium with bounded retention.
   9For bounded replacement regimes, the possibility of multiple solutions is more natural. For instance, an agent
located in one of the two retention zones to the side, but close to the replacement zone, could be indifferent between
a small and a large choice of noise.

          F IGURE 6. Fixed-Point Mapping to Show Existence of Bounded Retention

The proof provides some intuition for the result, so we loosely outline it here. Begin by searching
for any equilibrium via a fixed-point mapping. The very first box in Figure 6 delineates the
domain of that mapping. No agent will choose noise below σ∗ or above σ ∗ , so we have a compact
domain. The image of this mapping is derived as follows: for each (σg , σb ), find the retention
decision of the principal, shown in the middle graph (where x− and x+ are chosen), and then
record the best response to that decision, shown by the continuation mapping into the last box, a
replica of the one we started from. A fixed point of this mapping will yield an equilibrium.
The problem is that this fixed point mapping is not well-behaved. For any point (σg , σb ) in
the domain with σb < σg , the planner will best-respond with bounded replacement, and the
“subsequent” response that completes the mapping is generally not continuous in (σg , σb ). This
discontinuity problem is endemic. Given that the retention region (under bounded replacement)
is made out of separated zones, the choice of two or more noise levels that maximize retention
probabilities is generally unavoidable. With that multiplicity in place, discontinuities in the
fixed-point mapping are unavoidable. The simplest fixed-point approach is a dead end.
However, given our specific interest in the existence of a bounded retention equilibrium, we
want to start from an even smaller domain, which is the shaded triangle in the left box, over
which σb ≥ σg . This subdomain is better-behaved — the principal chooses bounded retention
(or a monotone threshold) as a best response, and the best response by the agents to each such
retention policy is unique (by Condition U) and therefore continuous. But now the problem
is different: it may well be that the mapping slips out of the smaller domain. In general, this
slippage cannot be controlled. In Panel B of Figure 5, we have a bounded retention zone that
could arise from some “starting” (σg , σb ) with σb > σg . And yet in response, type g chooses
larger noise as illustrated, which propels the system out of the triangle. See the lower pair of
arrows in Figure 6.
At the same time, the mapping on the smaller domain has an interesting property. On the bound-
ary between the two subdomains, the mapping “points inwards” whenever (14) holds. Look at
the upper pair of arrows in Figure 6. The first arrow in the pair maps a point on the principal
diagonal of the square (where σb = σg ) to a monotone retention regime; that is, (x− , x+ ) is of
14                             FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

the form (x∗ , ∞). By our restriction on β in condition (14), x∗ must lie between θb and θg . So
the good type wants to reduce noise to remain within the retention zone, while the bad type wants
to increase it. That means that the good type must choose noise σb < σ, while the opposite is
true of the bad type. But that implies a best response with σb > σg , which takes us back into the
starting subdomain from its boundary. (It also implies, in passing, that under condition (14), a
monotone equilbrium cannot exist, whether generically or otherwise.) A fixed point theorem due
to Halpern (1968) and Halpern and Bergman (1968) then completes the argument, establishing
the existence of a bounded retention equilibrium when β does not take on “extreme” values.
In summary, we have shown that when p is not too far above q, and nor is it too far below q
— and certainly when it is equal to q — a bounded retention equilibrium must exist. Indeed, it
could be the only equilibrium:
Proposition 4. When β = 1, every equilibrium involves bounded retention. More generally:
(i) It cannot be that σb ≤ σ ≤ σg .
(ii) If σg < σ and β ≤ 1, then σb > σg and there can only be bounded retention.
(iii) If σg > σ and β ≥ 1, then σb > σg and there can only be bounded retention.

While these propositions are by no means a universal claim for bounded retention, it is true that
moderate values of β do appear to be incompatible with bounded replacement. In Section 6.5, we
will see that this is indeed the case: we can rule out bounded replacement equilibria for moderate
values β. The case β = 1 in Proposition 4 is a good benchmark: it means that the prior q on the
current agent equals the “effective prior” p on future agents.

6.5. Non-Existence of Bounded Replacement Equilibrium for Moderate β. Moderate values
of β are not only conducive to the existence of a bounded retention equilibrium, they push against
the existence of a bounded replacement equilibrium. For instance, assume that there is a sizable
difference between the two types; specifically, that
(15)                                      θg − θb ≥ σ ∗ ,
where recall that σ ∗ is defined by the larger of the two solutions to c(σ) = 1.
Proposition 5. Assume that Condition (14) used in Proposition 3 holds, and so does (15). Then
only bounded retention equilibria can exist.

While the Appendix contains a formal proof, it is easy enough to illustrate the main argument.
Consider the same fixed point mapping used to establish the existence of a bounded retention
equilibrium. The first component of this mapping takes noise choices (σg , σb ) ∈ [σ∗ , σ ∗ ]2 to
best responses by the principal of the form (x− , x+ ). These responses, as already noted, could
involve bounded retention (x− < x+ ), bounded replacement (x− > x+ ) or monotone regimes
(x+ = ∞). In all these cases, conditions (14) and (15) can be used to show that the bad type must
lie outside the retention zone, while the good type lies in it. Now consider the second component
of the fixed point mapping in which the agents react to these retention and replacement zones.
The Appendix formally shows that in all such situations, the bad type exerts more noise in a
quest to land inside the retention zone, while the good type attempts to reduce noise so as not

to wander out of it. In short, σb > σg . But now we’ve established that starting from any
(σg , σb ) ∈ [σ∗ , σ ∗ ]2 , the mapping points into the shaded triangle of Figure 6 in which σb >
σg . Consequently, every equilibrium must have σb > σg , which — as we know already from
Proposition 2 — must involve bounded retention.10
The heart of the argument for Proposition 5 concerns the location of types relative to replacement
and retention zones. Figure 7 illustrates the exceptions. The density for the bad type is the
thicker line in both cases. The Figure shows that β must be so large or so small (that is, either
q  p or p  q) so that the intersection points of the two weighted densities are either on one
side of both the mean types, or straddle them both.11 These are the only two possible kinds of
bounded replacement equilibria. For completeness, the Appendix provides examples for each
of them. In one, both types are embedded in the retention zone as in Panel A of Figure 7, with
x+ < x− < θb < θg . Because they want to remain there, both want noise lower than the ambient
level. But the bad type is closer to the edge, so he will make a bigger effort than the good type to
stay safe, and σb < σg . To justify this configuration as an equilibrium, β must be large: q  p.
In the second example, as in Panel B of Figure 7, both θb and θg lie in the replacement zone,
with x+ < θb < θg < x− , and both exert costly effort to escape it. The good type is embedded
closer to the edge of the zone and has a high marginal benefit of noise, while the bad type is
embedded deep in the zone and has only a low marginal benefit. The good type therefore exerts
greater noise. The principal reacts by choosing a bounded replacement zone. To implement this
equilibrium, the value of β must be very small; that is, we need to assume that p  q.

                                           7. VARIATIONS AND A PPLICATIONS

In this Section, we describe several variations on the model and discuss a few potential appli-
cations. Section 7.1 replaces the normality restriction by signal structures that satisfy a strong
   10In particular, the careful reader will have noticed that under the additional restriction imposed by (15), the
Halpern-Bergman theorem no longer needs to be invoked to prove Proposition 3; Brouwer will suffice.
    11This argument shows, in particular, that Panel B of Figure 2 — which we put forward as a possible candidate
for a bounded replacement equilibrium — cannot ever be a full equilibrium satisfying both best response conditions.

version of the monotone likelihood ratio property. Section 7.2 studies non-binary agent types.
Section 7.3 considers more than one agent, each with privately known type. Section 7.4 studies
situations in which the agent can shift the means of their signals, presumably at an additional
cost. Section 7.5 introduces a simpler variant of the model with costless choice of noise. Section
7.6 applies this variant to a dynamic version of the model with agent term limits, in which the
principal’s outside option from a new agent is endogenously determined. We discuss applications
to risky portfolio management (Section 7.7), to the generation of noise via fake news (Section
7.8), and to noisy government statistics (Section 7.9). We end by relating and contrasting our
model to Bayesian persuasion (Section 7.10).


7.1. Non-Normal Signal Structures. Consider the following generalization of our model: the
signal x is given by:
(16)                                      x = θk + σk ε,
where ε is distributed according to some differentiable density function f , which is positive on
all of R, with mean normalized to 0. The density for x given type k is
                                                          
                                              1     x − θk
                                   g (x|k) =    f
                                             σk       σk
Assume that f satisfies the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP) so that when two types
transmit with the same noise, larger signals are increasingly likely to be associated with the
higher type. Indeed, we assume that the relative likelihood for the good type climbs without
bound as x → ∞, while the opposite is true as x → −∞. Formally, we assume
Strong MRLP. f (z − a)/f (z) is increasing in z whenever a > 0, with
                             f (z − a)             f (z − a)
(17)                      lim          = ∞ and lim           = 0.
                         z→∞    f (z)         z→−∞    f (z)
In particular, the limit conditions ensure that a monotone regime is possible for any value of
β ∈ (0, ∞), provided both types use the same noise. The normal density satisfies (17).
Proposition 6. Assume the signal structure is the one in (16), and satisfies strong MLRP. Then:
(i) Generically, a monotone equilibrium can not exist. Specifically, given model parameters,
there is at most one common value of σ that both players must choose in any monotone equilib-
rium, and this value is pinned down independently of the cost function for noise choice.
(ii) All other equilibria will have σb 6= σg , and will involve either a bounded retention zone or a
bounded replacement zone.

This proposition follows the same argument as in the basic model. Strong MLRP delivers the
observation that “spreads dominate means,” which is the argument that sends likelihood ratios
for extreme signals in favor of the type using the higher spread. Therefore, a monotone equi-
librium can only arise if both types are choosing the same amount of noise. The non-genericity
of identical choices then follows lines similar to that for normal noise. The boundedness of
                                                 NOISY AGENTS                                                     17

either retention or replacement zones in equilibrium is an easy though not logically immediate
consequence.12
We end this section with two observations. First, the boundedness of retention (or replacement)
zones does not imply that such zones are necessarily intervals. Second, it would be useful to
establish an analogue of Proposition 3: that bounded retention equilibria do exist for a interme-
diate interval of β values. The following proposition goes some way towards answering both
questions.
Proposition 7. Assume that β ≥ 1. Then, if σb > σg , the principal retains if and only if the
signal falls within some bounded interval.

This proposition states that if β is at least 1 — that is, if p ≤ q — then the bounded retention
zone must be an interval. It is easy to combine this Proposition with analogues of Conditions U
and (14) to obtain an existence theorem. Specifically, if agents make unique choices of noise for
every bounded or monotone retention interval, and if β is not too large, then a bounded retention
equilibrium, which involves an interval for the retention zone, must exist.

7.2. Multiple Types. We extend Proposition 1 to many types. We can do so at a level of gen-
erality that nests the two-type case, but it is expositionally easiest to assume that there is a prior
on types given by some density q(θ) on R. Let Q be the space of all such densities and give it
any reasonable topology; for concreteness, think of Q as a subset of the space of all probability
measures on R with the topology of weak convergence. A subset Q0 of Q is degenerate (relative
to Q) if its complement Q − Q0 is (relatively) open and dense in Q.
Given q ∈ Q, each agent of type θ chooses noise σ(θ) as in the baseline model. Following the
choice of noise, a signal is generated. The principal obtains payoff u(θ) from type θ, where u
is some nondecreasing, bounded, continuous function. There is some given continuation payoff
— V — from replacing an agent, which reasonably lies somewhere in between the retention
utilities: limθ→−∞ u(θ) < V < limθ→∞ u(θ). We also make the generic assumption that u(θ)
is not locally flat exactly at V . As before, the principal maximizes expected payoff by deciding
whether or not to retain the agent after each signal realization, and agents do their best to get
retained, with the cost of noise factored in.
Proposition 8. Fix all the parameters of the model except for the type distribution. Then, under
Condition U, an equilibrium with a monotone retention regime can exist only for a degenerate
subset of density functions over types.

We outline the argument here (see Appendix for details). Think of a monotone retention regime
of the form [x∗ , ∞). Figure 5 describes the optimal noise response; it attains a maximum at some
distinguished value θ∗ < x∗ . This picture translates perfectly as we move x∗ around: θ∗ moves
with x∗ staying at a fixed distance t∗ from it, and this distance t∗ is completely independent of
the underlying density of types q(θ).
Now, we’ve already seen the sender with the highest noise enjoys the highest likelihood of having
transmitted signals at the extreme ends of the line. That must mean that conditional on such
  12In principle, a non-monotone equilibria could involve perennially alternating zones of retention and replacement.
18                              FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

extreme signals, the expected utility to the receiver must approximate u(x∗ −t∗ ). But then u(x∗ −
t∗ ) ≥ V , for if not, a very large positive signal would be met with replacement, contradicting
our presumption that the retention zone is [x∗ , ∞). But it can’t be that strict inequality holds,
for if it did, a very large negative signal would be met with retention, again contradicting our
presumption. In short, u(x∗ − t∗ ) = V . Because t∗ is fixed (as already argued), and because u is
not locally constant at V , this argument fully pins down the retention threshold x∗ independent
of the density of types.
But that points rather straightforwardly to a non-generic situation. After all, because x∗ is the
retention threshold, the receiver must be indifferent between replacement and retention at x∗ ;
that is, the expected utility at x∗ must be exactly V . But only a non-generic choice of density
can guarantee that happy coincidence.

7.3. Multiple Agents. We’ve assumed that there is a single agent of unknown type. Suppose
there are two agents, 1 and 2, who simultaneously signal their types, and the principal must
decide which agent to retain. She wants to retain the better agent — or one of them, if she is
indifferent. This sort of structure brings us closer to a model of political campaigns.
Assume that it is common knowledge that only one of the two agents is good. The agents know
their own types and therefore both types. But they look identical ex-ante to the principal, so her
prior places equal probability on the two. The communication technology is unchanged:
(18)                                    xi = θk(i) + σk(i) εi ,
where i = 1, 2, and k(i) denotes i’s type. The errors are independent and identically distributed
standard normal random variables. In this game, by symmetry, a strategy for agent i is a function
σ : g, b → R+ . As for the principal, a strategy is a function r : R2 → {1, 2}, which indicates
for every possible pair of signals (x1 , x2 ) the agent she wants to retain. After observing (x1 , x2 )
the principal retains agent 1 if (and, modulo indifference, only if)

In this setting, a monotone equilibrium is defined as one where the principal retains the agent
with the higher signal value. Once again, monotonicity can only be achieved if both types of
agent play the same σ, but that won’t happen.
Proposition 9. If an equilibrium exists, it can only be the case that σb > σg , and the principal
retains agent 1 if and only if |x1 − x̂| ≤ |x2 − x̂|, where x̂ = (σb2 θg − σg2 θb )/(σb2 − σg2 ) is

                                                                               b
                                                                                   . In particular,
monotone equilibria do not exist.

The proof of this proposition is long and involved, and we relegate it to the Online Appendix.
Intuitively, when both types choose the same level of noise, the principal retains the one with the
higher signal realization. But the bad type then wants to inject additional noise, since the good
                                                NOISY AGENTS                                                 19

type has a lot of probability mass around his (higher) mean. At the same time, and for the same
reason, the good type wants to decrease noise.
Next, assume an equilibrium features σb < σg . If this is the case, the principal will respond by
retaining the agent whose signal is further away from x̂ = (σb2 θg − σg2 θb )/(σb2 − σg2 ), which is
                                                                     
                                                     x−θ
the value that minimizes the likelihood ratio σ1g φ σg g / σ1b φ x−θ
                                                                   σb
                                                                      b
                                                                          , and it is to the left of θb .
Then, it turns out that the best way for the bad type to escape from defeat is to inject additional
noise (whereas it is unclear whether the good type wants to increase noise or precision), so σb >
σ. This, together with the fact that the conjectured equilibrium features c0 (σb ) σb > c0 (σg ) σg
(see the proof), implies that σb > σg , and hence a contradiction.
Our result bears a broad resemblance to Hvide (2012), who studies tournaments with moral
hazard, when agents can influence both the mean and spread of their output. In equilibrium,
there is excessive risk taking. By setting an intermediate value for output and rewarding the
agent who gets closer to this threshold, the principal can do better.

7.4. Mean-Shifting Effort. We can easily augment the baseline model to include effort to shift
the mean value of one’s type. For instance, suppose that each agent k is endowed with some
baseline value (or type) θk (with θg > θb ). He can augment θ using a cost function d(θk − θk ),
common to both types, where d defined on R+ is increasing, strictly convex and differentiable,
with d0 (0) = d (0) = 0. The signal sent is then given by xk = θk + σk ε. Finally, the principal
makes a decision to retain or replace.
Parts of this model fully parallel our setting. The principal makes her decisions on the basis of
conjectured means and variances chosen by each type, leading to the familiar conditions (9)–(11)
for the retention edge-points x− and x+ . Similarly, an agent of type k maximizes the probability
of retention net of cost. Whether or not x− is smaller or larger than x+ (and even when x+ =
∞ as it will be with monotone retention), the agent always maximizes Φ ([x+ − θk ]/σk ) −
Φ ([x− − θk ]/σk ) − c (σk ), but this time by choosing both σk and θk . The first-order condition
for σk is unchanged; what this extension adds is a first-order condition for θk , given by
                                                        
                      1      x − − θk       1     x+ − θ k
(20)                     φ               − φ                 ≤ d0 (θk − θk ) ,
                     σk         σk          σk       σk
with equality holding if θk > θk . This additional condition can be used to show that the extension
fully mimics the original model: we must have θb < θg , with other choices of noise and principal
decisions just as in our baseline setting; see Online Appendix for details.
This extension is also useful for understanding other aspects of the noisy relationship between
principal and agent. For instance, mean-shifting effort for the sake of retention could be directly
valuable to the principal, apart from providing information about type.13 If neither that effort nor
the payoff-relevant “output” from it is contractible, then the principal could want to structure her
environment to keep agent effort high. Of particular interest is the case in which the background
noise σ is close to zero, so that the agents can communicate their types with very high precision.

   13For other models of relational contracts in which effort provides both current output and information about
match quality, see, Lipnowski and Kuvalekar (2016), Kostadinov and Kuvalekar (2016) and Bhaskar (2017).
20                             FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

In general, this limit model has several equilibria, some pooling and some separating. To see the
issue that arises, let’s concentrate on a particular parametric configuration in which θg and θb are
sufficiently separated from each other so that
(21)                                     d (θg − θb ) > 1.
In this case it is easy to see that there can be only separating equilibria in zero-ambient-noise
limit. In each such equilibrium, the bad type exerts no effort whatsoever. The principal cannot
incentivize the agent because there is no noise in the signal. Both types reveal themselves per-
fectly. There are still many equilibria possible in which the good type is forced to exert effort
to raise θg beyond θg , simply because the principal’s retention set is some singleton {θg } with
θg > θg . But these equilibria are shored up by the “absurd belief” that observations between θg
and θg are attributable to the bad type. These configurations can be eliminated by standard re-
finements, leaving only the least-cost separating equilibrium in which retention occurs if x = θg ,
and no agent exerts any effort at all. Condition (21) guarantees that the bad type will not want to
mimic the good type in this case.
If mean-shifting effort is separately valuable to the principal, this outcome is undesirable to
her. The solution will therefore involve the principal adding noise, thereby ensuring that the
bad type has some chance of being retained, and so incentivizing him. In any equilibrium of
such an extended model in which the principal can move first, the principal will choose σ > 0,
endogenously injecting noise into the system.


7.5. A Variant With Costless Noise. Our results assume a smoothly convex noise cost function.
Of course, this assumption is consistent with the choice of noise being essentially costless over
a wide range, as long as the cost mounts up at “either end.” In this section, we consider a simple
but attractive variant of our model: suppose that any level of noise can be costlessly chosen, as
long as it is no smaller than σ. Any choice smaller than σ is impossible. The condition σ > 0 is
a minimal requirement for the problem to have any interest: otherwise, the high type can always
reveal himself by choosing σg = 0, and there is nothing to discuss. Let’s call this the costless
noise model.
This costless noise variant admits a particularly sharp solution. Define a function α (β) by
                                                                              
                                 1                              α (β)
(22)              β≡           q               exp −           q              .
                                             2                               2
                       α (β) + 1 + α (β)               α (β) + 1 + α (β)

Notice that α(β) is well-defined, that α(β) > 0 for all β < 1 and α(β) → 0 as β → 1. We will
assume that σ is small enough so that:
                                   σ      1
(23)                                     < α(β)−1 if 0 < β < 1.
                                θg − θ b  2
and
                                   σ      hp         i−1
(24)                                    <    2 ln (β)    if β > 1
                               θ g − θb
                                                   NOISY AGENTS                                                      21

Notice how these conditions become progressively weaker as β converges to 1 from either direc-
tion; that is, as p and q get close. At p = q or close to it, no restrictions are imposed at all; both
right-hand side terms in (23) and (24) diverge to infinity.
One annoying price to pay for this simpler model is that without an upper bound to noise, there
could be a fully uninformative in which both types babble with infinite noise and the principal
always retains or always replaces. We ignore such equilibria. Following this line, say that
an equilibrium is nontrivial if the principal retains the agent for some signals and replaces for
others.
Proposition 10. (i) A nontrivial equilibrium exists if and only if (23) is satisfied, and when it
exists, it is unique.
(ii) If (24) is also satisfied, then the nontrivial equilibrium involves bounded retention. In it,
the good type chooses σg = σ, the bad type chooses higher but finite noise σb > σg , and the
principal employs a strategy of the form: retain if and only if the signal x lies in some bounded
interval [x− , x+ ].
(iii) In particular, if p ≥ q so that β ≤ 1, then (24) trivially holds and the equilibrium must
involve bounded retention.
(iv) If (24) happens to fail, then the nontrivial equilibrium involves a monotone retention regime,
with both types choosing noise equal to σ. The principal retains if and only if x ≥ x∗ (σ).

We relegate a formal proof to the Online Appendix.
In particular, Proposition 10 asserts that when p = q there is a unique equilibrium, with no
restrictions at all on σ; both (23) and (24) are vacuous. As in our baseline model, when p = q,
only bounded retention equilibria are possible. More generally, suppose that p ≥ q, which
applies to any situation in which there is some option value on a hired agent over and above
the prior on him. Condition (24) imposes no restriction in this case, and we will now argue
(loosely) that a nontrivial equilibrium must use bounded retention. If this assertion is false, then
a nontrivial equilibrium must involve either bounded replacement or a monotone threshold. The
former is easily dispensed with — with bounded replacement, either type would want to inject
unboundedly high noise to minimize the chances of landing in the replacement zone.14 As for
the latter, suppose that the principal employs a single retention threshold given by x∗ ∈ (θb , θg ).
Then the good type wants to minimize noise in order to pull more probability mass into the
retention region, whereas the bad type wants to increase noise. This is incompatible with a
monotone retention regime. On the other hand, if x∗ > θg , both agents will react by wanting to
inject additional noise. We are therefore left only with bounded retention, and the formal proof
shows that such an equilibrium must exist under Condition (23).15

   14The non-existence of bounded replacement survives more robust arguments which allow for a finite upper bound
to the choice of noise. See Online Appendix for more details.
    15It is possible that in equilibrium, the principal discards both types of agents irrespective of signal, simply be-
cause the option value of a new agent is too high and the minimum noise σ in the current environment too large.
Condition (23), which bounds σ, is necessary and sufficient for eliminating this possibility. Moreover, in any reason-
able “general-equilibrium closure” of this model, the failure of (23) is absurd: if both types are let go, where would
22                                 FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

Finally, when q > p, that the receiver is pessimistic about new hires and is inclined to keep the
current agent. Now Condition (23) is empty, and a nontrivial equilibrium always exists. Under
a symmetric choice of noise, it is entirely possible that the retention threshold falls below θb .
Faced with that low threshold, both types will want to reduce noise to the minimum possible,
and now there is scope for a nontrivial equilibrium with monotone retention regime, in which
both types choose noise σ, while the receiver employs a single threshold x∗ (σ). That scope
dwindles, however, when σ is small: the smaller it is, the more sharply is the receiver able to
distinguish between good and bad types. Condition (24) on σ is necessary and sufficient for
eliminating the monotone equilibrium.


7.6. Dynamics With Term Limits. So far we have studied a static setting, but at the same time
we’ve hinted more than once that the “outside option probability” p could, in principle, be solved
for in a dynamic setting. We study the case in which the agent has a two-period “term limit,” after
which he must be replaced. This is useful for applications to politics, and also — but perhaps
in a more limited way — to situations in which the agent is an employee or a contracted expert,
such as a fund manager. In what follows we study stationary equilibrium, in which every new
agent of a given type takes the same action independent of history.
For noise σk for each player of type k, and for each realization x, the Bayes’ update on q is
                                                        qπg (x)
(25)                                          q(x) :=           ,
                                                         π(x)
where for each k, the density of signal x is given by πk (x) = (1/σk )φ ([x − θk ]/σk ), and where
π(x) = qπg (x) + (1 − q)πb (x) is the overall density of signal x.
We can use this information to calculate the lifetime payoff to the principal at the start of any new
interaction. To this end, let M (q 0 ) := q 0 Ug + (1 − q 0 )Ub be the expected payoff to the principal
in any period when her prior (for that period) is given by q 0 . This prior equals q for a fresh draw
from the pool at any date. At the end of the first term, a signal x is generated, and the prior q is
updated to q(x). At this stage, the principal decides whether or not to retain for one more period,
after which the term limit kicks in.
If V denotes the normalized lifetime payoff to the principal starting from a fresh agent, we can
define a retention zone X as the set of all x for which (1 − δ)M (q(x)) + δV ≥ V . The lifetime
value to the principal can then be expressed as
                                 Z                                        Z
         V = (1 − δ)M (q) + δ        [(1 − δ)M (q(x)) + δV ] π(x)dx + δ       V π(x)dx
                                       X                                              Xc
            = (1 − δ) [q(1 + δΠg )Ug + (1 − q)(1 + δΠb )Ub ] + δ [1 − (1 − δ)Π] V,
               R
where Πk := X πk (x)dx is the type-dependent probability of retention, and Π := qΠg +
(1 − q)Πb is the overall probability of retention. (The second equality above follows from the
definition of M and (25).) Transposing terms, we see that V is a convex combination of baseline

the optimism regarding a new agent come from in the first place? We formalize this argument in Section 7.6, when
we endogenize p.

utilities Ug and Ub ; i.e., V = pUg + (1 − p) Ub , where
                                              q (1 + δΠg )
                                         p=                       .
                                       1 + δ [qΠg + (1 − q) Πb ]
We can rewrite this expression to obtain a “general equilibrium formula” for the ratio β:
                                          q 1−p         1 + δΠb
(26)                              β=                 =           .
                                        1−q p           1 + δΠg
Now observe that in any equilibrium, Πg ≥ Πb . That has to be the case, because the principal
can — and will — choose a retention zone that retains the high type at least as often than the low
type. Indeed, it is not even possible to have β equal to 1 in any equilibrium.16
This setup reveals a clear strategy to solve the two-term dynamic extension of our model. For
some (provisionally given) value of β, we obtain the baseline static model. Solve for the equi-
librium there. That equilibrium will generate retention probabilities Πg and Πb . The circle is
closed by the additional condition that (β, Πg , Πb ) must solve (26).
Our costless noise variant in Section 7.5 is particularly amenable to solving for the details. In
that model, noise is costless but bounded below by some number σ > 0. In this setting, we have:
Proposition 11. When agents can be hired for up to two terms, and the principal always has the
option to replace agents with a new draw from a stationary pool, there is a unique equilibrium
which has all the properties of the non-trivial equilibrium identified in Proposition 10. In partic-
ular, there are no trivial equilibria. Moreover, in this unique equilibrium, p > q and conditions
(23) and (24) do not need to be assumed.

Proposition 11 says that in a dynamic extension of the model in Section 7.5 with a two-term
limit, the equilibrium picks out precisely the two-threshold equilibrium with bounded retention
regime, as described in Proposition 10 of the static model. Observe that that equilibrium in the
static model does not always exist; after all, σ needs to be small enough as described in conditions
(23) and (24). Those conditions are automatically satisfied here. So Proposition 11 is not just a
mere refinement of the static equilibrium that eliminates all monotone and trivial equilibria. It
does that, to be sure, but in addition it guarantees that for any value of σ > 0, the dynamically
determined value of p must adjust itself so that conditions (23) and (24) are automatically met.

7.7. Risky Portfolio Managers. Suppose that an investment advisor (the agent) manages your
(the principal’s) money. There are good managers and bad managers. Both managers generate
uncertain returns on your portfolio. Assume that you have no idea which stocks are likely to
yield good returns: if you did, presumably you would be managing your money yourself. You
do have some aggregate idea of the distribution of returns, though, perhaps calibrated to the ex
post performance of stock indices or the range of returns over various investment funds.
In this setting, you effectively observe just the net return x on the portfolio built for you by the
manager. You might observe the portfolio as well, but if you know very little about individual
   16Suppose β = 1. Then p = q, and we know that in the static model only bounded retention equilibria are
possible. But in that situation the principal can strictly discriminate in favor of the good type, since there will always
exist two distinct real roots to (4). But now Πg > Πb , which contradicts our starting point that β = 1.
24                                   FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

stocks this will mean little or nothing to you. In short, you cannot use the portfolio to judge the
wisdom of the agent’s strategy.17 (This is a crucial point to which we return below.) Managers
can come in different types; these can be modeled by the amount of knowhow they have about
the prospects of various stocks, summarized in some mean return. To achieve these mean returns
they must take on some risk, so this minimal noise in their performance corresponds to σ. But
they can also take (mean-preserving) risks.18
Our model then tells us that bad managerial types will endogenously load up on financial risk
so as to try and achieve good returns. On average, the bad manager can never beat the good
manager, but he can bet on a more risky portfolio with the hope that the now riskier payoffs fall
in the retention interval. So you, the principal, should be suspicious not just when returns are
low, but also when returns are excessively high. It is not because you fear risk-taking per se;
in this setting you only care about expected payoffs. The central point is that there are career
concerns at work which manifest itself through excessive risk-taking.
The specific point on risk-taking, or “churning,” is not new. Dasgupta and Prat (2003) consider
a two-period economy where fund managers face career concerns. The manager trades a single
asset for a principal who decides whether to retain the manager or not (the manager can also not
trade at all). The good ones can read the fundamentals; specifically, they know the precise value
v of the asset, drawn from some binary set and to be revealed to the public in period 2. The
bad manager is like any other member of the public. The principal would like to retain the good
manager, and replace the bad manager with a fresh draw from the managerial pool.
Since, before taking the retention decision, the principal observes whether the manager sold,
bought, or did nothing, there is an incentive for the bad manager to trade. Since he doesn’t know
what the real value of the asset is, the manager randomizes between selling and buying. That is,
in equilibrium, the bad managers churn.
What does not emerge from the Dasgupta-Prat analysis is our notion of a bounded retention
interval: that a principal discards a manager who performs “too well,” under the suspicion that
he has been engaged in excessive risk-taking. We do not claim any empirical support for this
prediction, though anecdotal evidence on financial ventures or Ponzi schemes that promise (and
initially deliver) high rates of return suggests that careful individuals often stay away from such
ventures — to be sure, others don’t. We simply put this forward as a necessary corollary of our
result, one that perhaps deserves some empirical scrutiny.
In the Dasgupta-Prat model, a strategy for the agent is defined in terms of a mapping from type
to action. That is, the action is observed and has meaning for the principal. In our setting,
we effectively assume that the action isn’t observed. The principal has very little idea of the
huge universe of financial assets available, and cannot conceive of a strategy in these terms. We
can therefore model strategy as a choice of (unobserved) risk. This distinction is important. If
     17Of course this is an exaggeration, as some excessively risky ventures may be commonly understood to be risky.
Eliminate these from consideration here.
    18Our model fits this story well but not perfectly. Ideally, we would allow managers to choose both the mean and
the variance of the portfolio. The latter could well be costless — imagine loading pure risk on by the use of options,
for instance. The former would require costly effort that would vary with manager type. This extended model — in a
dynamic setting — is pursued in McClellan and Ray (2018).

actions are observed and can be interpreted — e.g., if buying or selling is known to be generically
optimal — then a separating equilibrium cannot exist in which the bad type does, say, nothing.
For if there is action separation, the actual outcome of the action (the return itself) would have
no additional informative value, and the bad type could break the equilibrium by deviating to the
action of the good type. That consideration, by itself, is enough to deliver the churning outcome.
Moreover, ex post, the good outcome is always a good reason for retention.

7.8. Fake News and Noise. The ever-increasing prevalence of noise, typified by the presence
of unverified media claims, has been a central characteristic of the recent political landscape
in several countries. This is in line with a model of heterogeneous candidates, who seek to be
“retained” by the median voter (who plays the role of the principal in this example). While
not claiming that this is all that was at stake in, say, the 2016 US elections, our proposition
suggests a rationale for the endogenous injection of noise when there is substantial heterogeneity
in candidate competence.
A bad politician cannot fully imitate a good politician. What he can do is to try to look like a
good politician to the extent possible, or (what is the same) to try not to look like a bad politician
to the extent possible. That implies being ambiguous, inconsistent and generally obscure about
attributes, intentions, and policy agenda, and encouraging the spread of fake news. A potential
voter might interpret the vague messages in many different ways, both positive and negative. So
in this argument, one might think of the signal space as being the public’s diverse interpretations
of the politician’s messages.19 It is in this sense that “fake news” can be thought of as noise.
Figure 8 shows an excel sheet (and a blown-up snippet) which purports to be the records of a
now-defunct company, The Sahara India Group, which was implicated in Ponzi schemes. These
files were apparently seized in a raid on the company. They detail large cash payments apparently

   19To the extent that such interpretations are themselves stochastic, this also justifies the assumption of some
ambient noise, that is, σ > 0.

made — and dutifully recorded — to the erstwhile “CM Gujarat,” Narendra Modi. The docu-
ments certainly appeared to convince Paranjoy Guha-Thakurta, then Editor of the prestigious
Indian publication, The Economic and Political Weekly:
“While the documents include the names of just about every important politician in India, cutting
across party lines, often with figures written or typed next to them in Hindi and English, the
records relating to the alleged payments made to Modi [and others] are distinct . . . [S]pecific
dates, amounts and persons who apparently delivered the cash have been mentioned.
I first learnt about the existence of these documents on 28 July 2016 from the member of par-
liament and well-known lawyer Ram Jethmalani, who was expelled from the BJP in May 2013
. . . ” (Guha Thakurta 2016).
The last line of this quote should, however, raise a red flag: Modi, now Prime Minister of India,
is at the helm of the Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP, which expelled Jethmalani. There is also
the question: would such illegal payments be faithfully recorded in excel files for posterity, or
might these files be fake? For the purpose of this paper, the answer is irrelevant: what matters
is the noise that such “news” creates, even among respectable observers of Indian politics as the
individual quoted here.

7.9. Lies and Statistics. Researchers studying Argentina’s official macroeconomic statistics
have expressed cynicism about the reliability of the data. For instance, Cavallo (2013) observes
that over October 2007 to March 2011, the inflation rate calculated from online prices was nearly
three times higher than the official estimate.20 Cavallo concludes:
“This supports the widespread suspicion that the government has been manipulating the CPI
since January 2007, when it intervened in the National Statistics Institute (INDEC). The impli-
cations for other statistics are significant. For example, using an online-adjusted cost for the
subsistence-level CBA basket, the share of the population in extreme poverty during the first
quarter of 2011 rises from 2.5% in official estimates to 6.69% . . . The implications for real GDP
are equally impressive. If the GDP deflator had behaved like the online index since 2007, the
real GDP annual growth rate would have been just 0.5% by March 2011, much lower than the
10% officially reported.”
These discrepancies may be viewed as a large increase in the noise around the statistics, as
the official data lose credibility. For instance, Drenik and Perez (2017) model the situation as an
increase in the variance of the public signal about the aggregate level of prices. Price-setters, who
are Bayesian updaters, put less weight on the official estimates and more on their idiosyncratic
signals (which are inherently dispersed). In short, the negative credibility shock forces agents to
refer to other measures of inflation (most of them from the private sector). With this interpretation
in mind, our model helps us predict when such disinformation is likely to increase.
We do this by studying the costless noise model from Section 7.5. We carry out comparative
statics on q (our prior on the government), which is affected by aggregate shocks to the economy.
For instance, there could be a recession or a currency crisis that induces the principal (or public)
to update negatively on the type of the agent (or government). That is, the shock reduces the
     20
      The same is not true of Brazil and Chile, where the two estimates are roughly in line.

value of β = [q/(1 − q)][(1 − p)/p]. We might then ask: how does this reduction affect the
equilibrium degree of noise in the system, as well as the retention zones employed by the public?

Proposition 12. There exists an interval [βl , βh ] such that:
(i) When β lies in this interval, a decline in β (or a fall in the prior that the agent is good) causes
the bad type to increase noise σb , while the good type continues to choose σ. The retention
interval [x− , x+ ] shrinks.
(ii) When β < βl , so that the prior on the agent is low enough compared to the outside option,
then there is no equilibrium in which the principal retains the agent.
(iii) When β > βh , both types of agents minimize noise to σ and a monotone retention rule is
followed. The retention threshold, x∗ (σ), increases as β decreases.

The bounds on β follow readily from Proposition 10, while the comparative statics in part (i)
of Proposition 12 require a separate proof; see the Online Appendix. When β is low enough,
Condition (23) is jeopardized, and the existence of a nontrivial equilibrium of any kind is threat-
ened. Define βl by the requirement that (23) holds with equality. For β < βl , then, there is
very little faith in the agent, who is invariably replaced irrespective of performance. On the other
hand, when β is high enough, Condition (24) is jeopardized, and Proposition 10 tells us that as
this threshold is crossed, the retention regime turns monotonic. Both types choose low noise.
Indeed, βh is defined by the requirement that (24) must hold with equality.
When β lies between the two thresholds, Proposition 12 has additional content. It states that
as an agent’s credibility falls, he tends to inject noise into the system in a risky attempt to stay
afloat.
Applied to Argentina, our story suggests that the government’s monetary policy produced in-
creasing inflation which, as it continued to escalate, negatively impacted on the belief of the
public in the government. That translated in higher noise in the inflation statistics in an increas-
ingly risky effort to hide the truth, thereby protecting the chances of re-election (or access to
any other “reward”). Notice that for this strategy to work, the public at large should not be sure
about the government’s policy per se. The public should not be able to observe or understand the
process of manipulation (σb is non-observable); it only sees a noisy signal of the outcome and
makes an inference. If the process is observed, then as in our comments on Dasgupta-Prat, the
process itself would reveal the government’s type and the attempted manipulation would have
no effect whatsoever in persuading the public. At least some (relevant) subset of the public must
trust — or be expected to trust — the official reports.
More generally, this interpretation of our result states that in economies with worse macroeco-
nomic outcomes, deliberate “measurement error” will be larger.


7.10. Persuasion. Our model is related to Bayesian persuasion, a theme pursued in Kamenica
and Gentzkow (2011). In that model, there is a sender (the agent) and a receiver (the principal).
The receiver observes a signal sent by the sender and uses Bayes’ rule to update her prior. The
28                                   FRANCISCO ESPINOSA AND DEBRAJ RAY

sender wants to choose a signaling structure to maximize the chances that the receiver’s poste-
rior will cross a certain threshold (in our case, a threshold probability that the sender is of an
acceptable type). He has no constraints in choosing the machine that generates signals.
In this setting, and in contrast to ours, it is presumed that the sender does not know his type
before he chooses the signal structure, and he cannot re-optimize after knowing his type. In
addition, the sender’s choice of structure is observed by the receiver. This has no effect on
retention rules: after all, whether the receiver actually sees the choice of structure or predicts
it in equilibrium makes no difference. But a contemplated deviation by the sender will have
repercussions for receiver behavior that the sender will need to take into account. (That isn’t
the case in our model.) Just as an illustration, consider the possible choice (σb , σg ) and suppose
that σb ≥ σg . Then we know that the receiver-principal will retain in some zone [x− , x+ ], with
endpoints solving (3) with equality when σb > σg , or equaling [x∗ (σ), ∞) in case σb = σg = σ.
Forgetting for a moment about the cost of noise, the sender’s ex-ante payoff (before he knows
his type) is therefore
                                                                                 
               x + − θg         x − − θg                      x + − θb          x− − θ b
       q Φ                −Φ                  + (1 − q) Φ                −Φ                   ,
                  σg               σg                            σb                 σb
where Φ is the standard normal cdf, and outside options has been normalized to zero.
Now notice that the ratio q/(1 − q) — call it π — enters into the sender’s optimal choice of
(σb , σg ). In our formulation it doesn’t, because the sender’s choices are not directly observed by
the receiver. In our model the bad type will increase σb when he needs to, knowing that receiver
decisions are frozen in equilibrium. But in the persuasion version, receiver decisions will be
affected. In particular, if θg − θb is big enough and π is big enough, the sender will refrain
from setting σb too high, so allowing his good incarnation a greater latitude to separate himself
and therefore be more easily retained by the receiver. This restraint disappears when the sender
cannot observe the choice of signal structure, as in our formulation.
Indeed, if the sender’s choice of structure were to go unobserved, the two models — ours, in
which the sender knows his type, and the ex ante version, in which he doesn’t — would be
equivalent. As in any other Bayesian game, this variant would be the same as one in which each
type chooses a separate signal structure to maximize expected utility (this paper).21 On the other
hand, another variant of the model in which we retain our private information assumption, but
permit the principal to observe the agent’s choice (of signal structure) is not the same as the
model studied here. After all, the observed choice itself would intrinsically carry information.
See our comments above on Dasgupta and Prat (2003) for more details.
In summary, the two models address very different real-world situations. In our model an agent
has a piece of private information (e.g., about his own competence). That information can be
transmitted to a principal. The agent may seek to add noise to that transmission. The principal
only sees the final signal, but not the noise that was added to the generation of it. In contrast, as in
the leading example of Kamenica-Gentzkow, a prosecutor doesn’t know whether the defendant
is guilty or not; that is, the sender does not know his type. The objective is, nevertheless, to

     21We use the term “equivalent” a bit loosely, as our signal structures are constrained to be normal, while the
Kamenica-Gentzkow formulation imposes no such restriction. This is not a fundamental difference, however.

convince the receiver that the seller is of a particular type (e.g., “the defendant is guilty”), through
an openly observed signal structure — legal procedure, the calling of witnesses, and so on. The
final signal will depend on the true state of the world, which no one knows at the time of their
“pre-trial” interaction.


                                            8. S UMMARY

We’ve studied a model in which an agent who seeks to be retained by a principal might delib-
erately inject noise into a process that signals his type. Possible equilibrium regimes include
monotone retention, in which a principal retains if an agent’s signal is high enough, and vari-
ous non-monotone regimes. Of these, we argue that bounded retention is the salient equilibrium
regime. In it, different types of agents choose different degrees of noise, with worse agents be-
having more noisily.The resulting equilibrium has a “double-threshold” property: the principal
retains the agent if the signal is good, but neither too good nor too bad. We discuss extensions to
non-normal signal structures, non-binary agent types, multiple agents each with privately known
types, situations in which the agent can shift the means of their signals, at an additional cost,
a dynamic version of the model with agent term limits, risky portfolio management, and noisy
government statistics.
We believe that the deliberate injection of ambiguity or noise is a central feature of many
principal-agent interactions. This paper makes a contribution towards an understanding of that
phenomenon.

Details in the Proof of Proposition 1. Recall (7) from the main text; this is the equation that σ
must satisfy if it commonly chosen by both types:
(27)                              φ(z1 )z1 = φ(z2 )z2 = −σc0 (σ),
where z1 = (σ/∆) ln (β) − (∆/2σ) and z2 = (σ/∆) ln (β) + (∆/2σ). The function φ (z) z has
the shape shown in Figure 3, reaching maxima and minima at z = 1 and z = −1 respectively,
and exhibiting “negative symmetry” around 0. Using (7), this tells us that there are two exclusive
possibilities: (i) either β > 1 and σ < σ, or (ii) either β < 1 and σ > σ. We study (i); Case (ii)
is dealt with in the same way.
In Case (i), elementary computation shows that z2 , viewed as a function ofp     σ (holding all other
terms constant) starts from infinity as σ = 0, declines to a minimum of 2 ln (β), and then
climbs monotonically again to ∞ as σ → ∞. Meanwhile, z1 is always increasing in σ, and is
exactly zero when z2 reaches its minimum. From this point on, φ(z1 )z1 climbs from 0 to its
maximum value of φ(1) and then falls, while φ(z2 )z2 falls monotonically from a positive value
to zero. Finally, we note that in the phase where φ(z1 )z1 falls, we have φ(z1 )z1 > φ(z2 )z2
throughout. Putting these observations together, we must conclude that there is a unique value
of σ such that the first equality in (27) holds, and it is independent of the cost function c.

Proof of Proposition 3. Recall that σ∗ < σ and σ ∗ > σ are the two solutions to c(σ) = 1. Let
Σ := [σ∗ , σ ∗ ]2 , and define
                                Σ+ := {(σg , σb ) ∈ Σ|σb ≥ σg }.
For each σ ∈ Σ+ , define x− and x+ by the distinct lower and upper roots to (4) if σb > σg ;
otherwise, if σb = σg = σ, set x− = x∗ (σ) as defined in (5) and x+ = ∞. Interpret [x− , x+ ]
as the retention zone. Call this map Ψ1 . As discussed in the main text, this map is well-defined
when σb = σg . To check that Ψ1 is also well-defined when σb > σg , we must show that there
are two distinct real roots to the quadratic in (4), or equivalently, using the elementary formula
for quadratic roots, that the expression

where the very last inequality uses σ ∗ ≥ σb > σg . So there are distinct roots x− < x+ , and by
exactly the same logic as for Proposition 2, the zone [x− , x+ ] must involve retention.
Next, for each pair (x− , x+ ) with x+ > x− and with x+ possibly infinite, define (σb0 , σg0 ) to
be the best-response choices of noise by the bad and good types who face the retention zone
[x− , x+ ]. By condition [U], these choices are well-defined and unique. Call this map Ψ2 .
Finally, define a map Ψ with domain Σ+ and range Σ by Ψ := Ψ2 ◦ Ψ1 . We claim that Ψ is
continuous. We first argue that Ψ1 is continuous in the extended reals. That is:
(i) if (σgn , σbn ) → (σg , σb ) with σb > σg , then Ψ1 (σg , σb ) = (x− , x+ ) with x− < x+ < ∞, and
it is obvious that Ψ1 (σgn , σbn ) → Ψ1 (σg , σb ).
(ii) if (σgn , σbn ) → (σg , σb ) with σb = σg , then Ψ1 (σg , σb ) = (x− , ∞). In this case, an inspection
of the quadratic condition (4) (the roots of which yield x− and x+ ) reveals that Ψ1 (σgn , σbn ) =
(xn− , xn+ ) must satisfy xn+ → ∞.
Now we turn to the map Ψ2 . As already mentioned, condition [U] guarantees that best-response
noise choices are unique, as long as x+ > x− . They are fully characterized by the first-order
condition (8), which we reproduce here for convenience:
                                                            

                    σk          σk               σk          σk
where we include the possibility that x+ = ∞ by setting φ(z)z = 0 when z = ∞.
Pick any sequence (xn− , xn+ ) that converges in the extended reals. That is, either the sequence
converges to (x− , x+ ) with x+ < ∞, or it converges to a limit of the form (x− , ∞). Let σkn

be the best responses for an agent of type k, and let σk be the best response at the limit value
(x− , x+ ). When x+ < ∞, it is obvious from (28) that σkn → σk . In the latter case, the fact that
σkn → σk follows from the additional observation that φ(z n )z n → 0 for any sequence z n → ∞.
We claim that Ψ is inward pointing; that is, for every (σg , σb ) ∈ Σ+ , there exists a > 0 such that
(29)                         (σg , σb ) + a[Ψ(σg , σb ) − (σg , σb )] ∈ Σ+ .
First observe that for every (σg , σb ) ∈ Σ+ , we have (σ∗ , σ∗ ) ≤ Ψ(σg , σb ) ≤ (σ ∗ , σ ∗ ). Therefore,
if (σg , σb ) ∈ Σ+ with σb > σg , (29) is easily seen to hold: for a > 0 and small, it must be that
both components of the vector
                                 (σg , σb ) + a[Ψ(σg , σb ) − (σg , σb )]
lie in [σ∗ , σ ∗ ], and the second component is larger than the first. The remaining case is one in
which (σg , σb ) ∈ Σ+ with σb = σg . In this case, we know from condition (14) that Ψ1 (σg , σb )
is of the form (x− , x+ ) = (x∗ , ∞), where x∗ ∈ [θb , θg ]. From the first-order conditions that
describe each type — see (6) — it is easy to see that σk ≷ σ when x∗ ≷ θk . Therefore
Ψ2 (x∗ , ∞) = (σg0 , σb0 ) must have the property that σb0 > σg0 (and of course each component lies
between σ∗ and σ ∗ ). It follows that for every a ∈ (0, 1), (29) holds, and the claim is proved.
To summarize, we have: Σ+ is a nonempty, compact, convex subset of Euclidean space, and Ψ
is continuous on Σ+ . In general, however, Ψ will fail to map from from Σ+ to Σ+ . However, the
map is inward pointing in the sense of Halpern (1968) and Halpern and Bergman (1968); for an
exposition, see Aliprantis and Border (2006, Definition 17.53). By the Halpern-Bergman fixed
point theorem (see Aliprantis and Border 2006, Theorem 17.54), there exists (σg , σb ) ∈ Σ+
such that Ψ(σg , σb ) = (σg , σb ). It is easy to see that (σg , σb ), along with the associated bounded
retention zone Ψ1 (σg , σb ), forms an equilibrium.
                                                                x+ +x−

                                              = b 2            .

So if σb > σg then x+ >        2     > θg and if σb < σg then x+ <             2     < θb .

(32). We must therefore conclude that σb c0 (σb ) > βσg c0 (σg ), and our proof is complete.

Proof of Proposition 4. The first assertion of the proposition is a simple consequence of (i)–(iii),
to which we now turn. If (i) is false, then c0 (σb ) ≤ 0 and c0 (σg ) ≥ 0, which contradicts Lemma
3. For (ii), if σg < σ then c0 (σg ) < 0. Then Lemma 3 implies
                                  c0 (σb )

                                  c0 (σg )            σg σb
so that c0 (σb )/c0 (σg ) < 1 when β ≤ 1. Rearranging (and keeping in mind that c0 (σg ) < 0), we
have c0 (σb ) > c0 (σg ), or σb > σg .
To prove (iii), assume σg > σ. Then c0 (σg ) > 0, and Lemma 3 implies that
                               c0 (σb )

If β ≥ 1, this inequality implies σb > σg .
Lemma 4. Under (14) and (15), x+ < θb < x− < θg in a bounded replacement equilibrium.

Proof. Consider a bounded replacement equilibrium. Then σg > σb . Recall (4), which states
that retention is strictly optimal if
                σg2 − σb2 x2 + 2 σb2 θg − σg2 θb x + σg2 θb2 − σb2 θg2 + 2Aσg2 σb2 > 0,

(33)
(where A = ln (βσb /σg )), and replacement is strictly optimal if the opposite inequality holds.
Putting x = θb in (33) and simplifying, we see that replacement is strictly optimal at θb if
                                              σg    ∆2
                                         β<      exp 2 ,
                                              σb    2σg
but this is guaranteed by the right hand inequality of (14), because σg > σb and σg ≤ σ ∗ .
Therefore θb lies in the interior of the replacement zone, or put another way, x+ < θb < x− .
Now putting x = θg in (33) and simplifying, we see that retention is strictly optimal at θg if
                               ∆2
(34)                                + ln (σb ) − ln(σg ) > − ln(β).
                               2σb2
The derivative of the left hand side of (34) with respect to σb is given by
                                                    ∆2
                                                       

                                          σb         σb
which is strictly negative given (15) and σb ≤ σ ∗ , so it follows that the left hand side of (34) is
minimized by setting σb = σg = σ ∗ . To establish (34), then, it is sufficient to have
                                           ∆2
                                                > − ln(β),
                                          2σ ∗2
but this is guaranteed by the left hand inequality of (14). Consequently, the principal strictly
prefers to retain the agent if she observes x = θg . Given x+ < θb < x− , this can only mean that
x− < θg , and the proof is complete.

where the first weak inequality follows from x− ≥ θb and inequality (30) of Lemma 2, the first
strict inequality follows from φ single-peaked around zero and x+ − θg < x+ − θb < 0, and the
last weak inequality follows from x− ≤ θg and (again) inequality (30) of Lemma 2.
But (36) leads to the following contradiction: if the marginal benefit of noise for the bad type
strictly exceeds that for the good type at every noise level, then by a simple single-crossing
argument, we must have σb > σg . But by Proposition 2, this contradicts the fact that we are in a
bounded replacement equilibrium.
Proof of the Propositions in Section 7.1. We begin with a summary of some properties for
densities f satisfying the strong MLRP.
Lemma 5. Suppose that f satisfies strong MLRP. Then f 0 (z)/f (z) is decreasing in z. In partic-
ular, f must be single-peaked, first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing.

Proof. Elementary differentiation of f (z − a)/f (z) with respect to z establishes the result.

                                       h(x) =                .
                                                  f (z(x))
Because z(x) is affine and increasing in x, the result follows directly from strong MLRP.
Part (ii): Observe that there exists  > 0 such that for x sufficiently large, (x − θ)/σ ≤ (x −
[θ0 + ])/σ 0 . Moreover, for x large enough, f is decreasing (by Lemma 5). It follows that for all
x so that both these conditions are satisfied,
                                                      x−[θ0 +]
                                                               
                                         x−θ      f
                                             
                                      f σ                σ0
                                        x−θ0
                                             ≥        x−θ0
                                                              ,
                                     f σ0           f σ0
and now, using part (i), the right hand side of this inequality goes to infinity as x → ∞. The case
x → −∞ follows parallel lines: switch (θ, σ) and (θ0 , σ 0 ) in the argument above, notice that f
is increasing for x sufficiently negative (Lemma 5), and use part (i) again.

Proof of Proposition 6. Note that an equilibrium is monotone if and only if σb = σg . For if
σb = σg , then Lemma 6(i) tells us that there exists x∗ with
                                                                 
                                           x − θg            x − θb
(37)                                βf                ≥f
                                              σ                σ
if and only if x ≥ x (with strict inequality when x > x∗ ). So the principal retains whenever
                        ∗

x ≥ x∗ . Conversely, if σb 6= σg , then the equilibrium cannot be monotone. Indeed, if σg > σb ,
then by Lemma 6(ii),                                             
                                           x − θg            x − θb
                                    βf                >f
                                              σ                σ
for all x sufficiently large and positive, or sufficiently large and negative. But that means retention
must occur for all such x, which proves that the replacement zone must be bounded. In similar
vein, if σb > σg , then the retention zone must be bounded. This argument establishes not only
that monotonicity is characterized by σb = σg , it also proves the boundedness of at least one
zone of retention and replacement, and proves part (ii) of the Proposition.
To prove part (i), suppose that an equilibrium is monotone. Then σb = σg as just proved. Now,
an agent of type k seeks to maximize
                                          ∗         
                                            x − θk
                                   1−F                 − c (σk ) ,
                                              σk
so that the corresponding first-order condition is given by
                                 ∗
                                  x − θ k x∗ − θ k
                                          
(38)                          f                        − c0 (σk ) = 0.
                                     σk         σk2
Because σg = σb = σ and c0 is injective, the two first-order conditions together imply that
                      ∗                           ∗        
                       x − θg                         x − θb
(39)               f               (x∗ − θg ) = f               (x∗ − θb ) .
                          σ                              σ

Furthermore, (37) tells us that
                                           x∗ − θg                x∗ − θb
                                                                         
                                  βf                     =f                     ,
                                              σ                      σ
and combining this with (39), we must conclude that
                                                     θg − βθb
(40)                                          x∗ =            .
                                                      1−β
The value of x∗ is thus completely pinned down by the system parameters. At the same time,
going back to equation (39), we have
                                      ∗     
                                      x −θg
                                   f     σ      x ∗ − θb
(41)                                  ∗  = ∗           .
                                   f x −θ  b    x − θg
                                         σ

By the strong MLRP there exists a unique value of σ that satisfies (41). It follows that (40)
and (41) fully determine the values of σ and x∗ without paying any attention to the first-order
condition (38), which must also be satisfied. But that imposes an independent condition on the
cost function c (σ).
