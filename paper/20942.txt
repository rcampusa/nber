                                           ABSTRACT

A common complaint about online auctions for consumer goods is the presence of "snipers," who
place bids in the final seconds of sequential ascending auctions with predetermined ending times. The
literature conjectures that snipers are best-responding to the existence of "incremental" bidders that
bid up to their valuation only as they are outbid. Snipers aim to catch these incremental bidders at
a price below their reserve, with no time to respond. As a consequence, these incremental bidders may
experience regret when they are outbid at the last moment at a price below their reservation value. We
measure the effect of this experience on a new buyer's propensity to participate in future auctions.
We show the effect to be causal using a carefully selected subset of auctions from eBay.com and
instrumental variables estimation strategy. Bidders respond to sniping quite strongly and are between
4 and 18 percent less likely to return to the platform.

The probit results in Table 3 use a sample of auctions where
the first-time bidder was winning at 5 minutes and still win-

estimates from Column 3 are those presented in Column 3
of Table 3. In Columns 1 and 2, we narrow the sample to
auctions where the first-time bidder was outbid in 6 and 10
seconds. Column 1 shows that there is still a 1.1 percentage
point increase in the probability of not returning for bid-
ders who are outbid with less than 3 seconds left compared
to those outbid between 3 and 6 seconds. This is slightly
smaller than the other windows, which confirms the rela-
tionship shown in Figure 1. Conversely, Columns 4 and 5
show that there is actually very little effect of adding auc-
tions where the outbidding occurs early in the auction.

A.2      Snipe Definition
Table 6 presents probit results for increasingly expansive def-
initions of sniping, from 6 seconds to almost 5 minutes (300
seconds). When we vary the sniping definition even a little,
the estimates are negative suggesting that the up-tick in exit
is only present for those auctions where the first-time bidder
actually did not have time to respond. The fact that these
probit results are negative is at first alarming, but actually
consistent with the instrumental variable motivation.

A.3      Linear Probability Model
We use a probit model in our primary specifications but we
can easily estimate a linear probability model for robust-
ness. Table 7 presents the results from Table 3 with a linear
model. The estimates are qualitatively similar. To check the
robustness of the downward bias on exit from product selec-
tion, we leverage the time zone instrument with two stage
least squares estimation of the linear model. Here the esti-
mates are substantially larger, so large that we believe the
linear model for the binary outcome is not well behaved. We
interpret these results as consistent with the probit results
because the negative bias persists and simple OLS estimates
are similar to the base probit models. The bivariate probit
is a more appropriate model given that both the dependent
and independent variables are binary.
