                                            ABSTRACT

This research establishes the influence of linguistic traits on human behavior. Exploiting
variations in the languages spoken by children of migrants with identical ancestral countries of
origin, the analysis indicates that the presence of periphrastic future tense, and its association with
long-term orientation has a significant positive impact on educational attainment, whereas the
presence of sex-based grammatical gender, and its association with gender bias, has a significant
adverse impact on female educational attainment.

          ploiting variations in the languages spoken by children of migrants with identical

             Robustness to Various Subsamples of Children of Migrants

  This appendix establishes the robustness of results to alternative sample of children of
migrants: (i) migrant children born overseas who arrived to the US before the age of 5,
("one-and-a-half generation migrants"), (ii) children born in the US to at least one foreign
parent ("second generation migrants"). The use of one-and-a-half and second-generation
migrants overcomes a potential concern due to ethnic attrition bias (Duncan and Trejo,
2016). In particular, previous analyses that have employed the US census or ACS to study
the effects of culture using migrants, have focused on all US-born individuals and tried
to identify migrants and their ancestry by using individual's self-reported ancestry. Thus,
these analyses have included all descendants of migrants that still identify with the country
of origin of their ancestors. But, as Duncan and Trejo (2011, 2016), among others, have
shown, individuals tend to self-identify differently depending on their generation, their true
ancestry, and their socio-economic background. Thus, using second-and-higher-generation
migrants can bias the results due to misidentification of ancestry. For this reason, the
analysis is performed using one-and-a-half or second generation migrants. Robustness of
the results to higher order migrants, as well as to other potential concerns, is established
           ¨
in Galor, Ozak   and Sarid (2016).
  The sample of "one-and-a-half generation migrants," consists of 524,774 individuals, who
migrated into the US before the age of 5. They were born in 147 countries and speak 64
languages.
  The sample of "second-generation migrants" consists 222,288 offspring who were born
in the US to at least one foreign born parent. These individuals originated from 143
countries of origin of the mother and 140 countries of origin of the father and they speak
63 languages.

Notes: The table examines the impact of speaking a language with periphrastic future tense on the
probability of college attendance among second generation migrants in the US. It replicates the analysis
of Table 1 to show the robustness to this subsample. It extends the analysis of Table A2 by accounting
simultaneously for the country of origin of both parents. Geographical characteristics in the historical
homeland of the language include absolute latitude, mean elevation, mean ruggedness, coast length and
pre-1500 crop return. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the countries of
origin or both parents, language and state levels are reported in parentheses.
