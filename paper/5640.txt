                                           ABSTRACT



         We explore the feasibility of catastrophic health insurance established in conjunction with
individual health accounts (IHAs). Under this plan, the employer establishes both a high-deductible
health insurance plan and an IHA. Employee health care costs below the deductible are then paid
out of the IHA; costs above the deductible are paid by the insurance plan. Assets remaining in the
account when the employee retires are available for other purposes.
         Although attractive because it helps to solve the “moral hazard” problem associated with
conventional insurance plans, the scheme may be considered infeasible if medical expenditures over
a working life are so persistent that certain individuals accumulate little in the IHA while others
accumulate a great deal, Within the context of an illustrative IHA plan, we develop preliminary
empirical evidence on the distribution of medical expenditures-and    hence savings—under an IHA
plan. Our analysis is based on longitudinal health insurance claims data from a large firm, We
emphasize the balance in the IHA account at retirement. Although such a plan would produce a
range of balances across employees, approximately 80°/0 would retain over 50°/0 of their
contributions. Only about 5°/0would retain less than 20°/0 of their contributions.
         The outcomes suggest to us that such a plan is feasible. And, we believe that such a plan
could be structured to increase retirement savings.

      Economists       have for some time emphasized      the desirable    incentive

properties of catastrophic health insurance.     Under such a system individuals

would pay for their own health care unless the expenses were very large.

Thus the temptation to spend too much, the “moral hazard,” that is created by

typical insurance provisions, would be reduced or eliminated.        Indeed, Arrow

[1963] demonstrated       that in the presence of moral hazard and risk aversion

a catastrophic      plan is optimal.   A practical argument    against catastrophic

insurance,   however, is that a very large fraction of families have almost no

liquid savings      and would find it hard to make even small out-of-pocket

payments, especially if they were not anticipated.      Perhaps in recognition of

this fact, employees have shown a willingness to pay very high premia to avoid

uncertainty about health expenditures and many firms have experienced very

low participation    rates in “major medical” plans with substantial deductibles

even though these plans are typically offered at generously low premiums.

      The attention of American health reformers in recent years has turned

to managed       care plans which place little reliance on “demand”       incentives,

instead using “supply-side” and contractual restrictions to limit spending under

insurance plans with low deductibles and copayments.          Apparently such plans

have had some success in limiting health expenditures,          although at the cost


                                          -1-
of increased regulation of doctor-patient       transactions.   But, ex-post, insured

patients bear only a small fraction of cost of their care, suggesting incentives

for cost control are far from optimal.      We begin with this paper a research

agenda that emphasizes -- and maybe reconsiders -- price incentives in health

insurance reform.

      We explore the feasibility of catastrophic       health insurance established

in conjunction with individual health accounts (I HAs). Such an arrangement

holds the potential for both reducing health care cost and encouraging saving.

Under this plan, the employer       establishes      both a high-deductible    health

insurance   plan and an IHA. Annual contributions          to the IHA are equal to a

substantial fraction of the deductible.    Employee health care costs below the

deductible are then paid out of the IHA; costs above the deductible are paid

by the insurance plan. Assets remaining in the account when the employee

retires, or becomes Medicare-eligible,      are then available for other purposes.

The motivation for the parallel saving and insurance plans, of course, is that

each employee is spending his or her “own” money for medical care, except

in the event of serious illness. The plan thus combines the desirable features

of catastrophic coverage for reducing medical expenditures,         as advocated by

Feldstein [1971] and by Feldstein and Gruber [1994], with a mechanism that

creates a reserve from which individual expenses can be paid.


                                          -2-
       But even if the IHA component       provides the necessary liquidity, it may

still be thought to be inequitable.     To the extent that individuals experience

different   health   shocks   over many years, the plan could lead to large

differences in IHA accumulations.      A person who is never sick will accumulate

large IHA balances,       while someone         who is always sick will accumulate

nothing.    If individual health expenditures over a working lifetime vary little, all

persons will have the same IHA balance at retirement.          On the other hand, if

average individual expenditures vary widely over the working life, the plan may

look like a savings plan to the healthy and self-insurance to the chronically ill.

Though mitigating measures could be appended to a basic IHA plan to limit

such inequality,     unequal accumulation        is an unavoidable   consequence    of

individual financial risk. Equal accumulations        under an IHA plan can only be

guaranteed if all individuals have the same health shock experience over their

lifetimes. Of course, equal premiums under a comprehensive           health plan with

first-dollar coverage also assure equal individual cost.

       Because individual health shocks clearly vary, the feasibility of an IHA

plan depends on whether the gains -- improved incentives for efficient health-

care spending and increased savings -- outweigh the costs -- more variation

in individual health    care costs than under more generous insurance plans.

Indeed, we believe that in practice feasibility may depend largely on what the


                                          -3-
variation in IHA balances would “look like.” Thus, as a crucial first step, we

address that issue in this paper. Within the context of an illustrative IHA plan,

we develop     preliminary   empirical   evidence     on the distribution    of medical

expenditures    -- and hence savings -- under an IHA plan.             Our analysis is

based on longitudinal health insurance claims data from a large firm. In this

analysis, we assume no behavioral response whatever to the increased cost

sharing under an IHA plan.          Feldstein and Gruber [1994] suggest that the

response could be substantial.       To the extent that individuals respond to price

incentives, expenditure will be more equal -- perhaps substantially more equal

-- than our results      suggest.     We hope to provide         an upper bound on

expenditure variation, as measured by variation in IHA accumulation.

      We begin with examples that illustrate the enormous variation in health

care costs in a single year and the persistence of individual expenditures from

one year to the next. The illustrations are similar to those in McClellan and

Wise [1994].       That paper emphasized        persistence   in individual health care

costs and demonstrated       that persons with large expenditures      in one year are

likely to have large average expenditures,           whether calculated     over one or

several years. In addition, we emphasize here that, although not insignificant,

the relationship    between expenditures        two years apart is substantially   lower

than the relationship between expenditures           one year apart.   And thus while


                                          -4-
persistence          is important,   the descriptive   data   also   suggest   that   high

expenditures         levels typically do not last for many years.

       Next we explain the statistical model that underlies our conclusions on

the distribution       of health care expenditures.    The goal is to approximate      the

distribution of medical expenditures over a working lifetime in a large firm. We

have data on employee expenditures             over a three-year period. We estimate

a model that captures the pattern of expenditures among employees and then

use the model to simulate the lifetime distribution of expenditures.            We give

particular     attention    to two issues:     One is the extent of persistence,       the

expected expenditure           in one year conditional on expenditure     in prior years.

The second is the “unexplained” residual variance, or “shock” in expenditures,

conditional on expenditure           in prior years. An important aspect of the data is

that this unexplained variance is very large and is not approximated              well by

any analytic distribution.       Thus our simulation procedure depends heavily on

non-parametric          analysis based on the empirical distribution      of conditional

expenditures.

      We next explain the results of simulations based on the model. We find

that many employees will have no large medical expenditures               over an entire

working      life.    Others will have one or more episodes that generate             large

expenditures         in one year and possibly in at least a few subsequent years as


                                              -5-
well.   The concentration      of expenditures         that is observed in one year, and

even when three years are combined, declines consistently as expenditures

are cumulated over more years. Nonetheless, even of over a working lifetime

there   is a noticeable       concentration         of expenditures.   We illustrate   the

implications of the concentration by considering the distribution of balances at

retirement in an IHA account with a $2,000 annual contribution.             Although the

vast majority of participants retire with substantial IHA balances, some incur

substantial out-of-pocket costs and thus retire with only small balances. About

80% of employees          are left with at least 50% of total IHA contributions,       but

about 5% have less than 20Y0.

        We conclude with a discussion of the implications and limitations of this

preliminary analysis.      We comment on issues that are not addressed and on

future research plans.




1.      THE DATA AND SUMMARY              DESCRIPTION.

A.      Medical   Claims     Data.

        The data are medical claims of employees                 in a large Fortune 500

manufacturing     firm.    The analysis is based on all fee-for-service        insurance

claims over the three-year period 1989 through 1991. Over this period there




                                              -6-
were   approximately       300,000    employees          and their dependents        covered

through these insurance plans.

       The firm has two fee-for-sewice               plans, one for hourly and another for

salaried     employees.     The hourly plan, with benefits           negotiated      in union

contracts, provides “first-dollar” coverage for virtually all health care. Because

of this virtually    unlimited    coverage,      hourly employees       have no financial

incentives    to join managed-care        or HMO plans, though specific              provider

relationships     and location considerations            may provide some nonfinancial

incentives.     The salaried plan has an annual deductible of $200 per individual

and $250 per family, a 20% coinsurance rate for all expenses, and an out-of-

pocket annual limit (including the deductible)               of $500 per family.     Routine

physical examinations       are not covered.          Both plans incorporate   limited case

management        for certain high-cost medical conditions and concurrent              review

of hospital      stays.   The hourly      plan includes        preadmission    certification

requirements      for certain elective admissions;          patients who elect admission

despite precertification denial are responsible for 20% copayments                 Up to $750


per individual and $1500 per family. Both plans also require second opinions

for 16 elective      surgical    procedures,     though the procedures         are covered

regardless      of the second opinion finding.            Both plans have very generous

hospital stay limits:     365 days per stay, renewable after 60 days out of the


                                               -7-
hospital. Mental-health and substance-abuse           inpatient care has a stricter day

limit of 45 days, also renewable after 60 days out of the hospital. (During the

time period of the study, a managed-care             program was implemented           for

mental health and substance-abuse          services. )


B.      Summary     Data.

        Many studies have documented that medical expenditures in a particular

year are concentrated         among    a small proportion        of the insured.     Less

evidence, and hence less attention, has been directed to the persistence                of

individual    expenditures    over longer time periods and to the relationship

between persistence and the concentration           of expenditures.      Together, both

have important implications for insurance in general and in particular for the

feasibility, incidence, and other consequences           of insurance market reforms.

Before presenting more formal analysis, we present descriptive evidence on

these issues using longitudinal individual claims data for the period 1989 to

1991.    We consider first a tabular description            of the relationship   between

expenditures in three successive years. We then consider the concentration

of expenditures      and present      more detailed      descriptions    of persistence,

considering    expenditures    in consecutive    years conditional on the decile (or

quintile) ranking of expenditures      in the first year.




                                           -8-
         1.      Medical      Claims    in Successive   Years:   The distributions     of

expenditures in 1990 and in 1991 conditional on 1989 expenditures are shown

in Table 1. Consider, for example, persons 18 to 35 in the first panel of the

table.        Conditional     on no expenditure     in 1989, 4% of persons        have

expenditures       above $5000 in 1990.        In contrast, over 20% of persons with

expenditures       above $5000 in 1989 have expenditure above $5000 in 1990.

Persistence       appears to increase with age. Almost 30% of persons 46-55

who had expenditures            greater than $5000 in 1989 also had expenditure

greater than $5000 in 1990. In contrast, only 5% of the persons in this age

group with no expenditure in 1989 had expenditures above $5000 in 1990. If

there were no persistence              across years, only 8% of the individuals      with

expenditures greater than $5000 would have such high expenditures again in

1990.

         Comparison         of the first and second     -- that shows data for 1991

conditional on spending in 1989 -- panels of Table 1 reveals that persistence

diminishes       with time.    For example, in the 18-35 age group, about 15% of

those with expenditure above $5,000 in 1989 had expenditures above $5,000

in 1991, compared to almost 21% in 1990.                For the persons aged 46-55,

about 22% of those with expenditures above $5,000 in 1989 had expenditures

exceeding $5000 in 1991, compared to almost 29% in 1990.

                                              -9-
      2.     Individual    Concentration      of Expenditures:        The relationship

between persistence       and concentration       is shown in Figure 1. The Figure

shows that in 1989 about 80% of cost was incurred by 10 percent of enrollees,

roughly comparable to concentration results from other studies.            Fifty percent

of employees incurred virtually no cost. Figure 1 also shows the concentration

of annual expenditures     averaged over the two-year period of 1989 to 1990,

and over the three-year period of 1989 to 1991. If there were no persistence

in cost from one year to the next, costs averaged over several years would be

much less concentrated      among a few enrollees than costs in a single year.

The curves show that although concentration              declines as the time period

increases,   even over three years a small proportion of employees             incur an

enormous fraction of health care costs. Averaged over three years, 10% of

enrollees account for a full 65% of expenditures.         If there were no persistence

from year to year, then averaged over many years the cost accounted for by

the highest-cost   decile would approach          10%.     The more formal analysis

presented below shows that concentration declines continuously as more and

more years of expenditures         are cumulated,        but is still substantial   even

averaged over a working lifetime.

      3.     Expenditure      Decile   and Subsequent         Expenditures.     Table 1

shows persistence in expenditures for selected age groups. Figure 2 presents


                                           -1o-
a more detailed picture of persistence for all ages combined.       Enrollees are

divided into deciles based on 1989 claims. The figure shows expenditures        in

1989 by decile, and then, also by 1989 decile, average annual expenditures

one year later in 1990 and two years later in 1991. For comparison, the figure

also shows average expenditures      for all enrollees over these three years,

which was $1,314. Persons in the tenth decile in 1989, in that year spent over

eight times as much as the average.          They spent close to five times the

average in 1990 and almost three times the average in 1991. Averaged over

all three years, those in the highest decile in 1989 spent about five times the

average.

       An alternative description is shown in Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c. Figure 3a

shows the distribution   of costs by quintile over the 1989 to 1991 period for

each 1989 quintile (determined by 1989 expenditures).      The figure shows, for

example, that almost 60% of persons who were in the highest quintile in 1989

were also in the highest quintile averaged over three years.        Another 35%

were in the second highest quintile averaged over three years.        By contrast

fewer than 10% of persons in the lowest 1989 quintile were in the highest

quintile over three years, and only about 10% were in the second highest

quintile.   Figure 3b shows the distribution    of costs in 1990 and Figure 3C

shows the distribution in 1991, conditional on the 1989 quintile.   Over 40% of


                                      -11-
persons in the highest quintile in 1989 are in the highest quintile in 1990 and

about 35% are in the highest quintile in 1991.

      These      descriptive    data show that, on average,    persons      with high

expenses in one year also tend to have much higher than average expenses

in the next year and also higher than average, but lower, expenses               in the

following year.     These data are used in more formal estimation             to allow

extrapolation    of this persistence pattern over subsequent years. The formal

analysis also shows that the importance of the persistence revealed in mean

expenditures      appears      to be dominated    by the enormous         variation   in

expenditure     shocks, conditional on any past expenditure    pattern.




Il.   A “MODEL”        OF PERSISTENCE       AND EXPENDITURE         SHOCKS.

      Our goal is a formal description of medical expenditures       that will allow

us to simulate the pattern of expenditures over the working life. We begin with

a description     of the model specification     and then explain the simulation

procedure.      A critical feature of the model is the extent to which it captures

actual expenditure      patterns and thus we give considerable     attention to the

model fit.




                                         -12-
A.      Specification.

        The descriptive specification must capture two critical features of health

care expenditures:       (1) the enormous variation across individuals in the same

year and (2) the persistence of expenditures from one year to the next. In this

version of the analysis we describe annual expenditures.           We assume that

medical expenditures          in year t, Mt, can be predicted by three factors:   (1)

demographic characteristics,        denoted by D, and which include age, sex, and

employment       status (hourly or salaried); (2) past expenditures    Ml~~,which in

this version include expenditures in years t-1 and t-2: and (3) random shocks,

e.

(1)~,     “ ~   ‘ pD   + yA41ag + E


The critical components         are the random shocks and persistence (measured

by y). Because a large fraction of employees have no expenditures in a given

year, it is useful to consider explicitly the expected value of M, given by

(2)~(~)     “ ~~[~,      ~   01 ~ o + ~~[~, >01 ~ ~(~j~, > 0)
We estimate the two components -- Pr[M~> O], and E(M~]M~>O) -- separately.

The first is estimated using a linear probability specification,      and the second

using a log linear regression.

        The model estimates, together with exact specifications,        are shown in

Appendix Table 1. The specification         used in the analysis is presented in the


                                           -13-
bottom panel of the table. The basic structure of the specification,          however,

is more easily seen in the simpler specification that is shown in the top panel.

This specification   shows three variables (D1, D2, DI 2) that identify persons

with no expenditures       in t -1, no expenditures     in t -2, and no expenditures    in

either prior period. Corresponding to these variables are expenditure amounts

for persons     who had claims         in prior years.       For example,    Ml    gives

expenditures    amounts for persons who had claims in period t-1 (for whom

DI =0), and is zero for persons who didn’t file a claim in period t-1.                 For

persons with claims in both t-1 and t-2 (the “base” group), there are two

expenditure variables, M*1 and M*2 fort-1 and t-2 respectively.          The estimated

coefficients are difficult to interpret individually.     (For example, the coefficient

associated with DI in the simplified expenditure equation (-0.7485) indicates

that the expenditure in period t for persons with zero expenditures          in both t-1

and t-2 is about 75% lower than the expenditures -- evaluated at M* I =M*2=0,

the “intercept” -- of persons with positive expenditures         in both prior periods. )

Thus we give scant atiention to individual parameter estimates,             instead we

emphasize      below the degree to which the specification          reproduces    actual

expenditure    patterns.    The more flexible specification      relaxes the simplified

version in two ways: the lagged expenditures            variables are piecewise linear




                                           -14-
and the lagged expenditure variables are interacted with age -- distinguishing

persons who are younger from those who are older than 45.

       Possibly the most important component           of the estimates   is the large

residual variance.     Consider a given a set of right hand variables          and the

associated mean expenditure.        The estimated standard error of the estimate

(1 .644) suggests that to capture say 95% of expenditures           one would have to

cover the range from 0.04 to 27 times the mean.


B.     Prediction    and Simulation    Method.

       The key to prediction is the distribution of random shocks. We want the

distribution   that is used in prediction to “match” as closely as possible the

actual distribution, which is extremely skewed.        Here, we use the distribution

conditional    on the demographic     variables    D and lagged expenditures.       In

padicular,     given D and 25 cells in the five-by-five          matrix of t-1 and t-2

expenditure     intervals   (used in Table      1), we randomly      choose   from the

distribution of residuals from the two components         of equation (2), using a 6-

year window centered at the age of the person whose expenditures are being

predicted.     Here, we use the distribution       conditional   on the demographic

variables D and lagged expenditures          Ml~~. This spending history is defined

across the 25 cells in the five-by-five matrix of t-1 and t-2 expenditure intervals

used in Table 1. Given D and Ml~~,we follow this procedure: First, choose a


                                         -15-
 residual      from    the   first   component      of equation   2 conditional     on the

 demographic variables and expenditure history (as reflected by the individual’s

 position in the five-by-five        matrix discussed above).      If the first component,

 evaluated      at the independent       variables and the chosen residual, is greater

 than 0.5, the person is considered to have positive expenditures.                 Second,

 choose a residual, again conditional on demographics                 and past spending,

 from the second component               of 2.    Then, predict expenditures      using the

“ second     component        of 2 evaluated       at the demographic     variables,   past

 spending variables, and the selected shock.

         The goal here is not to obtain “behavioral” estimates of marginal effects

 of predictor variables.       Instead, we seek a prediction procedure which captures

 both the dynamic and cross-section              features of health care expenditure   over

 a lifetime.    Below, we evaluate how well we have succeeded in attaining this

 goal.

         This initial analysis has at least one potentially important limitation.            It

 assumes that given expenditures in t-1 and t-2, expenditures in prior years add

 no additional        information    about expenditures    in t. Prior expenditures    may,

 however, contribute additional information and could yield better predictions

 of persistence.




                                                 -16-
cm    The Fit.

      There are at least four ways to check the extent to which the model

captures the actual distribution of medical expenditures.             All are based on a

comparison        between simulation   results and the actual data.        Some of the

comparisons       emphasize the dynamic properties of our simulation process --

the degree to which the simulated expenditures              capture the distribution    of

expense over time. Others emphasize the extent to which the short run model

predictions capture the persistence observed in the three-year data panel. We

consider    the    mean   of expenditures         by age,    actual   versus   predicted

expenditure distributions     in year t given expenditures      in t-1 and in t-2, actual

versus predicted persistence over a three-year period, and the distribution of

lifetime predictions at particular ages versus actual distributions at those ages.

      1.      Actual versus    Predicted    Means by Age:        Figure 4 shows actual

and simulated average expenditures         by age for hourly and salaried men and

women.     The actual averages are based on the full sample of 230,497.                The

simulated averages are determined as follows: Begin with a sample of 1,000

employees age 25. Then apply equations (3) repeatedly, producing a stream

of expenditures for each person through age 60. The simulated averages for

a given age are the averages of the simulated values at that age. Because

the simulated values are based on a rather small number of persons there is


                                           -17-
more variation in the simulated than the actual averages, but the overall match

seems quite close. (One might assume that any simple model -- like a Tobit

--would yield such a match.       But because of the very skewed distributions           of

health expenditures this is not the case. Indeed, simple Tobit estimates yield

means that are at least twice as large as the actual means. )

      2.      Actual versus Predicted        Third Year Expenditure     Distributions:

Figures 5a through 5d show the actual versus predicted distributions            of third

year (1991 ) expenditures       at selected ages --30, 40, 50, and 60-- for hourly

and salaried men and women.            The predicted distribution     is based on the

demographic     variables and expenditures          for the first two years (1989 and

1990). Overall, the simulated and actual distributions are very similar.

      3.      Actual   versus    Predicted      Persistence:   Table 2 shows mean

actual and simulated expenditures,       conditional on the expenditure      interval in

each of the preceding two years. To illustrate, consider persons 36 to 45: for

employees     who had no claims in period t - 1 and t -2,             the actual mean

expenditure in period t was $1,295, compared to a predicted mean of $1,337.

Overall, the simulated values capture quite well the pattern in the actual data

with one exception.     For individuals with spending above $5000 in both t -1

and t -2, the prediction of $11,949 substantially exceeds the actual value of

$9,934.    Because of the very skewed distribution of shocks, random draws of


                                             -18-
very high shocks in the simulation can have a substantial effect on simulated

means.

         4.      Distributions        of Lifetime    Predictions     at Selected      Ages versus

Actual        Distributions:          Our simulations        rest on the prediction               of the

expenditures        of employees over a working lifetime.                 The comparison          above

suggested         that the distribution        of the model          predictions      of third      year

expenditures         were      very    close   to the      actual   distribution     of third       year

expenditures.        Now we consider a comparison that is intended to test the long

run implications of the model. We start with the expenditures                        of a sample of

persons who are 25 in 1991.                Then we simulate their expenditures                   through

age 60.        We want to know in particular that the distribution                     of simulated

expenditures        approximates        the actual distribution at older ages.             Figures 6a

and 6b show simulated versus actual distributions                         at age 45 and 55. Two

comparisons         are made:         The first compares the simulated distribution at 45

with the distribution of the actual expenditures               of persons 45 years old in our

sample.        The second comparison            shows the distribution            of simulated       and

actual cumulated expenditures over three years, ages 45 through 47. Overall,

the   distributions       of simulated         expenditures         are    very    close    to    actual

distributions.       Given the small (1 ,000) sample                 used for the simulations,

simulations based on different samples yield somewhat different comparisons.


                                                    -19-
But our experience       has been that there is no appreciable      difference    in the

overall results.

        5.   Other      Validation   Comparisons.      Finally, we considered       two

additional   comparisons      to confirm that the persistence    implications     of the

model were consistent with the data.         Recall that the model assumes that,

given    expenditures     in t-1 and t-2, expenditures      in prior years       add no

information about expenditures       in year t. But although it is likely that there is

also some information        contained in the pattern of expenditures     in previous

years, the model lag structure does imply that expenditure shocks will “last” for

several years.

        First, we considered all persons with high expenditures      -- over $10,000

and over $15,000 -- at selected ages --35 and 45-- in 1989. We then used

the model to simulate their expenditures         in the ten subsequent    years.    We

compared the predictions in the subsequent two years with the actual data.

For the first two years, for which we have matching actual data, the actual and

simulated means are very close. The lag structure in the model is of course

a way to extrapolate        the decline in expenditures    to future years and the

simulations imply that after 4 or 5 years the expenditures of persons with large

shocks approach the overall sample mean. The simulated and actual “decay”

patterns are shown in Appendix Figure 1.


                                          -20-
      Second, we considered the future expenditures of persons with specific

1989 diagnoses       that are typically associated   with high expenditures.    In

particular, we were concerned that the expenditure decay in these cases be

consistent   with the implications   of the model.   We considered    these 1989

diagnosis:   AMI, cancer, mental health (with inpatient care), and pregnancy.

Only 45% of 1989 AM I patients had expenditures         greater than $1,000 one

year later in 1990, only 34% had expenditures greater than $1,000 two years

later in 1991. (Over 14% and zero expenditures        in 1990 and 25% in 1991.)

Less than 25% of cancer patients had expenditures       over $1,000 in 1990 and

only 2070 in 1991.       There was more persistence       in the expenditures   of

Inpatient mental health patients:    54% had expenditures    over $1,000 in 1990

and 42°A in 1991. Pregnancy is one of the most important contributors to firm

health care costs, but with minimal persistence.       Only 17% of women with

pregnancy related diagnosis in 1989 had expenditures         over $1,000 in 1990

and only 13% in 1991. We take these results as evidence that are simulated

decay rates are not unreasonable.      In particular, we find no reason to suspect

that they are too rapid.

      We conclude that simulated expenditure patterns compare closely with

actual expenditure    pattern revealed in the three years of our data.

Ill.   SIMULATION         RESULTS.

       We have simulated the lifetime expenditures          of 1,000 employees who

begin work at age 25 and retire at 60. We realize that few, if any persons,

would work for the same firm for that length of time, but it is the expenditure

pattern that we want to capture, assuming that employees continued to face

an insurance scheme like the one at this firm.


A.     The Distribution     of Lifetime   Expenditures.

       The distribution    of cumulative expenditures      at selected ages is shown

in Figure 7a. Figure 7b shows the concentration           version of the data. Over a

working lifetime, expenditures       of salaried men vary from less than $10,000

(about 10% of employees) to over $100,000 (about 10% of employees).              The

median is about $32,000, as shown in Figure 7a. The distributions             for the

other gender and employee status groups are similar to those for salaried

men.

       Figure 7a shows distribution of expenditures is much less concentrated

over a lifetime than over 5 years (at age 30). Figure 1 (above) shows that in

a single year about 80% of expenditures          are accounted for by about 10% of

employees.    For salaried men, Figure 7b shows that after 5 years (at age 30)

about 35% of employees account for 80% of expenditures.               Over a lifetime

about 55% of employees account for 80% of expenditures.

                                          -22-
B.       IHA Balances.

         Given the distribution of expenditures     described above, how might an

IHA plan work? We consider this plan:

         *
                The employer puts $2,000          in each employee’s      IHA at the
                beginning of each year.

         *
                The health insurance plan has a $4,000 annual deductible, with
                expenses below the deductible paid by the employee (out of the
                IHA) and 100 percent of expenditures above the deductible
                covered by the health insurance plan. If the IHA balance goes to
                zero, all expenses are paid by the insurance plan.

The distribution      of IHA balances at selected ages is shown in Figures 8.

Consider salaried men: After 5 years (at age 30), about 50% of men have

balances close to $10,000.        Only about 10% have balances less than about

$6000.       After a lifetime, there is more variation in the IHA balances, but most

employees        are left with a substantial     accumulation.    About 90% of the

employees have a balance at age 60 that exceeds $25,000, while 75% have

more than $40,000 and 50% have more than $50,000.                The distributions   are

similar for salaried women and for hourly employees.

         Another    way to understand    the plan implications     is to consider the

proportion of IHA contributions that remain at selected ages. The distributions

of these proportions      is shown in Figures 9. Two features of the distributions

stand out: The fraction declines with age but even at retirement the fraction



                                          -23-
remaining is large for almost all employees.            At retirement, only about 20°/0 of

employees    have less than 50% of their contributions,               about 10% have less

than 35Y0, and about 5% less than 20Y0. And, 50% still hold more than 70%

of their IHA contributions.

       The average balance remaining in the IHA is shown by age in Figure 10.

The fraction can be compared to the 45 degree line which represents                       the

accumulation      path if there were no withdrawals to cover health care costs.

The fraction remaining is higher for salaried than for hourly employees and

highest for salaried men.          The average balance of salaried men is about

$46,000 at age 60. The higher average for salaried than for hourly employees

may be attributed in large part to differences              in plan provisions.   The hourly

plan   provides     first-dollar    coverage,       while    the   salaried   plan   includes

copayments     and a deductible.           We have not accounted              here for any

behavioral   effects.    If the difference      in expenditures      of hourly and salaried

employees is due to plan provisions, it maybe an indication that the behavioral

response to a catastrophic         plan could be substantial as well.




Iv.    DISCUSSION.

       A health insurance system featuring IHAs combined with a catastrophic

insurance    plan would insure employees against high health care costs but


                                             -24-
would also subject a large fraction of expenditures to the discipline imparted

by “spending       your own money.” A potential drawback             of this scheme    is

increased       risk, measured   by variation   in IHA balance accumulation.        The

variation depends critically on the lifetime distribution          of health care costs.

With emphasis on this issue, our goal was to present preliminary evidence on

the feasibility of an IHA plan.

       We developed       a non-parametric      method to describe the longitudinal

distribution     of health care expenditures      in a large firm.    Comparisons   with

actual firm data suggest that the model captures well the important features

of the expenditure       distribution.   Using this model to simulate the lifetime

distribution     of individual health care costs, we evaluated the implications        of

variation      in health care expenditures      on the variation     in IHA balances   at

retirement.      Although the plan would produce a range of balances across

employees, approximately 80% of employees would retain more than 50% of

their IHA contributions.      Only about 5% of employees would retain less than

20% of their contributions.         These outcomes do not appear to us to be so

extreme as to make the plan a non-starter.

       To say more, we need to incorporate            additional components      into the

analysis. While we believe that such a plan would reduce medical expenses

substantially, we must quantify the behavioral response which would occur as


                                           -25-
employees spend more of their own money. Rough calculations suggest that

the proportion     of payments       subject to this restraint would increase from

virtually zero to as much as 45% (depending              on whether the payment that

pushes the total over the $4,000 deductible is counted).            And we believe that

such a plan could be structured to increase retirement saving.               The benefits

of reduced      health care costs and increased           saving must be considered

against   the risk associated         with increased     variance   in lifetime   medical

expenditures.      Traditional    insurance plans which offer near total insurance,

and erect a large moral hazard along the way, dampen this variability                    in

lifetime expenditures.       By considering risk aversion and time preferences, we

can address these tradeoffs more formally in the context of utility analysis.

      An IHA plan could have important implications for the composition              and,

possibly, the level of employee compensation.            The overall annual cost of the

firm’s current health plan is around $1,400 per participant.         With no behavioral

effects, the IHA plan we consider would reduce this premium to around $700

per participant.    Employee health care costs would increase by about $700.

Assuming     no reduction in other non-wage benefits, the IHA contribution               of

$2,000    would     result   in a net increase         in total   employee    benefits   of

approximately      $1,300.       Evidence on 401(k) plans suggests that offsetting

effects   on other employee         benefits is unclear.      Many 401(k)     plans were


                                            -26-
established     with no apparent reductions in other components                of employee

compensation,       at least in the short run.

      The actual additional             cost to be divided between        the firm and its

employees       may be substantially       lessened not only by any behavioral effect,

but also by the favorable           tax treatment      accorded     to 401(k)       and other

retirement programs, as well as health insurance premiums.                  For example, if

contributions     to an IHA were also treated              in this manner     and perhaps

combined with a retirement savings program, copayments                    and deductibles

now made by employees               with after-tax    earnings     might be replaced       by

payments made in pre-tax earnings from an IHA account.

      We also need to explore variations              in the structure     of IHA plans to

understand       the     implications     of alternative     IHA   contributions,     savings

accumulations,         and out-of-pocket     expenditures.     Our analysis reveals that

small changes in the structure of the plan can substantially alter the “way the

numbers look.” For example, if the IHA contribution is made at the end of the

year -- and thus is not available to fund expenditures               in the current year --

virtually no one would be left with IHA accumulations less than 35% to 40% of

their contributions (although this would generate a somewhat higher insurance

premium).       The results would also look quite different if IHA contribution were

$1,000 instead of $2,000.


                                               -27-
     We intend to consider all these issues more thoroughly in future work.   ,

We also plan to re-estimate the parameters of our model with longer panels
