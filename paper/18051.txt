                                             ABSTRACT

Governments around the world are reacting to extended lifespans and troubled pension finances by
increasing the age of retirement benefit entitlement. One concern that arises is how those who are not
working before reaching entitlement age are able to bridge their consumption to the age of entitlement.
This paper studies those who retire before the age of full pension entitlement in the United States using
data drawn from the Health and Retirement Study. The major finding is that four out of five people
who have zero earnings at pre-entitlement ages are able to find a way to lift their incomes over the
poverty line. For men, pension and annuity income is important while for women, spousal income
helps most to get them over the line. Reaching the early retirement entitlement age at 62 also has a
significant impact on poverty avoidance.

   1. Introduction

Countries around the world are reacting to long-term balance problems in public retirement

income programs with a variety of measures. Moving entitlement ages at which people begin to

receive benefits is one of these measures. For example, Germany will be phasing in an increase

from age 65 to 67 over the years from 2012 to 2029. In the fall of 2010, the French proposal to

move the retirement age from 60 to 62 was met with widespread protest. Similar reforms have

been contemplated or planned for Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In the

United States, the normal retirement moved from 65 to 66 over the previous decade and is

schedule to rise further to 67 for those born in 1960 or later. The early retirement age is

scheduled to stay at age 62, however.



In all countries, concern about movements in the retirement age centers around a worry that

those who are not working before the age of entitlement will suffer. The goal of this paper is to

address the concern about hardship among those not working at ages before benefit entitlement

in the United States. Specifically, the paper will address three questions. First, who retires early?

Second, what are the sources of income during this transition to retirement—especially for those

not working before the age of entitlement? Third, how do non-workers avoid hardship?



The approach taken here is to study cohorts of Americans working at late-career ages and follow

them into retirement ages. The data set used for this analysis is the Health and Retirement Study,

which focuses on older workers and the elderly over the time period from 1992 to 2008. These

data combine information on the work environment with detailed income and wealth data,

facilitating the answering of the questions posed.

                                                  1
There are several findings of interest. Foremost of these is that four out of five of those who have

zero earnings in the age 55 to 66 age range are able to put together incomes to take them over the

poverty line. For men, pension and annuity income is quite important, while for women spousal

income sources play the largest role. Reaching the early retirement age for Social Security

benefits at age 62 alleviates poverty among those with no earnings. Finally, there is some

indication that assets are used to bridge consumption into retirement, as a notable fraction of

those with higher asset levels report low levels of income at pre-entitlement ages.



The paper is structured as follows. I start by placing this research in the context of existing

research on the incomes of the near-elderly. I provide a brief description of government income

transfers to furnish the institutional context. I then describe the empirical approach and the data

in more detail. With these steps complete, the results are then presented, looking sequentially at

who retires early, the composition of incomes, and the avoidance of hardship.



   2. Related research

Interest in this research question comes from two directions. First, there is concern that

retirement before the age of public pension entitlement can lead to exaggerated economic

hardship. (See, for example, Munnell et al. 2004.) Second, the ‘retirement consumption puzzle’

(see Banks, Blundell, and Tanner 1998; Hurst 2008) has focused economists’ attention on the

particulars of the transition from work to retirement. In particular, Milligan (2008) and Baker,

Gruber, and Milligan (2009) find evidence of a divergence between income and consumption

based measures of hardship in Canada at near-retirement ages, suggesting that consumption

smoothing through the transition may be occurring in spite of temporarily low income levels.


                                                  2
The question and methodology used in this paper is similar to the analysis performed on

Canadian data in Milligan (2010) and Milligan (2011). Beyond the focus on American data and

institutions in the current paper, this paper is also distinguished by the ability to include analysis

of assets, since the Canadian data do not contain asset or debt information.




Engelhardt and Gruber (2004) also study poverty among the elderly and the role Social Security

plays in poverty alleviation. However, the paper most similar to the work in the current paper is

by Johnson and Mermin (2009), who also study economic hardship during the transition to

retirement. The focus in that paper is on the impact of employment and health shocks on

hardship in the pre-entitlement years. In contrast, in this paper I do not focus on the source of the

lack of employment earnings but instead cast attention more directly on the sources of income

used by those not working to understand how—and how much—hardship is avoided.



   3. Benefit programs for older workers in the United States

In this section I briefly describe the different sources of government benefit income for older

Americans. I focus in particular on the ages at which benefit entitlement is earned. The

discussion begins with Social Security, and then moves on to unemployment insurance, workers’

compensation, and other benefits.




The bulk of government-provided retirement income comes through Social Security retirement

benefits. Earnings from the best 35 years are translated into a wage-adjusted average called the

Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). This amount is then pushed through a progressive

benefit formula that pays 90 percent for the first tier of AIME, 32 percent for the second, and 15

                                                   3
percent for the rest. The resulting Primary Insurance Amount is the benefit that would be paid if

someone retired at the normal retirement age. For those retiring earlier, the Primary Insurance

Amount is adjusted using an actuarial factor to account for the length of time benefits are

expected to be received. The first age at which benefits can be taken is age 62, and the maximum

adjustment is 30 percent. Retirement after the normal retirement age (up to age 69) generates

entitlement to the delayed retirement credit, currently at eight per cent per year of delay. These

benefits are partially taxable. Surviving spouses receive a partial benefit, and there is also a small

death benefit. Around 94 percent of workers are covered by Social Security, with railroad and

state and local government employees accounting for most of the uncovered. The average benefit

for retired workers is around $1180 per month.




In addition to retirement benefits, Social Security provides disability insurance (SSDI) to

qualifying individuals unable to work. One needs to have worked a certain amount to become

eligible, and also the disability must be deemed severe enough to warrant benefits.1 At the

normal retirement age, the SSDI payments are transformed into retirement benefits. Current

average monthly benefits are around $1,070.




The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is available to those without other resources

who are age 65 or older, blind, or disabled. This program is subject to a tight asset test ($2,000

for individuals; $3,000 per couples) and also an income test. The average monthly benefit is

around $500.



1
 The two tests are a) inability to do any ‘substantial work because of your medical condition(s)’ and b) the
condition(s) must be expected to last at least one year (or be expected to result in death).

                                                          4
In addition to the above federally-administered benefits, there are also several state-administered

benefits for which older workers may be eligible. Those who have worked but are now out of a

job can be eligible for state-run unemployment insurance schemes. Benefits are typically for a

fixed duration.2 Some states have public workers’ compensation, but most states mandate

private insurance coverage for employers.



    4. Empirical Approach

In this section I set out my empirical approach and also some definitional issues. The empirical

approach is straightforward and is guided by the questions posed in this paper. I form measures

of retirement, income, and hardship. These measures are then analyzed through graphs and

descriptive regressions.




The regression equation to be estimated is:




where:



i indexes individuals

t indexes time

Yit is the outcome, either retirement or hardship

Xit is a vector of characteristics at time t

2
 Extensions of unemployment insurance eligibility to 99 weeks and beyond happened after the last year I use for the
HRS, which is 2008.

                                                        5
Xi0 is a vector of characteristics at time 0, when the individual is first observed.



Estimation is by Ordinary Least Squares, which in the case of binary dependent variables

becomes a linear probability model.3 The standard errors for the regressions are adjusted by

clustering on individuals, and the use of the robust adjustment to account for heterogeneity.




The unit of observation for most of the analysis is the individual. This choice derives from the

questions posed in the introduction. The goal of the paper is to examine the welfare of those who

are not working in ages before public pension entitlement. Working (or not) is an individual

concept, so the focus on the individual is natural. Information on the individual is supplemented

by information on his or her spouse and some other family characteristics.




A vexing problem is the definition of retirement. Borland (2004) developed a conceptual

framework for defining retirement, while Denton and Spencer (2009) review the issues that arise

in choosing a definition. I guide my choice by the focus of the question posed in the introduction.

The concern is for the wellbeing of those not working during their pre-entitlement years.

Whatever the reason for not working, it is the set of people not working that is the target of

policy concern. Whether they are not working because of unemployment or because of a choice

to retire early, the source of income and wellbeing at these ages is the focus of this paper. This

focus motivates the choice of a zero-earnings definition for retirement.

    Estimation using a probit shows very similar parameter estimates.

                                                           6
I supplement this zero-earnings definition with two others. One is a self-assessed retirement

measure, drawn from the question on labor force activity.4 The second is to allow for some

earnings by marking as retired only those who have their major source of income from a

category other than labor market earnings.5 I use these alternative definitions to check the

sensitivity of the results.



    5. Data

The dataset employed in this paper is the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a

panel dataset that follows older workers from work into retirement. It combines information on

labor market activity with questions on incomes health, and wealth, in addition to the normal

demographic controls. Five cohort groups are stacked together within the HRS, providing a

broader age range across years. I use the processed files for the HRS provided by RAND, version

K. The RAND HRS is organized into 9 biannual waves, from 1992 to 2008.6 I use all of the

available waves, and always use the provided sample weights.




For most of the analysis, the target range for ages is 55 to 66. Those under 55 are too far from

retirement ages to be of interest for the questions posed here. Those over age 66 have reached the

normal retirement age and are therefore outside the focus. For much of the analysis, I condition

on having worked at ages 53/54. This allows me to capture the baseline work characteristics as

the individuals enter the panel. Again, this is motivated by the focus of the paper—how people




4
  Those out of the labor force are asked why. One of the coded responses is for retirement.
5
  The two other categories I form are government incomes and non-labor private income (pension and capital
income).
6
  Data for the AHEAD cohorts from 1993 and 1995 is combined with the original HRS cohorts for 1994 and 1995.

                                                      7
who stop work before pension entitlement manage to survive. The welfare of those who were not

working as they enter near-retirement ages is important, but not relevant for the question at hand.




From the raw data, I form the variables used for the analysis. Most variables are taken directly

from the coding provided in the RAND K version. I make two noteworthy modifications. First, I

capture work and some personal characteristics at ages 53/54 and attach these characteristics to

all future observations available between ages 55 and 66. This allows me to control for these

factors without worrying about the endogeneity of these factors to work decisions. Second, I

create several aggregations of the provided income variables. These aggregations are earnings,

non-labor private income, and government income.7 These aggregations together sum to the total

income measure provided in the raw data.




Some descriptive statistics for the sample are provided in Table 1 and Table 2, for women and

men respectively. All dollar values have been transformed to 2008 dollars using the CPI-U.

Income and wealth measures have both the mean and median reported, along with the standard

deviation. For binary variables, I report just the proportion. Across the tables I show the values

for the full sample of 55 to 64 year olds, (including only those who worked at ages 53-54), and

then restrict the sample to zero earners for the second column. The third and fourth columns

show values for further subsamples of zero earners: those under the poverty line and those who

are covered by an employer-provided pension when they are observed at ages 53-54. Further


7
  Earnings comprises wages, bonuses, tips, overtime, and commissions. For non-labor private income, I include
capital income (including from a business), annuity and employer pension income, and ‘other’ income (includes
pension and insurance lumpsums, alimony, and inheritance; does not include income from friends and family).
Government income includes Social Security DI, Social Security retirement/widow/spouse, unemployment
insurance / workers’ compensation, and other government transfers (food stamps, welfare, and veterans’ benefits).

                                                         8
descriptive statistics are provided in the Appendix tables. There are 3,351 women in total in the

sample, with 14,644 total observations. For men, the numbers are 2,859 and 12,670.

At these ages, earnings for women represent over half of total income. Non-labor private income

is another third, but government income plays a small role at the mean and median. Only 4.9

percent of these women live in families below the federal poverty line. Twenty-seven percent of

the observations report zero earnings, but only 17 percent are self-reported retired. Over a third

of the women have a source other than earnings as their major source of income.




The next set of variables looks at workplace characteristics. Workplace pensions are reported for

59.5 percent of women, and 28.5 percent have defined benefit pensions. These employed women

are typically covered by employer-provided health insurance, with 84.8 percent coverage. Two

thirds of the women report job-related stress, and 63.8 percent report their work has some

physical aspect to it. On average, the women have worked for 27.9 years.




The same variables are reported for men in Table 2. Earnings overall are higher for men than

they were for women, and earnings makes up a bigger share of total income at the averages.

Poverty rates and the retirement measures are comparable to those reported by women. The job

characteristics are also quite similar to those seen for the women, except for average years

worked which is higher.



   6. Results

The results are presented in a series of graphs and tables. The description of these results is

organized corresponding to the three questions that motivate the paper: characterizing who

                                                  9
retires early, watching the evolution of income distribution and sources over these ages, and how

hardship is avoided.




   6.1 Who doesn’t work before age 67?

A comparison of the proportion of women not working at each age is presented in Figure 1,

using all three definitions. The sample here includes everyone age 51 to 70, including those who

may not be working at age 53/54. The age trend of all three measures is similar, but the level for

the major source definition is about twice as high. This results from people who are employed

less than full-time, full-year who have other sources of income but have not completely

withdrawn from employment. The zero-earnings definition shows a slightly higher rate than the

self-reported definition. This is consistent with people who do not work at all but do not consider

themselves retired, such as the long-term unemployed or people who are disabled. For the

patterns through time, there is a quick rise around age 62, the age of Social Security retirement

benefit entitlement, and a leveling out after age 65.




The same data for men are presented in Figure 2. The trends are, similar to the women,

comparable for the three definitions. The jump at age 62 is a bit more pronounced for men than

for women.




To delve further into non-work at these ages, I run regressions using the regression model

explained earlier. The three columns in Table 3 use as dependent variables the three definitions

of non-work for women. The coefficients and standard errors for the variables included in the


                                                 10
model are listed in the rows, spread across the two pages of the table. The first set of variables is

a set of age dummies for ages 56 to 66, with age 55 left out. All three definitions show

increasing propensity to stop work as people get older, and that the impact of aging is large. For

the first model in Table 3 the r-squared is 0.163—but with only the age dummies the r-squared is

still 0.083. The coefficients for race show no strong patterns, but education shows a sharp

difference between high-school dropouts (the left-out category) and the other three categories,

with higher education women being less likely to stop working. Having employer-provided

pensions or health-insurance tends to decrease non-work, although defined-benefit pensions do

increase non-work (likely because of the incentives embedded in the benefit formulas). Neither

stressful nor physically demanding jobs predict exit. Having an employed husband tends to

decrease non-work, but if he is employed full time the probability of not working increases.

Finally, those with more non-housing net worth measured at age 53-54 are more likely to be not

working, although the effect is rather small, at 6.8 percent points per million dollars in the zero-

earnings definition.




The male results presented in Table 4 show some strongly different patterns. The results for age

and race are very similar to women. However, there is no difference across education groups for

men. The impact of spousal employment is also different for men, as there is no impact visible of

having a wife who was working when the man was age 53-54 on non-work at older ages.




Overall, this evidence suggests that demographics and workplace characteristics other than

pensions do a relatively poor job of explaining retirement at pre-entitlement ages. Breaking the

sample into 55-61 and 62-66 blocks produces similar results to those presented here. The

                                                 11
dominant factor is age—capturing taste and wealth factors that are correlated with aging but not

otherwise included in the model.


   6.2 Income distribution before age 67

The next question to be addressed is the distribution and composition of incomes in the years

before benefit entitlement age. How do these sources change as benefit entitlement age

approaches? The analysis begins with a quick look at the overall total income distribution, and

then proceeds to several graphs exploring the composition of income.




In Figure 3 and Figure 4, I show several moments of the distribution of total income for women

and for men. At the median and above, there is a clear downward trend in incomes with age. In a

further cut of the data not shown here, this is driven by those not working, who have lower

incomes. For those still working, the income distributions look much more flat with age. At the

bottom of the distribution, there is an increase starting at age 62—the age of Social Security

retirement entitlement. The gap between the 10th and 25th percentiles closes noticeably.

Combined, the data exhibit a clear compression of the income distribution at older ages as retired

higher earners begin living off their normally-lower retirement incomes and those at the bottom

of the distribution reach ages of Social Security entitlement.




Having looked at the levels of income, I now turn to the composition of income. Figure 5 and

Figure 6 show the breakdown of total income into the three aggregates of income at each age

from 55 to 66. These graph the average income share across individuals. Earnings makes up the

majority of income for women until age 60 and men until age 62. At age 62 for both men and


                                                 12
women, the share of government income starts growing strongly. Non-labor private income sees

its share go down after age 62, but not substantially. The next graphs break down the government

income and the private non-labor income to understand better the reasons for these patterns.




Figure 7 and Figure 8 look into the sources of government income for women and for men. The

graphs show the proportion of women and men who are in receipt of any of the listed sources of

income. Social Security DI, unemployment insurance, and other government sources are fairly

constant for both men and women. The immediately obvious effect in both graphs is the

widespread receipt of Social Security retirement benefits after age 62.8 It is Social Security

retirement benefits that drive the government income shares seen in Figure 5 and Figure 6




The same analysis is repeated for non-labor private income in Source: Author’s calculations

using the HRS.

Figure 9 and Figure 10. Capital income is received by over 60 percent of both men and women.9

However, the amount of capital income is fairly small for most people. Among those with any

capital income, the median for men is around $3,000 at all the ages in this range, while for

women it is around $2,000. Pension and annuity income incidence grows steadily for both men

and women across ages, but more sharply for men. The amounts of pension and annuity income

are quite a bit larger than the other sources. At the median among those with any pension and




8
  Recall that the HRS groups together retirement, spousal, and widow benefits as ‘retirement’. Since more women
outlive their husbands than the reverse, this explains why more women are receiving Social Security retirement
before age 62 than are men.
9
  For capital income and other income, only couple-level aggregates are provided. For people living in couples, I
split the capital and the other income in equal halves for the husband and wife.

                                                        13
annuity income, men receive around $20,000 across the ages of concern here, and women around

$10,000.




This analysis has revealed three major findings about the distribution and composition of income

at ages approaching retirement. First, the income distribution compresses across ages as the

retirement of those in the top half of the income distribution lowers their income and those at the

bottom see their incomes rise when they reach age 62 and become eligible for Social Security

retirement benefits. Second, government income is small in aggregate until age 62, when Social

Security retirement benefits take a large and important position in total income. Third, non-labor

private income is fairly widely held, but the distribution is skewed. This skewness is strong for

capital income, but more muted for pension and annuity income.




   6.3 How poverty is avoided

The analysis in the previous section makes clear the important role played by Social Security

income after reaching age 62. However, a not insubstantial proportion of Americans are not

working at ages earlier than 62. What sources of income are important for these early retirees? In

this subsection, I examine this question. First, I show the rates of poverty for several interesting

groups. I then conduct an accounting exercise to see what sources of income lift the non-working

men and women in the sample above the poverty line. Finally, I run descriptive regressions to

explain the characteristics of those who are more likely to be under the poverty line, among those

not working.




                                                 14
The proportion of women living in families under the poverty line is graphed in Figure 11, and

men in Figure 12. I show the level for all observations, and then just among zero earners. I also

then split the zero-earners into those with and those without a workplace pension when observed

earlier at age 53/54. For women, the rate of poverty across the entire age range is fairly constant

at around 10 percent; although there is a slight increase at age 61 just before entitlement to Social

Security Retirement benefits. For zero-earners, the poverty rate is more than twice as high until

age 61 when the gap is narrowed somewhat. The poverty rate for those with a pension is

substantially higher than those without. The trends for men in Figure 12 are very similar, except

that there is no discernible dip at age 62 like there is for women.




To take another look at the poverty rates, I decompose the sample of women and men into

groups by the level of non-real estate net wealth. This more liquid measure of wealth allows a

view of which households have savings that can be more easily accessed to fund living expenses.

It is possible that those retiring before the age of benefit entitlement are doing so because they

have sufficient assets to draw down to allow them to live comfortably. These poverty lines are

graphed in Figure 13 and Figure 14.




The non-working women in Figure 13 have an overall poverty rate declining from over 20

percent to 11 percent by age 66, with a particular jump up at age 61 and down at age 62. For

those with less than $20,000 in non-real estate net wealth (making up 55 per cent of the sample)

the rate follows the same path—but at a higher level than the non-workers. For those with levels

of non-real estate net wealth over $20,000, poverty is under ten percent and doesn’t change

substantially with age.

                                                 15
The men are graphed in Figure 14. For the whole sample of non-workers, poverty is just under

20 percent across younger ages, declining noticeably after age 63. For the 53 percent of the

sample with less than $20,000 in non-real estate wealth, poverty rates are higher, but follow the

same pattern with age. For those with greater levels of non-real estate wealth, however, the

poverty rates are not monotonic with wealth. The rate among those with $20,000 to $100,000 of

non-real estate wealth bounces between 0 and 10 percent. In contrast, for those with $100,000 to

$300,000, more than 10 percent of those under age 62 are not reaching the poverty threshold.

Poverty rates for the 10 percent of the sample with more than $300,000 are very small. This

suggests that there is a set of families who do use assets to bridge their consumption until

reaching the age of Social Security entitlement. These families show up with incomes under the

poverty line, but have fairly substantial levels of assets—the $100,000 threshold is at the 76th

percentile of the distribution of this measure of wealth.




To dig deeper into the avoidance of poverty at these ages, I conduct an accounting analysis on

those who are not working at ages 55 to 66. The goal of the accounting exercise is to gain a

deeper understanding of how the individuals who are not working are able to avoid living in

poverty. The policy concern that motivated the paper was a worry that those retiring before the

age of Social Security retirement might suffer until their Social Security benefits begin to flow.

The accounting analysis addresses this question directly by showing whether and how poverty is

avoided.




                                                 16
I take each source of income, and several aggregates, and see how important each source is to the

avoidance of poverty. In doing so, I am limited in certain ways by the data available in the HRS

as the income definitions differ from those used for the income definitions for poverty. For

example, the other government income category contains income from food stamps, but this is

not included in the income definition for poverty. Similarly, capital gains income should be

excluded. Also, the HRS provides income data only for the couple, while the income definition

for poverty includes other household members’ income as well. These shortcomings must be

kept in mind as the accounting analysis is interpreted.




Table 5 presents the accounting analysis for women. Going down the table, I list the income

categories and the aggregates. As I reach the bottom of the table, I report the results both for total

HRS couple income and for the income level used for the poverty line, as provided by the HRS.

The columns of the table show first the proportion of women with a positive value for the

income measure, and then the median among the positive values. The last three columns show

the proportion of women for whom that income measure, taken by itself, lifts the family above

the poverty line. This is shown for the whole age 55-66 sample, as well as for subsamples by age

of 55-61 and 62-66.




Capital income assigned to the women is present for 64 percent of women, but the level at the

median is fairly small. Still, 18.3 percent of women are lifted out of poverty by capital income

alone. Other income is not widespread and lifts few above the poverty line. Pension and annuity

income is received by 16.7 percent of women, and this lifts only 7.3 percent above the poverty

line. Social Security DI and retirement benefits are received by around one fifth and one third of

                                                 17
women, respectively. However, neither plays a large role in lifting women out of poverty—

although retirement benefits do much better after age 62, naturally. Total government income

overall lifts only 9.8 percent out of poverty, although this source is more than twice as important

after age 62 as before it. Much more important for women are spousal sources of income. Labor

earnings, non-labor sources, and government income of the husband together lift 55.7 percent of

women over the poverty line, with each of these three components making a substantial

contribution. Using the total couple income as reported in the HRS, 74 percent of women overall

are lifted out of poverty. In the last row, the income measure used for the official poverty line

calculations is shown, which lifts a further 7.6 percent out of poverty.




The accounting analysis is repeated for men in Table 6 and the results are quite different. Capital

income alone lifts 25.9 percent of men above the poverty line. Pensions and annuity income is

more than twice as important for men as it was for women, with 16.9 percent overall and 22.7

percent of those over age 62 lifted above the poverty line. Social Security DI is a more important

source for men than it was for women, with 8.5 percent lifted out of poverty on that source alone.

Social Security retirement benefits are also more important for men than for women, with 27.9

percent (compared to 10.9 percent of women) lifted out of poverty. Spousal income for men,

however, is less important than it was for women. In particular, the government income of wives

is much less important to husbands as was the government income of husbands for their wives.

Overall, 80.7 percent of nonworking men have HRS couple income above the poverty line.

When using the official income measure for poverty, this proportion is increased further to 84.7

percent. As with women, roughly 4 out of 5 men who are not working at these pre-entitlement

ages still find a way to have incomes above the poverty line.


                                                 18
The final step in the analysis of poverty here is to run regressions using the poverty indicator as

the dependent variable and the same set of explanatory variables as was used in the previous

regression analysis. I present these results separately for women and for men, using the full

sample and the sample of zero-earners.




The regression results for women are in the first two columns of Table 7. In the full sample, age

does not have a big influence on being in poverty. The one exception is a small spike at age 61,

just before benefit entitlement for Social Security. In contrast, the pattern of age coefficients for

the sample of zero-earners is stronger. There is a very large 11.6 percentage point spike at age

61. More generally, poverty appears to be more muted after age 62. Re-running this regression

with the full set of age dummies replaced by an over/under age 62 dummy gives a significant

coefficient of -0.057 (0.018). This suggests that zero earners before age 62 are more likely to end

up in poverty than those after age 62. Among the other variables, education lowers the

probability of being in poverty, as does being an immigrant. However, being black tends to

increase poverty rates, all else equal. Being married has a strong negative effect on poverty in the

zero-earning sample. This is consistent with the accounting exercise which found a very

important role for spousal income. Workplace characteristics don’t seem to matter much.




The male results are in the last two columns of the table. The results are very similar to the

females, showing a stronger propensity of zero-earners under age 62 to be in poverty. Using the

single over/under age 62 dummy again, the coefficient is -0.053 (0.021).



                                                  19
The analysis of poverty has revealed several important findings. Foremost is that around 4 out of

5 of people not working at ages 55 to 66 are able to avoid poverty through some combination of

government and non-labor private income. For women, spousal income is quite important. For

men, Social Security and pension and annuity income is important. There is some evidence that

those with zero earnings before the early retirement age of 62 are more likely to suffer from

poverty. Finally, there are indications that some families with high asset levels use the assets to

bridge their consumption to pension entitlement ages and thus show up as being temporarily in

poverty in spite of their high asset holdings.



   7. Conclusions

This paper has addressed the wellbeing of Americans who are not working during the ages just

before entitlement to Social Security retirement benefits. Early retirement (and non-work) is

fairly prevalent, but is not easily explained by workplace characteristics or demographics. The

incomes of those not working at these ages before entitlement are compressed. Social Security

benefits play a large role for incomes after age 62, while pension and annuity income is more

important for men than for women. Poverty among those who retire early is fairly high, but is

mitigated in four out of five cases by some combination of non-labor private income and

government benefits. Among those remaining in poverty, Social Security entitlement at age 62

offers some respite.




Future research will look more deeply at those who avoid poverty at pre-entitlement ages. How

prevalent is asset draw down among this group? Does health play a large role? Answers to these




                                                 20
questions will help to understand the implications of future policy reforms that may change

retirement benefit entitlement ages.

 Note: Data are from the HRS. Reported are descriptive statistics of several variables from the sample.
 The first column shows the whole sample of people working at age 53/54. The next three columns use a
 subsample of zero earners. The third column restricts the sample to those with zero earnings under the
 poverty line. The fourth column restricts the sample to zero earnings with a workplace pension at age
 53/54. All workplace characteristics are recorded at age 53/54.

 Note: Data are from the HRS. Reported are descriptive statistics of several variables from the sample.
 The first column shows the whole sample of people working at age 53/54. The next three columns use
 a subsample of zero earners. The third column restricts the sample to those with zero earnings under
 the poverty line. The fourth column restricts the sample to zero earnings with a workplace pension at
 age 53/54.
