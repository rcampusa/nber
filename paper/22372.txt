                                          ABSTRACT

This paper investigates which attributes of a Carnegie PhD-level institution predict the share of
its undergraduate BA recipients that will earn a PhD. Four broad PhD fields are studied:
humanities, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. We use restricted-access,
individual-level Survey of Earned Doctorates data to determine both where and when PhD
recipients received their BA, and truncation-correction methodology to account for PhD receipt
after the data end. Across fields, we find that PhD production is positively related to the number
of highly-ranked PhD programs an institution has, suggesting such departments may play a dual
role in both producing PhDs as well as encouraging undergraduates to earn PhDs themselves. We
also find that PhD production is negatively related to the total number of students and the share of
total BAs that are received in the field, and is positively related to student test scores.

1       Introduction

This study examines the characteristics of an institution that correlate with the share of
its BAs that ultimately receive a PhD, or its PhD production rate. We examine four fields
separately, the humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences. Despite long
reported poor job market prospects for new humanities PhDs, graduate programs in the
humanities have continued, sometimes with smaller cohort sizes, to churn out PhD students
in the humanities. On the other hand, STEM fields, the life sciences and physical sciences,
strongly contribute to the economy, foster innovation, and lead PhDs in these fields to receive
high salaries. We study a number of factors of institutions, such as expenditure measures, the
number of total students, and other student body characteristics that might be associated
with predicting the PhD production rate. In addition to producing PhDs, departments also
educate undergraduate students, and one focus of this paper is to see whether the scope and
quality of an institution’s PhD programs are related the likelihood that its undergraduate
students go on to receive PhDs. Put another way, we are interested in the dual role that
departments at universities play in producing new PhDs and in generating undergraduate
student interest in going on for doctoral degrees, typically at other institutions.
        We focus our attention on doctoral institutions.1 Using data from the National Sci-
ence Foundation’s Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) linked to the IPEDS Completions
Survey, we calculate that for 1980-2001 BA recipients, the fraction of BAs in a given field
that receive PhDs in the same field is higher at baccalaureate institutions 2 than at doc-
toral institutions.3 However, because of the differences in the sizes of these two types of
    1
      We define define doctoral institutions as 2015 Carnegie Categories 15: Doctoral Universities: Highest
Research Activity; 16: Doctoral Universities: Higher Research Activity; and 17: Doctoral Universities:
Moderate Research Activity.
    2
      We define baccalaureate as 2015 Carnegie Categories 21: Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts and Science
Focus; 22: Baccalaureate Colleges: Diverse Fields; and 23: Baccalaureate/Associate’s Colleges: Mixed
Baccalaureate/Associate’s. We do not consider category 14: Baccalaureate/Associate’s Colleges: Associate’s
Dominant.
    3
      This calculation is for BA-years 1980-2001 and consider only those with a time-to-degree of 15 years or
less, which contrasts from the approach later in the paper, where the maximum time-to-degree varies by
field. The total number of PhDs in a given field is divided by the total number of BA recipients in the same
field. Some of the PhD recipients received BAs in other fields. We include only observations for which there


                                                     1
institutions, doctoral institutions produce far more total PhDs than baccalaureate colleges.
Doctoral institutions produce 5.8 times as many PhDs than do baccalaureate colleges for the
physical sciences; they also produce 2.7 times as many for the humanities, 4.7 times as many
for the life sciences, and 3.7 times as many for the social sciences.4 With the exception of
life sciences, the ratios are even higher for Master’s colleges.5 Therefore, knowledge of the
characteristics of the Carnegie doctoral institutions that lead to more undergraduates going
on to receive PhDs is of importance in understanding the determinants of PhD production.
        Lemke (2009) is among the latest studies to examine the determinants of undergrad-
uate institutions in “generating” (producing) PhD recipients.6 This study computed a PhD
production rate by dividing publicly-available data on the number of PhDs in all fields earned
by alumni of selective liberal arts colleges by the number of BAs earned by the students at
these institutions. Because of this study’s use of public-use data, while it was known where
a PhD recipient received her BA, it was not known when he or she received it. Lemke (2009)
assumed a 6-year time-to-degree (TTD) window from BA to PhD, which often is too short of
a window. We use restricted-access, individual-level SED data to observe the actual matches
of where and when each individual PhD graduated from his or her BA institution. For each
field, we compute one observation per institution-BA year on the percentage of BAs who
received PhDs. This is in contrast to the one observation per institution in the Lemke (2009)
study, where both the numerator and denominator of the dependent variable are averages
over different 10-year periods.
        When using individual-level data to compute the PhD production rate, there is an
is a match with the Completions Survey data. The institution must have produced at least 5 PhDs over the
SED data, without regard to TTD. Other sample restrictions are as in Section A.
    4
      This calculation makes use of sample restrictions as in Section A, including that the institution must
have produced at least 5 PhDs, but here consider all TTDs, not just up to 15 years. The BA years are
1980-2005.
    5
      We define Master’s institutions as 2015 Carnegie Categories 18: Master’s Colleges and Universities:
Larger Programs; 19: Master’s Colleges and Universities: Medium Programs; and 20: Master’s Colleges and
Universities: Small Programs.
    6
      Many other studies have addressed the determinants of PhD students’ times to degree and completion
rates. See, for example, Knapp and Goodrich (1951), Tidball (1986), Schapiro et al. (1991), Ehrenberg et
al. (2007), Groen et al. (2008), Ehrenberg et al. (2009), Bowen and Bok (2016), and Groen (2016).



                                                     2
inherent truncation problem. Not all PhDs from a given BA cohort are observed because
some individuals complete their PhD after the conclusion of the data. The truncation prob-
lem increases in severity for later cohorts. We use truncation correction methodology, where
early cohorts’ patterns of time-to-degree are used to predict the number of PhDs that later
cohorts will eventually produce. After correcting for truncation, we examine which features
of the institution predict the share of graduates that ultimately receive a PhD.
       In our main specification using the full sample, we find the number of an institution’s
departments that are in the top 10th percentile of the National Research Council (NRC) 1995
doctoral rankings in each field is one of the three variables that is correlated with the PhD
production rate across each field. Put simply, the number of high-quality doctoral programs
is an important predictor of the rate at which undergraduates go on for PhD study. The
other two variables that are statistically significant across all fields are the incoming student
75th percentile test scores, which is positively related with the PhD production rate, and the
total number of students, which is negatively related. Other variables, such as institutional
expenditures per student and the percentage of total BAs in the field, are significant for
some, but not all, fields. We also restrict the sample to Carnegie category 15 institutions
(Highest Research Activity), which have the highest level of research activity. Finally, we
conduct an analysis along the lines of that done in Lemke (2009). For both, we find generally
similar results to the baseline specification, although the NRC top 10th percentile variable
is significant in only two of the four fields, life sciences and social sciences.



2     PhD Production

Following Lemke (2009), we assume that characteristics of the undergraduate institution
generate, or produce, PhDs. We first list the explanatory variables considered in the anal-
ysis. We break down these characteristics into four categories: institutional, expenditure,
student body, and graduate programs. Appendix A provides details on the data.



                                                 3
                                Institutional Characteristics
       First, we include the student-faculty ratio. The smaller the class size, the greater the
potential for students to interact with the professor, which may lead to the students being
more interested in pursuing graduate studies. Next, we include a public institution indicator.
If the quality or amount of interaction between faculty and students differs between public
and private institutions, this may lead to differing propensities to pursue a PhD. The mission
of the institution may be generally different between the two types and may also influence
the propensity.
                                        Expenditures
       We include instructional expenditures per student. Greater instructional expenditures—
of which faculty salaries are a large part—may attract faculty who are more research pro-
ductive. Students may then want to emulate the career paths of these faculty by pursuing
PhDs themselves. We also include research expenditures per full-time faculty. A higher level
of research spending likely leads to higher quality research. This may influence students,
making a career in research via a PhD more attractive.
                                Student Body Characteristics
       As a proxy for the institution’s academic ability, we consider first-year incoming stu-
dent test scores, specifically a combination of 75th percentile SAT and ACT scores, weighted
by the percentage of scores from each. We emphasize that the scores are for first-year, not
seniors. We additionally include several measures of the size and composition of the stu-
dent body: the total number of students (including graduate and professional students), the
percentage of the students that are undergraduates, the percentage of undergraduates that
are female, and the percentage of undergraduates that come from underrepresented minority
groups. Because the importance on campus of, say, the humanities could play a role in
generating interest in humanities PhD study, in the humanities regressions, we include the
percentage of BAs that were received in the humanities in our humanities equations. We


                                              4
similarly include the percent of degrees received in the other three fields in their relevant
equations.
                                      Graduate Programs
       Finally, we are interested if having highly-ranked doctoral programs is associated with
having a higher PhD production rate. More highly-ranked doctoral programs is presumably
correlated with having more faculty at the cutting edge of their field, and, to the extent that
these faculty interact with undergraduate students, this may influence students’ decisions to
obtain a PhD in the humanities. Thus, we include a set of variables indicating the number
of humanities’ doctoral programs an institution has in several percentile bins: 0-10, 11-25,
25-50, and 51-100.



3    Estimating Equation

In order to obtain estimates, we employ weighted least squares regression with the PhD
production rate, defined in Section 4.3, as the dependent variable. We run the regression
separately by PhD field. Specifically:


             P hdP rodRatei,f,y = α0 + α1 IndepV ars + Carnegiei + Y eary + i,f,y ,


where, for institution i, field f in BA-year y, P hdP rodRatei,f,y is the PhD production rate
defined in Section 4.3, Y eary are year fixed effects, and i,f,y is the error term. Carnegiei
is the Carnegie category of the institution, with category 15 (Highest Research Activity)
being the omitted category. We include these because institutions vary substantially across
Carnegie categories (see Section 5). IndepV arsi,f,y is a vector containing the explanatory
variable (and missing variable indicators) as described in Section 2: Stud − F T F ac Ratio,
P ublic, Instr. Exp./Student, Rsch. Exp./F T F clty, 75 P ercentile Score, T otal Students,

#N RC 11 − 25 in (F ield), #N RC 26 − 50 in (F ield), #N RC 51 − 100 in (F ield). (F ield)

refers to field of study (Humanities, Life Science, Physical Science, and Social Science), with
the field matching the field currently in consideration.
        If an observation is missing or has 0 BAs—the denominator of the PhD production
rate—then it is not included in the regression. We weight the institution-field-BA year
observation by the number of field-specific BAs.7 Robust standard errors are clustered at
the institution-level.
        In addition to the main regression above, we also present results where we restrict the
sample to Carnegie category 15 institutions (Research Activity), which have a higher PhD
production rate as well as a smaller amount of missing data as compared to the other two
categories.
        Finally, we perform an analysis in the spirit of Lemke (2009), although there are some
differences. As opposed to constructing the PhD production rate as described in Section 4,
we instead divide the total number of PhDs produced over the 1994-2003 time period by
the total number of BAs produced over the 1989-1998 time period. Truncation correction is
explicitly not used in this analysis because TTD is assumed and a PhDs are not matched to
their actual BA-year. We use the same set of institutions as appear in the main analysis, and
there is now only only observation per institution. If an observation produced PhDs but had
no BAs, it is excluded from the regression. For the explanatory variables, we take the average
value over the same 1989-1998 period among non-missing observations. If all observations
for a variable are missing, we assign that variable a value of 0 and a corresponding missing
variable a value of 1. We use robust standard errors, and weight by total BAs over the
1989-1998 period.8
   7
      It can happen that an institution is predicted to have a very high (even greater than 1) PhD share. In
such cases, it is likely that the institution awards a very small number of BAs in this field, but produced
a disproportionately high number of PhDs. This can be because a relatively large share of the BAs in the
field went on to earn a PhD or BAs in other fields went on to earn a PhD. Because there are very few BAs,
these observations will receive a small weight, and not be very influential in the estimates.
    8
      Results differ somewhat if we do not weight by BAs. An advantage of using weighting is that there are
some observations that have very few BAs in a given field, but produce many PhDs, including those with
BAs from a different field. This causes the PhD production rate to be very large, even over 100. Weighting
greatly reduces the influence that such observations have in the regression.

4     Constructing the PhD Production Rate and Cor-

      recting for Truncation

We define the PhD production rate as the fraction of BAs for a given institution-BA year
that obtain a PhD. We return to the details of its construction in Section 4.3 after first
introducing the concept of maximum TTD in Section 4.1 and, in Section 4.2, how we employ
truncation correction to address not being able to observe PhDs granted after the SED
sample ends.


4.1    Maximum TTD

We measure the PhD production rate for students who earn a PhD within a given time,
which we denote as the the maximum TTD. Earning a PhD often takes many years. To
illustrate, Figure 1 plots the distribution of TTD by field for BA years 1980 and 1981, the
two earliest years in the sample. Because the final year of the SED sample is 2016, the
longest observable TTD for BA-year 1980 is 36 years and for BA-year 1981 is 35 years, and
all PhDs earned after this are truncated. This figure shows that nearly all PhDs are earned
by 30 years for the life and physical sciences, with a larger tail for the humanities and social
sciences. The peaks of these latter two fields are also longer, suggesting a longer average
TTD.
       This truncation problem is the most pronounced for BA-year 2005, the final BA-year
in the sample. For this year, the longest observable TTDs is only 11 years. We use the
truncation-correction technique presented below in Section 4.2 to estimate how many PhDs
will be produced by the maximum TTD.
       The higher the maximum TTD, the higher the number of PhDs are observed. But
there is a tradeoff: The higher the maximum TTD, the fewer the number of BA-years there
are for which we observe all PhDs for the maximum TTD, and the more truncation correction
is necessary. In this paper, we use field-specific maximum TTDs based on Table 1. This


                                               7
table displays separately by field the cumulative percentage of PhDs that were received by
each TTD for BA-years 1980 and 1981. For each field, we select the smallest TTD for which
at least 90% of PhDs had been earned.9 Thus maximum TTDs of 23, 20, 16, and 22 years
are used for humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences, respectively.
Choosing the maximum TTD this way puts all of the fields on an equal playing field, taking
into account the different TTD distributions. This means, however, that the extent to which
we must use truncation correction and thus artificially generate the outcome variable differs
by field, being the most in the humanities and the least in the physical sciences. For the
humanities, we observe the maximum TTD for BA-years 1980-1993 (because we observe
PhDs until 2016), and use truncation correction for remaining BA-years, 1994-2005.


4.2    Truncation Correction

We employ the simple truncation correction technique used in Prenovitz et al. (2016) to
estimate how many PhDs would be produced if we had observed PhDs up to the maximum
TTD. Using the number of PhDs produced by 2016 as a baseline, we predict how many
more would be produced had we observed the entire maximum TTD. The training sample
that goes into the prediction uses the BA-years for which we observe the maximum TTD;
as an example, for the humanities this is 1980-1993. Using these years only, we compute the
percentage of PhDs were received by each TTD, up to to maximum TTD. These cumula-
tive percentages are then applied to the remaining years (1994-2005 for humanities) at the
institution-BA year level to estimate the number of PhDs.
       An example will illustrate. Suppose that in the humanities, a given institution-field
with BA-year 2003 produced 6 PhDs by 2016. Because the maximum observed TTD is 13,
the cumulative percentage for a TTD of 13 will be used. Suppose that this is calculated to
be x. The predicted number of PhDs that will be produced by 2026 (23 years after BA-year)
is computed to be ( x1 )6.
  9
    In this table, TTDs of 36 years are combined with TTDs of 35 years; only the 1980 cohort has an
observed TTD of 35 years.

                                                8
          Here, we formalize the above idea. The prediction is based on the years for which the
full TTDs exist (1980-1993 for the humanities). Restricting the sample to these years only,
we compute the cumulative percentage of degrees that occur after TTDs of 4,...,MaxTTD,
where MaxTTD is the maximum TTD (4,...,23 years for the humanities).
          Specifically, we first compute the cumulative number of degrees by each TTD for each
institution, separately by field. Define the number of degrees granted by institution i, field
                                   t
f , BA-year y, at TTD t, to be P hDi,f,y , where t ∈ {4, M axT T D}.10 The cumulative number
of degrees for institution i by TTD t is then:

                                                           t
                                                           X
                                             t                       t
                                      CumP hDi,f,y =             P hDi,f,y .
                                                           t=4


These are aggregated across institutions to the TTD-level to produce CumP hDft :


                                                     X
                                    CumP hDt =                    t
                                                           CumP hDi,f,y .
                                                      i

Sum across TTDs to produce the total number of PhDs at the maximum TTD:

                                                    M axT
                                                      XT D
                                   T otalP hDf =                 CumP hDft .
                                                       t=4


Now, obtain the cumulative percentage of degrees granted for each TTD:11

                                                          CumP hDft
                                        CumP cttf =                   .
                                                          T otalP hDf

          We next apply the cumulative percentages to each institution-BA year for years for
which we do not observe the max TTD (1994-2005 for humanities) to obtain the estimated
total number of degrees for each institution-BA year. This is done by multiplying the number
of degrees produced by the maximum observed TTD by the inverse of the corresponding
 10
      We reassign TTDs of less than 4 years to be 4 years.
 11
      The cumulative percentage is actually a fraction, not a percentage.

where M axObsT T D is the maximum TTD that it was possible for the BA-year to have;
this is equivalent to 2016 − y. For example, M axObsT T D for BA-year 2003 is 13. Note that
the CumP ct value takes on the value corresponding to M axObsT T D. If an observation
produced 0 PhDs by 2016, we assign it a predicted value of 0. This method uses information
from past years to predict PhD rates for future years. It assumes that the production patterns
of PhDs does not vary by year, or that the pattern from the earlier estimating sample will
occur in the later prediction sample. For each field, we use the entire sample of institutions
in the training sample, regardless of which Carnegie category the institution is in.


4.3       PhD Production Rate

After implementing the truncation correction, we compute the PhD production rate for each
institution BA year, and do so separately by field. For BA-years for which we observe the
max TTD (1980-1993 for humanities), this is:

                                                                                 !
                                                                     M axT T D
                                                            CumP hDi,f,y
                          P hdP rodRatei,f,y = 100 ·                                 ,
                                                              T otalBAi,f,y

and for BA-years for which we do not observe the max TTD (1994-2005 for humanities):

                                                                                     !
                                                                         M axT T D
                                                          P redictedP hDi,f,y
                       P hdP rodRatei,f,y = 100 ·                                        ,
                                                               T otalBAi,f,y
             M axT T D                   M axT T D
where CumP hDi,f,y     and P redictedP hDi,f,y     are defined the same as previously, and
T otalBAi,f,y is the total number of BA degrees for institution i in field f in year y.12 Because
we multiply by 100, the PhD production rate is a percentage.
 12
      Observations with 0 BAs produced in the field in the BA-year are not included in the regressions.



                                                     10
          Note that the numerator includes all individuals who earned a PhD in the field,
whether or not they also earned a BA in the same field. To illustrate, Table 2 shows the BA
fields of study for PhDs in a given field. Over 93% of Physical Science PhDs also received a
BA in Physical Sciences, while only 64% of Social Science PhDs received a BA in the Social
Sciences. The denominator of the PhD production rate includes only the major that is listed
as the first major. If the individual dual-majored in a field other than their first-listed major,
then this will not be included in the other field.



5       Descriptive Statistics

We first describe several plots relating to the PhD production rate, and then proceed to
present summary statistics for the independent variables considered in the analysis.
                                         PhD Production Rate
          Figure 2 plots the total number of PhDs produced for each BA-year from 1980 to 2005.
This is broken up by PhD field. There were fewer PhDs granted in the humanities and social
sciences than in the life and physical sciences. These latter two fields both experienced
a large amount of growth beginning in the mid-1990s; the former fields also experienced
growth, but to a lesser degree.
          Panel B of Figure 2 also plots the total number of PhDs produced over time, but
breaks it up by the Carnegie category of the university. Relatively few PhDs came from
institutions in category 16, and even fewer from category 17. Both categories remained
fairly steady over the time horizon, with a small increase towards the end. Institutions
in category 15 (Highest Research Activity), meanwhile, produced many more PhDs, and
steadily increased this number beginning in the late-1990s.
          The plot in Figure 3 Panel A displays the PhD production rate, in contrast to the total
number of PhDs. Here, at the aggregate level, this is calculated by taking the overall number
of PhDs produced divided by the overall number of BAs.13 The PhD production rates in
 13
      This is as opposed to taking the average of individually-computed PhD production rates.

                                                    11
the life and physical sciences largely track each other and are very similar in magnitude for
much of the time period. These rates are also generally at least two times as large as the
rates for the humanities and social sciences, which do not experience the same growth at the
end of the sample.
        Finally, Figure 3 Panel B shows that the trends in the PhD production rate among
the various Carnegie categories are similar, but the levels differ substantially. The rate is
highest for category 15 (Highest Research Activity), while lower rates for category 16 (Higher
Research Activity), and again for category 17 (Moderate Research Activity).
                                        Independent Variables
        Table 3 displays summary statistics for the independent variables, specifically means,
standard deviations, and the percent of observations that are still missing after filling in and
interpolating as described in Section A. Means and standard deviations are conditional on
the observation not being missing. The unit of observation is an institution-BA-year; thus,
each institution contributes 26 observations.14 Observations are not weighted. Recalling
that the set of institutions included in the samples of the different field varies somewhat due
to the requirement that institutions produced at least five PhDs over the time frame, the
sample used in this table is the life sciences sample, which contains the greatest number of
institutions. For brevity, we do not present the summary statistics for the three other fields.
        The 1st–3rd columns display statistics for the full sample, while the 4th–6th, 7th–9th,
and 10th–12th columns display statistics for institutions with Carnegie category 15 (Highest
Research Activity), 16 (Higher Research Activity), and 17 (Moderate Research Activity),
respectively. After filling in and interpolating, most variables have a very small percentage of
observations missing, exceptions being the 75th percentile score, and research expenditures
per full-time faculty, both of which have a larger percentage missing across the Carnegie
category gradient. Within field, institutions that do not have any department ranked in
the NRC data are considered missing. There is a greater percentage of institutions without
  14
   Observations that do not contribute to regression results because e.g., they did not have any humanities
BAs, are still included in the summary statistics.


                                                    12
ranked NRC departments in the humanities and social sciences than in the life and physical
sciences. Across all four fields, the percentage of category 15 (Highest Research Activity)
institutions that do not have any departments ranked is small, while it is very large for
category 17 institutions (Moderate Research Activity).
       As a whole, the mean values across Carnegie category show a clear pattern. Com-
pared to category 16 (Higher Research Activity) and even more so to category 17 (Highest
Research Activity) institutions, category 15 (Highest Research Activity) institutions have
smaller student-faculty ratios, are more or equally often public institutions, and have higher
institutional expenditures per student and research expenditures per full time faculty. They
also have a smaller percentage of undergraduate students—meaning a higher percentage
of graduate and professional students—and a smaller percentage of female and minority
students. Carnegie category 15 (Highest Research Activity) institutions also have a higher
average share of undergraduate majors in the humanities, life sciences, and physical sciences.
They have a much smaller share in other majors, which include subjects such as business.
Finally, they have many more departments ranked in the 1995 NRC doctoral rankings.



6    Results

                                      Baseline Regression
       Table 4 presents the baseline weighted least squares results, where each column is
from a separate regression and corresponds to one of the PhD fields: humanities, life sciences,
physical sciences, and social sciences. The mean value of the dependent variable, the PhD
production rate, is displayed directly below the regression coefficients. Recall that this
variable is a percentage, not a share. In line with Figure 3 Panel A, this value is much
larger for the life and physical sciences. The explanatory power for these models is fairly
high—around 0.5—for all but the social sciences, where it is lower.
       There are three variables that are consistently statistically significant across the fields:



                                               13
the 75th percentile test score, the number of total students at the institution, the percentage
of total BAs that are in the given field, and the number of doctoral programs ranked in the
top 10th percentile. The direction of each is also consistent across fields. The higher the test
scores, the higher the PhD production rate. The coefficient is largest for the life sciences.
Students with higher college entrance exams are more likely to excel in school and have
lower costs of continuing to acquire education. That the total students variable has a negative
coefficient means that smaller institutions produce more PhDs, everything else equal: having
1,000 fewer students is associated with a drop in the PhD production rate of between .04
for social sciences and .11 for physical sciences. The percentage of the total BAs that are
in a given field is negatively related to the PhD production rate. Interestingly, this negative
relationship goes against the hypothesis that a field having a larger presence is positively
related to producing PhDs. One possible explanation is that those in smaller programs are
less likely to get lost in the shuffle and are more likely to gain more individual attention from
mentors such as faculty members. Having more highly-ranked doctoral programs, especially
in the top 10th percentile, is strongly related to producing PhDs. For the humanities, an
increase of one program in the top 10th percentile is associated with a higher PhD production
rate of 0.44, which is 17% of the (weighted) mean. The coefficient is even higher for the life
sciences (0.65; 13%) and the physical sciences (0.54; 12%). For the social sciences, it is 0.29
(13%). Top-ranked departments tend to have stellar faculty, which may influence students
in several ways, including attracting them to the institution in the first place.
       Several more variables are statistically significant for at least two of the four fields:
instructional expenditures per student, the percentage of undergraduates who are female,
the percentage of total BAs that majored in a particular field, and the institution being
in Carnegie category 17 (Moderate Research Activity) as opposed to category 15 (Highest
Research Activity). Instructional expenditure per student, measured in $1,000s, is positively
related for the humanities and physical sciences, but the magnitude is rather small. It may
be the case that having higher quality faculty inspires students. Research expenditures per


                                               14
full time faculty is not related to the PhD production rate. For life and social sciences, the
more men there are, the more likely students are to get a PhD. One factor that may be
involved is the lower rate in general that women pursued PhDs, especially at the beginning
of our sample timeframe. The percentage of total students who are undergraduates is never
significant. The percentage of undergraduates who are a minority is positively related to the
PhD production rate, but only for social sciences, and the coefficient is small.
       Compared to Carnegie category 15 institutions, those in category 17 have a lower PhD
production rate for both the physical and social sciences. This is after controlling for all other
variables and is thus not a raw difference as in Figure 3 Panel B. Neither the student-faculty
ratio nor being a public (versus private) institution relate to the PhD production rate.
       In tables not shown, results are quantitatively unchanged if we use a maximum TTD
based on the first year in which at least 80% or 85% of individuals receive their PhD.
                             Restricting to Carnegie 15 Institutions
       In Table 5 everything is the same as above except that we now restrict the sample to
Carnegie category 15 institutions (Highest Research Activity). The PhD production rates
and explanatory of these regressions are both higher. The 75th percentile test score and
total students variables are again statistically significant across all fields, with coefficients
larger in magnitude compared to the baseline. The coefficients across fields for the number
of doctoral programs ranked in the top 10th percentile are roughly of the same magnitude
as those found in Table 4, although only humanities and physical sciences continue to be
statistically significant.
       With some exceptions, the same general findings of significance and sign hold for
the other variables even though the standard errors have increases as the sample size has
decreased.
                                    Lemke-Style Regression
       Table 6 shows the results from performing the analysis along the lines of Lemke (2009).
Compared to the baseline regression, the findings are again largely the same. The test


                                               15
score and total student variables exhibit very similar patterns. The doctoral 0-10 percentile
rankings variables are statistically significant for the same fields as when we restrict the
sample to Carnegie category 15 institutions. Compared to the baseline regression, most of
the same coefficients are significant statistically and have similar magnitudes.



7    Conclusion

By using the restricted access Survey of Earned Doctorate individual-level data, we are able
to determine for each field each PhD recipient’s time-to-degree and, given the heterogeneity
in time-to-degree, to compute better estimates of the share of bachelor’s graduates at an
institution in a year that subsequently received PhDs in the field than did the early method
used by Lemke (2009). Our method required us to address the truncation problem that
occurs when using the individual level SED data, that we will not observe PhDs earned after
the data end.
       We conduct an weighted least squares analysis to examine which factors are associated
with the PhD production rate. We point out that because we are not exploiting exogenous
variation, our results should not be interpreted causally, as there are likely variables that
we did not control for. With that said, our major empirical finding is the strong positive
association between the number of highly-ranked PhD programs in a field at an institution
in a year and the number of its undergraduate students that go on for PhDs in that field.
Strong doctoral programs in a field thus seem to contribute to the supply of PhDs both
through the number of PhDs they directly generate and through their impact on the number
of their undergraduate students that go on for PhDs. We also find that higher entering test
scores for undergraduate students and a lower percentage of BAs that are received in the
field are both associated with more undergraduates at the institution going on for PhDs.

Notes: This table shows the cumulative percentage of PhDs received by the time-
to-degree, TTD. This is displayed separately by field as well as aggregated together.
BA-years of 1980 and 1981 are used. TTDs of less than 4 are combined with TTD
of 4. TTD of 36 is combined with TTD of 35. The entry corresponding to the first
TTD for which at least 90 percent of PhDs were earned is indicated in bold.

Notes: This table displays the percentage of PhD recipients in a given field (Hu-
manities, Life Science, Physical Science, Social Science) who obtained their BA in
each of these four fields as well as in subjects outside of these; this category is
referred to as “Other.” PhD fields are shown in the columns; BA fields are shown
in the rows. Observations with no BA field listed are excluded. Observations are
not restricted by TTD, and only PhDs actually observed are shown (meaning no
truncation correction was used).

Notes: This table displays means, standard deviations, and percent of observations that are missing.
Observations are unweighted and are displayed separately by Carnegie category of the institution. The
sample shown is the Life Science sample, as this was the field with the most institutions. Observations are
at the institution-BA year, and each institution contributes 26 observations, one for each year between
1980 and 2005. Means and standard deviations do not include missing observations in the calculations.
Total students, instructional expenditures per student, and research expenditures per student are in units
of 1,000. The missing column displays the fraction of observations that are missing after interpolating and
filling in as described in the text. The missing column for the NRC variables is the fraction that were not
observed with at least one department for the respective field (Humanities, Life Science, Physical Science,
Social Science).

Notes: This table displays regression results. The dependent variable is the PhD production rate, which is
a percentage, not a share. Maximum TTD and truncation correction are as described in Section 4. Each
column is a separate regression and corresponds to a field. Observations are weighted by the number of
field-specific BAs from the BA-year. Observations are at the institution-BA year, and each institution in
the field’s sample contributes 26 observations, one for each year between 1980 and 2005. Total students,
instructional expenditures per student, and research
                                                22    expenditures per student are in units of 1,000. Per-
centage undergraduate, female, minority, and total majors in (Field) are percentages, out of 100. BA-year
dummies are included, as are missing variable dummies. Robust standard errors are clustered at the
institution level.

Notes: This table displays regression results. The dependent variable is the number of PhDs produced
between 1994-2003 divided by the number of BAs earned from 1989-1998; this is a percentage, not a share.
Each column is a separate regression and corresponds to a field. Observations are weighted by the number
of field-specific BAs from 1989-1998. Each institution in the field’s sample contributes one observation. The
independent variables are averages over the 1989-1998 period. Averages are computed among non-missing
years; if all years are missing, the missing indicator
                                                 24 is one. Total students, instructional expenditures per
student, and research expenditures per student are in units of 1,000. Percentage undergraduate, female,
minority, and total majors in (Field) are percentages, out of 100. Missing dummies are included. Robust
standard errors are used.
           Figure 1: Distribution of Time-to-Degree, BA-Years 1980 and 1981




Notes: This figure plots the number of PhDs received by TTD, the number of years after
the BA-year that the PhD was received. Only BA-years of 1980 and 1981 are considered.
TTDs of less than 4 are grouped with TTD of 4; TTD of 36, which is only observed for 1980,

Notes: Panel A plots the PhD production rate each BA-year, separately by PhD field (Hu-
manities, Life Science, Physical Science, Social Science). Panel B plots the same, but splits
by the Carnegie category of the institution. The PhD production rate in Figure A is com-
puted by dividing the total number of PhDs of a given field (for a given BA-year) by the
total number of BAs from the corresponding field and BA-year. The PhD production rate in
Panel B is computed by dividing the total number of PhDs (for a given BA-year and across
all four fields) of a Carnegie Classification by the total number of BAs across all four fields.
Carnegie categories are: 15—Doctoral Universities:

Appendix A                  Data

We make use of several datasets in our analysis. The primary dataset is the SED, a survey
administered to new PhD recipients that has a very high response rate.15 These individual-
level data contain information on those who received their PhD by 2016. We consider
the PhD recipients who received their BA between 1980 and 2005, where 1980 refers to
the academic year 1980-1981.16 We drop observations with missing year of BA or PhD
receipt as well as those missing BA institution. We construct TTD, used in correcting for
truncation (Section 4.2), by computing the length of time between BA and PhD receipt.
Our measure of TTD thus includes any time pursuing other degrees, working, etc., before
completing the doctoral degree.
        As our focus is separately on the humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and so-
cial sciences, we consider the number of PhDs earned in each of these fields; Appendix B.1
describes how these fields are classified. We focus our analysis on doctoral institutions as
defined in the Carnegie 2015 classifications, those with Carnegie categories 15 (Doctoral
Universities: Highest Research Activity), 16 (Doctoral Universities: Higher Research Ac-
tivity), and 17 (Doctoral Universities: Moderate Research Activity). We exclude for-profit
institutions, institutions that are only graduate schools, and institutions not in the 50 states
and Washington DC. We include only institutions that produced at least five PhDs over
the sample timeframe. This restriction is made without taking into account TTD and only
includes observed PhDs, not those filled in by truncation correction. This is done separately
by field, meaning that one institution may be represented in one field and not another. For
this reason, the life and physical sciences have a somewhat larger sample than the humanities
and social sciences.
  15
    For example, the response rate in 2016 was 91.8%. See National Science Foundation (2017).
  16
    The SED data indicates the month and year of the completion of both the BA and the PhD. For BAs,
we consider completions occurring between September-December of year x-1 and January-August of year x
as corresponding to school year x. Because of this, our data includes individuals who graduated in the latter
half of 1979. If the month of completion is missing, we use the year variable as the year of completion. For
PhDs, we do not attempt to determine the school year, and only use the year of completion.



                                                     28
        We use the IPEDS Completions Survey to obtain the number of BA degrees granted
by each undergraduate institution each year, by field. See Appendix B.2 for classification
details. We consider only first reported BA major, which is problematic if the student
received two (or more) majors in different fields. The number of BA degrees is combined
with the SED data on PhDs produced to compute the humanities PhD production rate,
described more fully in Section 4.3. We also calculate the percentage of total BAs earned
in each field from this dataset. The Completions Survey data includes a FICE code (from
the older HEGIS survey) for all years and a UnitID code (from the IPEDS survey) for 1987
and after. There are a small number of instances where a FICE code maps to more than
one UnitID; this may happen, for example, when there are satellite campuses. If the first
year that we observe an institution having more than one UnitID is 1987, we aggregate all
UnitIDs together for this institution for all years. Because 1987 is the first year that we
observe UnitID, it is likely that the multiple campuses were included in the FICE in 1986
and before. This results in an inflated number of BAs for some institutions. If the first
year we observe a FICE mapping to multiple UnitIDs is after 1987, we exclude the UnitIDs
associated with institution names that do not appear to correspond to the main campus. In
general, we will observe too many BAs for observations where the satellite UnitIDs were not
broken out into their own UnitIDs.17
        We obtain additional explanatory variables, which are matched at the undergraduate
institution-BA year level, from a number of sources. The public institution indicator comes
from the SED. We use the IPEDS Fall Enrollment dataset to obtain the total number
of students, including graduate and professional students. Specifically, we sum full-time
students, having a weight of 1, with part-time students, having a weight of 0.4, regardless
of institution type or level of student18 This dataset is also used to compute the share of
  17
     In one case, the FICE code, which appears to sometimes include satellite campuses and sometimes not,
began in 1987; we used one of the several other FICE codes for prior years which correspond to the main
campus and which stops in 1986.
  18
     The weight of 0.4 for part-time students is very similar to the weight used for undergraduate in the IPEDS
“Calculation of FTE Students” (IPEDS, 2018). The weight listed for Public 4-year institutions is .403543
and for private 4-year institutions is .392857. The weights are somewhat further from 0.4 for part-time


                                                      29
students who are undergraduates, the share of undergraduates who are female, and the
share of undergraduates who are from underrepresented minority groups.19 Each of these is
measured as percentage (out of 100). These variables also use the same weights. We divide
total students by full-time faculty counts from the IPEDS Fall Staff Survey to compute the
student-faculty ratio.20
        Data from the Delta Cost Project (Lenihan, 2012) allow us to compute instructional
expenditures per student and research expenditures per full-time faculty. The former is
obtained by dividing instructional expenditures by full-time students; the latter comes from
dividing research expenditures by full-time faculty.21
        We construct the 75th percentile score variable from the Annual Survey of Colleges
Standard Research Compilation. We combine the incoming freshmen 75th percentile ACT
scores and 75th percentile SAT scores together; we do not use just one of the tests because
institutions vary widely in the propensity of their students to take these tests.22 This dataset
includes the percentage of students with reported SAT scores and reported ACT scores. We
weight the ACT score by the percentage of the total that reported ACT scores, and do
similarly for SAT scores. For example, if 70% reported a SAT score and 35% reported an
graduate students: the weights at public 4-year and private 4-year institutions are .361702 and .382059.
   19
      Due to problems with subcategories not adding up correctly in early years, when computing certain of
these variables, we did not use certain subcategories such as FT or PT UG Unclassified. When computing
race, the sum of the race categories were often less than expected; we assume that the race categories do not
include the non residence variable.
   20
      Full-time faculty counts come from the sum of the “Faculty, full-time men” and “Faculty, full-time
women” variables.
   21
      Instructional expenditures come from the instruction01 variable—“Expenditures for instruction—current
year total.” Research expenditures come from the research01 variable—“Expenditures for research—current
year total”.
   22
      The score data include two identifies, ID and FICE. However, there is not always a 1:1 mapping between
the two. After cleaning the test score data, in cases where the FICE code maps to multiple IDs, we select
one ID to use based first on the one that seems to match the institution name the best, second based on the
one that has non-missing test scores, and finally based on the one with the highest test scores. If ID maps
to multiple FICE, we use the FICE that is in the main dataset for matching. Finally, there are cases where
there is no match between datasets via FICE, but the institution name is associated with a different FICE
code in the score data. We manually make these matches. Finally, we manually match a number of cases
by institution name if the FICE codes do not match between datasets. We dropped the data from 1983 as
it is unreliable. In one case, the campus the ID referred to apparently changed over time; we used all years.
In addition, there were no reported percentage taking ACT or SAT for 1984-1987, so we backfilled the 1984
values with the earliest observation before 1993. We then interpolated the percentage taking ACT and SAT.



                                                     30
ACT score (a student can take both tests), then the SAT will get twice the weight as the
ACT. We do this after converting the SAT to be on the ACT scale.23 We note that after
conversion and among observations with both scores, the mean ACT is 1.5 points lower than
the mean SAT; the standard deviation for both tests is approximately 3.
        We obtain doctoral program rankings from the “scholarly quality of program faculty”
ranking from the 1995 National Research Council (NRC) doctoral program rankings (Gold-
berger et al., 1995). The newer, 2000s rankings do not provide point estimates of program
rankings and are thus not used (Ostriker et al., 2011). We also do not use the 1980s rank-
ings, which contain a smaller set of institutions (Jones et al., 1982). These rankings have a
high correlation with the 1995 rankings.24 Because we only use the 1995 data, the ranking
variables are constant within institution-field. We first classify the different subjects into
the four broad fields; classification details appear in Appendix B.3. For a given subject,
such as comparative literature (in the humanities), we construct percentile rankings over all
departments, including departments at institutions not in our sample. We then count the
number of departments a given institution has across all subjects in the field that are in
each of the following percentile ranges: 0-10, 11-25, 26-50, and 51-100.25 Importantly, the
   23
      The composite SAT score, the sum of an institution’s verbal and math 75th per-
centile scores,      was converted to its ACT equivalent using the conversion found at
https://web.archive.org/web/20160130223549/http://act.org/solutions/college-career-readiness/compare-
act-sat/—accessed April 27, 2016. We rounded up to the ACT score if the SAT score was outside
one of the listed ranges. For example, if the range was 1290-1320 for a 29 and 1330-1350 for a 30,
we converted a score of 1325 to 30. We made note of the re-centering of the SAT scores in 1995
and have converted all scores prior to 1995 to their current day equivalent (separately for math and
verbal) using the SAT I Individual Score Equivalents conversion table from the CollegeBoard (see
http://research.collegeboard.org/programs/sat/data/equivalence/sat-individual—accessed April 27, 2016).
The chart presented single conversion numbers. We rounded to the higher number. For example, a verbal
score of 690 is re-centered to 750 and 700 is re-centered to 760. We re-centered 695 to 760. For cases where
there was a test score for SAT, but not ACT, we used the SAT score entirely and vice versa. As there
was a great deal of missing data on earlier years of percentage taking each test, we backfill years missing
this data with the earliest reported percentages. We also fill in some of the missing score data using linear
interpolation.
   24
      The 1980s ranking include fewer institutions than the 1995 rankings, but for departments that appeared
in both rankings (and after re-ranking them to reflect only the departments in both rankings), the correlations
of the number of departments at an institution in each rankings interval are: 1 to 10 (.942), 11 to 25 (.888),
26 to 50 (.867), and 51+ (.805). Note that these are not percentiles, but the number in the top 10, etc. If
one does not restrict to departments in both, somewhat smaller, but still high correlations are observed: 1
to 10 (.917), 11 to 25 (.842), 26 to 50 (.797), and 51+ (.593).
   25
      Using the set of institutions in the life sciences, correlations within percentile ranges and across fields


                                                       31
smaller the percentile, the higher ranked the department. We use percentiles as opposed
to the number in the top 10, etc., because there is a large amount of heterogeneity in the
number of departments ranked in each subject. For example, many more departments are
ranked in English Language and Literature than in French Language and Literature, and a
ranking being ranked, e.g., in the 11-25 range may mean something very different for the
former subject than the latter.
        We face the challenge of missing data. For many of the control variables, we use
a linear extrapolation to fill in data for years that are bookended by two other years with
non-missing data. When variables do not contain bookended data due to the survey starting
after 1980, we backfill using the first possible year of data (for example, we fill in 1980-1983
with the 1984 value).26 After this process, if an observation is still missing, we code it
as 0 and create a missing data dummy that takes on value 1 for missing and 0 otherwise.
Universities not included in the 1995 NRC are coded as having zero programs in each of our
quality intervals and we do not include a missing dummy variable for such institutions.



Appendix B                   Classification of Subjects to Fields

B.1      SED

Our classification of degrees from the SED comes from the subjects listed in Appendix E
of the 2011 Paper Questionnaire.27 The SED uses fine-grained codes to classify subjects
into broader categories. We generally follow these with some exceptions. We list the more
general categories, but generally not list the more-specific categories.
range from 0.33 to 0.75, with progressively higher correlations for the 0-10 range than lower ranges in general.
These calculations include 0’s.
  26
     More specifically, we fill in full-time faculty of years 1980-1986 with 1987; test scores of 1980-1983 with
1984; student-faculty ratios of 1980-1986 with 1987; and instructional and research expenditures of 1980-1986
with 1987. We note that this is not ideal as it does not take into account trends, only takes care of cases that
have a non-missing value for the first year of data, and results in a lack of variation over these several years.
We compute student-faculty ration, instructional expenditures per student, and research expenditures per
faculty after backfilling.
