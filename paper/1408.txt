                        The Pricing of Default—Free Mortgages




                                      ABSTRACT



      In this paper   we examine the household's option to prepay or call   a

standard fixed—rate mortgage.    Results based on simulation indicate that the

value of this option is sensitive to the expected path of interest rates, the

variation around that path, risk aversion and refinancing costs.

Unfortunately, efforts to estimate the interest rate process (by us and by

previous authors) have met with only limited success, and uncertainty exists

regarding the degree of risk aversion and the magnitude of refinancing costs.

Thus we conclude that the application of contingent—claims methodology to

options on bonds is conceptually more difficult and operationally less reliable

than is the analogous application to options on stocks.

      Despite these reservations concerning the use of our model as a technique

for absolute valuation, preliminary findings on the effects of changes in

mortgage contract design on the value of the prepayment option are encouraging.

For example, our estimate of the relative values of the call options on 30— and

15—year mortgages and on level—payment and graduated—payment mortgages appear

to be reasonably robust with respect to specifications of the interest rate

process and the other parameters.    These findings suggest that our model may be

of considerable use within the context of relative or comparative valuation.

                       The Pricing of Default—Free Mortgages


                   Stephen A. Buser and Patric H. Hendershott



       A number of recent studies have attempted to price the prepayment or

 call option in mortgage contracts (Dunn and Mcconnell, 1981a and b) or

 limitations on this option (Dietrich et. ad.,   1983).   These studies:   (1)

 assume that the spot rate of interest follows a mean—reverting process with a

 constant—elasticity standard deviation,   (2) assign parameter values to the

 mean—reverting spot rate, the elasticity and scale of the standard deviation,

 the speed of adjustment and the "market price of risk",    (3) assume zero tax

 rates and (4) calculate prices for the call option or limitations upon it!

      These studies suggest considerable confidence in the magnitudes of most,

if not all, of the key parameters.   Dunn and Mcconnell (1981b, p. 606) report

that the parameter values used in their simulations were "similar to those

estimated by Ingersoll" in an unpublished paper (1976) and did not report

sensitivity results.   The absence of such results could be taken as an

indication that their model was sufficiently robust to permit reasonable

inferences from the selected simulation results tabulated and reported.

Dietrich, et. a1, too, specify values with no discussion.

      Unfortunately, there is substantial disagreement regarding many of these

parameter values, as a comparison of the assumptions underlying Dunn—Mcconnell

and Dietrich et. al. makes clear, and the results of these analyses are quite

sensitive to a number of parameter values,   consideration of the speed at


     one were uncertain regarding the time path of one of these parameters
 (interest rate volatility or the market price of risk, for example) but
                                                                      ,


fairly certain of the others, and were willing to posit market efficiency,
then one could extract a time series on the unknown variable from observed
mortgage price data.   Bodie and Friedman (1978) did, in fact, extract an
interest—rate volatility series from bond price and yield data.

which the interest rate adjusts to its mean—reverting value illustrates the

point.     Dietrich, et. al. posit a speed of 03, whereas Dunn and Mcconnell

employ 0.8.     With the lower 0.3 adjustment speed, Dunn and Mcconnell's

estimates of the value of call would have doubled.      Similarly, small changes

in risk aversion (in the assumed rate on infinite—maturity default—free debt

relative to the mean—reverting value of the spot rate) have significant

impacts on the value of call.

         We beqin this paper with a description of arbitrage—free pricing.   In

Section II, we take a closer look at establishing 'reasonable" parameter

values.     This includes estimation of the interest—rate process and

consideration of the existinq literature.      Section III contains a detailed

analysis of the value of the call option in GNMA pools of level—payment

mortgaqes.    Sensitivity analysis is conducted both with Dunn and Mcconnell

parameter values and with the set we estimate in Section II.     Both 8 and 13

percent GNMAs are analyzed.     In Section IV, we turn to an analysis of GNMAs

based upon pools of 15—year fixed—rate and 30—year graduated—payment

mortgages.    A summary concludes the paper.

 Price Paths for Default—Free Debt

      Following others (Vasicek (1977)             ,       Richard   (1978) ,   Dothan   (1978) ,    and

Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1978)], we begin with two assumptions.                           First, the

value of any default—free "bond"        (B)       is a deterministic function of time                  (t)

and the spot rate of interest (r) with well—defined first and second partial

derivatives




                                  B =   BR,            r).                                     (1)




Second, the time path of the taxable spot rate of interest follows a diffusion
          2
process




                                 dr =     fdt          +    gdz,                               (2)




where dz is a standardized Gauss—Weiner process and the mean or drift (f)                              and

standard deviation (g)   of the instantaneous rate are deterministic functions

of time and the spot rate of interest.                     To simplify the notation, we suppress

the functional form for these values as we do for the spot rate of interest,

i.e., we use f for f(t, r), g for g(t, r) and r for r(t).

      Given these technical assumptions, we can apply Ito's lemma (see McKean

(1968)J which identifies an essential closure property that smooth functions

(such as 1) of Ito processes (such as 2)                    are themselves Ito processes.            Thus




2Merton (1973) shows that, in certain cases, poisson events can be
incorporated via simple adjustments to the mean of instantaneous bond returns.
In our simulation work (Section III)  we employ shift parameters that serve to
                                              ,



measure the sensitivity of the model to this extension.

Equilibrium Price Paths

        Merton's (1973) equilibrium condition for asset returns, assuming none

of the returns of the marginal investor are taxed, is:3



                          +   C — rB     =                                                (6)



where: C is the instantaneous cash payment (coupon plus amortization) on the

mortgage;     and g are the drift and standard deviation of the price path for

the mortgage; and X,      "the market price of risk," is a deterministic function

of time and the spot rate of interest.                   Substituting (4) and    (S)   into     (6)

produces the folloing general expression for the equilibrium, or zero—

arbitrage, price path of any default—free debt instrument



3Assuming an untaxed marginal investor conveniently allows us to abstract from
tax—motivated trading.

                    + (f+Xg)B     +             + C — rB = 0.                              (6a)



 The first term is the price drift including prepayment but abstracting from

interest—rate changes, and the second term is due to the risk—adjusted

interest—rate drift (as is the third which reflects the 'Ito effect')                             The

remaining terms compare the cash flows of the mortgage with those of an

alternative "pure cash' investment.



CES Processes

        Most of the applied work on arbitrage—free interest—dependent claims has

focused on the special case of a spot rate of interest that follows a mean—

reverting process with a constant—elasticity standard deviation, hereafter

referred to as a CES process.             For examples, see Ingersoll (1976),

Ananthanarayanan and Schwartz (1980)             •   Marsh   (1980)   ,   Beckers (1980) and Dunn
and Mcconnell (1981 a and b)          -   We   represent the general form of the CES model

as:




                                             a
                               drk(p—r)dt+ardz,                                           (7)




where   i   is the long—run mean of the process,

        k measures the speed of adjustment,

        a is the "scale" of the standard deviation, and,

        a is the elasticity of the standard deviation with respect to the spot
          rate of interest.

Solutions

          The equilibrium price path (6a) is a deterministic second—order

differential equation.                         Given appropriate specifications of f, g, and                     g from

 (7a) ,   (7b) and   (8) ,         it          is possible in principle to solve the equation subject

to appropriate boundary conditions.                                 In the case of a noncallable debt

instrument, these conditions are that (1)                                        the mortgage becomes worthless at

maturity full (amortization) or when r goes to infinity and (2) the mortgage

equals the sum of the remaining payments when r goes to zero.                                        To determine

the price of a callable mortgage, we replace the second of these boundary

conditions with the condition that refinancing will occur (the claim is paid

of f) when r takes on the value r                             such that

wedge, equals the borrower's after—tax refinancing costs plus the value of the

                                                                   t

cash flow) is constant.  For graduated—payment mortgages, A is initially

       The difference between the values of the noncallable and callable

                                                           (and the cost of the

a rule, researchers rely on numerical alternatives such as the implicit

difference method described by Brennan and Schwartz (1977)    .    Thus our computer
program solves a second—order difference equation subject to boundary

conditions. As a check on our numerical and programming procedures, we have

reproduced simulation results reported previously by Dunn and Mcconnell
                                                                        (l98la

and 1981b) for what can be regarded as a special case of our model.



             II.   Estimation of the Parameters of the CES Process

      The general form of the mean—reverting CES process governing the taxable

spot rate of interest in continuous time was given in (7).        Estimation re-
quires a discrete—time analogue.      If we view the spot rate as reverting to the

beginning—of—period long—run mean value, then it i appropriate to
                                                                  estimate



                        r _r1                       r1)
                                      =   k               +               (7')
                           r1
                                              —9—




 We estimate (7') for three values of a                 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0; with a =   0.0,   the

 dependent variable is the change in the spot rate; with c =               1.0,   it is the

percentage change.   The equation is estimated over two periods: January 1970

to October 1979 and November 1979 to December 1983.

      The November 1, 1979 break point in our estimation corresponds to the

change in the Federal Reserve's operating procedures,                a change that resulted

in substantially more volatile interest rates.                To illustrate, the standard

deviation of monthly changes in our one—month rate tripled from the first

period to the second (0.0058 to 0.0183)             .   Of course, some of the increase

could be attributable to the higher average level of rates in the second

period (0.1113 versus 0.0626)   .   However, even after correcting for this (divi-

ding the standard deviations by     r½)   ,   the "adjusted" standard deviation is
nearly 2 1/2 times as large in the second period.

      Two proxies for p have been employed in the recent literature:

Ingersoll (1976) treats p as a constant in his preliminary estimates, and

Bodie and Friedman (1978) use the long—term corporate rate.                We test the

hypotheses that p is a linear function of the long—term Treasury rate minus                   a


constant ("the" liquidity premium)    -       First—day of month data for one—month

(the spot rate) and 20—year Treasuries yields are from Salomon Brothers and

are measured in decimals.   The one—month discount rates have been converted to

bond—equivalents.

      The estimates are reported in Table 1.                The speeds of adjustment are

low, 4 percent in the 1970s and 20 percent in the more recent period of

volatile interest rates.5   Moreover, the k's are not measured with precision;



51t has come to our attention that Brennan and Schwartz (1982) have estimated
equations similar to these (with a = 1.0) for the December 1958—June 1969 and
July 1969—December 1979 periods.   For the latter, their estimate of k was
0.0377 with a standard error of 0.0369.

 they are only one (first period) or one—and—a—half (second period) times their
 standard errors, and the explanatory power of the equations is low. The
 latter   should not be surprising.    Shiller et al (1983) have reported results

 indicating that future expected spot rates have zero ability to explain

 changes in spot rates.    In effect, changes in spot rates are predominantly

unexpected, and the impact of unexpected events swamps the impact of expected

changes.    This does not mean, however, that expected future rate changes would

not govern actual changes in the absence of unexpected events.           In fact,

Hendershott (1984) has shown that changes in the six—month bill rate are

related to the expected change implied by forward rates when surprise

variables (unexpected changes in anticipated inflation, industrial production

and base money) are included in the estimation equation.

      Say that these surprises show up in both p and r, which would likely be

the case when p is proxied by the 20—year Treasury rate.       The impact of

surprises could be incorporated byestimation of



                  r— r1        t—l r1

The results are reported in Table 2.      As anticipated, the surprise proxy (the

change in the 20—year Treasury rate) contributes enormously to the explanation

of the change in the one—month rate.      The coefficient of about 1 1/2 in the

second period reflects the greater volatility of the short—term rate.           The

mean—reverting term is also significant.       The standard errors of the speed—

of—adjustment coefficients decline slightly and the coefficients themselves

rise from 50 to 100 percent.

         The sensitivity to the value of a of both   the   estimates and the ability

of the equation to explain changes in the spot rate is low.          The similarity of

the coefficients is obvious.      Comparability in explanatory power is attained

by multiplying the equation standard errors of estimate (SEE) by the mean

value of r1.        This multiplication provides standard errors on r in all

cases.     These estimates (from Table 1), for a's of 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0, for the

1970—79 span are 0.0058, 0.0054, and 0.0054.      For the 1980—83 equation, the

estimates are 0.0179, 0.0171, and 0.0167.       That is, the explnatory power is

greater the higher is a, but the differences are very small.

         From the above results, our best an estimate of k for the first period

is 0.05 to 0.075; for the second period, an estimate of 0.2 to 0.3 is reasona-

ble.     Because a solution for the risk coefficient is available when      a      0.5

[equation (8)], we utilize this value.      Estimates of a for the different time

periods are the standard errors of the equations in Table 1 for a =         0.5.     For

1970—79, when FHA mortgage rates averaged 8 1/2 to 9 percent, a = 0.0225; for

1980—83, when the FHA rate averaged about 13 percent,       a =   0.05.


          III.   Values of the Call Option on Level—Payment GNMA     Securities
         In this section we provide estimates of the value of the call option for

three base cases and show the sensitivity of the estimates to alternative

parameter values.      The three base cases are: the Dunn—Mcconnell (1981a and b)

specification for an 8% GNMA, our specification for the 8% GNMA, and our

specification for a 13% GNMA.      The parameter values for these cases are listed

in Table 3.      The second base case is an alteration of the Dunn—Mcconnell

values to obtain greater realism.      The lower k and a values were discussed

earlier.     The Dunn—Mcconnell spread between R() and       implies an enormous

permanent spread between long and short rates and results in a large price of

 risk based on equation (8)     .   We   have substantially narrowed the spread, and

 thereby lowered the price of risk, by raising                i.     Dunn and Mcconnell assume a

 zero refinancing wedge: we assume a 3 percent refinancing cost which exceeds

 slightly the cost of originating a replacement mortgage.                       The third base case

 constitutes an attempt to analyze the early                1984 environment.         The coupon

 rate ±5 set at 13 percent, R() at 12½,                 at 11 3/4 percent and k at 0.25.

 The greater spread between R() and M and the larger k value, respectively,

 reflect the larger constant term and speed of adjustment estimated on data

 from the 1980—83 period.      We also raise        a     to 0.05, its value in the 1980—83

period.

      Each of the parts of Tables 4—6 contains three calculations for each of

three values of the parameter for which sensitivity is being tested, and the

results are reported for five values of the spot rate.                        The three calculated

values are: the price of the $100 par value mortgage, the value of the call

option in dollars (price of a noncallable mortgage with the same coupon less

the price of the callable mortgage)          and the value of the call option in basis

points (the stated coupon less the calculated coupon on a noncallãble mortgage

that would have the same price as the callable mortgage)                        To illustrate, when

the spot rate is 0.059 in Table 4 and the parameters are set at the Dunn—

Mcconnell base case values, the price of the mortgage is $99.58, the call is

worth $3.69 (the price of a noncallable mortgage would be $103.27) or a 29

basis point higher coupon (a noncallable mortgage priced at $99.58 would carry

a 7.71 percent coupon)

      Before turning to the specific results, it is probably useful to

indicate roughly how the variables should affect the call premium.                       They

operate via the interest—rate process         (k,       M and a) ,    the refinancing boundary
condition (RFW)   ,   and the transformed price of risk 1R()              ,    k,   and oJ.

 Because the refinancing wedge and the infinite—maturity yield enter only one

 relation, their directional impacts on the call premium are necessarily

 unambiguous.   The greater the refinancing wedge, the less the chance of call

 and thus the lower the premium.    The impact of R(oo), and the role of the price

of risk generally, requires more explanation.     The call provision of a

mortgage limits the extraordinarily large one—period gains received when

interest rates decline (the mortgage is called) but also dampens losses when

interest rates rise (the call premium is earned)   .   Thus callable debt is less

risky (has a lower standard deviation around the expected return) than

noncallable debt.   An increase in the price of risk increases yields on risky

securities (noncallable) relative to less risky securities     (callable) .   Hence

call premia decline.   Increasing R() in the simulations is simply a means of

analyzing a pure increase in risk aversion.     The result will thus be a

decrease in the call premium.

      A higher mean—reverting value () lowers the chance of call and thus

tends to decrease the call premium.     On the other hand, a higher p, other

things being equal, means the price of risk has declined, a decline which

tends to raise the call premium.     Thus the directional impact of an increase

in p is not readily apparent.     A higher speed of adjustment (k) restricts

declines in interest rates that tend to trigger call.     Thus the higher is k,

the lower is the call premium.6     Finally, an increase in the variance (a) of

rates generally increases the likelihood of call and thus raises the call




6An exception can occur when the spot rate starts at such a high value
relative to the mean—reverting value that much expected downward pull is
necessary in order for an unexpected decline in rates to have any chance to
trigger call.  (The change in risk—aversion implied by a change in k is
uncertain in direction and likely quite small in magnitude.)

 premium.7     (While an increase also implies an increase in the price of risk,

 the increase is slight and thus we would expect the direct effect to

 dominate.)




Dunn—Mcconnell 8% Coupon

       Consider the base case, which is reported in the center section of all

parts of Table 4 as a basis of comparison.     At a spot rate equal to the mean—

reverting value of 0.056, the call is worth about 30 basis points.      At lower

spot rates, instantaneous call occurs5 at a roughly doubled spot rate, the

call is worth about 20 basis points.     These values seem low because the spread

between GNMAs and a portfolio of Treasuries having an identical expected

pattern of cash flows, taking into account differences in timing of payments,

averaged about 65 basis points during the 1977—78 period when interest rates

were in this range [Hendershott, Shilling and Villani, 1984].

       The value of the call is quite sensitive to some of the parameters.

Most important are the yield on infinite—maturity default—free debt and the

interest—rate speed of adjustment.     A half percentage point reduction in the

former, which constitutes a significant reduction in assumed risk aversion,

roughly doubles the call premium (and triggers call at spot rates below 6

percent) .    So also does a reduction in the interest—rate speed of adjustment

from 0.8 to 0.2 which sharply reduces the pull of the mean—reverting value on

diverging spot rates.     The high assumed values of either the infinite—maturity

debt rate or the speed of adiustment could explain the low estimated call

premium relative to that observed in the market place.




    exception can occur when the spot rate starts at such a low value relative
to the mean—reverting value that call is likely unless there is a large
unexpected increase in interest rates.

       Changes in the scale parameter work in the opposite direction.        Cutting

 the scale from 0.9 to 0.5 roughly halves the call premium.     Changes in the

 other parameters have even smaller impacts.     Addition of a 2 point wedge to

 deter refinancing cuts the premium by about a third, while raising the mean—

 reverting value by a full percentage point decreases the call premium by only

 10 to 25 percent, depending on the level of the spot rate.     The lesser

sensitivity   of the call premium to the variance scale parameter than to

numerous other parameters, which could easily be changing over time, suggests

great, difficulty in extracting variance estimates from market data a' la

Bodie and Friedman (1978)




The Revised 8% Coupon

      The base case result, reported in all parts of Table 5, indicates a call

value of 100 basis points at a spot rate of 0.056.      This is triple the value

under the Dunn and Mcconnell assumptions.      With a spot rate of 6 percent, the

call is worth about 70 basis points, and a 50 percent higher spot lowers the

call value to under 10 basis points.

      In general, the call estimates are sensitive to the same parameters as

was the case under the Dunn—Mcconnell assumptions, namely the yield on

infinite—maturity default—free debt and the interest—rate speed of adjustment.

A half percentage point decrease in the infinite—maturity yield increases the

call premium by 50 to 100 percent, and a decline in the speed of adjustment

from 0l5 to 0.05 doubles the premium.    Also, a halving of the variance scale

parameter cuts the call premia by 25 to 75 percent, with greater percentage

reductions (but smaller absolute ones) occurring at higher spot rates.

 13% Coupon


          In general, the call premium in our third base case (see Table 6) is

 less sensitive than the premium was in the other two cases to equal absolute

 changes in parameter values, but the premium is equally sensitive to

 equivalent percentage changes.     Consider the responses to changes in the yield

 on infinite—maturity default—free debt and the interest—rate speed of

 adjustment.    A half point decline in the former increased the call premium by

 50 percent in our analysis of 8% coupons here a three—quarter point decline

 is required to cause the same impact.     Similarly, the increase in the speed of

adjustment from 0.05 to 0.15 halved the premium in the 8% coupon case; here an

increase from 0.15 to 0.35 is necessary.       ote, however, that in each of these

examples the same percentage changes in values yield comparable premium

impacts (e.g., a 0.005     increase on a base of 0.0775 is the same as a 0.0075

increase on a base of 0.1175)   .   Changes in the refinancing wedge, the scale

parameter and      continue to have about the same impacts (negligible for the

latter)




    IV.    Values of the Call Option in Alternative Maturity GrMA Securities

      GMAs based upon 15—year, level—payment mortgages and 30—year,

graduated—payment mortgages with a 7½    percent   annual graduation rate for 5

years are analyzed in this section.8     The upper halves of Tables 7a — 8b have

precisely the same format as Tables 4—6.       That is, the value of the callable

mortgage, the dollar value of the call option and the coupon rate equivalent

are reported for different values of some parameter (the middle columns are

identical, being the base case) for different levels of the spot rate.       The

lower halves are the differences between these values and those calculated for


8Graduated—payment mortgages with 4.9 percent graduation for 10 years were
also analyzed, but the results were so similar to the 7.5 percent instrument
that they are not reported.

the 30—year level payment mortgage.        There are two tables (a and b)       for each

mortgage in order to compute sensitivities of the call to all six of the

parameter values.    Following analysis of these mortgage contracts, we briefly

consider differences in call premia on 13 percent 30—year GNMAs with different

remaining years to maturity.



15—Year Level Payment

       At a 11.75   percent spot rate and the base case parameter values, the

15—year mortgage would be priced 44 cents above par and the call is valued at

$1.79 (see the middle column of any segment of Tables 7a or 7b except that for

taxes) .   This is one—third ($0.90) less than the call value on a JO—year

mortgage; 15 years call protection is worth less than 30 years.              Note,

however, that on a coupon—equivalent basis the call value is only 10 percent

less   (33 versus 37 basis points)   -   While 15 years of call is worth less than

30 years, the coupons on the 15—year mortgage will be received for a shorter

period and on lower balances than the coupons on a JO—year mortgage.

       The lower halves of all segments of Tables 7a and 7b suggest an

insensitivity of the difference in call premia on 15— and 30—year level—

payment mortgages to virtually all parameters: Except for low spot rates, the

15—year premium is 2 to 9 basis points less than the JO—year premium; at low

spot rates a slight positive difference exists.       The exceptions are for very

low spot rates (instruments close to being called where the expected

difference in lives is small) and for a low risk environment       [ji   =

combined with high spot rates.

 Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPMs)

       Tables 8a — 8b indicate the results for the
                                                   graduated—payment mortgage.
 Because these mortgages have a longer effective maturity than
                                                               the 30—year
 level—payment mortgage, the call has a higher value.     At a spot rate of 11.75
 percent and the base case values, the difference is $0.33 or 10 percent.
                                                                                In
 this case, the premia in the coupon rates are nearly identical for
                                                                    virtually
 any configuration of parameter values and spot rates.    While the value of call
 is greater with a GPM, the coupon will be earned on a larger valued
                                                                     mortgage
 over its life.




Differences in Remaining Years to Maturity

       Table 9 contains prices, call values, and coupon—equivalent call
                                                                        premia
for standard (3cJ—year original term, level—payment) 13 percent
                                                                GNMA5 with
differing remaining years to maturity for our base case parameter values.
                                                                                The
first column reproduces the results from Table 6 for a new—issue
                                                                    (30 years

remaining life) GNMA.   The next two columns refer to the same underlying GNMA

four and eight years after the date of issue (26 and 22 remaining
                                                                  years to
maturity, respectively).     At high spot rates, the call value (and coupon—

equivalent premium) is about 25 percent less on the eight year old GNMA
                                                                        than

on the newly issued one; at low spot rates, the difference is only about 5

percent.   Because call is worth considerably less when spot rates are high,

the absolute difference in call values is relatively constant.     And this

difference is a small S basis points in terms of coupon equivalents.     Thus

whether one purchases an old or new GNMA (with the same coupon) does not
                                                                         seem
to be of great importance.

          Substantial effort has been expended in estimating the magnitudes
                                                                            of the
 parameters governing the interest—rate process and measuring the sensitivity

 of call values to these parameters and refinancing costs.
                                                                                   Unfortunately, the
 results are not encouraging for application of the option pricing model
                                                                         to

 real world data. -The interest—rate process is not estimated with great

 precision; substantial uncertainty remains regarding the speed of
                                                                   adjustment
 (k) ,   and the data do not discriminate
                                                      among different values of the elasticity

 of the standard deviation (a) with              respect to the spot rate of interest.                 All

and all, there is not overwhelming evidence for the existence of a stable,

single state variable mean—reverting CES process.                       Substantial uncertainty

also exists regarding the magnitude of the refinancing wedge.                            These

difficulties are compounded by the sensitivity of the estimated call values to

virtually all the parameters about which we are uncertain.

         Nonetheless, some interesting results have been obtained.                         The

differences in call premia in coupon rates among alternative long—term fixed—

rate mortgage contracts (15— and 30—year level—payment and 3O—year graduated—

payment mortgages) are relatively small and insensitive to alternative

parameter values.          While the dollar value of call is less on the 15—year

mortgage than on the 30—year level—payment mortgage, the premium built into

the coupon to earn a given call value has to be relatively greater on the

former because the coupon will be received for a shorter period.                            Thus the

coupon—equivalents are roughly equal and the differences between them are not

sensitive to differences in parameter values.                    The reverse is true for

graduated—payment mortgages (GPM5)          ;    the dollar value of call is more than that
on the 30—year level—payment mortgage, but a somewhat smaller premium needs to
                                     —31—



be changed to earn a given call value because the mortgage principal on the

GPM will continually exceed that on the 30—year level—payment mortgage.
                                                                            Here
the coupon equivalents are nearly identical and are quite insensitive to

differences in parameter values.   Finally, differences in call premia on

near—par GNMAs with the same coupons but with different remaining lives are

likewise quite small.   On near—par GNMAs the difference between 8—year old

GNMAs (22 remaining years to maturity) and new GNMAs with the same coupon is

only 5 basis points in terms of coupon equivalents.    Thus whether one pur-

chases an old or new GNMA (with same coupon)   does not appear to be of great

importance.
