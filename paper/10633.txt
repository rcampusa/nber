Are Migrants More Skilled than Non-Migrants? Repeat, Return and Same-Employer Migrants
Jennifer Hunt
NBER Working Paper No. 10633
July 2004
JEL No. J6
                                      ABSTRACT

I examine the determinants of inter-state migration of adults within western Germany, using the

German Socio-Economic Panel from 1984-2000. I highlight the prevalence and distinctive

characteristics of migrants who do not change employers. Same-employer migrants represent one

fifth of all migrants, and have higher education and pre-move wages than non-migrants. Conditional

on age, same-employer migrants are therefore more skilled than non-migrants. By contrast, although

other migrants have higher education than non-migrants, they do not have higher pre-move wages.

Furthermore, they have in their ranks disproportionate numbers of the non-employed, unemployed

and recently laid off. It therefore seems inappropriate to characterize them as more skilled than non-

migrants. The results for same-employer migrants indicate that skilled workers have a low-cost

migration avenue that has not been considered in the previous literature. I also analyze the relation

between repeat and return migration and distinguish between short and long-distance migration. I

confirm that long-distance migrants are more skilled than short-distance migrants, as predicted by

theory, and I show that return migrants are a mix of successes and failures.

In this paper I contribute to a literature assessing whether migrants are more skilled than non-

migrants. It is often viewed as self-evident that migration is more beneficial, or at least less

detrimental, if it increases the average skill of the population rather than decreasing it. Sending

regions or countries speak of brain drain, while some receiving countries have immigration

policies designed to select the most skilled applicants. In standard analysis, both the costs and the

benefits of migration stem from any differences in average skills between migrants and non-

migrants. If there are no important fixed factors such as land, immigration of people with a

distribution of skills similar to that of natives will affect only the scale of the receiving economy

in the long run. If the skill distributions are different, groups complementary to the immigrants

experience labor market gains, while close substitutes for the immigrants experience losses.

Unskilled immigration provides a benefit by lowering the price of unskilled services, for

example, allowing the highly skilled to specialize more in their comparative advantage. Parallel

analysis applies to emigration.1

       The scale of the economy may matter, however, if there are increasing returns to scale in

production. More relevant to the issue of migrant skills, it is conceivable that returns to scale

could be particularly large in specialized high-skill sectors, where a critical mass of rare talent

may be necessary. Furthermore, even once a critical mass has been achieved, skilled workers

may provide knowledge spillovers to their skilled colleagues, or confer externalities on others in

the population.2 If the beneficial effects of such skilled workers accrue principally to the host

economy, these considerations suggest that an economy should encourage skilled immigration

and discourage skilled emigration.3




                                                 1
       The skill mix of migration could also influence economic institutions. For example, it

will affect the balance between taxpayers and recipients of transfers4, possibly causing tax and

benefit systems to be revised. The strength of labor unions could also be affected.5

       Theoretically, the quality of migrants depends not only on relative migration benefits for

the skilled and unskilled, influenced by relative inequality across regions, but also on the relation

between skill and moving costs.6 Empirical papers have often found that migrants are more

educated than non-migrants in the source region, and earned higher wages than non-migrants

prior to moving. Examples include Borjas, Bronars and Trejo (1993) for internal U.S. migration,

and Hunt (2002) for migration from eastern to western Germany. Chiquiar and Hanson (2002)

find Mexican emigrants to the United States to be more educated than Mexican non-emigrants,

despite the fact that the United States-Mexico wage gap is higher for the unskilled. They believe

their results point to lower moving costs for the more skilled, a point also argued by Chiswick

(2000). On the other hand, it is also known that the unemployed, the laid-off, and the non-

employed are more likely to emigrate than the employed. If the unemployed and laid-off are

observably or unobservably less skilled than the employed, the results overall point to migrants

having more heterogeneous skills than non-migrants.7

       I replicate these results in my analysis of the determinants of migration by adults between

federal states in western Germany. However, I show that the results indicating that many

migrants are more skilled than non-migrants are strongly influenced by a group not previously

analyzed: migrants who change state of residence without changing employer. Using the German

Socio-Economic Panel for 1984-2000, I show that same-employer migrants represent one fifth of

all migrants, even though a move must be to a non-contiguous county to be defined as inter-state

migration. Same-employer migrants have higher education and higher pre-migration earnings



                                                 2
than non-migrants. By definition, these migrants were employed before moving, and are

therefore clearly more skilled than non-migrants, conditional on age. By contrast, although other

migrants have higher education than non-migrants, they do not have significantly higher pre-

move wages. Furthermore, they have in their ranks disproportionate numbers of the non-

employed, unemployed and recently laid off. It therefore seems inappropriate to characterize

them as more skilled than non-migrants.

       The results for same-employer migrants indicate that skilled workers have a low-cost

migration avenue that has not been considered in the previous literature. Same-employer

migrants may significantly raise the average skills of migrants in more situations than the one

examined here, including migration between rich countries, such as the United States and

Canada, or the United States and Germany. They are likely to be less prevalent among migrants

from poor to rich countries, however, which might appear to suggest that such migrants could be

have skills similar to or worse than those in the source.

       Distinguishing between return migrants and “new” migrants, as well as between short

and long-distance moves is informative in this regard. Among migrants who are not same-

employer migrants, “new” migrants moving to a non-contiguous state could arguably be

characterized as more skilled than non-migrants, conditional on age, while this characterization

seems inappropriate for return migrants and “new” migrants moving to a contiguous state.

Conditional on education, the last group of migrants is less skilled than stayers. The higher skills

of long-distance migrants compared to short-distance migrants confirms the theoretical

prediction that migrants will be more skilled when moving costs are high. It is consistent with

Schwartz’s (1973) finding for white males, and with the finding of Hunt (2002) that commuters

are not more skilled than stayers. The result suggests that migrants from poor countries to distant



                                                 3
rich countries could be skilled by source country standards. Conversely, migrants from poor

countries to neighboring rich countries and especially commuters need not be relatively skilled,

which may go some way towards explaining the Yashiv (2004) finding of low skills among

Palestinians in Israel.

        Return migrants who are not same-employer migrants are a heterogeneous group of

failures and successes. Laid-off males are very likely to undertake return migration, and return

migration accounts for 40% of the positive influence of layoffs on overall migration. This is

consistent with the theory of Borjas and Bratsberg (1996), that some return migrants are

marginal migrants whose experience in the destination was worse than expected.8 On the other

hand, I find that young people with high earnings are also likely to return home. This group has

likely undertaken migration as part of a lifecycle plan to raise earnings at home and consume at

home, as postulated by Borjas and Bratsberg (1996) and Dustmann (2001,2003).9

        Finally, I note the link between repeat and return migration. At least 32% of all migrants

in my sample have moved previously, but more than two-thirds of repeat migrants are returning

to a state in which they have previously lived.10 I show that two-thirds of the positive effect on

migration of previous migration comes through its influence on return moves. The effect of

previous migration is often attributed to an unobserved propensity to move, and to the lower

opportunity cost of moving if the person in question has less location-specific capital to lose than

someone who has never moved. My results show the importance of possible return migration as

a variant of the latter explanation: a location with previously established capital is available.11




                                                  4
Theory

        Chiswick (2000) contains a simple exposition of the human capital investment model of

migration, whose origins are in Sjaastad (1962). An individual computes the gross benefit to

migration, based on the wage difference in the source and the destination, and compares it with

the cost of migration, which could include both foregone earnings and direct costs, such as

transport and psychic costs. In the simplest version of the model, the return to skill is the same in

the source and destination. If direct costs are equal for all potential migrants, migrants will tend

to be those who are better paid, and therefore more skilled, since the return to migration will be

higher for such individuals, all else equal. The higher the direct cost, the more positively self-

selected the migrants will be. Hence, migrants who move a long distance will be more positively

self-selected than migrants who move a short distance. If all moving costs are proportional to

the wage, migrants will be similar to non-migrants.

        Chiswick’s model also shows simply the result developed in Borjas (1987), based on the

Roy model, that relative returns to skills (inequality) in the source and destination are

important.12 If the return to skill is higher in the destination, this factor alone implies a higher

return to migration for the more skilled, and hence more positively self-selected migrants: for a

given difference in mean country wages, the skilled have a larger potential wage gain from

migration. If the return to skill is lower in the destination, this will tend to offset, and possibly

even reverse, the positive self-selection of migrants.13

        In this paper I discuss the self-selection of immigrants as viewed from the source: I

consider a migrant to be positively self-selected if he or she is more skilled than non-migrants in

the source region, as measured by personal and labor market characteristics, and the wage.

Borjas (1987) shows, however, that it is possible for a destination to attract a migrant whose



                                                   5
skills were below average in the source, yet are above average in the destination (“refugee

sorting”). The converse is not possible: migrants whose skills were above average in the source

will have above-average skills in the destination.

       The question of same-employer migrants has not been considered previously. A firm

might request an individual to transfer, or might solicit applications for transfers in particular

occupations, or might entertain a request instigated by an individual. In these cases, a firm will

most commonly want to transfer workers with skills not available locally at the destination site,

which implies transferred workers will be skilled, particularly with regard to firm-specific skills.

Alternatively, workers may be transferred for training at another site. Firm-specific skill

facilitates intra-firm mobility, contrary to the standard inter-firm case.

       Many large firms have internal job markets which allow employees to be well informed

about opportunities at other sites. Another site may prefer an applicant already working at the

firm, as that applicant has presumably been successfully screened according to the firm’s

standards. Such transferred workers need not necessarily have scarce observable skills, but are

likely to have good unobservable skills.

       Typically, firms with multiple sites are large firms, and workers at large firms are paid

more than observably equivalent workers at smaller firms. We would therefore expect

transferred workers to earn more than others because of their high human capital, and possibly

also because of rents associated with large firms.

       Migration with the same employer is a low cost and low risk move: information on

vacancies is easily available, the conditions of the new job are likely to be known and similar to

the old job, skills in the old job are likely to be fully rewarded in the new job and moving costs

may even be paid.



                                                  6
Data

       The sample from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) includes both workers

and non-workers, aged 18-65, and spans the years 1984-2000.14 I focus on inter-state residential

moves of residents of western Germany, since east-to-west moves may have somewhat different

determinants.15 I consider people under 25 moving with parents under sixty, and people moving

to an adjacent county across the state border or within a metropolitan area to be non-migrants

(“stayers”). Most people who change state but continue to commute daily to the same workplace

will be classified as stayers. However, some may move their principal residence while

commuting to the old workplace on a weekly basis. Although I have taken pains to identify false

moves, I have made no attempt to identify false stays: people who move long distances without

changing states.16 People moving abroad are recorded as missing observations. The survey will

underestimate migration, since movers are generally disproportionately lost by surveys.

       In each survey, respondents are asked explicitly whether they had changed job since the

beginning of the previous calendar year. If they answer yes, they are asked the nature of the

change; a possible answer is a within-firm job-change. I call same-employer migrants those

migrants who either said they did not have a job change, or said they had a within-firm change.

Many workers genuinely changing workplace may answer that they have no job change, either if

their new job is identical to the old, or if they are on a temporary training assignment.

       It is likely that some number of respondents classified as same-employer migrants do not

in fact change workplace. If these people should properly be classified as stayers, they will bias

the same-employer migrant group towards the characteristics of stayers. However, the possibility

that people who move a long way for housing or spousal reasons without changing job constitute

a distinct group cannot be excluded. It is also possible that some respondents interpret the



                                                  7
question about a change in job as referring to an occupation. Teachers, for example, whose

occupation is slightly overrepresented among same-employer migrants compared to stayers,

change employer when they teach in a different state, but may not consider that they have

changed jobs. If this is common, the same-employer migrants should be viewed as constituting

not only workers transferred by their firm, but also workers who can find jobs in other states so

similar to their old job that they do not consider the change to be a job change.



Model

        I begin by estimating probits for the probability that a respondent i changes state of

residence r between interviews at t and t+1, P(movet,t+1), as a function of characteristics before

the move, Xirt , whether the respondent was laid off between the interviews, Laid-offirt,t+1,

whether the respondent had migrated in the previous decade, Moveirt-, and whether the

respondent had completed an educational qualification between the interviews, Eduirt,t+1:

        P(Moveirt,t+1) = Xirtβ1 + β2Laid-offirt,t+1 + β3Moveirt- + β4Eduirt,t+1 +δr + γt + εirt.


I also control for year dummies γt and state dummies δr. I report marginal effects, and t-statistics


adjusted to reflect repeated observations on individuals. I include information on the acquisition

of an educational qualification, since many people move after completing a qualification, either

to continue their education or take a job.17

        I subsequently estimate multinomial logits based on this specification. I first divide

migrants into three mutually exclusive groups: same-employer migrants, return migrants (who

were not same-employer migrants), and others. I then divide the “others” group into those who

moved to a neighboring state, and those who moved farther. This gives me four groups of



                                                 8
migrants and the group of stayers as categories for the multinomial logit. I report odds ratios

(exponentiated coefficients) and t-statistics adjusted to reflect repeated observations on

individuals.

       Same-employer migrants had been working in year t, were not laid off between

interviews, and with one exception did not report being unemployed (in addition to employed) in

year t. Therefore, the coefficients on these variables for same-employment migration are

constrained to be zero (with an odds ratio of one). When the sample is split by age or sex, the

small number with an increase in education requires this coefficient too to be set to zero for

same-employer migration. Since there cannot be any return migrants in the first year, the

coefficient on the 1984 year dummy is constrained to be zero for return migration.



Descriptive Statistics

       Column 1 of Table 1 shows that the migration rate is 0.67% per year.18 The subsequent

columns indicate that the migration rate is twice as high among those under thirty compared to

those aged 30-49 (columns 2 and 3), and more than twice as high among those laid off as those

not laid off (columns 6 and 7). Men and women have similar migration rates (columns 4 and 5).

       In Table 2 I distinguish between same-employer migrants to a new state, and same-

employer return migrants, who represent 18% and 5% of moves respectively (column 1).19 Other

return migrants represent 17% of migrants, 31% of migrants moved to a “new” neighboring

state, and 29% moved to a “new” non-contiguous state. A majority of same-employer moves are

for people aged 30-49, for whom they represent in total 31% of moves (column 3), consistent

with the notion that these are transferred workers who have accumulated firm-specific




                                               9
knowledge. Most of these moves are made by men, for whom they represent 32% of moves,

rather than women, for whom they represent only 15% of moves (columns 4 and 5).

       Table 3 shows the means of the main variables of interest by migrant status, again

distinguishing between the two types of same-employer move. The most striking statistic of the

table is the share of migrants who had completed tertiary education (university or technical

higher education - Fachhochschule). While only 9% of stayers had completed tertiary education

(column 1), 28% of movers had done so (column 2), while 34% of same-employer movers to a

new state and 49% of return same-employer movers (columns 6 and 7) had done so. Same-

employer migrants are slightly older than other migrants, and with long-distance movers have the

highest pre-move wages (25-28 German marks (DM) per hour, compared to 20 for stayers).

Individuals laid off between interviews are overrepresented among movers, particularly among

return movers (column 5), where they represent 10% of the group. I shall assume that they were

laid off before moving. 32% of migrants (column 2) compared to only 3% of non-migrants

(column 1) had moved in the previous ten years, but among non-return migrants, this share is

never higher than 15%. A calculation not shown indicates that more than two-thirds of previous

movers are return movers. Means of other variables used in the regressions are shown in the

Appendix Table.

       The two groups of same-employer migrants have similar characteristics, and in

multinomial logit analysis the hypothesis that their coefficients were the same could not be

rejected. I therefore pool these two groups in the multinomial results reported below.

       As expected, same-employer migrants work disproportionately in large firms: 42% work

in firms of over 2000 employees, compared to 27% of working stayers, and 17-24% for workers

in other migrant groups. The most common and most over-represented occupation for female



                                                10
same-employer migrants is “accountants, cashiers and related”, who are 16% of same-employer

migrants compared to 9% in the general female workforce. For male same-employer migrants

the most common and most over-represented occupation is “architects and engineers”, who are

18% of the same-employer migrants compared to 4% in the general male workforce.



Results
Probits
        The columns of Table 4 represent a series of probits for the probability of migration, with

some variations in the definition of migration. All specifications include controls for sex, marital

status, the presence of a child eleven or younger, the interaction of marital status and child with

sex, and dummies for foreign nationality, age, year and state, in addition to those shown in the

table. The first five columns use the migration definition described in the data section. In column

1 I add education dummies to the basic set of controls. The omitted category is apprenticeship,

the most common category. The dummy for the unskilled “general education” category has an

insignificant negative coefficient. However, individuals with vocational training, which typically

follows an apprenticeship, or civil service training, are a significant 0.15% more likely to

migrate, while those with tertiary education are 1.2% (1.2 percentage points) more likely to

migrate, compared to a mean of only 0.7%. These results suggest that migrants are more skilled

than non-migrants. Those that acquired an educational qualification in the current year were

0.28% more likely to migrate.

       In column 2, rather than using education as a proxy for skill, I use the wage in the initial

year. This is naturally only valid for those who are working. For the employed, the wage may be

the best measure of skills, since it should reflect both observed characteristics and unobserved

characteristics such as motivation or firm-specific human capital. Those who are not working are



                                                11
0.28% more likely to move than those who are working, while amongst those who are working,

those with a higher wage are more likely to migrate, indicating that the more skilled workers

migrate. The mean hourly wage in the sample, as well as the mean wage of those with

apprenticeship education, is DM20 (standard deviation 23), while for tertiary graduates it is

DM31. The coefficient of 0.0166 indicates that were the hourly wage to rise by 31-20=11 DM

per hour, the probability of migration would rise by 0.18%, only 15% of the magnitude of the

university effect in column 1.

       In column 3 I use labor force status only as a proxy for skill (although the labor force

coefficients do not prove very sensitive to the presence of other skill covariates). Similarly to

column 2, those not working are 0.27% more likely to migrate than the employed. Those

registered as unemployed at the time of the initial interview are 0.16% more likely to migrate

than others who were not working, meaning they are 0.27+0.16=0.43% more likely to move than

the employed, about half the mean migration rate. Those laid off between interviews (who would

typically have been employed at the time of the initial interview), are 0.51% more likely to

emigrate, about half the size of the university effect.

       In column 4 I include education, labor force status and wage, as well as an indicator for

working part-time (whose coefficient is insignificant). The main change when the skill indicators

are entered simultaneously is that the coefficient on the wage falls to two-thirds of its column 2

level. In column 5 I add the covariate indicating whether the individual had moved in the

previous ten years. This is very significant: a previous move raises the probability of a

subsequent move by 2.4%, the largest effect identified. The only other coefficient to change

appreciably when this covariate is added is the coefficient on university, which falls to two thirds




                                                  12
of its column 4 level: part of the reason that the university-educated are more likely to move is

that they are more likely to have moved in the past.

       In columns 6-7 I recode the moves of same-employer migrants to be stays, to assess the

influence of this group on the results. I present results from the specifications corresponding to

columns 2 and 5. Removing the same-employer migrants in column 6 causes the coefficient on

the wage to fall to 40% of its previous size (in column 2), and increases the standard error. The

coefficient is thus not close to significant. If the wage is used as a summary measure of the skill

of employed potential migrants, therefore, migrants who are not same-employer migrants are not

positively self-selected.

       In column 7 I repeat the specification with all covariates including previous move. The

coefficient on the wage is here 28% of its column 5 counterpart and insignificant, and the

coefficient on university falls to almost half its column 5 level. The coefficient on vocational

training also falls, while the coefficients on not working and being laid off rise (since migrants

who by definition were employed and not laid off have been removed). This reinforces the

impression that migrants who are not same-employer migrants are not more skilled than non-

migrants. The coefficient on a previous move falls somewhat in column 7 compared to column 5,

suggesting that some of its effect comes from identifying people likely to be mobile same-

employer movers.

       In column 8, compared to the standard migration definition, I recode moves of those

returning to a state they have lived in the previous decade (who are not same-employer return

movers), to be stays. I present the specification corresponding to column 5. The coefficient

which changes the most when returners are recoded is that on a previous move: it falls to an

effect of 0.72%, only 30% as large as the column 5 effect. Thus, most of the effect of a previous



                                                13
move works through the fact that previous movers are at risk to return home. Nevertheless, the

remaining effect is still quantitatively important, and with university education the strongest

predictor of migration.20 There is also a large decrease in the coefficient on a layoff: it falls from

0.45% in column 5 to 0.24% in column 8, indicating that layoffs have a strong influence on

return migration. The coefficient on not working falls when returns are coded as stays.



Multinomial Logits

       In Table 5 I present the results of the multinomial equivalents of columns 2 and 5 in

Table 4. The reference category is non-migration. In columns 1-4 I focus on the wage as a

summary of skill. As expected based on the results of the probits, same-employer migrants have

significantly higher pre-move wages than stayers: the coefficient indicates that a one DM

increase in the hourly wage would increase the relative migration probability by 0.5%, and hence

a DM11 increase would increase the migration probability by 5.5%. Long-distance migrants are

similarly positively and statistically significantly self-selected. Return migrants have an

imprecisely estimated coefficient of zero, while migrants to a neighboring state appear to have

lower wages than stayers, but the coefficient is not statistically significant. Compared to the

employed, the non-employed have approximately double the relative probability of each type of

migration.

       In columns 5-8 I include all the skill measures. All migrants are positively self-selected

on their education: having tertiary education approximately quadruples the probability of being

in one of the migrant categories compared to being a non-migrant (the coefficients are not

significantly different across columns). The wage coefficients generally remain unchanged, but

the coefficient for short-distance moves falls sufficiently to become significantly negative:



                                                  14
conditional on education, the employed members of this group are negatively self-selected

(column 5). This is the wage effect least dwarfed by the education effect: a DM1 rise in the wage

reduces the relative probability of this type of migration by 3%, and a DM11 rise reduces the

probability by 33%.

       The weak effects of wages relative to education could indicate that the importance of

education goes beyond its relation with labor market productivity. An alternative explanation,

particularly for short-distant migration for which the wage is significantly negative conditional

on education, is that some people migrate because they are underpaid in their current job. This in

turn could be a manifestation of Borjas’s “refugee sorting”.21

       As expected based on the probits, the magnitude of the layoff effect is greatest for the

return migration category. The relative probability of return migration is multiplied by five for a

person who is laid off (column 7), compared to a multiple of two for a short-distance move

(column 5), and a multiple of three for a long-distance move (column 6). The effects are

significantly different at the 10% level for return and short-distance migration.

       Compared to other non-employed, the unemployed are significantly more likely to make

a move to a neighboring state only. The total effect of being unemployed is the product of the

odds ratios for non-employment and unemployment: compared to the employed, the unemployed

are four times (2.22 x 1.76, column 5) more likely to move to a neighboring state than to stay,

which is larger than the layoff effect of 2.19, though insignificantly so. The effect of a layoff and

the total effect of unemployment are similar for long-distance moves (odds ratios of 3.7 and 3.1,

column 6), but the layoff odds ratio is larger for return moves (5.0 vs 3.8 in column 7), though

insignificantly so. It is possible that when workers who have the possibility of returning home

are laid off, they return immediately without waiting to register for unemployment benefits.



                                                 15
Those who remain non-employed long enough to be picked up as such by the survey may have

made their decision not to return.

       Lest the distinctive characteristics of the same-employer migrants be influenced by the

unmodelled fact that a respondent must be working for this migration to be an option, I have

rerun the regression of columns 5-8 on a sample of people working in the initial year. The

(unreported) coefficients on the common coefficients are similar, except that the new layoff

coefficients are larger, particularly for return migration.

        Table 6 presents the multinomial      logit specification of Table 5 columns 5-8 with the

sample split by sex. For women, only same-employer migrants have relatively higher wages than

stayers (column 8), whereas for men both long-distance movers and same-employer movers have

higher wages than stayers (columns 2 and 4). These results suggest the possibility that women

moving long distances who are not moving with the same employer are often tied movers.22

       While for men the effect of a university education is strongest for same-employer moves

(column 4, odds ratio of 5.89), for women the same-employer odds ratio of 2.4 is the smallest of

the moving categories (column 8). The differences between the university coefficients across

categories are not statistically significant for men or women, however.

       Also of great interest in Table 6 is the result for men that those laid off are 11.5 times

more likely than others to return home relative to staying (column 3). This coefficient is

significantly larger than for the other migration categories. The result suggests that men who

migrate and fail return home. No such pattern is seen for women, for whom the layoff effect

operates exclusively through long-distance moves.

       In Table 7 I present the same specifications for a sample split by age. I focus on young

people (18-29) and prime-aged people (30-49). Coefficients vary by age for layoffs and the



                                                  16
wage. Layoffs push the young to return home (column 3 indicates that a layoff increases the

relative probability of such a move by five times), while for other moves layoffs have an

insignificant effect. Conversely, layoffs have an insignificant effect on return moves for the

prime-aged (column 7), but large significant effects of 3.5-6 on other moves (columns 5 and 6).

The association between same-employer moves and the wage does not differ much by age, but

while long-distance migrants are positively self-selected on the wage among the prime-aged, it is

rather return movers who are positively self-selected in the case of the young.

       The stronger effect of layoffs on older people for non-return moves confirms the result of

Hunt (2002) for east-to-west migration. However, for east-to-west migration, younger migrants

were found to be more positively self-selected than older migrants based on the wage, which is

not the case here. The wage may be a less good skill proxy for the young, who are in an

investment phase, than for the old.



Conclusion

       Skilled migrants have a low-cost avenue for migration that has not previously been

considered: transferring within their firm. This should contribute to the positive self-selection of

migrants, particularly for internal migration, or migration between rich countries. I show that this

avenue is quantitatively important for German internal migration, where a fifth of inter-state

migrants move with the same employer. If the wage is used as a summary of skill, these migrants

account for the overall positive characteristics of migrants compared to non-migrants.

       Migrants who are not same-employer migrants cannot be considered generally more

skilled than non-migrants. However, it is important to distinguish further between return and

“new” migrants, and short and long-distance migrants. Return migrants are a heterogeneous



                                                17
group of failures and successes, in keeping with theory predicting that some return migrants had

worse realized outcomes of their initial migration than they had expected, while some had

always intended to return. Among “new” migrants, long-distance migrants are positively self-

selected, while short-distance migrants are not. This confirms the theory predicting that higher

moving costs increase the positive self-selection of migrants. The result suggests that migrants

from poor countries to distant rich countries are likely to be positively self-selected, while

migrants from poor countries to neighboring rich countries need not be.

       Finally, I show that repeat migration is primarily accounted for by return migration. The

strong predictive power of a previous move has often been interpreted as reflecting an

unobserved propensity to move, or identifying people with low investment in their current

location. My result indicates the importance of having a potential destination where previous

investments have been made.

Data Appendix

        I use information about the interview dates and the dates that jobs started to establish
whether a respondent had changed job between interviews. I use information on the reason a job
ended to assess whether the change had been involuntary (which I term a layoff).
        I construct a variable indicating whether the respondent has moved in the previous ten
years (or since their entry to the survey, if less than ten years previously), and for migrants, I
check whether they have lived in their destination state in the previous ten years (or since entry
to the survey). These variables will be underestimated in the early part of the survey, meaning
early return migrants will be misclassified, and the effect of a previous move will be biased
downward. I compute these variables based on the periods in which I observe respondents in the
sample, to avoid having missing values for those who temporarily left the sample.
         I construct an hourly wage rate from monthly labor earnings divided by 4.33 times usual
weekly hours. Dropping observations with missing wages reduces the sample considerably, but
does not change the overall migration rate. I do not drop observations with missing layoff
information, since this leads to a disproportionate loss of migrants, but instead include a dummy
for having missing layoff information.
        The small state of Saarland is not identified separately in the GSOEP, and is treated as
part of Rheinland-Pfalz (Rhineland-Palatinate). Detailed geographic information in restricted
form is available by agreement with the SOEP Group at the DIW-Berlin.

  Constant and Massey (2002, 2003), who do not split their sample by age, find that foreigners’

   DaVanzo (1978) and Goss and Schoening (1984) are among previous papers to have found a

   Since most moves in a period where an educational qualification was obtained are likely to
take place after it is obtained, I control for educational qualifications in t+1 rather than t to avoid

   In results not shown, if same-employer return movers are also coded as stayers, the coefficient
on a previous move falls to 0.0034, with a t-statistic of 5.2. If all same-employer movers and
returns are coded as stayers, the coefficient falls to 0.0022 with a t-statistic of 5.9.

   Hunt (2002) finds a similarly weak effect of the wage compared to education for east-to-west
migration.

   Interactions of the wage with sex, spouse, and sex times spouse all had insignificant
coefficients, however. It is difficult to estimate the multinomial logit on single women only,
since the number of moves per category becomes small.

Notes. Whether the individual was working or registered as unemployed, and the wage of the
employed refer to the initial year of the pair. Education is measured in the second year of the
pair, while “laid off” refers to those reporting a layoff between the two interviews. The standard
deviations of wages and age are in parentheses. Wages are measured in 1991 DM.

Notes: Marginal effects from probits on a sample of 114,946 observations. The t-statistics in
parentheses are adjusted to account for repeated observations on the same person, and are
computed for the untransformed coefficients. Regressions also include sex, spouse, sex*spouse,
child, sex*child, foreign and age dummies, year dummies and state dummies. Columns 3,7 and 8
also contain a dummy for missing layoff information. The omitted education is apprenticeship.
In columns 6 and 7 same-employer migrants are coded as stayers rather than migrants. In column
8 return migrants (who are not same-employer migrants), are coded as stayers rather than
migrants.

Notes: Unweighted means of 114,178 stayers and 768 migrants. Variables refer to the initial year
of the pair, except education, which refers to the second year. “Laid off” refers to those reporting
a layoff between the two interviews. The standard deviation of wages interacted with working is
reported in parentheses. Means of other variables are shown in Table 2. Wages are in 1991 DM.
