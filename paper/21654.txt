Policymakers are increasingly interested in reducing healthcare costs and inefficiencies through innovative
payment strategies. These strategies may have heterogeneous impacts across geographic areas, potentially
reducing or exacerbating geographic variation in healthcare spending. In this paper, we exploit a major
payment reform for home health care to examine whether reductions in reimbursement lead to differential
changes in treatment intensity and provider costs depending on the level of competition in a market.
 Using Medicare claims, we find that while providers in more competitive markets had higher average
costs in the pre-reform period, these markets experienced larger proportional reductions in treatment
intensity and costs after the reform relative to less competitive markets. This led to a convergence
in spending across geographic areas. We find that much of the reduction in provider costs is driven
by greater exit of “high-cost” providers in more competitive markets.

1. Introduction

       With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), policy

makers are increasingly looking to reduce both health care costs and inefficiencies in care by

restructuring the ways that Medicare pays health care providers. High costs and inefficiencies

have long been attributed to the traditional “cost-based” reimbursement model, where health care

providers are paid separately for each service provided. In addition, competition has been shown

to increase costs under cost-based reimbursement, with health care providers competing for

patients based on quality and amenities which generate higher costs (Robinson and Luft 1987,

Zwanziger and Melnick 1988). In this way, competition may also drive geographic variation in

costs of care since there is considerable variation in market concentration across areas.

       Over the past 30 years, Medicare has progressively moved away from cost-based

reimbursement towards prospective payment, where a health care provider receives a set

payment for an episode of care based on the characteristics of the patient. These payment

reforms occurred in 1983 for hospitals and in the late 1990s and early 2000s for providers of

post-acute care (e.g., skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and inpatient rehabilitation

facilities). Extensive evidence shows that the shift to prospective payment had varying effects

on health care costs across setting, with more “prospective” reforms and those reducing marginal

payments leading to larger cost reductions (Newhouse and Byrne 1988, Grabowski, Afendulis et

al. 2011, Sood, Huckfeldt et al. 2013, Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2014). In addition, there is some

evidence that the relationship between competition and quality (or costs) also changed after

prospective payment. For example, data from California show that costs fell more for providers

in the most competitive markets after the Inpatient Prospective Payment System was

implemented in 1983 (Meltzer, Chung et al. 2002). However, the implementation of the Inpatient

                                                  3
Prospective Payment System coincided with the implementation of selective contracting and

rapid penetration of managed care in California. Thus, it is unclear the extent to which the

differential effects on costs were related to implementation of prospective payment versus other

contemporaneous trends.

       In this paper we revisit the question of whether provider payment reforms, which reduce

the marginal reimbursement to health care providers, may have a differential effect depending on

the level of provider competition in a health care market. We start with the premise that

differences in the level of competition across health care markets is an important source of

geographic variation in health care costs, with markets with greater competition under cost-

based reimbursement having higher costs or intensity of care. Prior research also suggests that

greater competition in health care markets with administered prices might lead to socially

wasteful spending (Gaynor 2006). We next develop a stylized model that evaluates how the

impact of payment reform on costs or intensity of care might vary by the level of competition in

the market. We predict that payment reform reduces costs more in more competitive markets.

Thus, it is possible that payment reform can simultaneously reduce costs and reduce geographic

variation in care as it will lead to convergence in costs across more and less competitive markets.

       We empirically test our predictions by investigating a significant Medicare payment

reform for home health agencies: the 1997 Interim Payment System (IPS). The IPS offers an

interesting case study as it imposed limits on payments to home health agencies in what was a

cost-based reimbursement system, dramatically reducing reimbursement to home health agencies

by nearly 50 percent (US Government Accountability Office 2000). Moreover, there is evidence

that post-acute care is a key driver of the still-substantial geographic variation in Medicare

spending (Newhouse and Garber 2013), suggesting significant scope for payment reforms

                                                  4
targeted at post-acute care in reducing overall geographic variation in spending. Although

several studies have analyzed the effects of IPS, none have looked at how the effects of the IPS

on costs or intensity of care varied by the initial level of competition in the market (McCall,

Komisar et al. 2001, Liu, Long et al. 2002, McCall, Petersons et al. 2003, Murtaugh, McCall et

al. 2003, Porell, Liu et al. 2006, Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2013, Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2014). In this

paper we add to this literature by analyzing how the effects of IPS varied by the level of

competition. We also analyze the pathways or mechanisms that might explain the heterogeneous

impact of IPS across markets with different levels of competition.

       The empirical results are consistent with the predictions from the theoretical model. We

find that there was significant variation in costs by level of competition in the pre-IPS period,

with more competitive markets having higher costs. After the IPS, costs declined in all markets

but there were larger declines in costs in more competitive markets. The decline in costs was

driven by both changes in the probability of any home health use (extensive margin) and a

decline in the number of home health days among existing users (intensive margin). As a result

of the heterogeneous response to the payment reform, costs and the number of home health days

converged in more and less competitive markets and the significant variation in costs or intensity

of care by level of competition in the pre-IPS period nearly disappeared in the post-IPS period.

       In robustness tests, we show that more competitive markets are more likely to be urban

with larger populations, but the heterogeneous response of IPS persists even after we flexibly

control for differences in observable characteristics between less and more competitive markets.

Payment limits under the IPS were partially determined by the difference between a home health

agency’s costs relative to the census division average, which varies systematically across regions

and may be correlated with competition levels. However, we find larger cost reductions in more

                                                  5
competitive markets even after controlling for heterogeneity in the reform’s “bite” across areas.

Finally, we show that the larger impact of IPS in more competitive markets is driven by two

factors. First, we observe greater exit of home health agencies in more competitive markets.

Second, the home health agencies that exited more competitive markets were more likely to be

“high-cost” agencies. Thus, payment reform serves to eliminate some of the most inefficient

providers, especially those that are operating in highly competitive markets.

       Overall these findings imply that payment reform is not only an important tool for

reducing health care costs but it can affect geographic variation in care and health system

efficiency by changing incentives and influencing market dynamics. Under the ACA, Medicare

is adopting new provider payment reforms such as bundled payment and accountable care

organizations, which represent further shifts towards capitation. The extent to which these

reforms can further reduce costs and improve efficiency – and potentially reduce variation in

health care spending- depends in part on the differential effects of such reforms across markets

with different levels of competition.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the IPS. Section 3 builds a

conceptual framework. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 discusses our empirical strategy

and section 6 discusses the results.

2. Background

       From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health expenditures more than quintupled, rising

from $3.4 billion to $19.2 billion. In addition, between 1990 and 1996 the number of

beneficiaries using the home health benefit almost doubled from 1.9 million to 3.7 million and

the number of visits per patient grew from 33 visits to 76 visits (United States Congress 2000).


                                                 6
Much of this growth was spurred by the 1988 Duggan v. Bowen court case, which drastically

broadened the eligibility criteria for the Medicare home health benefit. In response to rising

costs, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) mandated that the home health payment policy be

reformed. The BBA called for a Prospective Payment System (PPS) and immediately enacted an

Interim Payment System (IPS) to address the rising costs while the PPS was being developed.

The IPS went into effect in October 1997 and lasted for 3 years before being replaced by the PPS

in October 2000.

        Before the IPS, Medicare home health payment policy was a cost based reimbursement

system subject to a per-visit limit on costs. This limit was set at the lower of an agency’s

“reasonable costs” or 112% of the national average of per visit costs. The implementation of IPS

imposed stricter per-visit cost limits (reduction in average reimbursement) and introduced a per-

beneficiary total annual cost limit (reduction in marginal reimbursement). Specifically, IPS

introduced per-visit limits equal to 105% of the national median cost per visit for newer home

health agencies that entered the market after 1994. Older home health agencies faced a limit that

was a weighted average of the agency’s average per patient costs in 1994 (75%) and their census

division per patient costs (25%). A home health agency received payment equal to the lower of

its actual costs, its per-visit cost limit, or the per-beneficiary cost limit.

        McCall et al. (2001) and McKnight (2006) found a large decrease in home health

utilization and the number of visits per user following IPS. Huckfeldt et al. (2013) found that the

IPS reduced average payments and that this decline in reimbursement decreased utilization of

home health services with little change in readmission and mortality. The decline in use of home

health care coupled with lack of changes in readmission rates and mortality suggests that the IPS

increased efficiency in the home health care industry. While prior work has investigated

                                                     7
heterogeneous effects of the IPS by geography, such work has focused on variation in the

average reimbursement change after IPS across markets which stems from payment limits being

based on average census division costs (McKnight 2006). One study does look at entry and exit

effects by level of competition (as measured by the number of home health agencies in a market)

and find that markets with more home health agencies experienced more supply changes after

IPS (Porell, Liu et al. 2006). However, no studies have looked at how the impact of IPS on costs

or utilization varies by level of competition, which is the focus of this paper.

       Other related work has investigated trends in hospital costs in California during a period

when California experienced several important cost containment measures including the

introduction of Medicare inpatient prospective system, introduction of selective contracting for

Medicaid patients and diffusion of managed care in private insurance markets. This literature

finds that during this time reduction in costs were largest for the most competitive markets

(Zwanziger and Melnick 1988, Meltzer, Chung et al. 2002). We examine whether there was a

differential impact of IPS in more versus less competitive markets. The IPS provides an

important case study due to the large magnitude of overall reductions in payments. Moreover,

the wide variation in home health competition across markets generates an ideal context for

studying how competition affects responses to payment reform. Understanding how the effects

of prior Medicare payment reforms varied across more and less competitive markets provide

important evidence on the potential effects of reforms underway, and how they may affect

geographic variation in Medicare spending.

3. Conceptual Model

       In this paper, we are interested in how agencies adjust their intensity of care (in this

context intensity can be viewed as the number of visits per episode of care) in response to

                                                  8
payment reform across markets with different levels of competition. We develop a conceptual

model based on papers by Brekke, Siciliani, and Straume (2011) and Hodgkin and

McGuire(1994).

        Changes in an agency’s intensity of care can have two effects on demand – a market

stealing effect (attracting a patient from another home health agency) and a market expansion

effect (attracting a patient from another post-acute care provider or a patient who was not

planning on getting any post-acute care). To illustrate and isolate these effects we consider two

types of patients. The first, H type patients have a high value of home health care. These are

patients who are much more suited to home health care; they get a large amount of utility from

remaining in their homes and will not switch to other post-acute options as long as home health

care is provided at a baseline level of intensity. We assume this market is saturated such that

increasing intensity will not draw any new H type patients into the market, increasing intensity

will only steal them from other firms. So changes in demand by H type patients isolates the

market stealing effect of changes in intensity of care. The second, L type patients have a lower

value of home health care. These patients are willing to utilize other types of post-acute care, like

nursing homes, or forgo post-acute care if home health intensity is not high enough. To isolate

the market expansion effect we assume that the L type patient market is never saturated;

increasing intensity will draw in new L type patients to the market but will not steal L types from

other firms. We can model patient utility as:




Where     or   is the value that the patient puts on home health service at a baseline intensity that

we arbitrarily set as       for convenience. The extra utility that a patient gets from a firm


                                                  9
providing intensity above        is    . For simplicity, let     . The disutility of “mismatch costs”

is            . Firm demand is derived using a Salop circle model, classically the circle represents

the physical distance between each firm, but since home health patients do not travel to the

agency providing them service we think of the circle as a “firm specialization” space. The

distance between firms represents the different sets of skills or attributes that firms may have.

Thus the “distance” could be based on clinical condition of the patient and specialization of

home health agency in treating that condition or it could more generally reflect differences in

patient preferences for receiving care from a particular agency. Thus, x denotes the mix of home

health agency attributes preferred by the patient, zi indicates the mix of attributes characterizing

the agency i, and             represents how good of a fit a patient is for a specific home health

agency, is the marginal cost of the “distance” between the patients’ preferences and an

agency’s attributes. The smaller the “distance” between the firm and the patient, the better the fit

and lower the mismatch cost.


           In our model, price is regulated and takes the form                     , where α is average

reimbursement and β is marginal reimbursement. This formulation allows Medicare’s payment

of home health agencies to occur on a spectrum ranging from cost based reimbursement system

                       to prospective payment                      . Firm costs are separable and the

marginal cost of an additional patient is constant for any given level of intensity,

                      where              is the demand for firm i and       is the cost of intensity per

patient.

           We normalize patient density on the circle and the total length of the circle to one. There

are n firms evenly distributed about the circle, such that their distance apart is equal to 1/n. The

patient population is split between H and L types where a fraction λ are H type and 1-λ are L

                                                     10
type. To find demand for each patient type, we first find their point of indifference along the

circle between the first firm, i, and a second firm, j, for H type:




And for L type patients where agencies have a local monopoly patients are indifferent between

receiving home health care and the outside option whose utility is normalized to zero:




Total demand is given by multiplying (1) and (2) by two times the fraction of H or L type

patients.




The combination of having H and L type patients in the model separates the “market stealing”

and “market expansion” effects of an agency increasing its intensity of care. When a firm

increases its intensity, it “steals” H type patients from other agencies and “expands” the market

by attracting new L type patients who otherwise would not receive home health. We gain greater

insight from looking at how demand changes with intensity:




                                                  11
Both the “market stealing” (the second inequality) and the “market growth” (the third inequality)

components of demand contribute a positive, constant return to intensity. In addition, the market

growth is usually the primary driver of the return to intensity; only at high levels of H types in

the market (λ>2/3) does the “market stealing” component over power the “market growth”

component. We also look at how demand changes with number of firms:




As the number of firms increase, there is a decrease in demand for each firm coming from the H

type patients switching to new agencies, but no effect from the L type patients.

       In this model we assume that firms are profit maximizing, while in reality they may

exhibit altruistic behavior. A version of our model that includes altruism can be found in the

appendix. We found that our predictions are similar to the for-profit analysis presented here

except when firms exhibit a high degree of altruism. However, the empirical literature suggests

that the level of altruism in hospitals and post-acute care providers is not great enough to

differentiate for profit from nonprofit utility maximizing actions. Pauly (1987) reviews

theoretical and empirical literature and finds no significant differences in market behavior

between for profit and nonprofit firms (Pauly 1987). More recently, Duggan (2000) finds that

nonprofit hospitals are no more altruistic than for profit hospitals and that they respond similarly

to pricing incentives.(Duggan 2000) Additionally, Sloan, Picone, Taylor, and Chou (2001) find

no difference in outcomes for for-profit vs nonprofit hospitals (Sloan, Picone et al. 2001). For

these reasons, we restrict our analysis to classic for-profit profit maximization and include an

analysis that includes altruism in the Appendix.

Firms profit maximize, as in (4):

                                                 12
With the first order condition for intensity allocation being:




We substitute equation (3) into (5) and set qi=q j to solve for optimum intensity q*.




Proposition 1: The intensity of care increases with number of firms.

To solve for dq/dn we take the total derivative of the first order condition:




We can see that dq is simply the second order condition of profit maximization, and is, by

definition, always less than zero.




                                                 13
The denominator is the negative of the second order condition therefore is positive, so the sign is

determined by the numerator. The numerator is also positive given that costs are increasing and

there is a non-zero amount of H type patients in the market.

Proposition 2: A decline in marginal reimbursement has larger effect on intensity of care in

more competitive markets.

To see this, consider how dq/dn changes with marginal reimbursement:




To understand why this relationship is positive, we look back to the first order condition, which

simplifies to:




The right hand side (RHS) of the equation is the marginal cost of increasing intensity and the left

hand side (LHS) of the equation is the marginal benefit of increasing intensity. An increase in

intensity decreases profits because it increases the marginal cost of providing care for

inframarginal patients (RHS). However an increase in intensity raises profits because it increases

demand and firms enjoy a positive margin on the marginal patients (LHS). The marginal benefit

curve slopes downwards as profit margins decline with intensity. The marginal benefit term or

the LHS is independent of the number of firms as the profit margin is a function of

reimbursement policies and the slope of marginal cost curve while and the responsiveness of

demand to intensity is a function of patient preferences (see expression for     derived earlier in



                                                14
the theory section). However, the number of firms in the market does affect the RHS as an

increase in the number of firms reduces the number of inframarginal patients a firm has. Thus the

marginal cost curve for intensity shifts downwards as the number of firms rises (see Figure 1)

and consequently intensity is higher in more competitive markets.

An increase in marginal reimbursement pivots the marginal benefit curve for intensity upwards

as increases in intensity have a smaller effect on profit margins when marginal reimbursement is

higher. This has a larger effect on intensity in more competitive markets, as equilibrium intensity

is higher in more competitive markets. Similarly, an increase in reimbursement also pivots the

marginal cost curve for intensity downward as providing care to inframarginal patients now has a

smaller effect on profits. Again this downward pivot induces a larger effect on intensity in more

competitive markets, as equilibrium intensity is higher in more competitive markets. This effect

is shown in Figure 1. In the figure, the points labeled A denote the level of intensity before an

increase in marginal reimbursement. It is clear that intensity of care in the market with more

competition leads to a higher baseline level of intensity. When marginal reimbursement

increases, the marginal benefit curve pivots upwards and the marginal cost curves pivot

downward as previously stated. A new equilibrium level of intensity is achieved at the points

labeled B. The change in intensity for less competitive markets (low n) is less than the change in

intensity for competitive markets (high n) as predicted.

Proposition 3: Reducing marginal and average reimbursement reduces intensity of care.

This proposition is fairly intuitive and can be derived easily from the total derivative of the first

order condition:




                                                  15
Motivated by these propositions we expect to see the following patterns in our data:

   1. Less concentrated (or more competitive markets) have higher intensity of care (and

       consequently, higher costs)

   2. Because IPS lowered both average and marginal reimbursement we expect to see a

       decrease in intensity of care for all markets.

   3. Because the effects of changes in marginal reimbursement are magnified in markets with

       more competition we expect to see a greater decrease in intensity of care (and costs)

       following the IPS in more competitive markets. This implies a convergence in the costs

       or intensity of care in more versus less competitive markets after the reform.

One caveat is that we treat the number of firms in our model as fixed for simplicity – that is we

do not model firm entry or exit. In reality, the effects of IPS on firm entry and exit may vary by

the level of competition. For example, reducing payment will affect firms with already slim

profit margins the most. If payments are reduced such that a firm accrues a sufficient loss, they

may choose to exit the market. If firms in more competitive markets are operating at higher

levels of intensity their profit margins are likely to smaller and thus we might expect more exit

after IPS in more competitive markets. By similar logic, firm exit might be more pronounced for

“high cost” firms that are less efficient and cannot withstand a decline in reimbursement.


                                                 16
Although, we do not model firm exit in our theoretical model, we do explore it in our empirical

models.

Another caveat is that the model is silent on the effects of competition on patient outcomes. The

model predicts changes in intensity of care only and not patient outcomes. On the one hand, one

can argue that if patients value intensity it must improve patient outcomes. However, on the

other hand one can argue that patients might be uninformed and even though they value higher

intensity care, beyond a certain level, changes in intensity of care do not improve patient

outcomes and represent “wasteful” spending. Thus, in our empirical models we will evaluate

both changes in intensity of care and also changes in patient outcomes.

        The primary source of data for this paper comes from a 100 percent sample of Medicare

claims from the Medicare standard analytic file (SAF) for home health care. We restrict the

sample to individuals who were discharged from an acute care hospital for stroke1 between 1996

and 2000. We use the Medicare claims to obtain the total number of days that beneficiaries

received home health visits and total Medicare payments for home health during the 90-day post-

acute period following each individual’s initial hospital discharge. Any additional acute hospital

stay occurring within the 90-day follow-up period is considered a readmission.

 Stroke patients are defined as those with a principal diagnosis in the acute hospital stay of intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICD code is 431.xx), occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries with infarction (433.x1), occlusion
of cerebral arteries with infarction (434.x1), or acute but ill-deﬁned cerebrovascular disease (436.xx).

   Costs to home health providers are computed using data on facility costs from Medicare cost

reports. To construct total costs for each 90-day post-acute episode, we multiply the number of

visits from the claims data by the facility’s average calendar year cost per visit.


4.2.Patient and Provider Characteristics


   We use the Medicare denominator file to obtain demographic variables for each individual

including gender, age (5-year age categories), race, Medicaid coverage, county of residence, and

urban/rural status, as well as information about whether death occurred within 90 days of the

initial hospital discharge. We use the hospital claims from the initial acute episode to measure

comorbidities, as defined by Elixhauser, Steiner et al. (1998), and complications during the index

hospitalization. The comorbidities and complications that are included as controls in our

analysis are listed in Table 1. We also use the hospital claims to determine whether the stroke

was hemorrhagic or ischemic.

   Provider characteristics for the acute care hospital are derived from the CMS Medicare

Provider of Services file and Acute Impact file. These provider-level databases include

information about ownership status, number of beds, wage index, average daily census, acute

case-mix index, DSH patient share, and Medicare patient share.


4.3.Market Competition


       The empirical analysis compares changes in home health use and costs across areas with

high and low levels of competition. Our primary measure of the level of competition in the

market is the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI). We define markets using Hospital Service

Areas (HSA) as defined by the National Center for Health Statistics (M Makuc, Haglund et al.

1991, Wennberg and Cooper 1996, National Cancer Institute 2008). An HSA is defined as a

                                                 18
group of zip codes in which the residents receive the majority of their hospitalizations. Since

home health care is typically received after a hospitalization we believe that the market definition

for hospitals is a good approximation of the market for home health care. The HHI is the sum of

the squared market shares for home health providers within each HSA. Each home health

agency’s market share is defined as the proportion of Medicare patients residing in the HSA who

receive post-acute care (during the 90-days following their hospitalization for stroke) from that

home health agency. We also compute the Four-Firm Concentration Ratio as the sum of the

market shares for the four most dominant home health agencies within an HSA as a secondary

measure of competition. We exclude small HSAs from our analysis sample that contain fewer

than 28 home health claims (representing the bottom 25 percent of HSAs) where it is difficult to

obtain a precise measure of competition. In some specifications, we examine firm exit and

define a home health agency as exiting the Medicare market when there are no longer any

Medicare claims for that provider. Figure 1 shows that HHI and the Four-Firm Concentration

Ratio vary greatly across the home health industry; we will use this variation to study the

differential effect of payment reform across more and less competitive markets.

4.4.Sample Restrictions


   We exclude individuals who died during the initial hospital stay for stroke. We also exclude

individuals under age 65, those enrolled in Medicare managed care plans, and those residing in

Maryland since Maryland did not adopt prospective payment. We conduct our analysis at the

discharge level and observe outcomes for a 90-day follow-up period. Our main analysis sample

contains 1,178,430 post-acute episodes resulting from 1,178,430 unique stroke discharges over

the study period.

5.1. Primary specification

        We perform OLS regression of home health outcomes on the level of competition

interacted with a post-IPS indicator and controls taking the form:


                                                                               (6)


where Yijt is an outcome such as the number of home health days, provider costs, or the

probability of any home health care for patient i in market j discharged in quarter t.         is a

binary variable indicating the time periods following the introduction of IPS.             is the

baseline HHI in market j in the quarter prior to the introduction of IPS. In some specifications,

we include indicators for HHI quantiles rather than a continuous measure of HHI. HHI Quantile

1 refers to the lowest quantile of HHI (i.e. highest level of competition). We also control for

quarter fixed effects (   , market fixed effects        and time-varying patient level characteristics

and market level characteristics        . The key coefficient of interest is . Since the IPS has an

overall negative effect on outcomes, we predict that      will be positive since less competitive

markets (high HHI) will experience smaller negative effects from IPS (Proposition 2). Standard

errors are clustered at the market-level (HSA).

5.2. Robustness checks

Event study estimates

        We estimate an event study version of the primary specification where we add in

interactions of HHI with each quarter leading up to and following the introduction of IPS. The

omitted interaction term is the quarter before IPS is introduced (quarter 3 of 1997) We expect

the coefficients on the interaction terms for the quarters leading up to the IPS to be statistically


                                                   20
insignificant, implying that pre-IPS trends in outcomes were similar in more versus less

competitive markets. We expect the coefficients on the interaction terms for the quarters after

IPS to be positive and significant suggesting that IPS had smaller negative effects in less

competitive markets.

Urban-Rural

       Prior research and our data suggest that the level of competition in a market is strongly

correlated with the market’s status as urban or rural. More densely populated urban markets are

likely to be more competitive while rural areas have a more dispersed population and are

therefore more likely to be non-competitive. An analysis of changes in health outcomes after

payment reform based on levels of competition could actually be capturing the difference in

responsiveness between urban and rural markets. To test for this, we run our analysis for both

urban and rural areas separately.

Geographic variation in average reimbursement change

       The method of payment reform instituted by the IPS imposed varying levels of

reimbursement reductions for home health agencies depending on how long they had been in the

market and the census averages of costs for their district. Firms that entered the market after

1994 were subject to a maximum per patient reimbursement of 105% of the national median in

1994. Agencies that had entered the market before 1994 were subject to a weighted average of

the firm’s average per patient costs in 1994 and the firm’s census division weighted average of

per patient costs. Because of this, agencies in some census regions faced a larger reduction in

reimbursement limits than others, which could affect their responses to the reform. To account

for this, we introduce a measure, IPS “Bite”. In a similar spirit as McKnight (2006), IPS Bite is


                                                 21
defined as the average number of home health days in a HSA less the average number of home

health days in the HSA’s census division. HSAs with a higher deviation from the average census

region home health days are likely to be areas where IPS reduced payment the most. We plot

how IPS “Bite” varies with HHI to determine whether there is a systematic relationship between

the payment reduction and the level of competition in the market. We then control for the IPS

“Bite” by including a triple-interaction term between post-IPS, HHI and IPS “Bite”.

5.3. Mechanisms

       In addition to characterizing the heterogeneous effects of payment reform by level of

competition, we also want to understand the underlying mechanisms driving these differences.

As discussed in the theoretical framework section, home health agencies may respond to

payment reform by reducing the intensity of care or by exiting the market. We study each of

these mechanisms.

       First, we estimate equation 6 using the number of home health providers as the outcome

variable. We also estimate models defining the outcome variable as the log number of providers.

Changes in the number of home health agencies could be driven both by reductions in entry and

an increased rate of exit.

       Next, we compare the characteristics of exiting home health agencies (agencies that were

in operation in 1996 but exited after IPS) with “stayer” home health agencies (agencies that were

operating during the entire study period from 1996-2000), in order to identify changes in agency

composition after the IPS that may have affected practice patterns. Specifically, we look at

average home health days, Medicare payments, provider costs, and the demographic

characteristics of patients seen by agencies.


                                                22
       In the third set of analyses, we directly investigate how much of the effect of the IPS

occurred through a changing composition of home health agencies. Specifically, we estimate

equation 6 for the home health days and provider costs outcomes, limiting the sample to just the

agencies that stayed in the sample after IPS and compare the results to those for the full sample.

Any differences in results between the two samples are driven by changes in agency composition

due to exiting firms.

6. Results

6.1. Differential effects of IPS by level of competition

       Figure 3 and Table 2 test a primary hypothesis generated by the conceptual model: that

the IPS would have a greater impact on intensity of care (measured by the number of days of

home health care) and costs in more competitive markets. Figure 3 shows reductions in average

home health days, costs, and the probability of using home health across HSAs with different

levels of competition during the period following the introduction of IPS but before the

implementation of PPS (the introduction of IPS is indicated by a red vertical line after the third

quarter of 1997). Consistent with the theoretical model and prior literature, the most competitive

markets (HHI quantile 1) exhibit both the highest costs and days under cost-based

reimbursement prior to the IPS and the largest reductions in costs and days after the IPS,

converging towards the other HHI quartiles in the post-reform period. Figure 1 in the appendix

shows the corresponding figure for two important patient outcomes: readmissions and mortality.

In contrast to the results for intensity of care and costs we find little or no impact of the IPS on

these outcomes and we find no differential effects by the level of competition. These results are

consistent with (Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2014) who also found large changes in costs but no

change in patient outcomes after the IPS.

                                                  23
        Table 2 displays the results from the analogous regressions for home health days

(columns 1-4), provider costs (columns 5-8), and probability of any home health use (columns 9-

12) on the interaction of HHI quantiles with a “post-IPS” indicator variable. The omitted

quantile is the least competitive HSAs (HHI quantile 4). We show results from four

specifications that progressively add controls: the first includes just HSA fixed effects, the

second adds a linear time trend, the third replaces the linear time trend with quarter-year fixed

effects, and the fourth specification adds time-varying patient and market-level controls. The

first two specifications for each outcome include a “Post-IPS” indicator variable, which exhibits

the change in outcome for the least competitive markets (the omitted interaction category). For

home health days, we observe the largest reductions for the most competitive markets, where

home heath days fell by about 2.4 more days than the least competitive markets, and fell 1.5

more days more than the second quantile. The reduction in home health days after the IPS for the

third quantile was not statistically different from the fourth quantile. These results are robust

across the four specifications. We find similar results for provider costs. All quantiles

experienced a decline in costs, with home health agencies in the most competitive quantiles

seeing a decline in costs of $220 more per patient than in the least competitive quantile. Home

health agencies in the second quantile experienced an additional reduction of $80-$90 in costs

than agencies in the least competitive quantile. In total, provider costs were reduced by

approximately $320 for the first quantile of HHI and by about $200 for the second quantile of

HHI (column 6). We find no significant difference between the reduction in provider costs for

the third and fourth quantiles. Although there was an overall reduction in the probability of using

any home health care, we do not find any statistically significant differences in the magnitude of

the reduction across different levels of competition. In Appendix Table 1, we re-estimate all of



                                                 24
these regressions to estimate proportional changes using log outcomes. The results are

qualitatively similar.

6.2. Alternative specifications

Event study

       In Table 3, we estimate a regression that includes leads and lags of the policy to ensure

that our findings in Table 2 are not driven by differential trends in outcomes in the pre-IPS

period. We find no evidence of differences in trends by level of competition in the pre-IPS

period and only observe significant differences in the trends by different levels of competition

immediately after the implementation of IPS.

Results stratified by urban status

       Our data and prior research suggests that the level of competition might be correlated

with urban/rural status, and thus the results could be related to other unobserved differences

between urban and rural areas rather than competition. To investigate this, we re-estimate the

main analysis separately for urban and non-urban HSAs (results shown in Table 4). To

categorize our data into urban and non-urban groups we use data from NCHS. Table 4 shows

that urban and non-urban areas exhibit patterns that are similar to the pooled sample in Table 2 –

in both urban and non-urban areas the IPS had larger negative effects on costs and days in more

competitive markets.

Heterogeneous effects by IPS “Bite”

       The IPS reduced reimbursement by different amounts for home health agencies

depending on how long the firm has been in the market, as well as their average costs and census



                                                25
division costs. To account for this difference in reimbursement changes across HSAs, we

introduce a measure called IPS “bite” which is the difference between the HSA’s average

number of home health days and the census division’s average number of home health days. This

measure predicts how much of an impact IPS may have had on reimbursement. Figure 4 shows

the relationship between HHI and IPS “bite”. There is a slight negative correlation meaning that

a larger reduction in payment is associated with more competitive HSAs. This suggests that IPS

“bite” could be confounding our results.

       We account for the geographic heterogeneity of IPS payment reductions in Table 5 by

including an interaction between Post-IPS and IPS-bite, and a triple-interaction between HHI

Quantile, Post-IPS, and IPS bite. We find that the coefficient on the interaction between Post-IPS

and IPS-bite is negative and significant. This is consistent with prior research which also finds

that the IPS led to larger declines in costs in areas with larger bite.(McKnight 2006, Huckfeldt,

Sood et al. 2014) We find that after controlling for the IPS bite, the differential effect for the

most competitive markets is reduced slightly. Home health days are reduced by approximately

1 day more for markets in the first quantile of HHI compared to the fourth quantile (columns 2

and 3) relative to the 2.5 day reduction that we estimate without controlling for IPS bite (column

1). Similarly, including the IPS “bite” interactions reduces the magnitude of the difference in

reduction of provider costs between quantile 1 and quantile 4 to approximately $130 (columns 5

and 6) rather than $220 (column 4). While this does affect the magnitude of the effect of

competition it does not change our overall result that competition amplifies the impact of the

payment change. Finally, we find that the coefficients on the triple interaction between HHI

Quantile, Post-IPS, and IPS bite are statistically insignificant suggesting that IPS bite or average

reimbursement changes do not affect how competition mediates the impact of IPS on costs.

6.3. Mechanisms through which competition amplifies effect of IPS

Market exit

        We find substantial evidence that the IPS response varied with the level of market

competition. In our conceptual model, we exclude firm decisions regarding entry and exit for

brevity and simplicity when in reality our results could be caused by both internal changes to

cost and admission policies and market exit by firms who incur higher costs and more home

health days. Next, we explore the extent of the role of entry and exit in our findings. Figure 5

shows the trends in the number of home health providers by level of competition. HSAs in the

most competitive quantile experienced the largest reduction in the number of home health

agencies after IPS while the other quantiles appear to have experienced much smaller reductions.

Table 6 Panel A shows estimates from regressing the number of home health providers on the

same variables and controls used in Table 2. In addition, we show results separately by urban/

non-urban status and results that control for IPS bite (columns 5-7). We find progressively

greater reductions in the number of HH providers after IPS as the level of competition increases.

Compared to the lowest competition markets (quantile 4), markets in the third competition

quantile lost approximately 0.5 more agencies, markets in the second quantile lost 1.2 to 1.5

more agencies, and the most competitive markets lost about 5.5 to 6 additional agencies. In total,

the number of agencies in the most competitive markets fell by 4.4 agencies compared to an

increase of 1.6 agencies in the least competitive markets (based on column 2). Comparing urban

and non-urban HSAs in columns 5 and 6, we find that the number of agencies in competitive

markets in urban areas fell more than in non-urban competitive markets, however we find the

same general pattern across competition levels for both categories. Including the IPS bite

interaction terms attenuated the estimates slightly but did not change the pattern by competition

                                                 27
levels. In Panel B we estimate log effects, regressing the log of the number of providers on the

same variables in Panel A. The log effects results follow the same pattern as Panel A; we find

that markets in the first quantile experience a 13.7% greater decrease in the number of providers

after IPS than markets in the fourth quantile and similar results for the other specifications

including IPS “bite” and urban and non-urban comparisons.

Changing composition of home health agencies in the sample

       The results in Table 6 show that reductions in the number of home health agencies after

the IPS were greater in more competitive markets. Table 7 displays characteristics of staying

firms and exiting firms in markets with high and low competition. In non-competitive HSAs

(columns 3 and 4) there is very little difference in baseline year characteristics between exiting

and staying firms. In the most competitive HSAs (columns 1 and 2) we find larger differences,

with exiting firms having about 8 more home health days and $500 more in Medicare payments

and costs than staying firms in the baseline year (1996). Although exiting agencies provided

more home health days and incurred higher costs, there is almost no difference in 90-day

mortality and rehospitalization rates suggesting that exiting firms may have over-provided care

intensity (as measured by days). These results suggest that payment reform is more likely to

induce inefficient firms to exit the market when they are operating in high competition markets.

       In Table 8 we show results from repeating our preferred specification (specification 4)

from Table 2, excluding firms that exited the market after IPS was introduced. Excluding exiting

firms attenuates the extra reduction in home health days in the most competitive markets, from a

reduction of about 4 days receiving home health to a 2.4 day reduction (columns 1 and 2). Once

we control for IPS bite, the estimates become attenuated and insignificant (column 4). This result

implies that much of the difference in the reduction of home health days we found across levels

                                                 28
of competition is likely due to home health agency exit rather than changes in internal structure.

For provider costs, we also find a progressive attenuation in the estimates as the sample is

limited to agencies staying in the market and when we include the IPS bite interaction terms.

However, the extra reduction in the most competitive markets after IPS remains statistically

significant (column 8). This result suggests that market exit plays an important role in reducing

costs.

7. Conclusion

         Cost-based payment of health care providers has been widely acknowledged as a driver

of over-use of health care and the growth of health care costs in the US. Competition has been

acknowledged to exacerbate this problem, with providers in more competitive markets attracting

patients by providing more services and amenities, generating geographic variation in costs. The

effects of reforms that shift provider payment away from fee-for-service towards more capitated

models may also vary depending on the level of market competition. We develop a theoretical

model generating predictions that reducing marginal reimbursement will have a greater effect on

the intensity of care and costs in more competitive markets. Our empirical results are consistent

with this prediction, with larger reductions after the IPS in the probability of receiving home

health care and the intensity of care in more competitive markets, leading to convergence in costs

in more and less competitive markets. We do not find a similar convergence in patient outcomes

suggesting that the reduction in costs might have improved efficiency. We also find a larger

reduction in the number of home health agencies in more competitive markets and that exiting

providers were more likely to provide high-intensity and high-cost care. Further, much of the

reduction in more competitive markets comes from the exit of such providers.




                                                29
       These results imply that to the extent that current health care cost variation (for example

in post-acute costs) was driven by competition under cost-based reimbursement and now the

separate post-acute prospective payment systems, then higher-powered payment systems such as

accountable care organizations and bundled payment that further reduce marginal payments

could lead to greater convergence in costs across markets.

Appendix
Appendix: Altruism Model
Although there is evidence that many not-for-profit health care organizations behave as profit

maximizing firms, we include a model that takes into account the altruistic behavior that may be

displayed by not-for-profit home health agencies. To account for this, we include the value the

firm gets from providing services to patients as a fraction of the value the consumers get,

                  , where B is the total benefit patients receive from home care (the consumer

surplus) and θ is a number between zero and one. To calculate the patient benefit, we integrate

over the utility of patients for receiving care:




Differentiating with respect to quality gives:




There are two components that make up the change in patient benefit from a change in quality,

the first part,             , is the utility gained from all the existing patients experiencing

increased quality, this is the inframarginal effect. The second part is a marginal effect from the

new patients an increase in quality draws in. This marginal effect is dependent only upon H type

customer utility, this is because the “switchers” have a strictly positive net increase in utility

from treatment while the marginal L type consumers have a utility increase of zero at the margin.

We add in the altruistic value of patient benefit that the home health firm receives, (6), into the

firm’s utility function:




                                                    46
With the first order condition for intensity allocation being:




We substitute equations (3) and (7) into (8) and set qi=q j to solve for optimum intensity q*. The

total differentiation of equation (8) that is used to estimate how intensity changes with the

number of firms in the market and with changes to marginal and average reimbursement

becomes:




We find that intensity of care increases with the number of firms only for certain θ:




                                                 47
If a firm is above a certain threshold altruism level the sign is negative. Otherwise for modest

levels of altruism we find the same result as for a profit maximizing firm. The threshold level of

altruism is:




For a profit maximizing firm, we found that intensity of care increased as the number of firms in

the market increased due to increased competition. Although this result applies to altruistic firms

up to the altruistic threshold, very altruistic firms are predicted to actually decrease quality as the

number of firms increases. In the profit maximizing case, we obtained the a positive relationship

due to the fact that when the number of firms increased, the demand for each firm decreases, this

lower demand increases marginal profits which makes it more profitable to increase intensity of

care in order to attract more patients. Altruistic firms a have a second effect coming into play.

Because they value the patient benefit, lower demand from an increase in firms also lowers the

marginal patient benefit for high intensity of care giving the hospital less incentive to increase

intensity of care. At high enough levels of altruism, this lowered patient benefit effect

overshadows the increased marginal profit effect and firms actually decrease quality.

Our estimates of how intensity of care changes with the marginal and average reimbursement

remain unchanged in sign, as payments increase (decrease) intensity of care increases

(decreases).

Introducing the parameter, θ, lets us analyze the effect of changes in the level of altruism have on

intensity:




                                                  48
Although quality responsiveness to market competition is lowered by altruism, overall altruism

leads to higher quality due to the value firms place on patient wellbeing. Altruistic firms are

willing to forgo profits in order to provide higher quality and provide higher levels of

equilibrium quality than do profit maximizing firms with the same level of reimbursement.

Including altruism in our analysis leads to the same results as profit maximizing firms except for

at high levels of altruism. Because there is evidence that not-for-profit hospitals behave similarly

to for-profit hospitals, we use the simpler profit maximizing model.
