Model Structure and the Combined Welfare and Trade Effects of China’s Trade Related Policies

NBER Working Paper No. 15363
September 2009
JEL No. F1

                                             ABSTRACT

Because China’s economic structure is different from that in OECD countries, using conventional
neo-classical competitive trade models to analyze the welfare and trade impacts of trade related policy
change can be misleading. In particular, both the exchange rate regime and output and pricing policies
of state owned enterprises (SOE’s) will have effects on trade and welfare which differ from a classical
competitive model. This paper present a numerical model that captures the combined and interactive
effects of three policy elements in prototype form of tariffs, policy towards SOEs in the industrial
sector, and an exchange rate regime supporting large trade surpluses and additions to foreign reserves.
The model has non neutral monetary features, endogenous trade imbalances and average product pricing
of labor in goods. We do not claim it to be fully representative of modern China, but it does go some
way beyond simple competitive models used elsewhere and points to different conclusions of policy
impact. We calibrate our model to 2006 data, and then evaluate the impacts both singly and in combination
of: tariff liberalization, a move to more freely floating exchange rates, and SOE enterprise reform.
Results show that large differences in policy impacts relative to a classical competitive model. SOE
reform and a freely floating Chinese exchange rate have more impact on China’s welfare than tariff
liberalization. Policies of RMB appreciation and increasing China’s money stock reduce China’s trade
surplus. In the traditional competitive model, trade liberalization impacts both imports and exports,
while in our central case model, with endogenously determined trade surplus, trade liberalization has
little effect on exports. Most of the policy impact is on imports and the trade surplus. SOE reform
of China’s manufacturing sector significantly decreases production of China’s manufacturing sector
and increases production in China’s other sectors.

1. Introduction
  The center piece of Western neo-classical economic analysis is the Arrow-Debreu
competitive equilibrium model. It has been used in numerical form to describe both Western
and Chinese economies despite China’s economy being quite different in structure. Notably
China is in transition from a central-planned economy to a market economy, and other
elements complicate analysis, such as SOEs , and the exchange rate regime. Here, we present a
calibrated numerical model of China with SOE production, non neutral monetary and exchange
rate structure, and analyze the impacts of different liberalization policies, not only tariff
liberalization, but also RMB appreciation and SOE reform, either singly or in combination.
Our conclusion is that using simple competitive trade models with ad-valorem tariff equivalent
representation of all policies can be misleading.


   In the model, for the manufacturing SOE sector, we use a version of the managerial
control model of SOEs in Whalley & Zhang(2006) and Fosse & Raimondos-Møller(2009), in
which SOEs are assumed to be under managerial control with managers politically appointed.
Capital is assumed allocated freely to the SOE by credit rationing with a state bank
recapitalization mechanism covering any losses. We assume that enterprise managers
maximize personal gain from networking and political connections, and enterprise managers
maximize enterprise size rather than profits. The implication is that if managers hire labour in a
competitive labour market (a strong but greatly simplifying assumption for the Chinese case)
and pay labour its going wage, they will hire labour up to the point that the product price
equals the average value product of labour, rather than the marginal value product as in the
competitive case. We also add monetary structure into a trade model, as in Wang &
Whalley(2007), to reflect a managed Chinese exchange rate and monetary regime with a peg
and RMB inconvertibility. Monetary policy is thus non accommodative to the chosen fixed
exchange rate, and this implies either excess supply of foreign exchange which the Central
Bank accommodates as additions to reserves .


   We calibrate this model to 2006 base year data for two countries, China and the Rest of the
World. Our base case includes 2006 trade, production, and consumption and constructed


                                                3
money supply data. We then use the calibrated model to simulate the impacts of the 3 types of
policy change on welfare, trade flows, the trade surplus and production. These cover tariff
liberalization, exchange rate and monetary policy (Renminbi appreciation and /or increases in
the money stock), and SOE reform.


     Results show that tariff liberalization increases imports but has no impact on exports and
is welfare improving as the surplus falls. The results for RMB appreciation and monetary
policy have effects on exports but are small and reduce trade imbalances and are also welfare
improving.SOE reform only has significant trade and welfare impacts in the absence of
monetary non neutralities.


     Most of the available literature on Chinese SOEs uses econometric models with no
explicit trade and monetary structure, assessing the performance, profitability and labor hiring
(examples are Bigsten, Liu, and Zhang (2002), Cull and Xu (2003), and Liu (2002)). And
while there is literature analyzing interactions between trade structure and monetary policy,
they use tariff equivalents and analyze trade policy changes either ignoring monetary
structure(such as IMF(2005), Wilenbockel(2006)), or trade impacts of exchange rate changes
in structures where trade pattern changes do not follow from a trade model (such as
Park(2005),Kamada &Takagawa(2005),Marquez & Schindler(2006)).

2. A Prototype Model Capturing Some Key Chinese Features

   We analyze the potential impacts of different liberalization policies, tariff liberalization,
RMB appreciation, and SOE reform, using a calibrated numerical general equilibrium model of
China with SOE production and monetary structure. For the SOE manufacturing sector, we use
the managerial control model of SOEs used in Whalley & Zhang(2006) and Fosse &
Raimondos-Møller(2009). In this SOEs are assumed to be under managerial control with
managers politically appointed. Capital is assumed allocated to the SOE by credit rationing,
with an assumed state bank recapitalization mechanism which covers any losses. In effect,
capital is freely allocated. This more accurately reflects China in the 1980’s and early 1990’s
more so than today, but is analytically tractable and significant elements of this structure
remain. We assume that enterprise managers maximize personal gain from networking and
political connections and hence that enterprise managers maximize enterprise size rather than
profits. The implication is that if managers hire labour in a competitive labour market (a strong
simplifying assumption) and pay labour its going wage, they will hire labour up to the point
that the product price equals the average value product of labour, rather than the marginal
value product as in the competitive case.


   On the monetary side we follow Wang & Whalley (2007), and specify a simple monetary
regime in a model with monetary non-neutralities. In this, monetary policy is non
accommodative to the chosen fixed exchange rate, and given the current Renminbi peg this
implies excess supply of foreign exchange which the Central Bank simply accumulates as
reserves.


    More formally, the model incorporates 2 countries (China and ROW) indexed by j or k
( j = 1, 2 , k = 1, 2 ) to denote country ,and 2 traded goods (manufactures and other indexed
i ( i = 1, 2 ) to denotes goods. Goods across countries are heterogeneous (the Armington
assumption).




                                               5
     For each good i produced in country k , we define the seller’s price (net of tariff) as Pi k ,

and allow each country j to impose tariffs at rate t kji ( country j ’s tariff on good i imported

from country k ) on each imported good. Tariffs are set to zero for exports. Internal (gross of
tariff ) prices for good i produced in country k are thus

                   Pjik = [1 + t kji ]Pi k                                                 (1)

   On the production side in country 1(China), we consider a SOE manufacturing sector and a
competitive other sector. Both sectors have decreasing returns production functions, with labor
as the variable input. Capital used by the SOEs is fixed to reflect capital allocated to this sector
by rationed credit and is unpriced with average product pricing of labor. Capital used in the
other sector receives a rental return since it is immobile intersectorally.
     In the SOE sector, the production function is

                  YM1 = ϕ M1 ( L1M )α M
                                        1
                                                                                            (2)


   where YM1 is manufacturing output in country 1, L1M is labour used in manufacturing, ϕ M1 is

a units term(scalar parameter), and α M1 < 1 is the production exponent.


   The use of capital by the SOE is captured by a fixed factor. Capital is assumed to be
allocated via centralized credit allocation through the state banking system, but recipients of
loans (and hence capital) expect that any servicing costs of the loan will be covered by state
bank recapitalization of losses. We assume managers of the enterprise are politically appointed
and are concerned with the size of their personal network rather than profits, and networking
benefits are collinear with the size of the enterprise they manage. In this simple model with a
single SOE, labour is paid its average value product since managers maximize enterprise size
measured by output YM1 subject to the enterprise budget constraint.
 Since capital is effectively unpriced, this implies that
                    PM1 YM1 = w1M L1M + RM1                                                (3)

                                PM1 YM1 − RM1
  that is             w1M =                                                                (4)
                                     L1M



                                                 6
    where RM1 is any surplus required to be transferred to the state by the SOE. This, in turn,
implies that labour receive its average value product plus its share of required surplus rather
than its marginal product, and that implies that conditions for Pareto efficiency are violated.
      In the other sector, the production function is

                                YO1 = ϕO1 ( L1O )αO
                                                   1
                                                                                              (5)

    Where YO1 is output in the other sector in country 1, L1O is labour used in the other sector,

ϕO1 is a units term(scalar parameter), and α O1 < 1 is the production exponent. We assume that in
this sector labour is paid its marginal product, i.e. the wage rate is
                 ∂YO1
     wO1 = PO1        = ϕO1 PO1α O1 ( L1O )αO −1
                                            1
                                                                                              (6)
                 ∂LO
                   1



  and the residual return ( PO1YO1 − wO1 L1O ) accrues as rent to already invested capital.
    In country 2 (rest of the world), the production functions are:

     Yi 2 = ϕi2 ( L2i )αi ( i = M , O )
                        2
                                                                                              (7)

    The Yi 2 are manufacturing output and other sector output in country 2, L2i are labour used

in manufacturing sector and other sector, ϕi2 are units terms (scalar parameters), and α i2 < 1 is
the production exponent. We assume that in both sectors labour is paid its marginal product,
i.e. the wage rate is
               ∂Yi 2
   w2 = Pi 2         = ϕi2 Pi 2α i2 ( L2i )αi −1       ( i = M ,O )
                                            2
                                                                                              (8)
               ∂Li2




   On the demand side of the model, final demands for commodities in country 1 and country
2 as modeled are derived from maximization of CES nested utility functions defined over
composites of similar domestically produced and imported goods subject to country budget
constraints. This Armington structure allows us to directly incorporate substitution elasticity
parameters into the model as the substitution elasticity between similar domestic and imported
goods which can then be directly related to import demand elasticities.

   Unlike in a conventional trade model, we incorporate endogenously determined trade
surpluses and deficits directly into the two country budget constraints. To do this we use a



                                                                  7
simple monetized extension to a pure barter trade model with a transactions demand for money
and unitary velocity of circulation. We assume that the surplus country is predetermined as
country 1 (China) and the deficit country as country 2 (the rest of the world), and Country 1
fixes its exchange rate and has non-accommodative monetary policy. Country 2 is assumed to
fix its money stock to accommodate its trade deficit. This implies that jointly countries 1 and 2
set relative money stocks consistent with the fixed country 1 exchange rate and trade surplus,
but monetary non neutralities result. A change in the fixed exchange rate changes both trade
flows and country 1’s surplus.
  Maximizing country 1’s utility yields demands from the solution to a 2 stage budgeting
problem, ie:

 max U1{C1 ( Di11 , Di12 )}                                                               (9)

the demand in country 1 for good i produced in country 1 (2), and e is the fixed exchange
rate, S is the trade surplus of country 1, TR1 is the tariff revenue in country 1 , and R1 are
transfers to the state by the SOE in country 1. These are assumed recycled to consumers as
lump sum transfers.
  Country 2’s demands are similarly derived by maximizing a nested CES utility function
defined over CES composites of imported goods from country 1 and domestically produced
goods, i.e.

      Adding demand supply equalities in goods gives

       and factor market clearing conditions

             L2M + L2O = L2
      In equilibrium, factor prices are equalized across the two sectors in country 2, and wage
rates are equalized across the two sectors in each country, i.e.
           w1A = w1M                                                                 (18)

           wA2 = wM2
  and sellers commodity prices clear goods markets. These prices are consistent with zero
profit conditions in country 2 and SOE pricing the determination of rent in the other section in
country 1.

     We can build a model admissible data set for 2006 for this structure which we use to
determine model parameters through calibration and then perform counterfactual experiments
for changes in different policy elements. Alternative equilibria can easily be computed for this
system.




                                                                 9
3. Data and Model Calibration
     We build a model compatible benchmark general equilibrium data set which we use in
calibration. We use a base year of 2006 . The two countries in our simulations are China and
the Rest of the World. Our base case data includes 2006 trade, production, consumption and
country money supply data constructed to equal the value of transactions assuming unitary
velocity.


      In the model, for simplicity, we treat the entire manufacturing sector as a single SOE.
This is a strong assumption which ignores China’s growing private manufacturing sector and
the role of inward FDI flows. It is adopted as a simplification for purposes of tractability. The
whole Chinese manufacturing sector is also treated as producing a single product. We define
physical units for both manufacturing and the other sector product to be related to value
observations from national accounts following the Harberger(1962) and Shoven &
Whalley(1972) units convention that in the initial benchmark equilibrium data world prices are
unity, i.e. PM1 = PM2 = PO1 = PO2 = 1 , and factor prices are unity, i.e. w1M = wM2 = wO1 = wO2 = 1 .


   To convert Chinese data into units consistent with the ROW data in $, we construct an
artificial Chinese currency unit, RMB * , which we set as RMB* = 7.972 RMB , which is the
exchange rate of the US dollar to Renminbi in 2006. This implies that 1 unit of RMB * equals
1 US dollar. This convention is adopted so that in calibration all equilibrium prices will be
unity for both Chinese and ROW goods and factors.


       In Table 1 ,GDP data is from the World Bank’s WDI database and trade data is taken
from the UNCOMTRADE database. F.o.b. exports values as reported by exporting countries
are used, China’s exports and imports are taken as imports and exports by the rest of the world
from and to China. These trade data , in turn, imply China’s trade surplus for 2006. Labor input
data is from China’s NBS data and from the U.S. Bureau of Labor of Statistics. We assume the
labor input of ROW is 4 times that of U.S. on the basis that U.S. GDP is roughly ¼ of world
GDP China. Tariff data is from the WTO Statistical Database, and for 2006, the average tariff
on China’s manufactured import was 9% , and on other goods was 15.8%.

         Elasticities in the central case model specification are set as follows. There are no
available estimates of elasticities for China either on the demand or production sides. We set
the substitution elasticities in demands between domestic and imported commodities at 1 in
both countries. We later use senstitivity analysis to change this value. The substitution
elasticities between two domestic goods in each country we set at 0.5 and the substitution
elasticities between the two imported goods in each country are also set at 0.5. For China’s
SOE manufacturing sector, first order conditions imply no value directly for the exponent in
the production function. We assume a value of α M1 = 0.4 ,which we loosely justify as the share
of labor in total manufacturing output from the NBS (China’s National Bureau of Statistics)
data, which in the competitive (rather than the SOE ) case. This yields a value of ϕ M1 from
equation (2). We also perform sensitivity analysis around this setting.

4. Numerical Analysis of Different Liberalization Policies in China

   We have used our calibrated model to simulate the impacts of various forms of economic
liberalization policies on welfare, trade flows, and the trade surplus and on production. The
liberalization policies include tariff elimination, a freely floating exchange rate, and SOE
reform. Results are presented in Table 3 to Table 6. We reports impacts on welfare using
Hicksian money metric measures of welfare change. We calculate these as % of GDP.

     These results suggest that SOE reform and a freely floating exchange rate have more
impact on China’s welfare than tariff liberalization using 2006 data. RMB appreciation and an
increase in China’s money stock reduces China’s trade surplus as would be expected. But
impacts on exports are small. Most of the impact is on imports. For trade flows, in the
traditional competitive model, trade liberalization influences both imports and exports, while in
our model, with an endogenously determined trade surplus, tariff liberalization has no effect on
exports. Impacts instead are on imports and the trade surplus. SOE reform of China’s
manufacturing sector significantly decreases the production of China’s manufacturing sector
and increases the production of China’s other sectors.

   In Table 3, we use our central model specification to analyze the impacts of three different
policy elements in liberalization. For tariff elimination, we eliminate the tariff on both China’s
manufacturing and other sectors. In exchange rate policy, we freely float China’s exchange rate
and the trade surplus becomes zero. For SOE reform, we assume China’s manufacturing sector
changes from SOEs to competitive enterprises.

     The first column of Table 3 reports the impacts of China’s different economic
liberalization policies on welfare using Hicksian CV measures. Welfare impacts using
Hicksian EVs are similar and so in the tables, we only report the results for CVs. The most
effective policy to improve China’s welfare is SOE reform, the welfare impact on China is
12.212% of GDP, freely floating exchange is also effective with a welfare impact of 11.093%
of GDP, but for tariff elimination the welfare impact on China is only 3.124% of GDP.




                                               13
   In the second column of Table 3, we report the impacts of different Chinese liberalization
policies on trade flows. With a freely floating exchange rate, China’s imports increase in value
terms by around 22%. The increase of the imports of manufacturing and other sectors are
similar at nearly 22%. For tariff elimination, China’s imports increase in value terms by over
10%. Manufacturing imports increase by 9.885% and the other sector imports increase by
12.937%. For SOE reform, the impact on China’s imports is very small, only -0.051%. In this
model specification, the impact of all liberalizations on exports is very small. The
endogenously determined trade surplus acts as a buffer adjusting to the policy change so that
imports change sharply with little change in exports.

   In the third column of Table 3, we report the impacts of alternative Chinese liberalization
policies on production. SOE reform decreases production in China’s manufacturing sector by
over 16% in quantity terms, and increases the production of China’s other sectors by 29% in
quantity terms. Under a freely floating exchange rate, the production of China’s manufacturing
sector decreases by 3% in quantity terms, and the production of China’s other sectors increases
by 6%. Tariff elimination has little effect on China’s production since exports do not respond.

   In Table 4 we present results from the three different forms of liberalization using three
different models: the model with both SOE pricing and non-neutral money as used for Table 3,
a model with only SOE pricing (neutral money) and a classical competitive model with neither
of these features. Our purpose is to compare the welfare, trade and production impacts of
alternative liberalizations across models to gauge how important elements of Chinese
economic structure are for policy evaluation.


  We see large difference among the results form these three models. For tariff elimination, in
the competitive model, China’s welfare decreases by -1.002% of GDP due to an adverse term
of trade effect. Adding SOE pricing and keeping money neutral increases the negative impact
on China’s welfare to -1.581% as the terms of trade effects intensify. But in the model with
SOE pricing and non-neutral money, China’s welfare increases by 3.124% of GDP. In this
model, tariff elimination has little effect on exports, since most of the impact is directed to the
surplus, while in competitive model and model with only SOE pricing, the effects of tariff
elimination on imports and exports are similar. For SOE reform, the non-neutral money model
shows a welfare gain of 12.212% of GDP and the neutral money model shows an even higher
welfare gain of 15.825% of GDP. The latter model results show that SOE reform has a
significant effect on China’s imports (41.580%) and exports (31.561%).

     Table 5 then reports more detailed analyses of alternative liberalization impacts using our central
case model. In the trade policy component, we first eliminate only tariffs on manufactures, and then
eliminate only other sector tariffs. In monetary policy, we first consider RMB appreciation of 5%,10%
respectively with a fixed money stock in both China and the Rest of the World, then we fix the RMB
exchange rate and increase the money stock in China by 5% and 10% respectively.


   Results in Table 5 show that monetary policy again seemingly has more impact than tariff
liberalization on China’s welfare , trade and production, while Renminbi appreciation and increasing
monetary stock have similar impacts. With RMB appreciation of 5% and 10%, China’s welfare gains
are 4.215% and 8.039% of GDP respectively, while with an increase in China’s money stock of
5%,10%, China’s welfare gains are 4.224%, 8.110% of GDP respectively, and elimination only of
China’s manufacturing tariffs leads to China’s welfare gains of 1.986% of GDP. Elimination of only
other sector tariffs leads to Chinese welfare gains by 1.129% of GDP. In the base model; tariff
liberalization and monetary policy have little impact on exports. The largest impact is on imports and
the surplus. With RMB appreciation of 5% and 10%, China’s imports increase by 8.283%, 17.487%
respectively, with increase in China’s monetary stock by 5%,10%, China’s imports increase by
7.869%, 15.738% respectively, and elimination only of China’s manufacturing tariffs leads to a
Chinese import increase of 6.756%. Elimination only of other sector tariffs leads to a Chinese import
increase of 3.613%. Trade policy has little effect on production, while under Renminbi appreciation
and an increase in China’s monetary stock China’s manufacturing production decreases and China’s
other sector production increases.

    Three parameters in the model are crucial for these results. One is the top level trade elasticities; a
second is the bottom level trade elasticities, the third is α M1 in the production function of China’s SOE
manufacturing sector. We thus perform sensitivity analyses on the results in Table 3 by varying these
three parameters.

  Table 6 provides the results. The welfare effect of tariff elimination is very sensitive to the top level
elasticities used, while changing the bottom level trade elasticities has little impact on welfare effects
of tariff elimination. With varying α M1 the welfare impacts of trade elimination and freely floating

exchange rates change greatly. When the α M1 changes from 0.4 to 0.75, the welfare impacts of tariff
elimination changes from 3.124% to 11.979% . The welfare impact of freely floating exchange rate
changes from 11.093% to 17.386% ,the welfare effect of SOE reform changes from 12.212% to
14.630%.But while results are elasticity dependent, the theme of results that departures from the
classical competitive model matters greatly for results remains.

5. Conclusions

     In this paper, we present numerical general equilibrium models of China with SOE behavior and
non-neutral monetary structure that capture in a simplified form features of Chinese economic
structure missing in conventional competitive models. We calibrate these models to 2006 data , and
using the calibrated parameters, we analyze the impacts of three different liberalization policies on
welfare and trade flows: tariff liberalization, a freely floating RMB exchange rate, and SOE reform.
We note that China’s economy is quite different from a typical OECD market economy, and so it is
important to assess how far the competitive model now widely used in numerical simulation work on
China can be misleading.

   In our model, for the manufacturing SOE sector, we use the managerial control model of SOEs in
Whalley & Zhang(2006) and Fosse & Raimondos-Møller(2009).In this SOEs are assumed to be under
managerial control with managers politically appointed. Capital is assumed allocated freely to the SOE
by state bank credit rationing with a recapitalization mechanism covering losses. We assume that
enterprise managers seek to maximize personal gain from networking and political connections. We
thus assume that enterprise managers seek to maximize enterprise size rather than profits. We add non-
neutral monetary structure into our trade mode as in Wang & Whalley(2007), to reflect the actual
Chinese exchange rate and monetary regime. In this model monetary policy is non accommodative to
the chosen fixed exchange rate, and at 2006 exchange rates this implies excess supply of foreign
exchange and reserve accumulation.

     Counterfactual model results show that large differences in policy impacts relative to a classical
competitive model, including differences of sign. SOE reform and a freely floating Chinese exchange
rate are more effective policies for improving China’s welfare than tariff liberalization. Policies of
RMB appreciation and increasing China’s money stock reduce China’s trade surplus. In the
traditional competitive model, trade liberalization impacts both imports and exports, while in our
central case model, with an endogenously determined trade surplus, trade liberalization has little effect
on exports. Most of the impact is on imports and the trade surplus. SOE reform of China’s
manufacturing sector significantly decreases production of China’s manufacturing sector and increases
production in China’s other sectors.
