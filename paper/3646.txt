                      WHY ARE PRICES STICKY?
           PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM AN INTERVIEW STUDY


                            ABSTRACT

    This paper reports preliminary results from a large research

project on business pricing which is currently underway.    The

idea is to use interviews with actual price setters to assess the

validity of a dozen theories of price stickiness.   The rather

unorthodox (for economists) methodology is defended; the research

design is described briefly; and a few results based on the first
72 interviews (out of a projected 200) are presented.    This

sample suggests that the median firm changes its price annually
and that price adjustments typically lag 3-4 months behind shocks

to demand or cost.

       Those of us who teach Keynesian economics——an increasing

number these days, it seems——attach great importance to the
phenomenon of wage and/or price "stickiness.' It explains, for

example, why recessions cure themselves only slowly and why
changes   in the money supply have real effects. In   fact, Keynesian
economics   is sometimes characterized as the economics of nominal

rigidities; the theoretical link from aggregate demand to

employment, say, is hard to forge without them. Yet, more than a

half-century after Keynes published The General Theory,     the
phenomenon itself remains poorly understood. Just why are wages
or prices sticky?

       It is not that economists have ignored these questions. One

could literally fill many volumes with good empirical studies of

wage and price stickiness, and many more with clever theories
purporting to explain these phenomena. Yet, despite all this

work, the range of admissible theories is wider than ever, and
new theories continue to crop up faster than old ones are

rejected. (The study I am about to describe, for example, tests
12 theories; and my list is not exhaustive.) This lack of

scientific progress makes one wonder about the basic research

strategy that economists have been pursuing. Is there a better

way?



       In Section I, I argue   that traditional research strategies
may be unpromising vehicles for learning about why prices are
sticky; the time may have come to entertain new arid unorthodox

approaches. Section II defends the notion that interviews, in
                                1
particular, can be a useful research tool in this area. Sections
III and IV then, respectively, describe the design of and

summarize some preliminary findings from a large—scale interview

study currently underway at Princeton. This paper is very much a

progress report. Since the interviewing still has 9—12 months to

go, the information reported in Section IV is but a fragment of
what will ultimately be available. But it is a fascinating

fragment, I think.


       I. WHY INTERVIEWS?

       The canonical, if infrequently followed, program of
scientific research in economics is to (a) develop a theory of

some phenomenon,   (b) formulate it in econometric   tens,   and then

(c)   test it with actual data. The theory is then either rejected

or provisionally accepted, that is, allowed to   suniv    to the

next test.

       Unfortunately, this standard program has been singularly
unsuccessful in the area of wage/price stickiness. Most

economists would, I think, agree that we know next to nothing

about which of several dozen theories of wage—price stickiness

are valid and which are not. We might have expected statistical

tests to have weeded out the weaker theories by now, especially

since many of them have been around a long time. But, in fact,

the survivorship rate rivals that of congressional elections.

Why?
       Part of the reason, no doubt, is that economists are fonder

of building theories than of testing them. But I think the main

reason is that most of the theories are empty in the following
                                  2
    specific sense: Either they involve unobservable variables in an
    essential way, or they carry no real implications other than that

    prices are "sluggish" in some unmeasurable sense, or both. This
    makes econometric modeling a blunt——perhaps even useless-—

    investigative tool. Let me illustrate.
         To begin with, think about what we mean when we say that a

    theory predicts that prices are "sticky": Often nothing more than
    that prices adjust less rapidly than Walrasian market—clearing

    prices. But since equilibrium price movements often go

    unmeasured,1 it is hard to know whether actual prices are moving

    faster or slower than this norm. More important, all the theories

    share exactly the same prediction: that prices are "sticky" in

    this sense. So how are we to discriminate among them? It seems

    difficult even to imagine what a decisive test would look like,
    much less to carry one out.

         A natural idea is to use each theory to derive other,

    auxiliary predictions, and then test these. Unfortunately, often
    there are no such predictions——or at least none that can be

    checked against actual data. One reason is that many of the

    theories are based on variables that are unobservable either in

    principle or in practice.
         As an example of the former, consider the theory that firms

    hesitate to cut   prices   because they fear that customers will

    interpret   a price cut   as signal that quality has been reduced--

    when, in fact, there has been no cuality reduction (Stiglitz,

    1987). Clearly, the theory is predicated on the existence of
•




         1. Enough auxiliary assumptions will make them measurable,
    at least in principle. But then we are testing a complex,
    composite hypothesis.
                                        3
unobservable quality differences for, if consumers could observe

quality readily, price would not play a signalling role.
    As an example of the latter, consider the so—called menu
cost theory (Mankiw, 1985). In principle, fixed costs of changing

prices can be observed and measured. In practice, such costs take

disparate forms in different firms, and we have no data on their

magnitude. So the theory can be tested at best indirectly, at
worst not at all.2

     One might argue that theories that make identical

predictions are, in an operational sense, the same theory; so it
does not matter which theory is correct. In fact, however, it

does matter. It matters for the value of ecomomics as a

descriptive science; and it matters for the conduct of
macroeconomic policy because not all sources of price rigidity

open the door to welfare—improving policies. For example, an
increase in aggregate demand will probably raise social welfare

if a coordination failure is keeping the price level too high

(relative to the money stock, say). But the same policy might

lower social welfare if prices are rigid because of sizable real

costs of price adjustment.

     If it really matters which theory is correct, but

comventiomal modes of economic inquiry cannot ajudicate the

dispute, economic science would appear to be in deep trouble.

Fortumately, one other common characteristic of the theories




     2. For example, the menu coat theory predicts that a firm
will never make "small" price changes, which appears to be a
testable proposition. But does it rule out price increases of 1%
or 5% or 10%? Without measuring the menu costs, we cannot answer
this question.
                                4
suggests a way out: Virtually every theory of price rigidity
describes a chain of reasoning which allegedly leads the firm to

conclude that a change in price is inadvisable.

     That is what gave me the idea for an interview study. If

actual decisionmakers really think the way one of these theories

says, they ought to know that they do. If you ask them open—ended

questions like, "Why   don't you cut   your prices when sales
decline?", you may get shrugs or incoherent answers. But, if you
confront them with the chain of reasoning they actually follow,

they ought to recognize and agree with it. Conversely,      if they

explicitly deny the relevance or validity of a particular

argument, then it is probably not governing their behavior. At
least that is my methodological precept. If the true reasons for

price stickiness are buried deep in the subconscjousnesses of

price—setters, interviews will probably miss them.


     II. BUT AREN'T INTERVIEWS UNRELIABLE?

     Economists,   more so than other social scientists, are deeply

skeptical that you can learn much by asking people. We are
trained to study behavior by watching what people         (usually in
markets), not by listening to what they    y.
     There are valid grounds for this skepticism. For example,

critics will point out that subjects of interviews have no

incentive to respond truthfully or thoughtfully; so
economicus might refuse to cooperate or even give misleading
answers. If the respondent has reason to conceal the truth or
mislead the   interviewer, this objection is probably a show

stopper. So, for example, I would not try    to   learn about the
                                 5
extent of industrial collusion by interviewing suspected

colluders. But, in the case of-price stickiness, people have no

particular reason to conceal the truth.3 As long as people are
not pathological liars, interviews may elicit useful information.

     The thoughtfulness problem goes deeper. We all know the

billiard—ball   analogy: A good pool player makes excellent use of

the laws of physics without understanding them, and certainly

without being able to articulate them. For this reason, many
economists doubt that much can be learned by asking "economic

players" about how they play the game. But I believe that more

pointed questions, posed in plain English, can elicit useful
answers. For example, if you ask a skilled billiards player

whether he bases his shots on the principle that the angle of

incidence equals the angle of reflection, he will probably look

at you quizzically.   But, if you take him to the table and,

pointing to the proper angles, ask: "Do you try to make this

angle the same as that angle?", I imagine he would respond in the
affirmative.

     Legitimate questions can also be raised about the size and

representativeness of interview samples. Detailed case studies of
two or three companies can, at most, provide anecdotes, not

useful statistical information. And samples that are

unrepresentative   of the underlying population give no basis for

drawing inferences about population statistics. But these are
familiar problems, well known to any user of data. They are not



     3. To ensure that this was so, I abjured any questions about
collusion, oligopolistic interdependence, limit pricing, etc.--in
general, any question that might conjure up images of the U.S.
Department of Justice.
                                  6
reasons to reject interview evidence out of hand.

     As economists, we should evaluate the usefulness of the

interview method by posing the classic question: "Relative to

what?" Interviews may be problematic; I do not deny that. But

theory and econometrics have their limitations, too-—limitations
that are sometimes more severe than we like to admit.

     Theoretical deductions are often untested and/or based on

untested premises. Worse yet, either the conclusions or the

assumptions may be untestable. Econometric evidence is often

equivocal and/or subject to methodological dispute. On top of
this comes the litany of standard objections to time series

econometric evidence: Results are fragile due to small samples,

multicollinearity, and the suspected presence of unit roots;
there may have been "regime changes" during the sample period;

appropriate instruments are scarce or nonexistent; computers make
data mining too easy; and so on and on and on.

     The imperfect knowledge we can pick up from interviews and

questionnaires should therefore not be compared to some

epistemological   ideal, but to the imperfect knowledge that

nonexperimental   scientists can deduce theoretically or glean from

econometric studies. By this more reasonable standard of

evidence, data culled from interviews certainly looks

admissible——especially if viewed as a supplement to, rather than
a replacement for, more conventional modes of economic inquiry.



     III. TRE   RESEARR DESIGN
     Along with a team of Princeton graduate students, I have now
been in the business of interviewing executives about their
                                 7
pricing strategies since August   1988.   Let me briefly describe the

research strategy and some of the tactics.

     Designing the questionnaire: The first step, obviously, was

to decide which theories were to be tested and then to turn them

into questions that ordinary people can understand. This

selection process was not entirely objective; nor could it have

been. In scouring the intellectual waterfront, I excluded

theories that sounded silly, or that actually          silly, or that
seemed too complicated to be explained tersely in plain English.

These omissions were not particularly costly; they did not

disqualify any of the major competing theories. (The twelve
theories actually tested are described briefly in the next

section.)
     Translating the equations and diagrams into English proved
to be quite easy. My first stab at a questionnaire was tried out

on many "guinea pigs"——including economists, business people, and

a few scholars involved in survey research——and altered in

literally hundreds of ways. During this lengthy process of trial
and error, one of the theories from my original list of twelve

was dropped from consideration and one new one was added.4 But,

in general, the current version of the questionnaire bears a

striking resemblance to my original draft. Translating     from

technical journalese into English simply proved not to be very


     4. The omitted theory is of interest. Greenwald and Stiglitz
(1989) argued that prices vary less than quantities over business
cycles because risk—averse firms are more uncertain about the
consequences (for profits) of changing prices than about the
consequences of changing quantities. This idea made sense to me,
and I thought I could explain it in plain English. But several
failures convinced me that the interview method is simply not
capable of dealing with this particular theory. This illustrates
a general point: Not all theories are testable by interviews.

                                    be a good omen.
            However, one
                          important caveat should be
                                                        entered. Hot
      infrequently, a question must be

    economics well                                        understand  the

                                 paraphrase a question without
    its
         meaning. Thus                                            changing
                         professional pollsters will not
                                                            do.

      Second, and much more important, we have taken
                                                       great pains
 to ensure that the sample of firms is
                                        (a) large enough to
 generate a database suitable for serious statistical
                                                        analysis,
 (b) randomly selected, and (C)
                                 representative of the private,
 for-profit GNP. To my knowledge, this is the first time
                                                           anything
 like this has ever been attempted in an
                                          interview study. Since it
 is what makes the study unique, it is worth
                                              describing in some
 detail.

      We purchased a tape
                          listing firms with annual sales over $10
 million in the northeastern United
                                    States, an area which accounts
 for about 40—45% of U.S. GNP. From this
                                         sampling universe, we
eliminated government enterprises and
                                      non—profits on the grounds
that the theories we wanted to test were
                                         all about profit—seeking
firms; this left almost 25,000 firms. We then
                                              assigned a sampling
weight to each firm proportional to its value added7 and
                                                         drew a
random sample of 400 firms,
                             seeking to complete 200 interviews.
 (Remember, the estimated response rate was
                                            50%.)
      Notice that we excluded any
                                  company with annual sales under
$10 million, even though they employ
                                      nearly half the labor force.
Why? Because there are so many of them, and the
                                                 expense of
reaching any sizable portion would be prohibitive.
                                                    Clearly, an
optimal experimental design would balance the value of the
information obtained against the costs of
                                           obtaining it and would,
therefore, undersample very small companies.8 We

     IV. PRELIMINARY RESULTS

     The   interviewing is now in progress. Given the limited
clerical and interviewer resources at my disposal, we are

conducting them in eight waves of approximately 50 letters (25

interviews) each over    a   period of about 18 months. As of this

writing, the first three waves are nearly complete and we have

just begun the fourth.
     The results reported here are based on tabulations of the 72
interviews completed as of mid—November 1990. Even this partial

sample is probably the largest ever used in a study of this
nature; but it is still too small to permit much useful

disaggregation.   So I restrict my attention to national averages

in this paper. Once the full sample of 200 is available, however,

there will be a great deal of information about, e.g., how the

validity of different theories varies by industry.
     The questionnaire comes in two parts and usually takes about

45—60 minutes to administer. Part     A   gathers a variety of factual
information about each firm, while Part B inquires directly about

the theories.

     The factual data in Part A will eventually be used for

disaggregation,   in cross—tabulations, and as righthand variables

in regressions explaining the validity of the various theories. I

make little use of these data in this paper, but one issue is

important enough to deal with right now: Just how "sticky" are
                               13
prices in the U.S. econony?
     To find out, we ask each firm,    "How often do the prices of

your most important products change in a typical year?" So far,

the median response is once per year.9 The distribution       is:

         Frequency of price change
             (tines ner vear               Percent of conpanies

                   More   than 12                  10.1%
                   4.01   to 12                     4.3%
                   2.01   to 4                     10.1%
                   1.01   to 2                     20.3%
                   1.0                             37.7%
                   Less   than   1.0               17.4%

These results offer cheer for Keynesians who model prices as,

say, rigid for one period or more. I like to joke that in
macroeconomic theory we know that the length of "the period" is
one quarter. According to these data, less than 15% of the GNP is
repriced more frequently than quarterly, and fully 55% is
repriced no more often than once per year. If we had to pick a
single abstraction to represent the whole economy, annual price
review would appear to be the "right" model.

     From the point of view of macroeconomic theory,       frequency of

price change may not be quite the right question to ask, for it

depends as much on the frequency of shocks as on firms'      pricing
strategies.   We are more interested to know howlong price
adjustments lacy behind shocks to demand and cost. Table 1
summarizes the results from a series of questions of the form,
"How much time normally elapses after a significant ____________
before you    raise [reduce] your prices?" We inquire about four



     9. The mean is not a particularly meaningful statistic
because two firms responded "thousands of times." If these are
excluded, the mean was still 10 times per year, with a standard
deviation of 45.5.
                                14
events: an increase in demand, a decrease in demand, an increase

in cost, and a decrease in cost. The table shows that, while the

distributions are quite spread out, the mean lags cluster in the

3-4 month range.        There   is   precious little evidence that prices
increase faster than they decrease, and virtually none that firms

respond to cost shocks more quickly than to demand shocks. The

latter came as a surprise to me.

     Part B asks decisionmakers what they think about the

theories themselves. It is divided into twelve parts. We begin

each part by succinctly summarizing one of the theories and then

posing a question like, "How important is this in explaining the

speed of price adjustment in your company?"10 Respondents answer

freely   in their   own words, but interviewers are instructed to
code the responses on the following four—point scale:
                1   =   totally unimportant
                2 =     of minor importance
                3 = moderately important
                4 = very important
                N don't know or cannot answer
                    =

    This scale resembles the typical grading system used at
universities, but we should expect the "grades" to be more
compressed.   At the high end, no theory is ever going to score a

perfect 4.0. Indeed, a theory rated "very important" by half the

firms and "of minor importance" by the other half would be a fine

theory indeed. Thus I would interpret a score of 3.0 as quite

good, by no means the equivalent of a B. At the low end, a score
of 1.0 would mean that every firm           in   the   sample   dismissed the



     10. For many theories, there is a preliminary factual
question. For example, before we ask whether judging quality by
price deters price increases, we first ask whether the firm
thinks its customers actually do judge quality by price.

                         is not a grade of D, but a kind of
theory out of hand. This

super—F. Indeed, any score below 1.5 is a remarkably poor

performance.
      If the respondent says     a   particular idea is "totally

unimportant" to the speed of price adjustment, we ask no further

questions about that theory. Otherwise, we ask a variety of

followup questions——sometimes many, sometimes few——geared

specifically to each theory. In this interim report, I ignore
most of the followup questions and concentrate on the main

questions about the perceived validity of each theory. But one

group of followup questions merits a brief mention.
      For nine of the twelve theories, we included an "asymmetry"

question asking whether prices are more inflexible upward or
downward. The questions were posed differently for each theory,

and so defy any short tabulation or summary. With the Nixonian

preface "Trust me!," I will summarize the responses in two brief
statements: (1) We have so far found only very weak evidence for

asymmetry.     (2)   The balance of this evidence suggests that prices

are actually slicthtly stickier upward than downward. But this

question will clearly have to be revisited when more data are in.
       Table 2 summarizes the central results on the validity of

the   twelve   theories, as perceived by actual decisionziakers,

ranked in order of popularity. The second column names the

theories briefly, and sometimes cryptically. (Explanations

follow.) The third column records the mean score on the above-
mentioned four—point scale; remember that we expect most theories

to score in the 1.5—3.0 range. We can interpret a rating of 1 or
                                16
2 as meaning that the firm     rejects   the theory as an explanation
of price rigidity, and a rating of 3 or 4 as meaning that the

firm   accepts   it. So the fourth column gives the percentage of

respondents that rate the theory as 3 or higher——an indicator of
the fraction of the private, for—profit GNP to which this theory

applies)-1-   The two alternative ways of ranking the theories
agree closely. Ranked from best to worst by mean score, the
theories are:

       1. Atop the list is a theory cryptically     denoted delivery

lags/service. The idea,     which I attribute to Dennis Carlton

(1990),   is that price is but one of several elements that matter

to buyers. Rather than cut (raise) prices when demand is low

(high), firms might prefer to shorten (lengthen) deliver lags or

provide more (less) auxiliary services.       Canton   emphasized
delivery lags; but many of our respondents point to other aspects
of service. The mean score for this theory so far is a healthy

2.86. Seventy-six percent of the firms accept the premise, and

65% say it is an important factor in slowing down       price
adjustments.
       2. Coordination   failure: This very old idea has been revived

and formalized in recent New Keynesian theorizing by, among

others, Cooper and John (1988) and Ball and Romer (1987). The
notion is that firms might like    to.   raise or lower prices, but

hesitate to do so unless and until other firms move first. Once

other firms move, they follow quickly. The mean score for this




     11. Because sampling weights were proportional to value
added, no further weighting of the sample is required at this
time. 'Votes" from small firms and large firms count equally.
                                   17
theory of 2.85 and its "acceptance rate" of 66% are quite high
indeed.

        3. Cost—based pricing connotes another   very old Keynesian
idea.   This is the theory that prices are based on costs (of labor

and purchased materials) and do not rise until costs rise. When

combined with the notion that the prices of upstream firms become
the costs of downstream firms as cost increases percolate through
the input—output table (Gordon 1981, Blanchard 1983), this can
lead to substantial lags in price adjustment. Well over half the

firms in our sample so far rate this a moderately or very
important factor in explaining the speed of price adjustment; the
mean score is 2.72.
     4. Implicit contracts rounds out the top four. This phrase
connotes Okun's (1981) "invisible handshake" theory that firms

have    implicit understandings with their customers which proscribe

price increases when markets are tight. Though this theory
obtains an average score of 2.52, it elicits the most bimodal

responses of any. Sixty—one percent of the sample accepts the

premise that implicit contracts exist. Within this sector,

respondents generally think that such contracts are an important
source of price stickiness. The mean response among those not

responding "totally unimportant" is a stunning 3.42.
        5. Exolicit nominal contracts refers to the naive Keynesian

idea that written contracts prohibit price adjustments while they

remain in force. Most firms have such contracts, for at least

some of their products; but discounting appears to be common. Our

 rough estimate is that this is an important factor in price
 stickiness for only about 40% of the economy. The mean score
                                 18
(counting firms with no explicit contracts as l's) is 2.29.
     6.    A number   of theorists have suggested that firms incur

special costs of price adlustsent whenever they change prices.
Both menu costs and convex costs are lumped together under this

rubric,12 but followup questions distinguish between the two.
About 70% of all firms report that they have such costs. But

fewer than half think them an important factor in slowing down

price responses. The average score is 2.28.
     7.    According to a very old idea revived in the mid-1980s,
demand curves become less elastic when they shift in (Shapiro,

1988). Such procyclical behavior of elasticity would lead to

countercyclical markups which would, in turn, rigidify prices.
This is another case where the premise is often accepted (59% of

the time), but the idea is thought to be a significant source of

price rigidity in only 36% of the cases. The average score is

just below 2, which connotes minor importance.
     8. Pricinc points refers to a somewhat "non—economic" idea

advanced by Anil Kayshap (1987): that certain prices--such as

$19.95 for a shirt——are psychological barriers which firms are
reluctant to cross. This also scores 1.97 on average. Again, a
majority   of the firms   (53%)   accepts the premise; but only a third
think it explains much price stickiness.
     9. Inventories     refers to the theory that, when demand rises

(falls), firms draw down (build up) their inventories rather than
increase (decrease) prices (Blinder, 1982). Note that this

question is not asked of service companies, so the sample size so


     12. On the former, see Mankiw (1985); on the later, see
Rotemberg (1982).
                                19
far is only 33. Of these, however, fewer than a third think

inventories a significant factor in deterring price adjustments.

The average score is a low 1.72.

     10. Constant marcinal cost is shorthand   for the simple model

advanced by Robert Hall (1986): that prices are sticky because

both marginal costs and markups are constant over the business

cycle. Since its ratings are so poor——a mean score of only 1.56
and an acceptance rate of just l9%--I should explain how we posed

the question. First, we asked respondents how their "variable

costs of producing additional units" (our plain—English

translation of marginal cost) behave as output rises. Only 42% of

the sample reported that their MC was constant.13 The 58% who

said MC was rising (13% of the sample) or falling (45%) were
deemed to have automatically rated the theory as totally

unimportant. Among the minority of firms reporting constant

marginal cost, however, about 60% said that the constancy of MC
was totally unimportant or of minor importance in explaining
their speed of price adjustment.

     11. Hierarchies   is a code word for a "theory" not on my

original list of 12, for it does not come from the academic
literature. Rather, it was suggested to us by an executive of a

large corporation. The simple idea is that price changes are
slowed down by the difficulty of getting a large, hierarchical

organization to take action. Its low average score of 1.54 nay

appear unsurprising, since it should apply only to giant


      13. This includes those who said MC is constant except at
 certain discrete points. For example, a fast—food chain may have
 constant MC until it must open a new store to serve its expanding
 customer base, and then have constant MC thereafter.
                                20
 companies. But, even among firms with annual sales over $100

 million, its mean score is only 1.66.
     12. The worst theory, according to our
                                            practitioners, is
judging guality by price, a theory I have mentioned before. It

obtains a paltry mean score of 1.45 and an
                                           acceptance rate of
just 12%. Less than a quarter of the firms in the
                                                  Sample so far
think their customers would "interpret a price cut as a
                                                        signal
that the quality of the product has been reduced." In our

tabulations, we count the others as rating the theory "totally

unimportant." However, among the minority of firms whose
customers     judge quality by price, roughly 45% say it is a

moderately or  very important factor in discouraging price
increases. Thus this theory may be of some
                                            importance within     a
narrow sector of the economy.
     In summary,      it seems to me that the   theories divide
themselves    into   three groups. The top four listed above

distinguish themselves as especially promising and/or applicable
to the U.S. economy. The leading theory (by a slim
                                                   margin)-—
delivery lags/service-—has not received the attention it
deserves.     other three look to me decidedly Keynesian. Cost-
             The
based pricing is, of course, old—fashioned Keynesian stuff.
Coordination   failure is a major strain of New Keynesian

theorizing. And Okun's (1971) "invisible handshake" is by now

part of the Keynesian tradition.
     At the bottom of the list, we find four theories which

appear to be rejected by our respondents. Two of them have
enjoyed great popularity in the 1980s. If practitioners are to be

believed, marginal costs are constant in only a minority of
                               21
industries. And    judging   quality by price appears to be   neither a
common nor an important phenomenon.

     It is true that these results are based on only 36% of the

ultimate sample. But I will be surprised if the rankings change

dramatically as more data come in; 72 observations is sufficient
to answer most questions about national averages.-4 The payoff to

a large sample will come later, when I have enough data to answer
                                          of firms make
disaggregated questions like, "What kinds
'invisible handshakes' with their customers?" I will report

information   of   that sort at a later date.

 completed interviews. That ranking was similar to that reported
 here.
