Outsourcing at Will: Unjust Dismissal Doctrine and the
Growth of Temporary Help Employment

NBER Working Paper No. 7557
February 2000
JEL No. J21, K31

                                           ABSTRACT

       The U.S. temporary help services (THS) industry grew at 11 percent annually between 1979
– 1995, five times more rapidly than non-farm employment. Contemporaneously, courts in 46 states
adopted exceptions to the common law doctrine of employment at will that limit employers’
discretion to terminate workers and opened them to litigation. This paper assesses whether the
decline of employment at will and the growth of THS are causally related. To aid the analysis, the
paper considers a simple model of employment outsourcing, the primary implication of which is that
firms will respond to externally imposed firing costs by outsourcing positions requiring the least
firm-specific skills rather than those with the highest expected termination costs. The empirical
analysis indicates that one class of exception, the implied contractual right to ongoing employment,
led to 14 – 22 percent excess temporary help growth in adopting states. Unjust dismissal doctrines
did not significantly contribute to employment growth in other business service industries.
Temporary help employment is closely correlated with union penetration, with states experiencing
the least rapid decline in unionization undergoing substantially faster THS growth. The decline of
employment at will explains as much as 20 percent of the growth of THS between 1973 – 1995 and
accounts for 336,000 to 494,000 additional workers employed in THS on a daily basis as of 1999.

    Between 1979 and 1995, the temporary help supply (THS) industry grew at the extraordinary rate

of 11.2 percent annually – over five times more rapidly than U.S. non-farm employment – increasing

its daily head count from 435 thousand to 2.4 million workers. During these same years, what many

have termed a revolution in jurisprudence towards worker dismissal occurred as U.S. state courts

recognized exceptions to the common law doctrine of employment at will. That doctrine, which had

been recognized throughout the U.S. by 1953, held that employers and employees have unlimited

discretion to terminate their employment relationships at any time for any reason unless explicitly

contracted otherwise. The recognition of exceptions to employment at will by 46 state courts between

1973 and 1995 limited employers’ discretion to terminate workers and opened them to potentially

costly litigation.1 This paper assesses whether these contemporaneous phenomena – the erosion of

employment at will and the rapid growth of THS – are causally related. More generally, the paper

answers the question of whether changes to the legal environment surrounding worker dismissal are

in part responsible for the growth of ‘contingent’ work arrangements in the U.S. economy of which

Temporary Help is the most prominent example. The answer appears to be yes.

    The analysis proceeds as follows. Section 1 of the paper introduces the three classes of common

law exception to the at-will doctrine, evaluates their implications for THS and other ‘outsourced’

employment, and concludes that one exception in particular – the implied contractual right to

continued employment (‘Implied Contract’) – provides a compelling incentive for firms to utilize

temporary help workers. Section 2 considers a simple model of employment outsourcing in the

presence of positive firing costs, the primary implication of which is that employers are most likely

to respond to externally imposed firing costs by outsourcing positions requiring the least firm-

specific skills rather than positions with the highest expected termination costs. Section 3 describes

 Of course, employers’ power to terminate at will has not been absolute for some time. Major pieces of federal legislation
protect the employment rights of minorities, union members, persons over the age of 40, and persons with disabilities include
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the National Labor Relations Act, the Age Discrimination

the data and empirical strategy and Section 4 provides empirical results. Section 5 concludes.

    A key finding of the present analysis is that state courts’ adoption of the Implied Contract

doctrine has resulted in approximately 22 percent excess temporary help employment growth in

adopting states. In addition, states experiencing smaller declines in unionization saw substantially

greater THS growth. Unjust dismissal doctrines did not significantly contribute to employment

growth in other business service industries, however. In net, the results indicate that changes to the

employment at will doctrine explain as much as 20 percent of the growth of THS between 1973 and

1995 and account for 336 to 494 thousand additional workers employed in THS on a daily basis as of

1999.

    The present analysis is related to empirical work by Dertouzos and Karoly (1992) and Morriss

(1995) who explore the impacts of unjust dismissal doctrine on employment growth and employment

termination probabilities; to recent work evaluating the impacts of civil rights legislation on the

employment of the disabled (Acemoglu and Angrist, 1998), and minorities (Donohue and Heckman,

1991; Oyer and Schaefer, 1998a and 1998b); and to research on the impact of labor market flexibility

on labor force participation, employment and unemployment in the OECD (Di Tella and

MacCulloch, 1998; Lazear, 1980). Segal and Sullivan (1997a) provide a comprehensive discussion

of the growth of THS, Morriss (1995) offers a thorough review of case law impacting employment at

will, and Epstein (1984) presents the major legal and economic arguments supporting the at-will

doctrine. Lee (1996) and Segal and Sullivan (1997a) suggest a possible causal connection between

the growth of THS and the decline of employment at will but do not investigate the question

empirically. In independent contemporaneous work, Miles (forthcoming) explores the impact of

common law exceptions to employment at will on a variety of labor market aggregates and reports




in Employment Act of 1967, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1992.

results for temporary help employment that are largely consistent with those presented here.2

1. The decline of employment at will

     The employment at will doctrine was most famously articulated by the Tennessee Supreme Court

in 1884 which wrote:

          “Men must be left, without interference to buy and sell where they please, and to
          discharge or retain employees at-will for good cause or for no cause, or even for bad
          cause without thereby being guilty of an unlawful act per se.” (Payne v. Western &
          Atlantic Railroad, Tennessee 1884).

Though largely uncontroversial at the turn of the century (Morriss, 1994), the judicial consensus

behind the at-will doctrine eroded rapidly beginning with the 1967 publication of an extraordinarily

influential law review article by Lawrence Blades. Prior this time, only one state (California in 1959)

had recognized an exception to employment at will. But in the subsequent two decades, 44

additional states recognized exceptions as is shown in Figure 2 and documented in Table 1. By 1992,

46 of 50 states had amended the at-will doctrine, in 45 of these cases judicially and in one case

legislatively.3 The tenor of these judicial decisions is exemplified in a court opinion from the 1985

Texas case of Sabine Pilots, Inc. v. Hauck.

          Absolute employment at will is a relic of early industrial times, conjuring up visions
          of the sweat shops described by Charles Dickens and his contemporaries. The
          doctrine belongs in a museum, not in our law.”

     By the early 1990’s, state courts had recognized three common law exceptions to the at-will

relationship: breach of an implied contractual right to continued employment, terminations contrary

to public policy, and violations of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.4 For reasons



2
  Miles reports a significant impact of both the Implied Contract and Implied Covenant doctrines on temporary help employment,
although it is shown below that only the first of these correlations appears to be causal. Miles does not report the impact of
unionization on THS nor estimate to what extent the growth of THS is explained by unjust dismissal laws. Another significant
difference with the present paper is that Miles does not consider the substantive economic or legal reasons why firms outsource
employment nor why the Implied Contract doctrine apart from other common law exceptions is relevant to outsourcing.
3
  Montana is the one state that adopted a statute specifically defining a default employment contract other than employment at
will, the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act of 1987. Interestingly, this legislative action may have been a
response to a particularly broad incursion into the at-will doctrine by the Montana courts (cf., Krueger, 1991; Morriss, 1995).
4
  Dertouzos and Karoly (1992) make a further distinction between so-called ‘narrow’ and ‘broad’ public policy exceptions, i.e.,
those that are tightly tethered to a specific statute of public policy versus those that hinge only on an amorphous conception of the


                                                            3
discussed below, only the first of these exceptions is likely to be relevant to the outsourcing of

employment.

A. The Implied Contract Exception to employment at will

     A landmark decision in the recent erosion of employment at will is the 1980 case of Toussaint v.

Blue Cross & Blue Shield in which the Michigan Supreme Court held that an employer’s indirect

statements about the manner in which termination decisions are made can imply legally binding

employment contracts.5 In Toussaint, the plaintiff successfully sued for breach of contract by citing

an internal personnel policy handbook indicating that it was Blue Cross’ policy to terminate

employees only for just cause. Although Toussaint was unaware of the handbook when hired, the

court held that the handbook implied a binding contract. Courts in 23 other states issued similar

decisions over the next 5 years. An equally influential 1981 California case, Pugh v. See’s Candies,

further expanded the Implied Contract notion by finding that workers are entitled to ongoing

employment even in the absence of written or indirect statements if contractual rights are implied via

the context of the employment relationship. This context may include for example longevity of

service, a history of promotion or salary increases, general company policies as exemplified by

treatment of other employees, or typical industry practices. Cumulatively, these court decisions

generated substantial uncertainty surrounding termination, resulting in numerous cases where courts

found that employees held implied contractual employment rights that employers had clearly not

intended to offer.6

     Systematic data on the costs of unjust dismissal suits are sparse because fewer than 3 percent of



intent of public policy. In addition, Dertouzos and Karoly employ a second characterization according to whether the recognized
exceptions provide a tort-based remedy (as is common for the public policy exception and, less often, for the implied covenant
exception) or a contract remedy. Tort remedies may yield punitive and compensatory damages to the plaintiff whereas contract
remedies only provide redress for contractual losses (i.e., earnings lost net of outside opportunities). Although initial empirical
work for the present paper made use of the Dertouzos and Karoly taxonomy, the data disconfirmed its relevance for THS
employment and hence the results are not reported below.

  A defendant’s attorney interviewed for this research stated that the Implied Contract doctrine leaves open “the largest room for
creativity” on the part of plaintiffs’ attorneys because the definition of what constitutes an indirect or contextual statement of



                                                            4
these suits reach a jury and the vast majority settle (Jung, 1997). Among California Implied Contract

actions studied by Jung, plaintiffs prevailed in 52 percent of cases, with average and median

compensatory damages of $586,000 and $268,000 respectively. In addition to jury awards, legal fees

in the cases studied by Deroutzas et al. (1988) averaged $98,000 in cases where the defense prevailed

and $220,000 in cases where the plaintiff prevailed. Underscoring the fact that large transaction costs

are the norm, the average net award received by plaintiffs was only 48 percent of the money

changing hands.7

     Indirect costs may also be substantial. The threat of litigation will prompt forward looking

employers to take avoidance actions such as revising employment manuals, limiting the discretion of

managers to hire and fire, instigating bureaucratic procedures for documenting and terminating

poorly performing employees, and potentially retaining unproductive workers who would otherwise

be fired. These steps while potentially costly, are difficult to quantify.8 Additionally, since there are

no representative data available on the share of terminations leading to unjust dismissal suits, it is not

possible to compute a measure of expected direct employer cost.

B. Implications of the Implied Contract exception for temporary help
   employment

     There is substantial evidence that employers responded to the changing legal environment by

attempting to ‘contract around’ the Implied Contract exception. The Bureau of National Affairs

(1985) found that 63 percent of employers surveyed in the early 1980s had recently “removed or

changed wording in company publications to avoid any suggestion of an employment contract,” and

53 percent had “added wording to applications and handbooks specifying that employment may be




contractual rights is open to broad interpretation (personal communication with Barry Guryan, 01/14/2000).

  Figures from Jung (1997) and Dertouzos et al. (1988) Table 16 are inflated to 1999 dollars using the PCE deflator. Dertouzos et
al. do not provide disaggregated data and hence these figure apply to all unjust dismissal suits rather than just Implied Contract
suits. Both studies use California data, which is most frequently studied because of the state’s accessible electronic case
reporting system.
8
  Lewin (1987) reports that managers implicated by employee complaints of wrongful treatment may also suffer diminished
career advancement, even in instances where the complaint is ultimately unsuccessful.

terminated for any reason.”9 Anecdotal evidence also indicates that employers began adding

probationary periods to employment contracts, making explicit their unconditional right to terminate

workers during an initial term.

    In practice, however, the courts have made it difficult for employers to ‘contract around’ the risk

of Implied Contract suits. For example, courts have ruled that employers’ progressive discipline

policies – stipulating that workers will not be fired for poor performance without first receiving

successive warnings – demonstrate the intent of an implied contract of ongoing employment.

Similarly, courts have taken employers’ 401K and other retirement programs as evidence of an

expectation of long-term employment. And in 15 states that currently recognize the Implied Contract

exception, courts have held that signed disclaimers waiving implied contract rights do not, in fact,

nullify these rights (Walsh and Schwarz, 1996). Perhaps ironically, courts have also ruled that

probationary hiring periods can themselves create an Implied Contract once the probationary period

is complete.10

    These court decisions have not, however, extended to temporary help, which remains a relatively

‘safe’ alternative for employers wishing to avoid termination risks associated with the Implied

Contract exception. Because THS employment is by nature temporary, there is little in the policies or

business practices of THS employers that would likely be held by the courts to imply a contractual

right to ongoing employment. Nor is there any precedent for finding client firms in violation of

implied contracts for terminating workers on assignment through a THS firm (Lenz, 1997). Hence,

employers in states that have adopted the Implied Contract exception might be expected to face

greater incentive to ‘outsource’ employment to THS firms. I discuss this point in more detail below.11

C. Other exceptions to employment at will

     In addition to the Implied Contract exception, many state courts have recognized two other

exceptions to the at-will doctrine. The Public Policy exception, currently recognized by 41 states,

bars employers from terminating employees for reasons that would contravene a statutory public

policy. Essentially, this doctrine makes it illegal to retaliate against employees for upholding the law

or exercising their statutory rights, for example by attending jury duty, whistle-blowing, or refusing

to commit a fraudulent act. A second less widely recognized exception, the Implied Covenant of

Good Faith and Fair Dealing, bars employers from terminating employees to deprive them of earned

benefits, such as collecting an end-of-year sales bonus or a drawing a pension.12

     While the Public Policy and Good Faith doctrines may have important consequences for

employer conduct (cf., Dertouzos and Karoly, 1992; Morriss, 1996; Olson, 1997; Verkerke, 1995),

they have little relevance to outsourcing in general and THS employment in particular. The reason is

that violations of these doctrines are actionable regardless of the identity of the employer (whether

conventional firm or THS). Additionally, federal courts have ruled that staffing arrangements –

which include temporary help – cannot be used to shield companies from civil rights compliance.

Hence, there is little reason to believe that the Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions confer a

distinct legal advantage to THS firms.13

2. Does temporary help provide the ‘right’ workers? A model of outsourcing
   with positive firing costs.

     Although THS firms possess a distinct legal advantage in avoiding suits under the Implied

Contract exception, it is less obvious that they offer the ‘right’ workers for clients who wish to avoid




man, you get rid of those people fast. You don’t have to worry about anything legal. You just end the assignment.”
12
   In a handful of states, the Public Policy exception is construed more broadly to protect any action encouraged by public policy.
The Good Faith exception is also read more broadly in several states to bar all terminations that are in ‘bad faith.’
13
   The civil rights case of Amarnare v. Merrill Lynch (611 F. Supp. 344 S.D.N.Y. 1984, aff’d, 770 F.2d 157 2d Cir. 1985)
established the ‘no shielding’ precedent. While the common law exceptions to employment at will are distinct from civil rights
laws, the Amarnare precedent is likely to apply. Accordingly, a client firm could be held liable for instigating the termination of a
THS worker in violation of the Public Policy or Good Faith doctrines.


                                                            7
these suits. The modal litigant in an unjust dismissal suit has one to five years of tenure, is an

executive or middle manager, is over 40 years of age, and earns a median salary in excess of $40,000

(Dertouzos et al., 1988). By contrast, the modal temporary worker has less than one year of tenure, is

overwhelmingly likely to be employed below middle management, is slightly over 30 years of age,

and earns a median salary under $15,000.14 Hence, even if firms wished to ‘outsource’ employment

to reduce the risk of Implied Contract suits, it is not clear that they would use THS workers for this

purpose. The model in this section explores this question formally by analyzing which workers a

firm will choose to outsource when firing is costly.

A. Conceptual model

     The fact that most workers are hired directly rather than through temporary help firms suggests

that employers receive benefits by hiring directly that in most cases offset the cost savings from

outsourcing.15 While these benefits are not easily measured, the hypothesis explored here is that by

outsourcing employment, firms forgo productive specific capital investment that directly hired

workers would otherwise undertake. Given a tradeoff between minimizing firing costs and

encouraging specific capital investment, the model suggests that the relevant question for firms is not

simply ‘which workers sue’ but how costly it is to outsource them to avoid these suits. If this is

indeed the correct question, then temporary help appears to be a logical answer.

     Consider a two period model of employment where the first period consists of hiring and specific

capital investment and the second period of production. There are a large number of identical, risk

neutral workers who live for two periods and a large number of infinitely lived firms. In period 1,

workers and firms form matches and workers sink firm-specific skills investments (as in Becker,

1964) at cost c(s ) where c(⋅) is a convex, strictly increasing, continuously differentiable function



14
  Less senior workers also litigate. For example, Dertouzos et al. (1988) report that 18 percent of unjust dismissal plaintiffs had
under one year of tenure and 56 percent held positions below middle management. Data on the characteristics of THS workers
are from the February 1995 Current Population Survey Contingent Worker Supplement, inflated to 1999 dollars using the PCE.



                                                            8
with c(0) = 0 . Production and wages during this period are normalized to zero. At the close of the

first period, the worker-firm pair receives a mean zero match-specific productivity shock, η , which

can be thought of as realized match quality. For simplicity, I assume η has a uniform distribution,

η ~ U [− z, z ] .

     At the start of the second period, worker and firm engage in a Nash bargain over the wage, w ,

where the worker’s bargaining power is given by β ∈ (0,1) . If the firm and worker agree on a wage,

the worker produces output of Y = γ ⋅ s + η where γ ≥ 0 is the productivity of specific capital

investments for the job. If they fail to agree, the worker leaves the firm to receive an outside wage of

zero. Additionally, if the worker was hired directly, the firm pays a firing cost of φ > 0 to terminate

the position. If instead the worker was hired through THS, the firm pays no firing cost.

     Three things about this setup deserve comment. First, it is important to stress that φ represents a

deadweight loss or a payment to an outside party such as a law firm and hence is not subject to

Coasian compensation.16 Second, the sole difference between direct hires and THS workers is that

firms do not pay φ to terminate THS workers. While in reality THS arrangements entail other

transaction costs including a sizable wage markup, I abstract from these details to emphasize that

THS does not dominate direct hire even absent transactions costs.17 Third, I assume that specific

capital investments require unobservable worker effort and commitment and are therefore not

contractible. Hence, as in Hart and Moore (1990) and Prendergast (1992, 1993), firms will foster skill

investment by rewarding realized productivity rather than by sharing in up-front investment costs.

B. Wages, specific skill investment, and terminations

     Since γ ⋅ s is the return to firm-specific capital, it is not competitively priced and is subject to



15
   Under the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ broadest definition, 4.3 percent of U.S. workers were ‘contingent’ in February, 1999 and
6.3 percent of workers were independent contractors (BLS, 1999). THS workers were 2.4 percent of non-farm employment.
16
   Any firing cost that is subject to Coasian compensation would also be present in the wage bargain but would not appear in φ .




                                                           9
worker-firm bargaining. Nash bargaining and risk neutrality imply that the worker’s second period

wage at the current firm is w = β [γ ⋅ s + η + φ ] . Given this wage bargain, the firm will choose to

terminate the worker in period 2 rather than pay the wage if Y − w < −φ , realized productivity is less

than the cost of termination.

      Workers choose specific skill investment to maximize expected utility, which is the difference

between training cost and expected income:

(1)       max E (U ) = E ( w | w ≥ 0) ⋅ P ( w ≥ 0) − c( s ) .
             s



Using the uniform density to calculate expectations for η , the first order condition is:

                         βγ ( z + γ ⋅ s * + φ )
(2)       c ′( s * ) =
                                  2z

which will have a solution at s * ≥ 0 .18 Worker skill investment is increasing in both the productivity

of specific capital, γ , and in the worker’s bargaining power. Centrally for purposes of the model,

worker skill investment depends positively on the firing cost. Because firing costs reduce workers’

odds of termination in the second period, they make larger specific skill investments when φ is

higher.19

C. Direct hire versus temporary help

      Consider a case where a firm must select between direct hiring with firing cost φ > 0 (set by the

legal regime) and temporary help where φ = 0 . Expected profitability as a function of φ is:

                           ( z + γ ⋅ s (φ ) + φ ) é (1 − β )( z + γ ⋅ s (φ ) − φ )      ù     é ( z + γ ⋅ s (φ ) + φ ) ù
(3)        E[π (φ )] =                            ê                                − βφ ú − φ ê1 −                     ú,
                                    2z            ë              2                      û     ë          2z            û



17
   Autor, Levy and Murnane (1999) estimate that the wage markup averages 50 percent.
18
   I also assume that γ ⋅ s + φ ≤ z , which ensures that the probability bounds of the uniform distribution are not violated in (2) and
elsewhere. This assumption can be relaxed at no substantive cost by rewriting the expectation functions with minimums and
maximums at − z and + z respectively.
19
   Note that with a sufficiently skewed density function for η, it is possible to obtain the opposite result – that greater ex ante
odds of termination increase worker skill investments. For example if the probability mass of η were primarily concentrated at a
threshold value, workers might invest heavily in specific capital to overcome this threshold. Substantively, because retaining a



                                                               10
which in the case of THS hires reduces to E[π (0)] = [(1 − β ) ⋅ [ z + γ ⋅ s (0)] 2 ] / 4 z ] .

    Observe that φ enters both the credit and debit side of (3). On the debit side, φ raises the cost of

terminating workers. On the credit side, φ raises the expected profitability of retained workers due

to their greater specific skill investments (underscored above by denoting specific skill investment

s(φ ) as an explicit function of φ ). Which of these effects dominates – downside firing costs or

upside productivity benefits – depends sensitively upon other parameters: the productivity of firm

specific capital, the firm’s bargaining power, and the worker’s investment cost function. Only in the

extreme case where specific capital is unproductive ( γ = 0 ) does φ = 0 necessarily dominate all other

(positive) firing costs.

    This result is a manifestation of the theory of the second best. Because firms share in the returns

to but not the costs of specific skill investments, workers choose sub-optimal investments in period 1.

To counteract this under-investment, firms may accept positive firing costs by hiring directly, thereby

credibly reducing the odds that they will terminate workers in period 2.20 Workers invest more

accordingly. Firing costs can therefore increase profits. This result is illustrated in Figure 2 which

graphs a simulation of the profitability of direct and outsourced hiring for different values of γ while

holding other parameters constant.21 For small γ , the profitability of outsourcing exceeds direct

hiring while for large γ (specific capital highly productive) the relationship is reversed.

D. Optimal firing costs versus mandated firing costs

    If firing costs are profitable, then firms need not wait for courts to impose them. Firms will

presumably make legally binding promises ( φ * ) that encourage workers to develop specific capital.

                                                                                           ~
The relevant question therefore is how does hiring change when courts impose firing a cost φ that



job has a rent attached, added uncertainty could induce workers to make larger precautionary specific skill investments. Because
of the unusual assumptions required on η, I consider this case remote.
20
   This result is similar to Prendergast (1992).

differs from φ * ?

       Assume now that φ * (γ ) is chosen optimally to maximize (3). In moving from an at-will regime

  ~                         ~
( φ = 0 ) to a regime where φ > 0 , consider the relationship between court mandated firing cost and

firms’ chosen firing costs, φ * (γ ) . If firms have already committed to greater firing protections than

                                             ~         ~                     ~
those adopted by the court (i.e., φ * (γ ) ≥ φ ), then φ is non-binding. For φ > φ * (γ ) , however, a subset

of firms will find it more profitable to choose outsourcing over direct hire despite the foregone

specific capital investment. The likelihood that a firm chooses to outsource a given job (‘occupation’)

will depend directly on the magnitude of φ * (γ ) . For occupations where specific capital is quite

productive ( γ large), the changing legal regime is unlikely to cause outsourcing since firms will have

                                                         ~
already written contracts that are more restrictive than φ . And conversely for occupations where

specific capital is of minimal import, any increase in firing costs may be sufficient to cause firms to

outsource employment. Hence, the primary implication of this model is that in response to firing

costs, firms will outsource those occupations that require the least specific capital.22

       This implication is relevant to temporary help employment because workers supplied by THS

work overwhelmingly in occupations that rely on general, interchangeable skills. For example, low-

skilled blue collar and administrative support occupations make up 63 percent of temporary help

employment versus 30 percent of overall employment.23 And even among white collar occupations,

Temporary Workers are predominantly found in technical, computer, and medical occupations (such

as nursing) where again skills are quite general (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996, Table 2). Hence,

although temporary help workers are quite dissimilar from the typical plaintiffs in unjust dismissal



21
     The following parameter values are used: φ = .15, c( s ) = 0.5s 2 , β = .1, and z = 2 .
22
   If firing costs are also increasing in γ , then the relative profitability of outsourcing high versus low γ workers will depend on
whether the marginal profitability of specific capital investment rises more quickly or more slowly than does the marginal firing
cost.

lawsuits, this fact is consistent with the notion that employers will optimally outsource jobs to THS

firms to avoid unjust dismissal suits.24 It therefore appears plausible that state-level demand for

temporary help workers will grow in response to the adoption of an Implied Contract exception.

3. Empirical Framework and Data

A. Empirical framework

    Figure 3 presents the time series of U.S. states recognizing common law exceptions to

employment at will between 1979 and 1995 alongside a plot of the unweighted average log size of

THS employment in each state relative to 1979 after adjusting for state employment growth. The

figure reveals a striking similarity in the movements of the two series, particularly after 1983. Of

course, this relationship may not be causal. By exploiting the fact that the common law exceptions

are adopted in different states and years, I attempt to assess their causal impact by testing whether

THS grew relatively more in adopting states. Specifically, I estimate differences-in-difference

models of the form:

          ln(THS jt ) = α + δ (Common Law Exceptions) + λ (ln Nonfarm Emp)
(e1)                                                                                       ,
                       + ζ ( Lab Force Demographics) + µ j + τ j + ε jt

where the dependent variable is log temporary help employment in state (j) and year (t). In addition

to dummies for adoption of common law exceptions, all estimates include a vector of state dummies

µ j that control for mean differences in THS employment across states, and year dummies τ j that

control for THS growth common to all states. Some models also control for state non-farm

employment, labor force demographics, linear and/or quadratic state time trends, and region by year



Clerical occupations.
24
   Consistent with this implication, Kahn (forthcoming) in a study of the consequences of temporary help outsourcing for
productivity writes, “In their decisions about the level of temp use, managers were extremely aware of the kinds of jobs where
temps were useful and the kind of jobs where this was not the case. For instance, one manager noted, ‘Temps can describe the
products we sell and take orders, but we would never hire a temp to handle customers unsatisfied with the service.’ Managers
also knew that when company-specific knowledge and experience were needed for the job, temps were inappropriate …When
only a modest amount of firm-specific experience was necessary, companies’ policies made sure that the temps were well versed
in the institutional knowledge and firms’ computer systems by using the same temps repeatedly.” Hence, companies using THS
appear to take the consequences for specific capital development seriously.


                                                         13
dummy variables. Data sources are discussed below.

     In applying the difference-in-difference framework to the data, it is important to consider

carefully the ‘experiment’ created by these court decisions. In the ideal case, the court decisions

would be independent, random events that varied in timing and had no spillover effects to non-

adopting states. Assuming further that the ‘treatment effect’ of the common law exceptions was

constant, equation (e1) if correctly specified would provide an unbiased estimate of δ .25

     The present analysis differs from this ideal case. The court rulings should not be viewed as

independent events since 79 exceptions were recognized in 1979 – 1995 as opposed to 20 in the

preceding two decades. Because a movement to revise the at-will doctrine was visibly underway,

firms may have responded preemptively, potentially by increasing demand for temporary help.26

Additionally, if the common law exceptions led to rapid growth of THS in affected states, this is

likely to have contributed to the maturation and diffusion of an industry that was historically small

and unsophisticated (Moore, 1965). The differences-in-differences framework will fail to capture

these impacts if present, thereby understating the total impact of common law exceptions on THS.

     Alongside these shortcomings, the common law exceptions have two virtues. First, they are

discrete. Second, because a court’s issuance of a new precedent is an idiosyncratic function of its

docket and the disposition of its justices, the timing of a change to the common change is likely to be

in part unanticipated.27 The empirical approach will therefore identify the extent of discontinuous



25
   The likelihood that δ is constant depends in part on whether the content of the common law exceptions differs among states.
Dertouzos and Karoly (1992) distinguish among narrowly versus broadly tailored Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions, and
additionally distinguish whether the recognized doctrine(s) offer tort- versus contract-based remedies (i.e., punitive and
compensatory damages versus contractual losses only). Although initial empirical work for the present paper implemented this
finer taxonomy, these additional distinctions did not prove empirically relevant and the results are not reported.
26
   For example, a 1985 Business Week cover story entitled, “Beyond Unions: A Revolution in Employee Rights is in the Making”
warned that, “The time is coming when nonunion employees will no longer serve entirely at the employer’s will – the so-called
employment-at-will doctrine that has prevailed in the U.S. since the late 1800s. Slowly but inexorably, judicial and legislative
law is recognizing that even nonunion employees have an implicit employment contract that is enforceable in the courts” (Hoerr
et al., 1985, p. 73).
27
   In their study of the impact of the decline of employment at will on state employment growth, Dertouzos and Karoly’s (1992)
attempt to instrument for the adoption of common law exceptions using measures of states’ legal and political climate. While
these factors may influence the probability of an adoption, the assumption that they are otherwise orthogonal to labor market
conditions is suspect. Accordingly, I do not attempt such an instrumental variables strategy here.

changes in THS employment induced by unanticipated changes in the common law.

B. Data sources

    To create a time series of state level THS and other business service industry employment, I use

data from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns (CBP) files for the years 1979 – 1995.

These data, collected annually from a theoretically complete universe of U.S. employers, provide a

count of the total number of workers on THS payrolls during the month of March in each state and

year. The CBP data do not distinguish between temporary and permanent employees of THS

establishments and hence line staff are included in these counts although their employment share is

likely to be small. The 1987 revision to the Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) expanded

the Temporary Help Supply Services industry (7362) to a slightly broader aggregate, Personnel

Supply Services (7363). To the degree that this expansion is uniform across states, it will be absorbed

by year effects.

    As control variables for the THS employment equations, I use state level non-farm employment

counts drawn from the BLS State and Area Employment Statistics. I use the Outgoing Rotation

Group (ORG) files of the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1979 – 1995 to create demographic

controls for summary characteristics of the labor force in each state and year including education,

gender, age, marital status, and industry employment composition in 1-digit CIC industries. For

estimates of unionization, I use the CPS ORG for years 1983 – 1995 and data from Troy and Sheflin

(1985) for the years 1980 and 1982.

    To characterize the state-by-year time series of exceptions to employment at will, I rely on

Morriss (1995) who characterizes the relevant case law to 1989. For subsequent years I combine

information from the Bureau of National Affairs (1997) and Postic (1994). The cases cited for each

exception are found in the Legal Appendix. The reader should be aware that characterizing the status

of the common law is an inexact science and, to mitigate concerns about subjectivity, all of the

results presented below were also estimated using the characterization developed by Dertouzos and


                                              15
Karoly (1992). The findings are neither qualitatively nor (substantially) quantitatively affected by the

use of this alternative characterization.

     Because data on THS employment is assembled from complete establishment counts and hence

do not contain systematically heteroskedastic measurement error, estimates found in the body of the

paper are unweighted. Estimates that use state mean employment as weights, found in Appendix

Tables A1 and A2, are closely comparable to unweighted estimates and are discussed briefly in the

text.28

4. Empirical results

A. Initial estimates

     Summary data on THS employment by region and year are found in Table 2 and initial estimates

of equation (e1) are found in Table 3. Each column presents a regression of the log of state THS

employment on state and time dummies, state linear time trends (in even-numbered columns), and an

indicator variables for the three common law exceptions, equal to one if an exception is present in a

given state and year and zero otherwise. The first two columns contain the estimated impact of the

Implied Contract exception on THS employment. The coefficient of 0.112 in column (1) indicates

that after removing mean state THS levels and common year effects, THS employment grew by

approximately 11.2 log points more in states adopting the Implied Contract exception than in non-

adopting states. The second column adds 50 state specific time trends to the model, increasing the

point estimate slightly to 13.6 log points and reducing the standard error considerably. An F-test of

the hypothesis that the state trends are jointly zero is strongly rejected by the data and hence I employ

these linear trends in most specifications.


28
   Since the empirical objective is to estimate the average treatment effect of common law exceptions on THS in percentage
terms, there is also no a priori reason to place more weight on larger states. All models are estimated by OLS using Huber-White
robust standard errors that are heteroskedasticity consistent but do not account for potential serial correlation in the residuals. In
Appendix tables A2 columns (3) – (6), I present estimates of detailed models using a maximum likelihood GEE estimator that
explicitly incorporates an AR1 error process (Liang and Zeger, 1986). After conditioning on state log employment and state time
linear trends, the serial correlation in the state residuals is estimated to be 0.2 – 0.4, which is not large. Accordingly, the OLS and



                                                            16
     Comparable models estimated with the Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions are found in

columns (3) – (6). Although both common law exceptions appear initally to contribute to the growth

of THS, each point estimate becomes insignificantly negative once state trends are included. It

appears that both the Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions were adopted in states where THS was

already growing rapidly.

     The last two columns of Table 3 estimate the impact of the three exceptions simultaneously. The

point estimate for each common law exception is only minimally affected by the inclusion of the

others. The Implied Contract exception remains robust with a coefficient of 13.7 log points. The

Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions are again insignificant once state trends are accounted for.

Because these doctrines remain insignificant in the remainder of the analysis, they are not reported in

subsequent tables although they are always included in regression models.

B. Controlling for other covariates

     The previous estimates employ only the sparsest controls. In this section, I test the robustness of

the results by controlling for a richer set of covariates including state employment, quadratic state

time trends, region by year effects, and labor force demographics. Estimates are found in Table 4.

     A first specification check addresses the concern that the states that adopted the Implied Contract

were simply those undergoing faster employment growth. This would be true if courts in states with

robust economies were particularly inclined to ‘liberalize’ the employment regime.29 Column (1) of

Table 4 adds a control for the log of state non-farm employment to the baseline specification, which

obtains a coefficient of 1.5 conditional on trend. Consistent with Segal and Sullivan (1995) who

report that THS employment is highly procyclical, the point estimate indicates that THS employment

grew or contracted about 50 percent faster than overall employment within states on a year to year



GEE estimates provide similar point estimates and standard errors, and I limit the discussion in the text to the OLS results.
29
   The figures in Tables 1 and 2 cast initial doubt on this possibility, however, since Southern states were the last and least likely
to adopt common law exceptions and yet these states grew persistently faster than the U.S. average throughout the post-war
period (Katz and Blanchard, 1992).


                                                             17
basis.30 In columns (4) through (6), I add controls for quadratic state time trends and interactions

between year dummies and indicators for each of the nine census regions that allow state THS

employment to trend non-linearly and also absorb region-specific shocks. The Implied Contract

coefficient is largely insensitive to these additional controls.

    To explore whether the estimates are driven by demographic changes in the labor force, I include

in columns (5) – (7) detailed state demographic variables that measure the fraction of the labor force

in the following groups: high school graduate, some college, greater than college; female, married,

married and female; black, and other race; and age 16 – 24, and 55 plus.31 Consistent with the

demographics composition of temporary help employment (Cohany, 1998), there is a substantial

correlation between the growth of THS and increases in the labor force shares of high school

graduates, some-college attendees and females, and a negative correlation with the shares of blacks.

Subsequent columns add quadratic time trends and region by year dummies. In column (5), the base

specification augmented with demographic controls, the estimated impact of the Implied Contract

exception on THS employment is 13.3 log points. The final column yields a point estimate of 14.1

log points which is highly significant despite the inclusion of approximately 300 covariates.

    Estimates of these models that use average state employment as weights are found in Appendix

Table A1. These models also find a robustly significant effect of the Implied Contract exception on

THS growth. In the base specification, Column (2), the point estimate is 7.1 log points as compared

to 14.8 log point for the unweighted estimate. When labor force demographics, region by year

dummies, and quadratic state time trends are included, the point estimate increases to 9.3 log points

as compared to 14.1 log points for the unweighted estimate.




30
   One can reject that the THS employment/Overall employment elasticity is equal to 1.0 at the 5 percent level. Although the non-
farm employment measure also includes THS employment, THS is a small component (0.2 to 2 percent) of the total and
subtracting it from the non-farm employment measure has no discernable impact on the point estimates.
31
   The omitted groups is white, male, high school dropouts, ages 25 – 54. The labor force sample includes both employed and
unemployed workers.


                                                          18
C. Estimates by region and time period

     Because the many court decisions altering the common law provide multiple ‘experiments,’ one

can usefully subdivide the data to provide a consistency check on the estimates. Two such tests are

discussed here. Table 5 presents estimates of the baseline model using state level data subdivided

into 3 four-year intervals over 1979 – 1991.32 To alleviate concern about non-independence of the

outcome variable over short time spans, I estimate the models using observations at one, two, and

four year frequencies. The point estimates in Table 5 present a highly consistent picture: the Implied

Contract coefficient is positive in each case and generally in the range of 7 to 20 log points.

Estimates are slightly less stable at four-year intervals. The Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions

(not tabulated) again present no clear pattern. In Appendix Table A2, I provide estimates of the base

specification for each of the nine geographic Census regions. These estimates are reasonably stable

across Census regions: positive in 8 of 9 regions, and in the range of 6 to 17 log points in 6 of these.33

D. Inferring causality via the timing of common law changes

     The discrete specification above provides no sense of the dynamics of common law adoption and

THS employment: how quickly employment grows after an exception is adopted and whether this

impact accelerates, stabilizes, or mean reverts. If it were the case that temporary help employment

growth lead the adoption of exceptions rather than vice versa, the previous estimates would obscure

this reverse causality. To explore these dynamics, Table 6 provides estimates of a subset of the

models in Table 4 that include leads and lags of the Implied Contract exception. Specifically, I add

indicator variables for one and two years before adoption, years zero through three after adoption,

and year four forward. Of these seven indicator variables, note that the first six are only equal to one

in the relevant year while the final variable is equal to one in every year starting in the fourth year



32
  Note that no additional Implied Contract exceptions were adopted after 1989.
33
  For two regions, the estimate is close to zero while for the Mountain Division, the estimated impact is quite large (48 log
points). Estimates of the models in Table 3 that drop the Mountain Division states continue to indicate a significant impact of the
Implied Contract exception on THS employment.


                                                           19
after adoption.

     The first column of Table 6 presents the base specification augmented with the leads and lags.

The coefficients on the adoption leads are close to zero, showing little evidence of an anticipatory

response within states about to adopt an exception.34 In the year of adoption, temporary help

employment increases substantially by 12 log points, fluctuates between 8 and 17 log points in the

subsequent three years, and averages 10 log points in years four and forward. One cannot reject the

hypothesis that the four post-adoption coefficients are jointly equal (p = 0.66). Subsequent columns

repeat these estimates adding linear and quadratic time trends and region by year effects. The pattern

of coefficients is comparable in each case, providing robust evidence that adoption of the Implied

Contract exception led the growth of THS rather than vice versa. In the preferred specification that

includes linear state trends (column (2)), the estimated impact is 19.6 log points at year four.35

     Weighted estimates of these models, found in Appendix Table A3, provide a similarly clear-cut

pattern of rapid THS growth after adoption of the Implied Contract exception. Coefficients are about

two-thirds the magnitude of unweighted estimates, yielding a point estimate of 12.6 log points

growth after 4 years in the preferred model. Table A3 also presents maximum likelihood GEE

estimates of both unweighted and weighted models. These models which assume an AR1 error

process yield point estimates and standard errors closely comparable to their OLS counterparts.

     In results not tabulated here, I have explored more complex dynamics by allowing the common

law exceptions to take a linear or quadratic time slope and including additional years of indicator

variables. The data reject these more complex specifications in favor of those found in Table 6. I

find no evidence of an accumulating impact on THS employment beyond four years, nor is there

evidence of mean revision in the longer term. It thus appears that the extent of the dynamics of the


34
  This finding should be distinguished from the hypothesis that employers in all states increase use of THS as an anticipatory
response to common law changes. This latter phenomenon would not be detected by pre-adoption dummies unless employers
foresaw individual court decisions in their states.



                                                          20
THS demand response to adoption of the Implied Contract exception is resolved within four years.

Note, however, that since THS expanded rapidly throughout this time, a constant impact of 13 to 20

log points (~14 – 22 percentage points) implies a growing absolute effect on THS employment.36

     Two further observations on this pattern of results deserve mention. First, the quite rapid growth

of THS employment after adoption of an Implied Contract exception – on the order of 10 percent in

the year of a ruling – may appear implausibly large. Note, however, that THS is an industry

characterized by extremely high flows. For example, Segal and Sullivan (1997b) estimate that 60

percent of THS workers leave the industry within one calendar quarter. A substantial change in the

scale of the industry therefore requires only that the exit rate decreases slightly (e.g., assignments

lengthen) or that intake accelerates.37

     A second question is whether contrary to the estimates above, one should expect the ‘steady

state’ impact of a common law change on THS to be more substantial than the near-term impact. The

stylized model in Section 2 suggests that the degree to which firms outsource employment in

response to the legal environment is circumscribed by the ‘technology’ of jobs ( γ specifically), in

particular how much outsourcing reduces productivity relative to termination costs. More generally,

it seems likely that firms facing added legal risks will alter their occupational ‘technology’ to make

outsourcing less costly, perhaps by shifting the mix of human capital from specific towards general

skills (e.g., using off the shelf instead of custom software), or learning to manage outsourced workers

more effectively. Logically, the temporary help industry has striven to assist this effort by

developing a sophisticated capacity for training and screening workers (Autor, 1999).38

Unfortunately, the present empirical framework will not detect this richer interplay between the legal


35
   Adding controls for labor force demographics to these models as in Table 4 (not shown) does not alter the results.
36
   I also explored models that controlled for the fraction of neighboring states and the fraction of states in the same Census region
recognizing an Implied Contract exception. Neither variable was significant, suggesting that if spillovers occur from the
common law changes, they are not identifiably geographic.
37
   In addition, note that there are no ‘industry specific’ skills required to work in temporary help.
38
   Recent work also suggests that the industry has become an increasingly significant intermediary for employers screening



                                                            21
environment and the growth of outsourcing since these practices will diffuse slowly and potentially

affect all states simultaneously.

E. Unionization and the growth of temporary help employment

    A potentially complementary explanation for the recent growth of outsourcing in the U.S. is the

changing role of labor unions. Unionized workers have traditionally received greater employment

protections than provided by the at-will doctrine and it is therefore sensible to ask whether the recent

decline of unionization has played a role in the erosion of employment at will and the growth of

temporary help. Unions might impact the development of temporary help either indirectly, by

influencing the adoption of unjust dismissal doctrines, or directly by either retarding or contributing

to employers’ demand for THS workers.

    To explore these possibilities, I first estimated probability models in a state-by-time panel to

explore whether states where union penetration was growing or declining relatively faster were more

likely to adopt common law exceptions. I found no evidence to support this notion and these results

are not tabulated.39 I next estimated models of log THS employment comparable to those in Table 4

while including a control for the percentage of the state workforce unionized. These estimates, found

in Table 7, provide surprisingly robust evidence that temporary help employment is closely

correlated with unionization.

    The initial column of Table 7 presents a model of log state THS employment controlling only for

state union penetration and state and year dummies. The union coefficient of 0.040 implies that for

every percentage point increase in unionization, THS employment grows by 4 log points. Inclusion

of state linear time trends reduces this coefficient to 0.021, which remains highly significant.

Subsequent columns add controls for adoption of the Implied Contract exception, the log of state




workers for permanent positions (Houseman and Polivka, 1999; Houseman, 1997).
39
   Miles (forthcoming) reports that union levels have no impact of the adoption of common law exceptions in estimates of a
duration model.


                                                         22
non-farm employment, and a full set of trends, region-by-year effects, and labor force demographics.

Additionally, because of the concern that state unionization level might proxy for the presence of

manufacturing which is a substantial user of temporary help workers (Estavao and Lach, 1999),

columns (2) and (6) include controls for employment composition in 12 major industries. The union

impact on THS employment remains robustly positive and in the range of 2 log points. 40

     In interpreting the THS-unionization relationship, two points should be kept in mind. First,

union levels fell substantially over this time period, from 22.9 percent to 12.4 percent in the data, and

hence unionization does not contribute to an explanation for the recent growth of THS. Instead, the

estimates are best read as indicating that temporary help grew relatively faster in states where unions

declined more slowly. Second, unlike in the case of the Implied Contract doctrine, the unionization

estimates do not have a clear causal interpretation since union penetration cannot be viewed as

exogenous. The relationship is nevertheless suggestive and provides an empirical underpinning for

the visible enmity between THS employers and U.S. labor unions (cf. Carré et al., 1994; Lips, 1998).

One interpretation of this finding is that employers in highly unionized states use temporary help to

avoid union constraints on wages or management practices. An alternative reading, however, is that

high levels of THS employment contribute to increased worker demand for union representation.

F. Impact of the decline of employment at will on other business services
   employment

     Although temporary help grew substantially faster than other forms of outsourced employment,

other Business Service industries (such as janitorial services and computer and data processing) also

experienced rapid growth between 1979 and 1995, rising from 2.1 to 3.6 percent of employment

(excluding THS). It is natural to ask whether the erosion of employment at will contributed to this

phenomenon as well. To explore this question, I estimate log employment models as in Table 4 for



40
  An interaction between the level of unionization and a dummy for the Implied Contract exception was never significant and
always close to zero.


                                                        23
each of the business service industries. Before proceeding to these estimates, I note that the legal

analysis above indicates that adoption of unjust dismissal doctrines would not directly contribute to

the growth of other Business Services since, unlike THS, these industries are not directly advantaged

by these doctrines. Hence, these results can be viewed as a falsification test of the earlier findings.

       Estimates in Table 8 give little indication that adoption of the Implied Contract doctrine

contributed to the growth of other business service employment. Except for those sub-components of

business services that contain temporary help (rows (1) and (10)), estimates are primarily

insignificant and do not have consistent signs.41 Estimates for the impacts of the Public Policy and

Good Faith doctrines (not tabulated) also present no consistent pattern.

       Point estimates for the unionization variable are more consistently positive. This variable is

significantly related to the growth of Credit Reporting and Collecting employment and is marginally

significant for Building Services employment (which includes building maintenance). Neither point

estimate is as quantitatively large as the estimated impact of unionization on temporary help

employment. Consistent with the earlier results, these estimates suggest that states with higher union

penetration saw faster growth of outsourced employment.

5. Conclusions

       To summarize the primary findings, Figure 4 depicts the time series of states adopting the

Implied Contract exception alongside estimates of temporary help employment for 1979 to 1995 both

before and after conditioning on adoption of the Implied Contract exception. A fourth line on this

plot indicates the share of the growth of temporary help since 1973 that is explained by changes to

the at-will doctrine. The estimates indicate that as of 1995, 306,000 additional workers were

employed in temporary help on a daily basis as a result of the Implied Contract exception.

       Extending this estimate forward and using the weighted and unweighted point estimates to form



41
     The estimate for SIC 7310, Advertising, is significant the 5 percent level but is not robust to inclusion of quadratic trends.


                                                               24
bounds, I find that 336,000 to 494,000 additional workers were employed in temporary help as of

1999 due to the Implied Contract exception.42 As the lower line of Figure 4 indicates, the estimates

explain as much 20 percent of the growth of temporary help services employment over the 26 year

period from 1973 – 1999. Observe, however, that the explanatory power of the model actually falls

in the recent period since temporary help has continued to expand rapidly since 1992, several years

after the most recent Implied Contract exception was adopted. Hence, the present analysis provides a

starting point for understanding the recent dramatic growth of THS specifically and outsourcing more

generally but is not a complete account.

     There is an irony to the findings of this research, shared with recent work by Acemoglu and

Angrist (1998) and Oyer and Schaefer (1998a and 1998b) – namely, that labor market interventions

intended to protect or expand workers’ employment ‘rights’ appear to have had unintended and

potentially perverse consequences. Acemoglu and Angrist conclude that the Americans with

Disabilities Act reduced the employment of the disabled while Oyer and Schaefer present evidence

that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 increased firms’ use of mass layoffs as a shield for the firing of

black men and raised the earnings of experienced workers relative to the young. In a similar vein,

the current research suggests that courts’ efforts to protect workers against unjust dismissal have

fostered the growth of temporary help employment – non-preferred jobs that offer less job security

and lower pay than standard positions. Moreover, there is some evidence that labor unions, which

have historically provided employment protection to their members, also induce employment

outsourcing to temporary help.

     It should be stressed however that the welfare impacts of the decline of employment at will are

indeterminate based on the present evidence. While the current analysis explores one margin of


42
  As of 1995, the most recent year for which state level estimates are available, 75.6% of THS employment was in states that had
adopted an Implied Contract exception. Assuming this ratio continued to hold as of 1999 when national THS employment was
equal to 3,624 thousand, the total employment estimated impact is 3624*0.756/(i/(1+i) where i is equal to either 0.14 (weighted

response to the changing legal doctrines, it offers no evidence on the compensatory benefits workers

may have received by dint of these laws. Theory also suggests that some legal restrictions on private

contracting can enhance efficiency (Aghion and Hermalin, 1990; Levine, 1991). Whether workers

were in net harmed by these well meaning judicial efforts – and if so, which groups of workers have

borne the greatest burden – is a question open to future research.

non-farm unemployment, and dummy variables for Public
Policy and Good Faith exceptions. Column (A) also contain
controls for state linear time trends. Note that no Implied

Notes. n=850. Columns (1) and (2) contain OLS estimates with Huber-White robust standard errors in
parentheses. Columns (3) - (6) contain maximum likelihood GEE estimates that assume an AR1 error
process (estimates of ρ tabulated above). Estimates in columns (1), (2), (5), and (6) are weighted by mean
state share of national employment over 1979 - 1995. All models include state and year dummies, state
linear time trends, a control for log state non-farm employment, and leads and lags of adoption of the
Public Policy and Good Faith exceptions.
