       This paper presents the case for investing more in young American children who grow up

in disadvantaged environments. Figure 1 graphs time series of alternative measures of the

percentage of children in disadvantaged families. The percentage of children born into, or living

in, nontraditional families has increased greatly in the last 30 years.1,2 Approximately 25% of

children are now born into single parent homes. While the percentages of children living in

poverty and born into poor families have fallen recently, they are still high, especially among

certain subgroups.

       Adverse environments place children at risk for social and economic failure. The accident

of birth plays a powerful role in determining adult success.3 Many have commented on this

phenomenon, and most analyses have cast the issue of assisting children from disadvantaged

families as a question of fairness or social justice.

       This paper makes a different argument. We argue that, on productivity grounds, it makes

sense to invest in young children from disadvantaged environments. Substantial evidence shows

that these children are more likely to commit crime, have out-of-wedlock births and drop out of

school. Early interventions that partially remediate the effects of adverse environments can

reverse some of the harm of disadvantage and have a high economic return. They benefit not only

the children themselves, but also their children, as well as society at large.

       Investing in disadvantaged young children is a rare public policy with no equity-

efficiency tradeoff. It reduces the inequality associated with the accident of birth and at the same

time raises the productivity of society at large.

       While a more rigorous analysis is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the effects

of early intervention programs, their precise channels of influence, and their exact benefits and

costs, the existing evidence is promising. An accumulating body of knowledge shows that early

                                                        2
childhood interventions for disadvantaged young children are more effective than interventions

that come later in life. Because of the dynamic nature of the skill formation process, remediating

the effects of early disadvantages at later ages is often prohibitively costly (see Carneiro, Cunha

and Heckman and Cunha and Heckman, 2006). Skill begets skill; learning begets learning. Early

disadvantage, if left untreated, leads to academic and social difficulties in later years. Advantages

accumulate; so do disadvantages. A large body of evidence shows that post-school remediation

programs like public job training and General Educational Development (GED) certification

cannot compensate for a childhood of neglect for most people.

       This evidence has dramatic consequences for the way we think about policy toward skill

formation. Most current policies directed towards improving the skills of youth focus on schools

as the locus of intervention. The No Child Left Behind Act uses mandates and punishments to

encourage schools to remediate the educational deficits of disadvantaged children. School

accountability schemes are used to motivate higher levels of achievement for children from

disadvantaged environments.

       While these initiatives are well-intentioned, their premise is faulty. Schools work with

what parents give them. The 1966 Coleman Report on inequality in school achievement clearly

documented that the major factor explaining the variation in the academic performance of

children across U.S. schools is the variation in parental environments—not the variation in per

pupil expenditure across schools or pupil-teacher ratios. Successful schools build on the efforts of

successful families. Failed schools deal in large part with children from dysfunctional families

that do not provide the enriched home environments enjoyed by middle class and upper middle

class children. Since failure in school is linked to so many social pathologies, each with

substantial social and economic costs, a policy of equality of opportunity in access to home

environments (or their substitutes) is also a one that promotes productivity in schools, the

                                                     3
workplace, and society at large.

       Rigorous statistical analysis is not needed to show that parents and their resources matter,

although there is a large body of empirical evidence that supports this claim, as we document

below. The issue that has stymied social policy is how to compensate for adverse family

environments in the early years. One approach has been to reduce the material deprivation

suffered by the poor with transfers from the state, as in Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty.

Another approach has been to bolster the family with programs outside the home. Sometimes

children have been removed from the biological families, as in the case of the American Indians

in the early twentieth century. Policies that have removed children from homes have had

catastrophic consequences.4

       An emerging body of evidence suggests that there is a better way to improve the early

years of disadvantaged children. Enriched preschool centers available to disadvantaged children

on a voluntary basis coupled with home visitation programs have a strong track record of

promoting achievement for disadvantaged children. The economic return to these programs is

high, especially when we consider alternative policies that target children from disadvantaged

environments or the policies targeted to the young adults who emerge from them. We review the

evidence on these programs and suggest that some version of them be used to supplement the

resources of disadvantaged families with children.

       Our logic is simple and compelling. Education and human skill are major factors

determining productivity, both in the workplace and in society. The family is a major producer of

the skills and motivation required for producing successful students and workers. The most

effective policy for improving the performance of schools is supplementing the childrearing

resources of the disadvantaged families sending children to the schools. The family is a major

determinant of child participation in crime and social deviance. A family supplementation policy

                                                     4
is a successful anti-crime policy.

          Our emphasis on early childhood interventions does not deny the importance of schools

or firms in producing human skill. Indeed, if proven early intervention programs are adopted,

schools will be more effective, firms will have better workers to employ and train, and the prison

population will decline. At lower cost to society, bolstered families will produce better educated

students, more trained workers and better citizens.

          This paper proceeds in the following way. We first discuss the problem of the supply of

skills to the American economy. Growth in both the quantity and the quality of the labor force

traditionally has been a major source of U.S. output growth. Given current trends, U.S. growth

prospects are poor. Labor force growth is slowing, especially that of young and skilled workers

who are a source of vitality for the entire economy. The composition of the future workforce will

shift towards workers from relatively more dysfunctional families with commensurately worse

skills.

          We next discuss the problem of crime in America. Even though the crime rate has fallen

in recent years, the levels and costs of crime are still very high. The damage to victims and the

resources spent on preventing crime and on incarcerating criminals are large. Early intervention

programs targeted towards disadvantaged families reduce participation in crime. On purely

economic grounds, the case for early childhood intervention is strong.

          After describing these two major social problems that impair the productivity of

American society, we summarize trends in adverse child environments. We summarize a vast

literature in social science that establishes that dysfunctional and disadvantaged families are

major producers of cognitive and behavioral deficits that lead to adverse teenage and adult social

and economic outcomes. The effects of disadvantage appear early and persist. Remediating these

disadvantages at later ages is costly. Human abilities affect lifetime performance and are shaped

                                                      5
early in the life of the child. Early interventions promote cumulative improvements. Enriched

interventions targeted towards children in disadvantaged environments are cost-effective

remedies for reducing crime and the factors that breed crime, and raising productivity in schools

and in the workplace.

       We then move on to summarize the findings of the literature on the economics of child

development that demonstrates the importance of both cognitive and noncognitive abilities in

shaping child educational and economic outcomes. Both types of abilities are major determinants

of the economic return to education.

       Both cognitive and noncognitive abilities are shaped early in life and early differences in

abilities persist. Gaps in college attendance across socioeconomic groups are largely shaped by

abilities formed in the early years. Gaps in child ability across families of different income levels

are associated with parental environments and parenting practices. Early interventions can

partially remediate these deficits. Later interventions are much less effective. At current levels of

investment, American society over-invests in public job training and formal education and under-

invests in early education for disadvantaged children.

       We summarize the evidence from a variety of early intervention programs targeted toward

disadvantaged children and focus on three early interventions that followed participants into

adulthood. Some of these interventions are evaluated by the method of random assignment. Early

interventions reduce crimes, promote high school graduation and college attendance, reduce

grade repetition and special education costs, and help prevent teenage births. They raise

achievement as measured by test scores. Very early interventions also appear to raise IQ,

especially for girls. Cost-benefit analyses of these programs reported in the literature show that

they are cost effective. Estimated rates of return are 16%: 4% for participants and 12% for

society at large. The paper concludes with a summary of the argument and some specific policy

                                                      6
recommendations.



Human Capital and Economic Performance

       Education and skill are central to the performance of a modern economy. The emergence

of new technologies has raised the demand for highly skilled workers who are qualified to use

them. A wage premium for skilled labor emerged in many countries in the early 80s, and wage

inequality grew as the economic return to education (the economic benefit of attending school)

rose, especially in countries like the U.S. where the supply response to the increasing wage

premium was weak.5 Not only did the wages of the skilled rise, but those with the least ability

and education earn less today than comparable workers would have earned thirty years ago.



Workforce Trends

       Table 1, taken from Ellwood, highlights the problems facing the American labor market

in the next two decades. The first column of the table presents the distribution of the American

workforce among age and race-ethnicity categories in 1980. The second column shows the

growth in the categories from 1980 to 2000 and the third column shows the labor force as of

2000. The fourth column shows the projected growth in the labor force in the next twenty years

by category. With the possible exception of the numbers for immigrants, these are reliable

projections because there is little emigration and the groups being projected are already alive.

The immigration projections come from a carefully executed U.S. Census study. The labor force

is aging and young replacements for old workers are increasingly in short supply compared to the

1980s.6 The aging of the American workforce raises serious problems for the future of American

productivity growth.

       The workforce of prime-age workers, fueled by the entry of Baby Boomers, propelled

                                                     7
U.S. economic growth in 1980–2000. However, we cannot count on this source of growth in the

next twenty years. Indeed, the largest components of growth in the workforce will come from

older workers as the Baby Boom cohort ages. Hence, a major source of vitality in the U.S.

workforce will be lost. Future workforce growth will come from older workers and from

demographic groups in which, for a variety of reasons, dysfunctional and disadvantaged families

are more prevalent (See the middle rows of the table 1 and the discussion below).

       On top of these trends in the number of workers by age, there is stagnation in educational

attendance rates. Figure 2 shows the distribution of educational attainment among 30-year-olds

by year. College-going rates have stalled out for cohorts of Americans born after 1950. This is

not a consequence of immigration of unskilled workers. It is a phenomenon found among native-

born Americans. Currently, 17% of all new high school credentials issued are GEDs.7 Heckman

and LaFontaine (2006) document that the high school dropout rate has increased over time if one

counts GEDs as dropouts, as one should, because GEDs earn the same wages as dropouts, and

graduate from college at the same rate as dropouts.

       The growth in the quality of the workforce, which was a mainstay of economic growth

until recently, has diminished. Assuming that these trends continue, the U.S. economy will add

many fewer educated persons to the workforce in the next two decades than it did in the past two

decades (see table 2). Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh estimate that the average annual rate of growth

of college labor supply was 4.5% in 1977, but fell to 1.75% in 1990–2000. These trends are

predicted to continue, or possibly worsen.

       The slowdown in labor force quality growth has already hurt American productivity

growth. Delong, Katz, and Goldin estimate that increases in educational attainment boosted the

effective quality of the workforce by 0.5% a year over 1915–2000, and thus contributed an

average of 0.35 percentage points per year to economic growth over that period.8 The slower

                                                      8
growth in educational attainment of the workforce substantially reduced productivity growth in

recent years compared to its performance in the period 1915–1980. Based on current trends, these

authors project that the annual rate of productivity growth attributable to education—0.35 from

1980 through 2000—will decline by half or more (to between 0.17 and 0.06 percent) in the next

two decades. This will reduce the productivity growth of labor by a substantial 0.18–0.29

percentage points per year and will be a drag on real wage growth and fiscal revenues.



Literacy and Numeracy

       The skills of the U.S. labor force are poor. The U.S. has a thick lower tail of essentially

illiterate and innumerate persons, who are a drag on productivity and a source of social and

economic problems. We use data from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) to

examine literacy and numeracy of working age adults (age 16-65).9 Document literacy is defined

as the ability to locate and use information from timetables, graphs, charts and forms. Figure 3

presents data on document literacy. Tests for prose literacy and quantitative literacy produce the

same pattern.10

       Level 1 performance is essentially functional illiteracy or innumeracy. It represents the

inability to determine the correct amount of medicine from information on a bottle of pills.

People who perform at Level 1 can make limited use of texts that are simple and uncomplicated.

They are only able to locate information in text or data as long as there is no distracting

information around the correct answer. On the quantitative scale, they can only carry out

relatively straightforward operations such as simple addition. Roughly 20% of U.S. workers fall

into this category on each test, a much higher fraction than in some of the leading European

countries. This is a major drag on U.S. competitiveness11 and a source of social problems.



                                                      9
Crime

        Crime is a major burden on American society. Anderson (1999) estimates that the net cost

of crime (after netting out transfers) is over $1.3 trillion per year in 2004 dollars. The per capita

cost is $4,818, in the same dollars. This figure includes crime-induced production (of personal

protection devices, trafficking of drugs and operation of correctional facilities) which costs $464

billion per year; opportunity costs (production foregone by incarcerated offenders, valued at their

estimated wage, time spent locking and installing locks, and so forth) of $152 billion per year;

and the value of risks to life and health (pain, suffering and mental distress associated with health

losses) of $672 billion annually (table 3). This includes time lost from work by victims as well as

value of life lost to murders. Some of these items like the valuation of life require controversial

judgments. Even ignoring any transfer component or any risks to life and health, the cost of crime

is over $600 billion per year. Although such calculations are necessarily imprecise and there is

disagreement over the exact costs, there is widespread agreement that the costs of crime are

substantial.

        Even though crime rates have recently declined somewhat, their levels remain high (see

figure 4a). The adult correctional populations (in prison or local jail, on probation or on parole)

continue to grow despite the drop in measured crime rates (see figure 4b). The size of the

population under correctional supervision has continued to increase for all groups, as has the

percentage of each group under supervision. Nine percent of blacks were under the supervision of

the criminal justice system in some form in 1997, although recently this adverse trend has

slowed. Incarceration rates have risen steadily since 1980 and only slowed in the late 1990s. The

inmate population has risen steadily until recently.12 Expenditures on prisons, police and the

judicial system continue to grow despite the drop in measured crime rates (see figure 4c).

        These statistics do not convey the full scope of the problem. According to the Bureau of

                                                      10
Justice Statistics (2004), as of the end of 2001, there were an estimated 5.6 million adults who

had ever served time in State or Federal prison--4.3 million former prisoners and 1.3 million

adults in prison. Nearly a third of former prisoners were still under correctional supervision,

including 731,000 on parole, 437,000 on probation, and 166,000 in local jails. In 2001, an

estimated 2.7% of adults in the U.S. had served time in prison, up from 1.8% in 1991 and 1.3% in

1974. The prevalence of imprisonment in 2001 was higher for Black males (16.6%) and Hispanic

males (7.7%) than for White males (2.6%). It was also higher for Black females (1.7%) and

Hispanic females (0.7%) than White females (0.3%). Nearly two-thirds of the 3.8 million

increase in the number of adults ever incarcerated between 1974 and 2001 occurred as a result of

an increase in first incarceration rates; one-third occurred as a result of an increase in the number

of residents age 18 and older. If recent incarceration rates remain unchanged, an estimated one of

every 15 persons (6.6%) will serve time in a prison during his or her lifetime.

       The lifetime chances of a person going to prison are higher for men (11.3%) than women

(1.8%), and for Blacks (18.6%) and Hispanics (10%) than Whites (3.4%). Based on current rates

of first incarceration, an estimated 32% of black males will enter state or federal prison during

their lifetime, compared to 17% of Hispanic males and 5.9% of White males.



What Can We Do about This Problem?

       It is now well established that education reduces crime. Figure 5, from Lochner and

Moretti, displays this relationship, reported separately for blacks and whites. Increasing high

school graduation rates is a major crime prevention strategy. Risk factors promoting crime

include poor family backgrounds, which also promote high school drop out. Poorly educated

teenage mothers in low-income families are much more likely to produce children who

participate in crime.13 We discuss the evidence on the impact of family background on child

                                                     11
participation in crime in the next section. Although analysts do not agree on which specific

aspects of adverse family environments most affect crime, they all agree that there is a strong

empirical relationship between early adverse environments and child participation in crime later

on in life.

        Some of the most convincing estimates of the impact of adverse early environments on

participation in crime come from interventions designed to remedy those environments. Table 4

presents a summary of the impacts of a variety of early childhood intervention programs on

participation in crime. We discuss some of these programs in much greater detail in below. Here

we summarize some findings relevant to crime.

        Many of these programs were evaluated by the method of random assignment. Children

from disadvantaged populations were randomly assigned, at early ages, to the enriched child

development programs described in the third column of the table. Most interventions were for

children in the pre-kindergarten years. Both the experimental treatment group and the controls

were followed over time, often for many years after the intervention. The Perry Preschool

program, which we discuss in detail below, followed the intervention and control children for

more than 30 years after the intervention. Over that time, the Perry students averaged

significantly fewer lifetime arrests than the comparison group, including arrests for dealing and

producing drugs. This effect was especially pronounced for males. The Abecedarian program

appears to be anomalous, because it did not reduce crime in the treatment group compared to the

control group. It was administered to a population in a low-crime region in the South. Most

studies show dramatic reductions in criminality and participation in the criminal justice system

for treatment group members. Enriched environments reduce crime. Impoverished environments

promote crime.

        Lochner and Moretti present convincing non-experimental evidence that increasing

                                                    12
educational attainment reduces crime and that the inverse relationship between crime and

education in figure 5 is not a correlational artifact arising from unobserved variables that are

common to both crime and education. Using Census data, they show that one more year of

schooling reduces the probability of incarceration by 0.37 percentage points for blacks, and 0.1

for whites.14 To put this evidence in perspective, 23% of the black-white difference in average

incarceration rates can be explained by the differences in education between these groups. Using

the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, they find that the greatest impacts of education are associated

with reducing arrests for murder, assault, and motor vehicle theft.

       Lochner and Moretti also calculate the social savings from crime reduction associated

with completing secondary education. They show that a 1% increase in the high school

graduation rate would yield $1.8 billion dollars in social benefits in 2004 dollars. This increase

would reduce the number of crimes by more than 94,000 each year (see table 5). The social

benefits include reduced losses in productivity and wages, lower medical costs, and smaller

quality-of-life reductions stemming from crime.15 They also include reductions in costs of

incarceration.16

       High school graduation confers an extra benefit of 14-26% beyond private returns

captured by the high school graduate wages that are pocketed by graduates. This is an important

benefit of education beyond its private return that suggests overall under-investment in the

population of disadvantaged children at risk for committing crime. Completing high school raises

a student’s wages by about $10,372 per year (in 2004 dollars), and the direct cost of completing

one year of secondary school is approximately $8,000 per student in 1997 (in 2004 dollars).

Looking only at the savings from reduced crime, the return is $1,638-$2,967 per year, so that

expenditure is cost effective even if we ignore the direct benefits in earnings and even if we

assume that the benefits decline as the youths grow older.

                                                     13
       Comparing the effect of educational expenditure with the effect of hiring an additional

police officer suggests that promoting education may be a better strategy. Using a somewhat

different framework, Levitt claims that an additional sworn police officer in a large U.S. city

would reduce annual costs from crime by about $200,000 dollars at a public cost of $80,000 per

year. These are recurrent annual costs.

       Lochner and Moretti estimate that in steady state it would cost $15,000 per year in terms

of direct costs to produce enough high school graduates to reduce crime by the same amount.

This cost ignores foregone earnings in high school but it also ignores all of the benefits from high

school graduation documented in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd. If Levitt’s estimate is correct,

educational policy is far more effective per dollar spent than expenditure on police.17,18



Trends in Children’s Home Environments and the Consequences of Adverse Environments

       Demographers have documented that over the past forty years, the aggregate birth rate has

declined, but in the past few decades relatively more of all American children born are born into

adverse environments. The definition of adversity varies among studies, but the measures used

are strongly interrelated. Most scholars recognize that absence of a father, low levels of financial

resources, low parental education and ability, a lack of cognitive and emotional stimulation, and

poor parenting skills are characteristics of adverse environments. Determining the relative

importance of these factors is an ongoing debate. Each seems to play a factor in affecting child

outcomes.



Family Structure

       Fewer children are living with two parents who are married. In 2003, 68% of children


                                                     14
under 18 lived with two married parents, down from 77% in 1980.19 This percentage has

remained stable since 1995, after trending downward for many years. The percentage of children

who live with only one parent, or in a home where the parents are not married, increased by 8%

since 1980 to 28%. The percentage of children who live with no parents remained roughly

constant around 3-4% during this period. The source of single parenthood has also changed.

Relatively more children are living with a single parent who has never been married (see figure

6a).

       The aggregate trends conceal a great deal of variation across demographic groups. In

2003, 77% of non-Hispanic White children lived with two married parents, while 20% lived with

only one parent or with unmarried parents. The corresponding percentages for Blacks were 36%

and 56%. For Hispanics, it was 65% and 31%.20 Among Blacks, the percentage of children

living with a never-married parent has increased dramatically over time.21



Non-Marital Childbearing

       Since the 1965 Moynihan Report, many analysts have focused on family structure—the

absence of a parent and the attendant decline in financial, emotional and cognitive resources—as

an important source of social problems.22 Over time, while the birth rate has fallen, births to

unmarried women have risen until very recently.

       After rising dramatically since 1940, out-of-wedlock childbearing leveled off in the 1990s

but remains at a very high level.23 The number of births to unmarried women increased from

1.17 to 1.3 million between 1990 and 1999. The birthrate for unmarried women increased from

43.8 births per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15-44 years in 1990 to 46.9 in 1994, before falling

back to 43.9 in 1999.24 The percentage of all births to unmarried women has risen from 28% in

1990 to 33% in 1999, though it has been roughly constant at 32-33% since 1994. To put these

                                                    15
numbers in perspective, in 1940, this number was 3.8%.

        The birth rate for unmarried Black women has been higher than that of White unmarried

women (including Hispanic women), but this gap has narrowed in recent years because the birth

rate has grown at a faster pace for unmarried White women.25 In 1970, the rate for unmarried

Black women was roughly 7 times the rate for unmarried White women—96 per 1,000 versus 14

per 1,000. By 1998, the gap was reduced by 70%; it became 73 versus 38 per 1,000.

        Unfortunately, the birthrate for unmarried Hispanic women is only available for the

1990s, but it is the highest among the three demographic groups. In 1990, the birthrate for

unmarried Hispanic women was 89.6 per 1,000, peaked at 101.2 per 1,000, and fell to 90.1 per

1,000 in 1998.26

        The same trend holds for the percentage of births to unmarried mothers within each

race.27 In 1969, 5.5% of white children were born to unmarried mothers. The corresponding

percentage for blacks was 34.9%. By 1999, these numbers were 26.7% and 68.8%, respectively.

The percentage for Hispanics in 1999 was 42.1% versus 36.7% in 1990. Until recently,

unmarried births have been increasing overall, although the percentage due to minority mothers

has stabilized.28

        Single parenthood is much more prevalent for high school dropouts (see figure 6b and the

discussion in Ellwood and Jencks, 2002). Although the media has focused on celebrities who

choose single parenthood, the bulk of the single mothers have high school education or less and

the majority of this group consists of high school dropouts (see figure 6c). The incidence of

divorce is greater for this group as well.29 The percentage of children born to unmarried

teenagers has trended up dramatically over the past fifty years. Close to 10% of all children were

born to unmarried teenage mothers in 2000 (see figure 6d).

        Many pathologies are associated with less educated mothers and teenage mothers. They

                                                    16
are less likely to marry when they have children and they are more likely to divorce. Their

abilities, (see Armor, 2003), family incomes, and the emotional and intellectual support accorded

children are low. Figures 7a-b show that younger mothers provide less emotional and cognitive

stimulation for their children, as do mothers with less schooling (figures 7c-d). While the debate

is not settled as to which features of adverse family environments are most harmful to the success

of children, there is uniform agreement that poor environments adversely affect child outcomes.

       Other studies show the same pattern. Mayer analyzed child outcomes classified by a long

run measure of parental income.30 Low family income is associated with single parenthood,

divorce, reduced education, and low parental ability. Child test scores are greater for children

from higher income families. Teenage pregnancy and high school dropout rates are strongly

negatively correlated with family income. Young adult education, earnings, wage rates and

participation in social pathologies are much greater for children from poor families. Mayer does

not isolate which factors in the constellation of poverty are the main causes of poor child

outcomes; but the constellation has a clear association with adverse child outcomes.

       McLanahan and Sandefur focus on another aspect of childhood disadvantage: one-parent

vs. two-parent families. For a variety of data sets, and controlling for parental education, and

family size, they show that: 1) attrition from high school is higher31 , while test scores and school

expectations are lower for children from one parent families32 ; 2) college enrollment is lower33 ;

3) labor force and school withdrawal is greater for disadvantaged children34 ; and 4) teenage

pregnancy is greater.35 Ginther and Pollak extend their analysis to note that the real dichotomy is

that between children living with both biological parents vs. other family structures. Being raised

in an intact, two-parent family benefits child outcomes, relative to other family statuses.

       Armor presents evidence on a variety of home environmental factors and uses test scores

of children as the outcomes for his analysis. Test scores, taken at early ages, predict schooling

                                                     17
and many other outcomes (see Cameron and Heckman, 2001). Armor shows the gap in ability

and knowledge of math between children of teenage mothers and children of older mothers.36

The gaps are 20 points when he does not control for maternal ability and are smaller but still

important when he controls for parental ability (6 points higher ability leads a person to complete

two more years of school). His book demonstrates the importance of parental ability as well as

the additional negative effect of teenage pregnancy on child outcomes.

       Armor studies the effects of cognitive stimulation on child ability and math scores.37 He

goes part way toward isolating the factors characterizing adverse environments. Armor studies

the effects of various environmental factors on the ability and math achievement of children.38

Mothers’ ability plays an important role but even controlling for that effect, family environmental

factors play a substantial role in raising child test scores. Controlling for maternal ability, never-

wed mothers who provide above average cognitive stimulation to their children can largely offset

the circumstance of single parenthood in terms of their child’s cognitive outcomes. This evidence

is consistent with a large body of research reported in the National Research Council Report

Neurons to Neighborhoods (Shonkoff and Phillips; Carneiro, Heckman, and Masterov; and

Cunha, et al.).

       The growth of adverse childhood environments explains a substantial part of the problems

of schools, skills and crime in American society. It is especially problematic that poor

environments are more common in the minority populations on which America must depend for

the growth in its labor force (recall the data in table 1). Unless these environments are improved,

one cannot rely on a growth in the skills of these groups to propel growth in workforce quality at

the rate we have experienced in the past.



The Importance of Cognitive and Noncognitive Ability in Economic Life

                                                      18
        A large literature has established the importance of both cognitive and noncognitive

ability in social and economic life. Basic intelligence, acquired skills, social skills, self-control,

and persistence matter for success in life (see Heckman et al., 2006, for recent evidence). The full

implications of this body of evidence have not yet made their way into the design of economic

and social policy.

        Cameron and Heckman (1999, 2001) document that substantial gaps in the college-going

rates of different racial and ethnic groups, which are nominally due to gaps in parental family

income in the college-going years, are actually due to ability differences—that is, child college

readiness. Adjusting for ability, family income and tuition play only minor roles in accounting for

disparity in college attendance rates. This evidence explains why so many poor or disadvantaged

children fail to utilize the programs that subsidize the college tuitions of the disadvantaged.

        In the next section, we show that the ability gaps that explain college attendance gaps

open up early, before schooling begins. A school-based policy for eliminating these gaps is less

effective. Ability formed in the early years is also important in explaining crime, teenage

pregnancy and a variety of social pathologies. Figure 8a shows that women with low cognitive

ability are more likely to bear children when they are young. Figure 8b shows that low cognitive

ability is associated with a higher probability of incarceration. Ability also affects the economic

return to each year of schooling. Figures 8c-d show that mothers with low cognitive ability

provide less cognitive and emotional stimulation for their children. Finally, in their research,

Carneiro and Heckman (2003) show that the economic returns to one year of college for people

of different ability differ greatly.39 Those at the bottom 5% of the ability distribution get half of

the return to education of those at the top 5% of the ability distribution. Ability also affects wages

independently of schooling, as shown in Carneiro, Heckman, and Masterov.

        Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua analyze the changes in the probability of various outcomes

                                                       19
that are brought about by altering cognitive or noncognitive ability, holding the other constant.

Figure 9a, taken from their study, clearly shows that higher levels of both cognitive and

noncognitive skills are associated with lower rates of attrition from high school. For many

outcome measures in their study, increasing noncognitive ability by the same percentile has a

higher effect on outcomes than cognitive ability.

       Increasing noncognitive ability to the highest level reduces the probability of being a high

school dropout to virtually zero for females with average cognitive ability.40 The same argument

holds for other behavioral outcomes. Both types of ability have the same effect on reducing the

likelihood of spending time in jail by age 30 (see figure 9b). Figure 9c shows the same effect for

smoking. Figure 9d show this for teenage pregnancy. For this outcome, noncognitive ability is as

important as cognitive ability. 41



Human Ability and Its Determinants

       The recent synthesis of neuroscience and social science has produced a much deeper

understanding of the processes by which skills are formed over the life cycle, although much

remains to be known (see Shonkoff and Phillips; Knudsen et al.; and Cunha and Heckman, 2007).

The social science literature establishes that both cognitive and noncognitive abilities affect

schooling attainment, participation in welfare, teenage pregnancy and crime (see Heckman et al.,

2006, for a comprehensive analysis). More able and engaged parents produce more able children.

       The recent literature distinguishes between IQ and achievement tests. IQ approximates

intellectual capacity. Achievement tests capture knowledge in specific areas. IQ spurs

achievement. At the same time, persons more motivated to learn and more persistent, and those

who plan ahead—important aspects of noncognitive skills—also score higher on achievement

tests at the same level of IQ. Families produce both cognitive and noncognitive skills, and both

                                                     20
matter for the social and economic success of the child. Gaps among income and race groups

open up early and persist.

       Figure 10a presents the average percentile ranks on a math test administered at ages 6, 8,

10 and 12 for children from different income groups. The test measures a composite of raw IQ

and achievement.42 Gaps in ranks by family income are substantial overall. Figure 10b shows

that these differentials are greatly reduced when the scores are adjusted by mother’s IQ,

education, and intact family status. Similar adjustments appear when the mother’s status is

controlled for, and when other test scores are used. Enriched environments produce higher ability

children.43

       Figures 11a-b present parallel analyses for noncognitive skills. A high value of an

antisocial score stands for a range of behavioral problems. High scores are associated with low-

income environments; low scores with high-income environments. Again, gaps open up early

among income groups, and again, gaps can largely be eliminated by accounting for the quality of

the early environments facing the child.44 A large body of literature, surveyed in Carneiro and

Heckman (2003) and Cunha, et al., demonstrates that skill gaps open up early, before schooling

begins, and that these gaps are major determinants of social and economic success. The strong

association between family characteristics and child performance measured by cognitive and

noncognitive skills also demonstrates the value of a strategy targeted toward disadvantaged

families.



Implications of the Evidence on Ability for Skill Formation Policy

       The policy implications of the emerging body of evidence on the technology of human

skill formation are substantial. Conventional school-based policies start too late to effectively

remedy early deficits, although they can do some good. The best way to improve the schools is to

                                                     21
improve the early environments of the children sent to them.

       At current levels of funding, incremental expenditures on schooling quality are unlikely to

be effective. Table 6 is based on estimates of the effect of schooling on earnings from a paper by

Card and Krueger that greatly influenced recent California efforts to reduce class size. It shows

the discounted economic returns (i.e., effects on discounted lifetime income) to decreasing pupil-

teacher ratios by 5, but keeping the quality of students the same. Reducing pupil-teacher ratios is

frequently advocated to raise the performance of schools. Taking the most favorable estimates

reported by these advocates of schooling programs produces a net negative return, even if the

social cost of taxation used to fund schooling is ignored and optimistic estimates of aggregate

productivity growth are used. The cost of reducing class size would be better spent on giving

children a savings account. These calculations are too optimistic because they understate the full

costs of the policy, which would entail substantial increases in teacher salaries to hire the new

teachers, or lower the quality of teachers hired into the school system.45

       The celebrated Tennessee Star experiment produced, at best, marginal gains to

participants that did not survive a rigorous cost benefit analysis (see the discussions in Hanushek;

and Krueger). The widely discussed policy of improving schools by reducing pupil-teacher ratios

is unlikely to have substantial benefits unless the quality of the input going to school is improved

(see Carneiro and Heckman, 2003). The importance of family to the success in schools has been

known since the Coleman Report, but this wisdom has not yet found its way into policy.

       Tuition and family income support for families of children in the college-going years are

often proposed. The basis for this policy recommendation is the empirical regularity that child

college-going rates are inversely related to family income in the college-going years. This

empirical association is treated as a causal relationship which should guide policy. Politicians

around the world campaign on this issue. The recent literature, surveyed in Carneiro and

                                                     22
Heckman (2002, 2003), documents that at most 8% of American children are cash-constrained in

the college-going years. While a policy targeted to the cash-constrained has a high economic

return, it will not go far in promoting college attendance or reducing schooling among racial and

ethnic groups.

        As Carneiro and Heckman (2003), Cunha, et al. and Cunha and Heckman (2007)

document, the real credit constraint facing children is not the lack of access to funds for tuition

and room and board in the college-going years. Rather, it is the inability of children to borrow

against future income to buy a parental environment that will allow them to fulfill their potential.

It is the accident of birth.

        The empirical regularity that drives policy discussions has been misinterpreted. The

widely discussed correlation between parental income in the child’s college-going years and child

college participation arises only because it is lifetime resources that affect college readiness and

college-going, and family lifetime resources are strongly positively related to family resources

available to the adolescent in the college-going years.

        Government job training programs and GED programs are second chance efforts designed

to remedy the deficits caused by early childhood and schooling neglect. The GED program does

not confer benefits to very many of its participants (Heckman and LaFontaine, 2007). Job

training programs targeted at the disadvantaged do not produce high rates of return and fail to lift

participants out of poverty (See the evidence in Heckman, LaLonde and Smith; and in Martin and

Grubb, 2001). At current levels of funding, these programs are largely ineffective and cannot

remedy the skill deficits accumulated over a lifetime of neglect.

        Cunha and Heckman (2007), and Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach formalize the

technology of skill formation by families and estimate empirical models of dynamic skill

formation. They show that investments in children are complementary and that early investments

                                                     23
improve the return on later investments. The self productivity of early investment warrants more

investment in the young.

       Their analysis shows that the young receive highest returns to a dollar of investment.

Early skills breed later skills because early learning begets later learning. Both on theoretical and

empirical grounds, at current levels of funding, investment in the young is warranted. Returns are

highest for investments made at younger ages and remedial investments are often prohibitively

costly. Figure 12 summarizes their model and the findings of an entire literature. Returns for

disadvantaged children are highest for investments made at young ages. The optimal investment

profile declines with age. This pattern is true for all children. But more advantaged children

receive massive early investments from their parents that disadvantaged children do not receive.

Figure 12 shows the returns for human capital programs for the disadvantaged at current levels of

investment.

       This literature does not suggest that no investments should be made in schooling or post-

school on-the-job training. They are major sources of skill formation. Indeed, the

complementarity or synergism between investments at early and later ages suggests that early

investment has to be complemented by later investment to be successful. Currie and Thomas

suggest that the effects of early investment will dissipate unless it is followed by later investment.

If early investments are made, the returns to later investments will rise. Investment in the

preschool years raises the productivity of schooling and post-school job training. Cunha and

Heckman (2006) show that adolescent remediation for the effects of adverse early environments

is very costly and Cunha and Heckman (2007) present an analytical synthesis of the literature.

       However, the self-productivity of investment suggests that an optimal investment strategy

should focus investments in the early years compared to the later years. Carneiro and Heckman

(2003) argue as an empirical proposition in the U.S. that there is currently under-investment in

                                                     24
the young, especially in disadvantaged populations.46

       Two matters of concern arise in using this evidence to guide policy. First, it is

associational or correlational. It establishes empirical relationships that may or may not be causal.

Second, while family factors matter, it is far from obvious how to improve families. We cannot

easily raise the education of parents, nor can we improve their IQs.

       The evidence presented in Armor, in figures 10-11, and in the other studies reviewed here

suggests that early investment is productive. But traditionally, the early years of a child’s life are

the exclusive province of the family. The tough question is how to enrich the family and at the

same time preserve the benefits of parents? An accumulating body of evidence on voluntary

interventions points the way. We now turn to a review of the evidence on the benefits of these

voluntary interventions.

       In the past 40 years, many voluntary interventions have been devised to improve the early

years of children by supplementing the resources of disadvantaged families. These family

supplements do not actively intrude on family life, yet they enrich the early years of the child.

       Some of these interventions have been implemented using random assignment. Packages

of enriched environments are randomly assigned to children in disadvantaged environments,

while children in comparable families are randomly denied access to the enriched treatment.

When successfully implemented, randomization allows analysts to be more confident that the

empirical associations produced by the interventions are causal. The findings from this

experimental literature bolster the evidence from the associational literature that we have just

discussed.



Evidence from Enriched Preschool Programs

       Currie and Blau and Currie present comprehensive surveys of numerous preschool

                                                      25
programs and their measured effects.47 The programs they analyze vary, both in terms of age of

enrollment and age of exit. The effects, however, are generally consistent, although in some cases

only weak effects are found. Generally, performance of children in school is improved in terms

of less grade repetition, more graduation and higher test scores. Unfortunately, many of these

programs are not evaluated by following children into late adolescence or adulthood and looking

at their outcomes.

        Three programs have long-term follow-ups, and we focus on them here. They all target

high-risk children from disadvantaged families. The Chicago Child-Parent Centers (CPC), is a

half-day program on a large scale in the Chicago public schools. It is evaluated by a non-

experimental method (matching) and has a sample of about 1,500 children. The second program

is the Abecedarian program, a full-day, year-round educational child care program in Chapel Hill,

NC. It was evaluated by randomization and has 111 participants. Students are followed to age 21.

Finally, the High/Scope Perry Preschool is a small-scale half-day program in the Ypsilanti, MI

public schools. It was evaluated by experimental methods. Sample size is 123, and follow-up is to

age 27. CPC and Perry had a parental involvement component — Abecedarian did not.

        The programs differ by duration and child age of entry. Abecedarian started with young

children in the first months of life. Perry and the CPC program start with older children, 3 or 4-5

years old. The programs differ in intensity.48 It is also important to point out that the comparison

made in all of the studies is between children with enriched preschool environments and children

with ordinary early environments, some of whom may attend preschool and kindergarten, albeit

of a less intense variety.49



Program Descriptions

 Perry Preschool Experiment

                                                    26
       The Perry preschool experiment was an intensive preschool program administered to

randomly selected black children enrolled in the program over five different waves between 1962

and 1967. All the children came from Ypsilanti, MI. A control group provides researchers with

an appropriate benchmark to evaluate the effects of the preschool program.

       The assignment to the experimental group was performed in the following way.

Candidate families were identified from a census of the families of the students attending the

Perry school at the date of operation of the program, neighborhood group referrals and door-to-

door canvassing. Poor children who scored between 75 and 85 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test were

randomly divided into two undesignated groups.50 The children were then transferred across

groups to equalize the socioeconomic status, cognitive ability (as measured by the IQ test) and

gender composition of the samples. Finally, a coin was tossed to determine which group received

the treatment and which did not. Initially the treatment and control groups included 64 children

each, but the actual treatment and control groups contained 58 and 65 children, respectively.51

       Children entered the Perry School in five waves, starting with wave zero (of four-year-

olds) and wave one (of three-year-olds) in 1962, and then waves two, three and four (of three-

year-olds) entered in each subsequent year through 1965. The average age at entry was 42.3

months. With the exception of wave zero, treatment children spent two years attending the

program. In the final year of the program, 11 three-year-olds who were not included in the data

attended the program with the 12 4-year-olds who were. About half of the children were living

with two parents. The average mother was 29 years old and completed 9.4 years of school.

       The treatment consisted of a daily 2 1/2 hour classroom session on weekday mornings and

a weekly ninety-minute home visit by the teacher on weekday afternoons to involve the mother in

the educational process. The length of each preschool year was 30 weeks, beginning in mid-

October and ending in May. Ten female teachers filled the four teaching positions over the course

                                                    27
of the study, resulting in the average child-teacher ratio of 5.7 for the duration of the program.52

All teachers were certified to teach in elementary, early childhood or special education.53 If it

were administered today, the Perry preschool program would cost approximately $9,785 per

participant per year in 2004 dollars.



Abecedarian Project

       The Abecedarian Project recruited 111 children born between 1972 and 1977 whose 109

families scored high on the High Risk Index.54 It enrolls and intervenes in the lives of children

beginning a few months after birth. Enrollment is based on the characteristics of the families

more than on those of the children, as in the Perry program. Virtually all of the children were

Black, and their parents had low levels of education, income, cognitive ability and high levels of

pathological behavior. The children were screened for mental retardation. 76% of the children

lived in a single parent or multigenerational household. The average mother in this group was

less than 20 years old, completed 10 years of schooling and had an IQ of 85. There were four

cohorts of about 28 students each. By the time they were 6 weeks old, the children were assigned

randomly to either a preschool intervention or a control group. The mean age of entry was 4.4

months. At age 5—just as they were about to enter kindergarten—all of the children were

reassigned to either a school age intervention through age 8 or to a control group. This produced

4 distinct groups: children who experienced no intervention at all, those who experienced an

intervention when they were young, those who experienced an intervention when they were

older; and finally, those who enjoyed a high-quality intervention throughout their whole

childhood. The children were followed up until age 21.

       The Abecedarian program was more intensive than the Perry program. Its preschool

program was a year-round, full-day intervention. The initial infant-to-teacher ratio was 3:1,

                                                     28
though it grew to a child-to-teacher ratio of 6:1 as the kids progressed through the program.

Infants in the control group received an iron-fortified formula for 15 months and diapers as

needed to create an incentive for participation. Many of the control children were enrolled in

preschool and/or kindergarten.

        During the first three primary school years, a home-school teacher would meet with the

parents and help them provide supplemental educational activities at home. The teacher provided

a curriculum tailored specifically for each child. The target set for the parents was at least 15

minutes per day of supplementary activities. This home-school teacher would also serve as a

liaison between the teachers and the family, and she would interact with the parents and the

teachers about every two weeks. She would also help the family deal other issues that might

improve their ability to care for the child, such as finding employment, navigating the

bureaucracy of social services agencies, and transporting children to appointments. Data were

collected regularly up to age 21. In terms of 2004 dollars, it cost roughly $15,000 per year.



 Chicago Child-Parent Center and Expansion Program

        The Chicago Child-Parent Center was not evaluated by the method of random assignment

but by matching treated children to comparable nontreated children on the basis of age, eligibility

for intervention, and family socioeconomic status. It was started in 1967, in 11 public schools

serving impoverished neighborhoods of Chicago. Using federal funds, the center provided half-

day preschool program for 3- and 4-year-olds during the 9 months that they were in school. The

program provided an array of services, including health and social services, and free meals. It

also sought to include the parents, including helping the parents complete school, home visits and

field trips.

        In 1978, state funding became available, and the program was extended through third

                                                     29
grade and included full-day kindergarten. Eventually, 24 centers provided preschool and after-

school activities, up to second or third grade. This is the period during which the sample analyzed

by Reynolds, et al. was enrolled in the program. The preschool program ran 3 hours per day

during the week for the nine months that school was in session, and usually included a six-week

summer program.

          During the kindergarten years, more services were provided at the affiliated school.

Teacher-child ratios were 17:2 for the preschool component and 25:2 for kindergarten.

Participation during the primary years was open to any child in the school. Program participants

experienced reduced class sizes of 25 rather than 35 or more. Teachers’ aides, extra instructional

materials, and enrichment activities were also available. Some children continued to participate in

CPC through age 9, for a maximum of 6 years.55 93% of the children were black and 7% were

Hispanic. Costs were considerably less, but intensity was correspondingly lower. (See Cunha

et al.)



Lessons from Early Interventions

          These and other studies of interventions for children from low-income families find that

participants experienced higher achievement test scores, decreased grade retention, reduced time

in special education, less crime and delinquency and increased high school graduation. The gains

vary with quality and age at which the program is started, and there are important differences by

the sex of the child.

          Programs differ in the measures they use to evaluate the outcomes. As a result, it is hard

to compare the programs using a standard basket of benefits. The CPC program had significant

effects on high school graduation rates, reductions in special (remedial) education, grade

repetition and juvenile arrest (figure 13).

                                                      30
       The Perry Preschool Program is the flagship intervention. Children are followed through

age 40, with data collected annually from ages 3-11, and again at ages 14, 15, 19, 27 and 40.56

The boost in IQ faded by the time the children were in second grade (see figure 14a), but the

program had substantial effects on educational achievement. Test scores for the treatment group

were consistently and significantly higher through age 14, and as were literacy scores at 19 and

27. Participants had higher grades and were more likely to graduate from high school.

Substantially less time was spent in special education or in repeating grades, and high school

graduation rates of participants improved (figure 14b).

       Participants were more likely to be employed, to earn more (figure 14c), and they were

less dependent on welfare.57 There was substantially less crime among participants (figure

14d)—both in terms of incidence and severity, a recurrent finding of early intervention programs

(recall the evidence summarized in table 5). However, there was no significant difference in

grade retention by age 27 between the two groups. Teenage pregnancy was lower, and marriage

rates were higher by age 27 for program participants.

       The Abecedarian program appears to have had an effect on IQ, but it is concentrated

primarily among girls.58 Figure 15a shows the overall IQ gap between treatments and controls. It

is persistent over ages. The Abecedarian program intervenes in the very early years, and it is

known that IQ is malleable when children are very young (see e.g., Armor; and the references in

Cunha and Heckman, 2007). This message is reinforced by the fact that the IQ boost was not

found among children who only experienced the later intervention. Comparable effects are found

for reading (figure 15b) and math achievement scores (figure 15c). The test score effects persist

through age 21, which is the last age analyzed.

       Figure 15d shows that there were substantial academic benefits. Treatment group

members participated less in remedial special education at age 15 and repeated fewer grades at all

                                                    31
ages. High school graduation and four-year college participation rates were high. Participants

were less likely to smoke and had better jobs (see figure 15e).

       Table 7 presents estimated costs and benefits of the Perry and Chicago programs with

benefits discounted at a 3% rate. All figures are in 2004 dollars. The benefits vary among

programs.59 Perry produced some gain to parents in terms of reduced child care costs, and

earnings gains for participants were substantial. The K-12 benefit arises from the increment in

student quality and is a reduction in special education costs. This benefit is substantial across all

programs. The college/adult category represents the extra tuition paid by students who go to

college. Crime represents the reduction in direct costs (incarceration and criminal justice system)

as well as damage done to victims. This excludes transfers. Welfare effects are modest. Future

Generation (FG) Earnings represents the improvement in the earnings of the children of the

program participants. Smoking and health benefits were not measured in the Perry and Chicago

data. For Abecedarian, there were substantial effects, including major differences in smoking

rates. CPC documents a decline in child abuse and the costs of treating abused children. The costs

of Perry are substantial but per year are about the average cost of expenditure on public school

students. CPC per year costs about $6,796 for the preschool and $3,428 for the school-age

component (in 2004 dollars). The reported benefit-cost ratios are substantial: 9 to 1 for Perry; 8 to

1 for Chicago CPC. Rolnick and Grunewald claim that the annual rate of return for Perry is 4%

for participants and 12% for society at large, for a total of 16%.

       Much more research is needed on Perry, CPC, and a wide variety of other early childhood

program results.60 Results from these programs need to be put on a common footing to

understand better the differences in samples, treatments, and effects.61 A much more careful

analysis of the effects of scaling up the model programs to the target population, and its effects

on costs, has to be undertaken before these estimates can be considered definitive.

                                                     32
       The gain from the pilot programs is a lower bound on the potential benefit of intervening

in the early years: although the costs are well established, many of the benefits cannot be

precisely monetized. For instance, we do not yet have a full accounting of how the children of the

participants will respond to the intervention, and neglecting this likely understates its effect.

Extrapolating from old, small, and local programs to large, national ones in the future is

precarious business—a fact often neglected in the early childhood literature. The benefits of these

interventions appear to be sufficiently large that the actual or potential program may remain cost-

effective even after a large reduction in its efficacy.



The Case for Early Intervention

       Without claiming to offer a monolithic explanation for the origins of the major social

problems discussed in this paper, we nonetheless point out the important role of disadvantaged

families in producing less educated and less motivated persons and in producing persons more

prone to participate in crime. A large literature establishes that children from disadvantaged

homes are less educated and more likely to participate in social pathologies, including crime. In

the past forty years or so, the American family has come under stress. Relatively more American

children are being raised in the adverse environments that produce less educated and less skilled

individuals and persons more likely to commit crime and participate in socially deviant behavior.

       American society has traditionally appealed to the schools to remedy what failed families

produce. Current policies such as the No Child Left Behind Act are premised on using schools to

remedy the consequences of disadvantaged families. Schools can only work with what families

give them. Successful schools are those that teach children from functioning families.

       In addition, the current emphasis in American schools is on test scores, and tests ignore

crucial noncognitive components of motivation, persistence and self-control that successful

                                                      33
families foster in their children. Both cognitive and noncognitive skills are important for success

in school and in life.62 The enriched early childhood interventions have had their greatest

impacts on creating motivation and successful attitudes among participants — traits usually

ignored in discussions of educational policy.

       A large body of empirical work at the interface of neuroscience and social science has

established that fundamental cognitive and noncognitive skills are produced in the early years of

childhood, long before children start kindergarten. The technology of skill formation developed

by economists shows that learning and motivation are dynamic, cumulative processes. 63

Schooling comes too late in the life cycle of the child to be the main locus of remediation for the

disadvantaged. Public schools focus only on tested academic knowledge and not the noncognitive

behavioral components that are needed for success in life. Schools cannot be expected to

duplicate what a successfully functioning family gives its children. Parental environments play a

crucial part in shaping the lives of children.

       Later remediation of early deficits is costly, and often prohibitively so.64 Remedial

schooling, public sector job training programs, and second chance GED programs are largely

ineffective at current levels of funding. While these programs can be improved, and do help a

few, they are not cost-effective when compared with alternative policies.

       Families matter. But most Americans are justifiably reluctant to intervene in the early

years and prefer to respect the sanctity of the family. In the past forty years, American society has

experimented with voluntary enriched family supplementation programs, which offer children

from disadvantaged environments some of the cognitive and emotional stimulation and

enrichment given by more advantaged families.

       Children who received these enriched environments were followed into adulthood.

Comparing their social and economic outcomes to those of similar children denied access to these

                                                     34
environments by randomization, one finds that the treated children perform better at school, are

less likely to drop out of school, and are more likely to graduate high school and to attend

college. The treated children are less likely to be teenage mothers and foster a new generation of

deprived children. They are less likely to be on welfare and less likely to smoke or use drugs.

Treated students have higher test scores. A principal benefit of early childhood intervention is in

shaping the noncognitive skills - behavior, motivation and self control - that are not considered an

important outcome of the schooling curriculum in current policy discussions.

       The estimated rate of return to the Perry preschool program is about 16%. This includes

benefits from reduced remediation and reduced crime, as well as the increased earnings of the

participant. All of the children targeted for intervention are of low ability. While much work

remains to be done to bolster the case for wide-scale application of these programs to

disadvantaged families, the current evidence is powerfully suggestive, if not yet definitive, that

large-scale programs will be effective. None of this evidence supports universal preschool

programs.

       It is important to note what we are not saying. We do not claim that all skills and

motivations are formed in the early years, nor that schools and firms do not matter in producing

effective people. We are also not offering any claims that the early years are the sole

determinants of later success, or that persons who are raised in disadvantaged families should be

absolved of any guilt when they participate in crime. We are simply arguing that early

environments play a large role in shaping later outcomes and that their importance is neglected in

current policy. The recent evidence on the technology of human skill formation establishes that

enriched early environments need to be followed up by good schooling and workplace learning

environments. Complementarity of investments at different ages is an intrinsic feature of the

human skill formation process. Enriching the early years will promote the productivity of schools

                                                    35
by giving teachers better-quality students. Improving the schools will in turn, improve the quality

of the workforce.

       The available evidence on the technology of skill formation shows the self-productivity of

early investment. Figure 12 summarizes the argument. At current levels of public support,

America under-invests in the early years of its disadvantaged children. Redirecting funds toward

the early years is a sound investment in the productivity and safety of American society, and also

removes a powerful source of inequality.

nonmarital childbearing is considerably higher then the number reported in this paper. In

recent years, their estimate is approximately 10 percentage points higher than what we

mothers, so it is less useful for the type of analysis that we want to perform. Hence we

will use the more conservative estimate.

        14
             The extra year of school is assumed to take place during high school years. The

effect of an extra year of kindergarten or college is likely to be rather different.
        15
             Lochner and Moretti use estimates of victim costs and property losses taken

from Miller, Cohen, and Wiersema, which are based on jury awards in civil suits. Some

costs cannot be quantified accurately or are unobservable. These include costs of

precautionary behavior, private security expenditures, some law enforcement and judicial

costs (i.e., costs that are not related to dealing with particular crimes) and the cost of drug

offenses. Some crimes are also omitted from the analysis.
        16
             Incarceration cost per crime is equal to the incarceration cost per inmate

multiplied by incarceration rate for that crime (approximately $17,000).
        17
             It is important to note that this is a steady state calculation. The payoff to pre-K

interventions shows up 10-15 years later, whereas the effects of increasing police on

crime are more immediately realized. The discounted returns from the two policies are

less different, but a 5:1 gap can tolerate a lot of discounting and still be substantial.
        18
             Lochner and Moretti actually present a comparison of flow costs ($80,000 per

year on a police officer) with a one time stock cost ($600,000 to educate 100 new high




                                                     47
school students at a cost of $6,000 per year assuming that dropouts get 11 years of

school). Cameron and Heckman (2001) estimate 10.6 years. Assuming a 40-year working

life (including criminal career life) the annual replacement flow cost is $15,000 a year

($6,000×2.5). Even cutting the career life in half produces a flow cost that is less than

hiring a policeman. Spending $9,000 per year (to account for the 1.5 year gap between

high school dropouts and graduates) still makes education cost effective. The evidence

from the Perry Preschool Program suggests that our calculation is conservative. At a cost

of $9,000 (2004) per participant, the high school graduation rate was raised by .17 from

.60. To get 2.5 more students to graduate requires that we spend only $5300 per pupil.

Foregone earnings in high school are small and are offset by the rise.

              Table A6, from Currie, describes some of the main programs, evaluated by

randomized assignment, and their consequences. Table A7 shows the effects of large-

scale public early childhood programs which were not evaluated by randomized

assignment.
         48
              See Table A8.
         49
              Arguably the experimental studies understate the value of early childhood

interventions against “no intervention” because some of the control group children

received treatment. See Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith for an additional discussion of

randomization.
         50
              Poverty status was determined by a formula that considered rooms per person in

the child’s household, parental schooling and occupational level. The IQ range was

labeled as “borderline educable mentally retarded” by the state of Michigan at the time of

the experiment. Only children without an organic mental handicap were included in the

study.




                                                     50
        51
             Some aspect of the assignment was clearly nonrandom. First, younger children

were assigned to the same group as their older siblings. Two treatment children were

transferred to the control group because their mothers were not able to participate in any

classes or home visits because they were employed far from home. Four treatment

children left the program before completing the second year of preschool when their

families relocated and one control child died. Thus, the final sample consisted of 123

children came from 100 families. In the control group, 41 families contributed 1 child

each, and 12 families contributed 2 children each. In the treatment group, 39 families

contributed 1 child apiece, 6 families contributed 2 children apiece, 1 family contributed 3

and another 4 children. Assigning younger siblings to the same group effectively made

the family, rather than the individual, the unit of analysis. Still, it is difficult to argue that

assigning siblings at random would have been a better strategy. So-called spillovers to the

control siblings from home visits would have been one possible source of bias since

mothers cannot be expected to treat siblings in accordance with their experimental status.

Another potential source of bias is spillover from one sibling to another. In any case,

differences in background characteristics between the two experimental groups are

virtually nonexistent, with the exception of much higher rates of maternal employment at

program entry in the treatment group.




                                                    51
       52
            This number is low relative to other early education experiments. For instance,

the student-teacher ratio for the Chicago Child-Parent Center and Expansion Program

ranged from 8 to 12 (see Fuerst and Fuerst).
       53
            Schweinhart, Barnes, and Weikart argue that the certification of the teachers is

an important component in the success of the Perry preschool.
       54
            The factors that were considered consisted of weighted measures of maternal

and paternal education levels, family income, absence of the father from the home, poor

social or family support for the mother, indication that older siblings have academic

problems, the use of welfare, unskilled employment, low parent IQ, family members who

sought counseling or support from various community agencies. Parental income and

education were considered most important in calculating the index.
       55
            These costs depend on the stage of the program and are presented in detail in the

next section.
       56
            See Schweinhart, et al. for a summary of results up through age 40.
       57
            The difference in employment rates was only significant at age 19.

than boys.

            There is a cost benefit study of the Abecedarian program (Barnett and Masse),

but it is highly speculative, so that we did not include it here.

inmate, $17,027 (U.S. Department of Justice, 1999), multiplied by the
incarceration rate (U.S. Department of Justice, 1994). Total costs are
calculated as the sum of victim costs and incarceration costs less 80% of
the property loss (already included in victim costs) for all crimes except
arson. Total costs for arson are the sum of victim costs and incarceration
costs since there is no transfer of property between victim and criminal.
Estimated changes in crimes adjust the arrest effect by the number of
crimes per arrest. The social benefit is the estimated change in crimes
times the total cost per crime. All dollar figures are adjusted to $2004

Note: All values, in 1990 dollars, are given as net present values at age 8 of an individual; costs
of schooling improvements are incurred between ages 6 and 18 and benefits from increased
earnings occur between ages 19 and 65. Data for costs are from NCES 1993. Costs of adding
new teachers include salaries and capital, administrative, and maintenance expenditures.
Estimates of increases in earnings resulting from a decreasing the pupil-teacher ration by 5
pupils per teacher come from Card and Krueger (1992, table 3) which produces a range of
estimated earnings increase from about 1 to 4 percent, whereas most of the estimates are in the
1 to 2 percent range, which we use in this paper. To capture the benefits of smaller class sizes,
students must attend twelve years of higher-quality schooling. We calculate the costs for one
year of improvements and then calculate the present value of the costs over the twelve years of
school attendance.

Notes: All values discounted at 3% and are in 2004 dollars. Numbers differ
slightly from earlier estimates because Future Generations (FG) Earnings
for Perry and CPC were estimated using the ratio of FG Earnings Effect to
Earnings Effect (about 15%) that was found in Abecedarian.
