                                          ABSTRACT

The regulation of many activities depends on whether societies consider them morally
controversial or “repugnant”. Not only have regulation and related ethical concerns changed over
time, but there is also heterogeneity across countries at a given time. We provide evidence of this
heterogeneity for three morally contentious activities: abortion, prostitution and gestational
surrogacy, and explore the relationship between a country’s economic conditions and how these
activities are regulated. We propose a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms that can
explain our findings (including the role of non-economic factors), and indicate directions for
future research.

Introduction
Countries restrict or prohibit many activities and transactions on moral grounds under the
assumption that most people consider these activities ethically unacceptable or repugnant (Roth
2007). Examples include such activities as abortion, same-sex marriage, prostitution, payments
for blood and organs, gestational surrogacy, child labor, and indentured servitude. The ethical
issues associated with these activities include the concern that the individuals engaging in the
transaction are exploited or coerced into participating, that the transaction implies the
objectification of the human body, or that the activity violates human dignity, the sanctity of life
or traditional institutions such as marriage. These concerns may be among those “sacred” values
that, since at least Durkheim (1893), have been thought as important to define common identities
and tie societies together. However, prohibitions also imply costs for the parties who would
otherwise engage in a given trade and for society more generally. Prohibiting payments to organ
donors, for example, creates supply shortages and results in many patients waiting years for a
life-saving organ and even dying without obtaining one (Becker and Elias 2007; Lacetera, Macis
and Slonim 2013; Elias, Lacetera and Macis 2015a-b). Moreover, prohibition typically increases
the underground performance of certain activities, potentially compromising the safety of the
participants, often leading to crime and thus requiring resources for law enforcement. 1
    Moreover, countries differ in whether and how they regulate morally controversial activities,
and in many countries the legislation changes over time. For example, payments to plasma
donors are legal in the United States but not in neighboring Canada; Germany prohibited
prostitution until 2002 when the country passed legislation to allow it, whereas in Austria the
exchange of sex for money has been legal since the 1970s; commercial surrogacy is permitted in
countries as different as Armenia and the United States, and is illegal in equally heterogeneous
jurisdictions such as Albania, Canada and Italy.
    In this paper we explore the relationship between economic development and the regulation
of three morally contentious activities: abortion, prostitution and gestational surrogacy. Studies
in different disciplines have addressed legal, ethical and sociological questions related to these

1
  Grimes et al. (2006) study the consequences of illegal abortions on maternal mortality (before Roe vs. Wade,
abortion was “one of the most common forms of illegal activity practiced in the United States” [Howell Lee, 1972)].
See also WHO (2011). Miron and Zweibel (1995) discuss how prohibition of drug and alcohol consumption
increases crime and violence. Becker and Elias (2007) describe how prohibiting payments to organ donors leads to
black markets. Cunningham and Shah (2015) show that criminalizing prostitution increases violence and
transmission of sexually transmitted infections.
activities. 2 However, these issues have received less attention from economists. In particular,
there is still a limited understanding of what explains the heterogeneity in the regulation of
morally contentious or “taboo” activities across countries and over time. We provide a
systematic documentation of the regulation of abortion, prostitution and surrogacy around the
world, as a first step toward categorizing the regulation of a greater number of ethically
controversial activities, and analyze some of the factors related to the different approaches over
time and across countries.
    We focus on abortion, prostitution and surrogacy for three main reasons. First, unlike other
transactions that are nearly universally illegal (e.g., organ sales or indentured servitude), there is
large variation across countries and over time in whether and how abortion, prostitution and
surrogacy are regulated. Second, this set of activities include a non-monetary one (abortion), an
essentially monetary transaction (prostitution), and an activity that may or may not involve
monetary compensation (altruistic vs. commercial surrogacy). Third, in spite of the differences,
all of these activities principally concern women and their bodies; this implies some
commonalities in the underlying ethical and economic factors involved.
    A first set of moral issues about abortion, prostitution and surrogacy regard the potential
exploitation or coercion of the participants. Concerns include whether women who sell sex or
make their womb available to carry somebody else’s child make a truly voluntary choice, or
whether a woman should be forced to have a baby when she does not want it. Moreover, these
activities may violate some sacred values, such as the sanctity of life, the belief that sex should
be performed only to procreate, or that the only moral way to conceive a child is through sex
within marriage. In the case of prostitution and surrogacy, a further concern is that the presence
of a monetary exchange contaminates an activity otherwise not repugnant (having sex or having
a baby). Finally, the debate about these activities and transactions involves deep questions
regarding women’s rights to decide in full autonomy what to do with their bodies.
    There are several channels through which economic development could impact the
legislation about these activities. The impossibility of terminating an undesired pregnancy is
arguably a higher economic burden to women and couples in higher-income countries, due to the

possible consequences in terms of missed education and labor market opportunities (Becker
1960). 3 Similarly, improved health care makes abortion procedures safer, and this would
increase demand for legal abortions. On the other hand, improved contraception methods and
access might reduce the demand for abortion. 4 Turning to surrogacy, by overcoming biological
constraints, women and couples can delay having a child to pursue their careers (Lee 2009); this
could lead to more acceptance and liberal legislation on gestational surrogacy as a country's
economy grows. Economic development could also impact the regulation of prostitution. In
particular, improvements in communication technologies can create safer conditions for the
exchange of sex for money (for example facilitating identification and allowing demand and
supply to meet at pre-specified indoors locations rather than on the street in red-light districts).
Better health care systems also make it possible for the health authorities to periodically monitor
the health of sex workers, which increases the desirability of legalized sex transactions.
Additional mechanisms might also provide a link between development and the regulation of
these activities and transactions. Economic development often comes with an expansion of
individual rights, in particular for previously marginalized groups, including women (Duflo
2012, Jayachandran 2015). This could in turn produce more permissive regulations of abortion,
gestational surrogacy and prostitution insofar as these activities are viewed as an expression of
women’s autonomy. In some cases, the expansion of certain rights could induce changes in other
areas. For example, as more jurisdictions allow same-sex marriage, the demand for gestational
surrogacy increases, potentially leading to changes in its regulation. On the other hand, an
increased attention toward preventing undue coercion or exploitation might instead lead to
restricting such activities as prostitution or commercial surrogacy if there is a belief that women
engaging in these transactions do not do it in full freedom. Moreover, these activities may be
seen as a threat to human dignity, which in turn may be a more relevant concern in countries
with better economic conditions.

  Finer et al. (2005) report that 73% of women who had an abortion in the US mention “Can’t afford a baby now” as
(on of) the reason(s); 38 percent mention “it would interfere with education” and 39% that “it would interfere with
job/employment/career”.
4
  Better technology also improves the detection of abnormalities in the fetus, which could increase the demand for
abortion. On the other hand, improved medical care and social programs might make it easier to care for children
who are born with physical or mental deficiencies. However, fetal defects motivate a relatively small share of
abortions (Finer et al. report that only 13% of women who had an abortion in the US mention “possible problems
affecting the health of the fetus”).




                                                        3
       More generally beyond these three specific cases, different economic conditions might affect
the costs and benefits of the activities, and therefore the desirability of prohibition (Elias et al.
2016). For example, medical advances make kidney transplantation safer, thus increasing the
social cost of organ shortages. Economic development also has income effects that can modify
social values, transforming transactions that were morally unacceptable into acceptable, or vice
versa. 5 Also, if income effects increase the demand for safety, societies will be more likely to
legalize activities and transactions that would occur nonetheless, only in (often) less safe
conditions. Moreover, economic development typically implies an increasing role of markets in
society (Baumol 2002), possibly leading to greater acceptance of economic transactions in areas
where they were previously unacceptable.
       In the next section we describe the data that we assembled on the regulation of abortion,
prostitution and gestational surrogacy in a large number of countries for the period 1960-2015. In
Sections II and III we present our analyses of the relationship between these regulations and
economic development, which we measure with GDP per capita; we also explore whether and
how cultural and historical features of a country such as the prevailing religion, the legal origin,
the type of political regime, and the recognition of women’s economic and political rights
contribute to explaining the variation in regulations and their relationship with economic
development. Although we make no claims of causality, we identify several suggestive patterns,
and, based on these findings, we propose in Section IV a conceptual framework to organize our
thinking and identify possible mechanisms. In the concluding section we discuss directions for
future research, including our ongoing efforts to build, and make publicly available, a
comprehensive dataset on the legislation of several other morally contentious activities.


I. Data
We collected information on the legislation regarding abortion, prostitution, and surrogacy for a
large number of countries from 1960 to 2015. Building this dataset required combining different
sources as well as different methodologies – from merging existing datasets to hand-collecting
and codifying primary sources such as legislative texts. We are making the dataset available and
hope that it will be useful for future research. 6

    For example, Zelizer (1979) considers the case of life insurance contracts in the United States.

    The Data Appendix provides details about the data and our classifications.




                                                             4
    We compiled information on abortion laws mostly based on information from the Population
Policy Data Bank maintained by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and
Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat; however in some cases we completed the data
using country-specific legislation sources (see the Data Appendix for more detail). For each
country and year, our dataset reports whether a law regulating abortion exists, whether the
existing law allows termination of a pregnancy at all (beyond to save the mother’s life), and, if
so, under what conditions. We organized the various reasons for the termination of pregnancy
into five categories: 1) to protect the mother’s health (physical and/or mental), 2) if the fetus
presents serious genetic, mental, or physical defects, 3) in case the pregnancy is the result of rape
or incest, 4) in consideration of socio-economic reasons (e.g., the mother’s poverty or her young
age), and 5) upon request by the pregnant woman. 7 In most of our analyses we group conditions
2 and 3 together in one category, and we do the same for 4 and 5.
    Regarding prostitution, we relied mainly on information from the Country Reports on Human
Rights Practices (U.S. Department of State, 2008); in several cases we integrated this
information with country-specific searches for national legislation. We determined whether a law
regulating the exchange of sex for money was in place in a given country-year, and, for the
countries where a law existed, we classified countries into three groups: 1) prostitution is illegal,
2) prostitution is not illegal but brothels and pimping are prohibited, and 3) prostitution, brothels
and/or pimping are not illegal.
    Finally, to obtain information on the regulation of gestational surrogacy, we assembled data
from various sources, including a comparative study on the regime of surrogacy in EU Member
States by the European Parliament (Brunet et al. 2013), a book by Trimmings and Beaumont
(2013), the IFFS Surveillance Report of 2013 (IFFS 2013) and, in most of the cases, we used
country-specific legislation and references. By combining information from these sources, we
determined whether in each country, in a given year, there was a law governing surrogacy
arrangements or not, and if a law exists, whether it prohibits all forms of surrogacy, allows only
                                                                                                      8
altruistic surrogacy, or legalizes both altruistic and commercial surrogacy.                              Commercial

7
  In countries where abortion is allowed for reasons 5) and/or 6), regulations establish time limits by which the
abortion can be legally performed, typically setting the limit around week 12 of the pregnancy. We did not consider
these legislative details in lour analyses.
8
  Where commercial surrogacy is allowed, the activity is strictly regulated. In most countries, there are age limits for
the surrogate mother, she is required to have had at least one child of her own, and there is a maximum number of
times that she can serve as a surrogate (for more detailed information refer to the Data Appendix).




                                                           5
surrogacy includes the possibility to compensate the surrogate mother in addition to reimbursing
for medical expenses, whereas a regime of altruistic surrogacy prohibits such additional
compensation.
   Figure 1a reports the share of countries, between 1960 and 2015, which belong to one of the
categories above in terms of abortion regulation. In 1960, about half of the countries did not have
any regulation regarding abortion; by 2015, a law existed in virtually every country. Of the
countries with legislation, about half prohibited abortion (or allowed it only to save the mother’s
life) in 1960, and less than 20% allowed pregnancies to be terminated on request or for socio-
economic reasons. In 2015, by contrast, abortion was illegal in only a quarter of the countries,
whereas about 40% of the countries allowed it upon request or for socio-economic reasons.
   In 1960 only about 10% of countries had legislation regulating prostitution (Figure 1b),
against almost 60% in 2015. Among countries with legislation, the proportions of countries
prohibiting or allowing prostitution is similar at the two ends of the time period that we consider,
with about 60% having formal legislation prohibiting the exchange of sex for money, about 30%
allowing it but prohibiting brothels and pimping, and about 10% of the countries allowing also
the exercise of brothels and pimping.
   Figure 1c shows that legislation on surrogacy was first adopted in some countries only in the
mid-1980s; in fact, non-traditional forms of gestational surrogacy have become possible only
recently, thanks to innovations such as in-vitro fertilization. According to our data, in 2015,
legislation was present in 35 countries. Of these, 15 currently prohibit any kind of surrogacy, 10
allow only altruistic surrogacy, and 10 allow both altruistic and commercial surrogacy.

Note: See the Appendix for details about the data and the sample.




       A common trend for all three activities is therefore that more countries, over time, explicitly
legislated about these issues. However, if in the case of abortion the adoption of legislation
became in general more permissive over time, for prostitution and surrogacy often countries
introduced legislation to explicitly prohibit these activities. At the other extreme and to a lesser
extent, more recent legislation on prostitution and surrogacy has also allowed the most
permissive approaches, by permitting the operating of brothels and commercial surrogacy. These
patterns are consistent with a “bimodal” nature of preferences on these issues. Particularly in the
case of abortion, where individuals typically hold a strong view on the issue – either one favors
or opposes it - we observe that in the majority of cases the countries either prohibit abortion
outright, or allow it upon request (Medoff, Dennis and Bishin 1995). 9
       We now explore whether economic development correlates with these legislations, after
controlling for the overall time trends just discussed and for other relevant historical, cultural and
political factors.

    We do not have information regarding a country’s stance on abortion in the absence of formal legislation.

II. Regulations and Economic development
To explore the link between regulations and economic development we examine the relationship
between the legislation for an activity and GDP per capita. In spite of some limitations, GDP per
capita is widely used as an indicator for the broader construct of “economic development”
(Fleurbaey 2009). Moreover, in our context this indicator of a country’s “standard of living”
appropriately measures some of the mechanisms that, as we discussed above, could lead
economic development to be associated with the regulation of repugnant activities.
     For abortion and prostitution, we present an econometric analysis where we estimate
functions that can be expressed as Legislationajt = f(GDPjt, Xjt, λt, εjt), where the dependent
variable Legislationajt represents the regulatory status for activity a in country j in year t. Xjt
includes other variables of interest, described below. We also include time effects λt to control
for possible aggregate trends (Figure 1 above shows the presence of these trends). Because of the
categorical (and not straightforward to rank-order) nature of the outcome variables, we estimate
the relationships within a pooled multinomial logit framework. We then use the estimated
parameters to compute predicted probabilities for each country-year observations to belong to
one of the possible categories. Unfortunately, this analysis is difficult to perform for gestational
surrogacy because, as seen above, to date only a limited set of countries have legislation in place
regulating this activity. Therefore, for surrogacy we will present a more descriptive analysis.
     On the right-hand side of our regression equation our measure of economic development is
the natural logarithm of GPD per capita for country j in time t. We collected this information for
the World Development Indicators (World Bank 2012). 10 The other variables that we include in
the model, in addition to the year dummies, include a set of country-year characteristics that are
likely to affect the regulatory choices discussed here: the predominant religion in a country at a
given time, a country’s legal origin, the presence of a democratic regime, as well as measures of
women’s economic and political rights in a particular society and period. 11 All major religions
condemn abortion as immoral because they view it as the taking of an innocent life. Some
religions (and denominations within religions) make exceptions when the mother’s life is in
danger or in the presence of other special circumstances (e.g., in the presence of severe fetal
defects, or when the conception was the result of incest), but abortion “on request” is nearly

11
  These variables were taken from the Quality of Government Standard Database 2016 (Teorell et al. 2016). More
details are given below.




                                                      9
universally condemned by all major religions. Most faiths, including Christianity and Islam,
view sex as a sacred act intended for procreation and that should be reserved to married couples,
and therefore consider prostitution as immoral. Similarly, surrogacy is considered immoral on
the grounds that a child should be the outcome of marital love, and that gestational surrogacy
violates the dignity of the surrogate and the child (the Catholic Church's 2008 instruction
Dignitas Personae establishes that techniques that represent an “aid to the conjugal act” to
achieve fertility are permitted, whereas all techniques of heterologous artificial fertilization
(including surrogacy) are not permitted; as for Islam, the Turkish Religious Council, for
example, equated surrogacy to adultery, see Dogan News Agency, 2015). In the analysis we
separate observations in three groups: countries-years where more than 50% of the population
are Catholics, countries where more than 50% are Muslim, and all the others. The first two
groups include countries where the absolute majority of the population profess religions that
strongly condemn the three activities that we consider in our paper, whereas the third group
includes countries with more religious diversity where it is less likely that regulations will be
affected by religious values.
   Our “legal origin” variable classifies countries into five groups: English Common Law,
French Commercial Code, Socialist/Communist Laws, German Commercial Code, and
Scandinavian Commercial Code. Previous studies identified that a country’s legal origin
influences regulations, policies and economic outcomes (La Porta et al. 2008), and that it is a
construct separate from cultural (including religion), political or historical factors. Indeed, the
two major legal origin groups, the English and French, each include a large and heterogeneous
set of countries. The German group also includes a heterogeneous, although smaller, set of
countries. The remaining two groups, however, include smaller and more homogeneous
countries. The Scandinavian group includes only five countries in Scandinavia, and the countries
in the Socialist group share the historical experience of having been part of the Soviet Union or
the Soviet bloc, which might have long lasting effects beyond those caused by the origin of their
legal system. Countries with different legal traditions differ in their approach to the private
contracting rights of individuals, as well as in the role of case law in producing rules with
broader validity. In particular, in English Common Law systems, judicial decisions have
precedential value on future cases, which might make such systems more responsive to demands
arising from citizens compared to systems that require acts from the legislative branch to produce




                                                10
laws (this is difficult particularly in the case of “bimodal” issues, see Medoff et al. 1995). For
instance, in the United States the courts have played a crucial role in establishing abortion on
demand (Row vs. Wade 1973) and, more recently, in making same-sex marriage legal
(Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015).
   Regarding the political regime, there are at least two reasons to expect that the presence of
democratic institutions could influence the regulation of morally controversial transactions. First,
the democratic process (at least in principle) ensures that laws and regulations reflect the
citizens’ preferences and beliefs, as opposed to imposing policies in accordance to the views of
the individual, group or political party in charge. Second, democratic regimes tend to limit the
role of organized religion in influencing regulations. Both these channels would imply that
democracies should make it more likely for regulations to change with economic development, if
such an association indeed exists. For our analysis, we use a dichotomous democracy measure
from Teorell et al. (2016). According to this variable, a country is democratic if political leaders
are chosen through elections, and if they satisfy a minimal level of suffrage (Boix, Miller and
Rosato 2013).
   Finally, we consider the political and economic status of women. Given the centrality of
women’s role in the activities that we consider, and the correlation between economic
development and improvements in the role of women in society (Duflo 2012, Jayachandran
2015), it is possible that the patterns observed in section I are due to the greater opportunities and
influence of women in politics and the economy rather than to increases in GDP per capita, or,
better said, that the relationship between income and legislation requires also openness to
recognizing women’s right in order to occur. We use two variables from Teorell et al. (2016).
The first is an indicator of women’s economic rights (including women’s freedom to choose their
profession or employment without the husband’s permission, the right to own land or open a
bank account; see the Appendix for more details), which can take four values ranging from 0 if a
country does not recognize economic rights to women and if systematic gender discrimination is
built into law, to 4 in countries where all of women’s economic rights are guaranteed by law and
the government “fully and vigorously” enforces these rights. The second variable is an indicator
of women’s political rights (including the right to vote and to run for political office); the
variable can take four values, ranging from 0 for countries where women’s political rights are not




                                                 11
guaranteed by law, to 4 in countries where women’s political rights are guaranteed by law and
enforced in practice.
   We expect that these features have a direct relationship with the type of legislation on
abortion, prostitution and surrogacy. Perhaps more interestingly, we investigate whether our
main relationship of interest, that between legislation on these issues and income, depends on
these other features. To do so in our econometric framework, in addition to adding these
variables to the model, we interacted each of the variables with GDP per capita, and, as
explained in detail below, included those interactions when computing predicted probabilities.

   Our analyses do not fully control for country-specific, unobserved heterogeneity, in the way
that a country-level fixed effect specification would. We decided not to include country fixed
effects for two main reasons. First, including fixed effects in a multinomial logit framework is
problematic (Allison 2009). An alternative would be to estimate linear probability models with
country fixed effects; however, but doing so with our categorical variables would make the




                                                       12
interpretation of the predicted probabilities less immediate. Second, most of the covariates that
we include in our models are either time-invariant (e.g., legal origin) or, when they change over
time, they do so slowly or rarely (e.g., religion, democracy). Because, as we argued above, there
are strong reasons to believe that these variables are related to the legislation as well as affect its
relationship with economic development, we chose to include them directly. Our goal, at this
stage, is to present an exploratory, descriptive analysis in order to measure interesting
correlations that should be the basis for future, more structured work.


III. Findings
Legislation and income
Figure 2 reports the predicted probabilities for each category of legislation on abortion and
prostitution, as a function of GDP per capita, controlling for legal origin, democracy, religion
and women’s political and economic rights as described above. We set all of these other
indicator variables (including the year dummies) at their overall mean. For the regulation of
abortion, the available information on all variables of interest is from 1981 to 2010, for up to 151
countries, with a total of 3,781 country-year observations. For prostitution, the sample size is of
3,215 observations, from the same time period as abortion and with up to 133 countries per year.
   Higher income per capita is strongly associated with the adoption of legislation regulating
abortion, with this legislation allowing abortion, and with conditions being increasingly
permissive. At low levels of income, our estimates imply that only a small share of countries
allow abortion on demand, whereas the predicted probability of countries allowing it is higher
than 80% at high levels of income.
   As for prostitution, there is an association between higher income per capita and the
likelihood to legislate on the issue and to formally allow (or not prohibit) the exchange of money
for sex (though still prohibiting brothels or pimping). The implied share of countries where
prostitution is not illegal goes from about 5% at the bottom of the income distribution to 20% at
the top. However, the relationship is weaker compared to the case of abortion; overall, the
presence of explicit prohibition as well as the absence of formal regulation cut through all
income levels with similar estimated shares.
   These findings are consistent with the view that higher income increases the cost of
prohibition, particularly for abortion. The weaker relationship found for prostitution may suggest




                                                  13
a stronger role for the opposing historical, cultural and political factors that we discussed above.
We now proceed to analyze this possibility.

                                              2a. Abortion




                                           2b. Prostitution




The role of historical, cultural and political factors
From our main multinomial logit regressions, we estimate that a democratic regime and more
economic and political rights for women are associated with slightly higher likelihoods to more
permissive abortion legislation, all else constant. Countries with a democratic regime and with
stronger political rights for women are also more likely to permit non-organized forms of
prostitution. Countries with a majority of Catholics are less likely to formally legislate on



                                                 14
markets for sex, but also more likely to allow, again, non-organized forms of prostitution. As for
legal origin, there were no significant differences between English and French legal origin
countries; however, countries with a Socialist legal origin are considerably more likely to have
permissive laws regulating abortion 12
     We next analyze, in addition to the independent impact of these factors on legislation, how
these different characteristics affect the relationship between income and regulation. The
analyses below present, as before, predicted likelihoods of countries adopting different types of
legislation at different income levels; however, the underlying multinomial regression models
also include interactions terms between income per capita and, in turn, an indicator for each of
the other variables of interest. To calculate the predicted probabilities, we then set all variables
but income per capita and the other factor of interest (and their interaction) at their mean, and we
present the findings separately for each category. Figure 3 shows the findings for abortion, and
Figure 4 those for prostitution.
     Although the prevailing religious attitudes in a country at a given time affect the relationship
between income and regulations for abortion, a positive relationship between income and the
predicted share of countries allowing abortion (including on demand) characterizes countries
with different prevailing religions (Figure 3.a). There are some differences across these groups of
countries, however. Countries with a majority of Muslim citizens show more liberal regulation at
lower levels of income, but the correlation between economic conditions and the probability of
more permissive abortion laws is weaker than for other countries. Countries where Catholicism
is prevalent are at the other extreme; in these cases, higher income correlates with a higher
adoption rate of permissive policies, but catholic countries at the lowest end of income per capita
are those with the most restrictive laws. Higher income is associated with more permissive
abortion laws in both English and French legal origin countries. However, countries of English
legal origin are less likely to prohibit abortion at lower levels of income compared to countries in
the French legal origin. However, we observe that the positive relationship between income and
abortion on demand is steeper in countries of French legal origin; as a result, the predicted share
of countries allowing abortion on demand is around 90 percent for high-income countries of
French legal origin while it is about 60 percent for countries in the English tradition.

12
   Abortion was legalized in many Eastern European countries in the 1950s; among other reasons, one of the
intended goals of permissive abortion policies was to allow greater female labor force participation (Potts
1967; Wolchik and Meyer 1985).




                                                    15
     The impact on the legislation-income relationship of the other features that we consider –
political regime and women’s political and economic rights – is limited in the case of abortion
regulation. In fact, the strong, positive correlation between economic conditions and liberality of
the legislation is similar regardless of these other features (Figures 3b-e). 13
     The differences between these groups of countries are more marked in the case of
prostitution (Figure 4). We estimate a positive association between income and laws allowing
prostitution in countries with a majority of Catholics and countries with more religious diversity.
The relationship, however, is fully reversed in countries with a majority of Muslims, where
higher income correlates with a lower likelihood of the presence of a law regulating prostitution,
and with a higher likelihood of prostitution being prohibited, given that a law exists. As for the
other features, we estimate that higher income is associated with a higher likelihood of
prostitution being permitted in democratic regimes, in countries where women are granted more
economic and political rights, and in countries where the dominant religion is not Islam.
Conversely, in non-democratic regimes, in countries where Muslims are the majority, and in
countries that do not recognize women’s economic and political rights, higher incomes are
associated with equally or more restrictive legislation on prostitution.




13
   For legal origins, the figure reports only countries with English and French traditions, because the sample size is
larger and estimates are more reliable in these two groups.

Gestational Surrogacy
As mentioned above, countries started regulating gestational surrogacy only in the second half of
the 1980s, and by 2015 legislation was present in only 35 countries. It is therefore difficult to
estimate multinomial logit models at this stage. We thus opted to present a descriptive analysis.
     In Figure 5, we rank countries according to their GDP per capita, and indicate their stance on
gestational surrogacy, with grey dots indicating that a law regulating surrogacy does not exist,
red dots denoting prohibition of any form of gestational surrogacy, yellow dots indicating that
only altruistic surrogacy is permitted, and green dots indicating that both altruistic and
commercial surrogacy are permitted. There is no clear relationship between income and the
likelihood that countries pass a law on surrogacy, and with the likelihood of countries allowing
commercial surrogacy. 14 By contrast, the countries in the top half of the income distribution
appear to be more likely to allow altruistic surrogacy. To reiterate, because gestational surrogacy
is a relatively new practice made possible by recently developed technology and only a few
countries have regulated this activity, it is therefore soon to draw conclusions.


                   Figure 5: Gestational surrogacy legislation and Income, 2015




14
   Seven of the ten countries where commercial surrogacy is legal were part of the Soviet Union (Armenia, Belarus,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russian Federation, and Ukraine); the remaining three countries are India,
Israel and the United States of America.


                                                       21
IV. An interpretative framework
Our main finding of a positive association between per-capita income and liberal legislation for
abortion and prostitution is consistent with the idea that cost-benefit considerations affect
attitudes toward repugnant transactions. We propose a conceptual framework to highlight
possible mechanisms for this association.
    Assume that a country decides to legalize a certain morally controversial transaction if
∆ = 𝐿𝐿(𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿 , 𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿 , 𝑋𝑋) − 𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃 , 𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃 , 𝑋𝑋) > 0 for a majority of voters, where L and P denote individual
utility under legalization and prohibition, respectively; E stands for “efficiency” (the “gains from
trade” from the activity), R for “moral repugnance”, and X are other potentially relevant factors
(including individual income). E, R and X, in turn, are a function of technology and other factors
related to economic development, which we proxy with per-capita GDP (y). Differentiating ∆
with respect to y gives:
                               𝑑𝑑∆        𝜕𝜕∆ 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕        𝜕𝜕∆ 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕         𝜕𝜕∆ 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
                                      =               +               +                (1)
                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑       𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕       𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕        𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

    Thus, economic development can affect the regulation of morally disputed transactions
through three channels: direct effects on efficiency and repugnance (first and second term,
respectively); and an indirect effect through the change in the individuals’ relative valuation of
the two policy options (legalization vs. prohibition) due for example to income effects (third
term). These three terms have ambiguous signs. Starting with the first term in (1), economic
development can increase the net benefit of the activity. For example, the impossibility of
terminating a pregnancy is arguably a higher economic burden in higher-income countries,
because of missed education and job opportunities (Becker 1960). Similarly, by helping women
and couples to overcome biological constraints, gestational surrogacy can allow delaying having
a child to pursue a career. New medical procedures or technologies that make abortion safer or
in-vitro fertilization more successful, or that facilitate disease prevention and detection, can have
similar effects on the benefits of abortion, surrogacy and prostitution. However, with
development, less morally controversial alternatives might become available. For instance,
contraception techniques and devices might reduce the demand for abortions (Marston and
Cleland 2003), and online pornography might reduce the demand for prostitution. As for the
second term in (1), improved economic conditions may affect how an activity is performed, thus
making it more or less morally repugnant. For instance, medical advances that allow early
detection of fetal abnormalities might reduce the ethical aversion toward abortion; conversely,


                                                                      22
the availability of RU486 (the “abortion pill”) or emergency contraception methods (the
“morning after pill”) may increase the repugnance toward abortion if the act is perceived as
being “too easy” (Cook 1991). Also, economic development typically implies an increasing role
of markets in society, possibly reducing the repugnance of trades in previously unacceptable
areas. Finally, income effects raise the value of life and safety (Viscusi 2008), making societies
more likely to legalize activities that can increase life expectancy, and those that would occur
nonetheless, only in often less safe conditions. Also, individual rights are likely to be normal
goods, and economic development often comes with an expansion of these rights, in particular
for marginalized groups including women (Doepke, Tertilt and Voena 2010; Duflo 2012). This
could produce permissive regulations for activities viewed as expression of women’s autonomy.
However, a stronger aversion to coercion or exploitation might lead to restricting activities like
prostitution or surrogacy if it is believed that women do not engage in these trades freely.


V. Conclusions and Directions for Future Research
We assembled a novel dataset with information on the legislation regarding three morally
controversial activities: abortion, prostitution and gestational surrogacy, and analyzed the
relationship between the legislation and countries’ GDP per capita. We found that higher income
is associated with more permissive legislation on abortion, and, to a more limited extent,
prostitution. We also found that the relationship between income and the legislation on these
activities is affected by historical, cultural and political factors, notably religion and women’s
political and economic rights. As for gestational surrogacy, we presented descriptive evidence
suggesting that higher income countries might be more likely to allow altruistic surrogacy but are
not more likely to permit commercial surrogacy.
   These patterns are somewhat consistent with evidence from experimental survey data that
cost-benefit considerations affect attitudes towards repugnant transaction (Elias et al. 2015a-b).
However, the analysis at this stage did not identify causal mechanisms. Rather, we established
some correlations that open questions for additional inquiry.
   Future studies would indeed test whether there is a causal relationship between income and
the presence and nature of legislation, and identify the mechanisms. One way to proceed would
be to adopt country fixed-effects models with a non-categorical component of the legislation
status, for example focusing on the determinants of the onset of a legislation (or of a more, or



                                                 23
less permissive legislation) within countries. As our data revealed, several countries have
adopted laws and in many cases changed their stance on abortion, prostitution and surrogacy in
the past four decades. Exploiting these policy changes and using richer data at the country level
(particularly in federal countries where different jurisdictions can adopt different regulations)
would be natural next steps. Also, as we recognize that economic development is not the only
important factor that might shape the evolution of legislation around morally controversial
activities, further analysis will require a more in-depth study of other factors such as economic
inequality (Bénabou et al. 2015), but also factors more related to social or political aspects that
might be correlated with the economic development but also might identify their own peculiar
mechanisms of transmission.
     Another direction for further research is to explore individual preferences and attitudes
towards repugnant activities, both to understand their determinants and distribution across
various socio-demographic groups, and to corroborate the mechanisms that drive regulations at
the country level. 15 A related question is how individuals and societies “manage” the perception
of ethically disputed transactions (Healy and Krawiec 2017).
     In addition, other morally controversial activities imply major tradeoffs and, as such, are
worthy of study. Examples include payments to blood and plasma donors, the sale and purchase
of recreational drugs, assisted suicide, and recent medical and technological procedures such as
the commercialization of human genetics (Caulfield 1998). Analyzing the regulation of these
activities and of domains that are not morally disputed may help identify whether the links
between income and regulation hold broadly or are specific to activities that raise ethical
concerns and are, at least in part, gender-specific.
     As a final point, academic work in this area warrants the combination of theoretical and
empirical approaches from different disciplines, such as philosophy, bioethics, psychology,
sociology, law and economics. A starting point would be a comprehensive review of the factors



15
   Elias et al. (2015a, 2015b and 2016) examined individual attitudes towards payments to kidney donors, indentured
servitude and prostitution. Attitudes towards paid kidney donations appear to be affected by information on the
number of transplants that would be performed if donors were paid (that is, most individuals display
“consequentialist” preferences), whereas individuals are under no circumstances willing to accept the legalization of
indentured servitude contracts. In the case of prostitution, there are stark gender differences. Men are not only more
likely to be in favor if its legalization compared to women, but also become more favorable when presented with
evidence that legalizing prostitution reduces violence and STD incidence. Women, on the contrary, are either not
affected or somewhat less likely to support the legalization of prostitution when presented with such information.


                                                         24
that scholars in these disciplines identified as important in understanding the evolution of
attitudes and regulation of morally controversial trades.
