                                            ABSTRACT



        To explain    cross-country   differences   in economic     performance,   the economics      of

coordination   failures typically portrays each country in a closed economy model with multiple

equilibria and then argues that the poor countries are in an equilibrium inferior to those achieved by

the rich. This approach cannot tell us anything about the degree of inequality in the world economy.

A more satisfactory approach would be to build a world economy model and show why it has to be

separated into the rich and the poor regions, i.e., to demonstrate the co-existence of the rich and poor

as an inevitable aspect of the world trading system, In the present model, the symmetry-breaking

of the world economy      into the rich and the poor occurs because international          trade causes

agglomeration of different economic activities in different regions of the world. International trade

thus creates a kind of “pecking order” among nations, and as in a game of “musical chairs,” some

countries must be excluded from being rich.

1.        Introduction.

         One major         challenge       for the theory           of economic        development              is to explain

the diversity         of economic        performances          across     the countries.              In short,             “why Are

There Rich and Poor Countries?”                    The economics           of coordination            failures          attempts

to answer this question              by developing         a model of multiple               equilibria,             and arguing

that the Rich countries              somehow managed           to achieve       a Pareto-superior                equilibrium,

while the Poor countries               fail to achieve          a necessary          coordination          and are trapped

in a Pareto-inferior             equilibrium.           The most         influential         work    along       this line is

Murphy,      Shleifer,       and Vishny         (1989) .       In the context         of imperfectly                 competitive

closed       economies       with    aggregate         spillovers,          they      have     demonstrated                 the    co-

existence       of a good equilibrium              and a bad equilibrium.                    While    insightful,              it is

difficult       to see within        their framework            why some countries             have to be trapped                   in

the    bad     state,      while     others      find      themselves          in    the     good     state,           since       the

coordination         in    the    good     state    is no       more      difficult        than      in    the        bad    state.

Indeed,      all     the    models       they   developed          are    static,      and     taken       literally,              the

economy      could    go back       and forth      between         the two equilibria.                Their       paper       hence

offers no compelling             reason why we have observed                  and continue           to observe             the huge

cross-country         differences.          (As one commentator             said, “according              to their theory,

in order        to   eliminate       the    development            problem,     all     we    need        to    do     is    simply

imitate      the Rich       countries,        and people        in the Poor countries                 are just too dumb

to be able         to do it.”)

         One    can partially          deal     with    this       criticism        by making        the model          dynamic.

For example,         in a series       of papers,        I studied        dynamic      models       of development                with

multiple       steady      states:    Matsuyama         (1991, 1992) ; see also               Ciccone           and Matsuyama

(1996) .       In these models,          the initial       condition       of the economy            plays an important

role   in determining            the eventual          state    toward     which      the economy              will    gravitate



                                                               1
(without       entirely          ruling       out the possibility              of    “economic           miracles, ” or “take-

Offsfl, i.e.,            some    comtries           may       occasionally         escape    from       the poverty      trap and

join the club of the Rich countries) .                               These dynamic          models       thus help to explain

why the cross-country                   differences            could be self-perpetuating                  and sometimes          tend

to magnify        over         time,     and,       at    the    same     time,     they    are     consistent        with    a few

observations             of     IIeconomic       miracles. “              Nevertheless,            these      studies        do    not

explicitly       model a mechanism               of generating            the initial cross-country                 differences,

and hence       come      short     of offering               an answer      to the question,             “Why Are There Rich

and Poor Countries?”

         In    all       these      studies,         each        country      is    modelled        a     closed     economy,       an

independent,             isolated        entity.          Hence,        multiple      equilibria          suggest     merely       the

possibility        of the co-existence                        of Rich    and Poor countries.                The models       camot

tell us anything                about    the degree             of inequality        in the world           economy.

         This paper             is an attempt            to answer        this question,           “Why Are There Rich and

Poor    Countries?”              from     a   global           perspective,         although        the     lessons     from       the

previous      studies          are also incorporated                 here.     Instead       of portraying          each country

in a close       economy          model       with       multiple        equilibria,        and arguing        that    different

countries       are in different                equilibria,             as the previous           studies     have    done,       this

paper    offers          a model        of the       world       economy,      where    many       (inherently)         identical

countries       trade with one another.                         It is shown that cross-country                 differences          in

the     standard         of      living       and        in    the   income        appear     as     a    stable      outcome       of

international            trade.         According         to this model,           the co-existence          of Rich and Poor

countries       is not just the possibility.                             It is an inevitable              aspect    of the world

trading       system.

         The model            developed       below adopts many specific                    assumptions       for the sake of

concreteness         .        Nevertheless,          the logic behind              the result        is fairly       general       and



                                                                     2
can be understood               intuitively.          Imagine        that there are a list of goods                     that need

to be    consumed.              Furthermore,          there     are     some    agglomeration              economies        in    the

production          of each of these goods.                 In the absence         of international                trade,      these

goods must all be produced                  in each country.            Without        any imate           difference         across

countries,          each country         produces      these goods by the same amount,                       and there is no

cross-country            difference.           Now introduce          the possibility          of international                trade

in these goods.             The equilibrium           allocation        under autarky          remains       an equilibrium,

but   such      a    symmetric       allocation         can     no     longer     be    stable        in    the    presence        of

agglomeration             economies.           As   different         countries        start    acquiring          comparative

advantage       in different         goods,         the production        of each good concentrates                     into some

countries,          which    leads to an emergence              of a system of the international                         division

of labor.        The stable         cross-country           difference         appears    as a result             of “symmetry-

breaking”           in    the   world      economy,         caused      by     international           trade.           And      some

countries       become       Rich   if they are lucky enough                   to acquire       comparative             advantage

in goods     associated           with     large      agglomeration           economies,       while       other     countries,

those    which           happen     to     acquire      comparative            advantage        in     goods        with       small

agglomeration            economies,        become      Poor.

         From       the     perspective          of    an   individual          country,        the    problems          of      Poor

countries       may look just like those captured                        in the previous              studies.          They fail

to achieve          a necessary          coordination        to reach         a Pareto-superior             equilibrium           and

find themselves             in a Pareto-inferior               equilibrium.            The problems           thus      seem just

a matter     of coordination               failures.           The global       perspective,           however,          offers     a

different       view.       The international           division        of labor requires             different         countries

to take charge of producing                    different       tradeable       goods,     with differing             degrees       of

agglomeration            economies.            International          trade    thus     creates       a kind       of    “pecking

order”    among          nations.        Not    all   countries        can be Rich:            some    countries         must      be



                                                                 3
excluded       from being           Rich,    just like in a game of “musical                            chairs. “     At the same

time,     the    model        does     not     rule     out    the    possibility                that     some     (but not         all)

countries        might       succeed        in overcoming        the       coordination            failures,        and becoming

Rich.     This       feature        of the model        makes    it possible            to talk about             the effects         of

such an “economic              miracle”        in the world          economy.

         Although        mainly       motivated        by the development               problem,          this paper       can also

be    viewed      as    a     contribution         to    the     literature            on        North-South         trade.          The

neoclassical           trade    theory        approaches        the North-South              problem        by first       assuming

that     there       exist     some    fundamental            differences            across       the     two    regions       of    the

world,    say in labor productivity                     or in the factor               endowment,          and then examining

the     consequences           of     trade     between        the     two      regions.            This        approach       cannot

adequately        deal       with     the     concerns        held    by     many      “structuralist”              or    “radical”

economists,          such      as    Baran      (1957),       Myrdal        (1957),         and     most    notably        Prebisch

(1950) , who believe                that international           trade       is a cause           of the huge differences

between        the     two     regions.          The     approach          adopted          in     this    paper      explains         a

separation        of the world           economy        into    the Rich         and    the Poor           through       “symmetry-

breaking, ” capturing                an element        of the radical            view of the world                 economy.         The

present     framework           thus    makes     it possible              to    address          the     validity        of   policy

recommendations              offered    by the radical           economists            in a more           formal    manner.1

         The     closest        to     this    paper      in    spirit          is    the     recent        work     on    economic

geography        by Krugman           (1991),    which        shows    that      a reduction              in transport          costs

causes    a symmetry-breaking                 to separate        the otherwise              identical           regions    into the

factor mobility                plays     an important        role in generating            the agglomeration.               To the

contrary,       the factor mobility                 plays no role in this paper,                which       is more relevant

in the context               of international             trade.     A simpler       version       of the model           in this

paper,        and   a few          of    its    implications,        has    been     sketched      in my         recent     survey

article       on complementarities                  and cumulative         processes;        Matsuyama           (1995, pp.720-

721) .    Hence,          this paper           can be viewed        as its elaboration             and its extension.

         In the next section,                    I lay out the physical            structure       of the world economy.

The building             blocks         of the model        are    fairly     standard,       so that        I refrain        from

discussing          specification              issues in detail.           The purpose       of this section          is rather

to establish             the    notations,          and highlight          the key       features      of the model.               In

section       3, I discuss              the equilibrium         allocation         under    autarky.         In section       4, I

look     at     the      world          economy     in    equilibrium.          In       section      5,    I     discuss     some

implications            of the model.              Section      6 concludes.




2.       The Physical               Structure       of the World       Economy.

         The world             economy         consists    of a continuum           of    identical        small     countries.

Each country            is endowed         with L units         of labor,      which       is the only primary              factor

of production.               There       are three consumption             goods,    1, 2, and 3.            Good    1 and Good

2 are tradeable,                while      Good    3 is nontradeable.               (Think of them as Agriculture,

Manufacturing,               and    Services.)            The     representative           consumer        has    Cobb-Douglas

preferences             over    the      three    goods,     which    can     be represented           by    an expenditure


function,           E    =     P:’ P:’ P:’ U , where U is utility,                   Pi the price          of good    i, and Di




the share       of Good            i in consumer’s          expenditure,       satisfying          PI + P2 + B3 = 1-               BY

denoting       the aggregate               income    by Y, the budget          constraint          is then written            as
                                                   Y    =    P:’ P:’ P:’ u                                                  (1)


        The assumption          of the Cobb-Douglas                    preferences       not only helps           to keep the

algebra     simple,    but also implies                that both Good I and Good 2 (as well as Good 3)

are “essential, “           i.e., there        are positive              demand       for these goods          at any finite

prices .      This     means     that       the     two      tradeable           goods    must        always     be    produced

somewhere     in the world.            This    feature          plays        an important        role    in the following

analysis.

        The    three       consumption        goods         are       produced        competitively,           with    constant

returns     to scale       technologies.            All      the inputs          are nontradeable,              and    they are

labor and a variety           of differentiated               intermediate             inputs,       which   are aggregated

by a symmetric        CES production           function,          as in Dixit          and Stiglitz.           Labor    and the

composite     of intermediate          inputs are combined                   with a Cobb-Douglas             technology     with

cri being     the    share     of     intermediates.                   The    unit     cost     of    production       in   each

consumption        goods    sector     can thus be expressed                     as



                                       cl =        W1-=J
                                                            [J‘[p(z)

                                                                              ll-”dz+
                                                                                    1
                                                                                                                            (2)



where W is the wage rate, N the range of differentiated                                       intermediates           available

in the marketplace,            p(z)    the price            of variety          z, and u > 1 the direct                 partial

elasticity     of substitution           between            every      pair     of intermediates.              It is assumed

that a different           sector     relies       on the intermediate                  input    sector      to a different

degree;     Sector     i    spends     ai     fraction          of      their     revenue       on    the    intermediates.

Without     much    loss of generality,                Sector         2 is assumed       to use intermediate             inputs

more   intensively         than Sector        1;


                                                        al    <a2.                                                          (3)


If Goods 1 and 2 are interpreted                   as Agriculture              and Manufacturing,            this intensity



                                                                  6
assumption       implies    that the production                   cost of the manufacturing               sector    depends

more heavily       upon the local support                 industries.            Needless      to say, nothing          in the

ensuing      analysis     depends        on such an interpretation.                      What     is critical       here    is

that the tradeable          goods        sectors      differ       in the degree         to which     they rely on the

local    support       industries.

         The intermediate           inputs          are supplied      by the monopolistically                competitive

firms .      Each variety        is supplied          by a single         fi.Km, which      uses ax(z)       + F units      of

labor to produce         x(z) units,          where F represents               the fixed cost.        Each firm, aware

of    its    monopoly      power,        sets       the   price      optimally,         but     its   market     power      is

negligible       relative       to the aggregate              economy,         so that     each    firm   does     not    Lake

into account       any strategic          interaction          with other         firms.       As is well-known,          this

specification           leads       to        the      following          simple        pricing       rule       for      each

monopolistically         competitive           firm, p(z) [1-I/u] = aW.                By choice of units,          one can

set a = 1 - 1/0, so as to have p(z)                       . p . W.        Hence,       the unit    cost of production

in each sector,          given    by     (2), is simplified               to


                                                                                                                          (4)



Hence,      in all the consumption              goods     sector,     the production            cost declines       with N,

but   the intensity        assumption           implies     that the cost declines                 faster    in Sector          2

than Sector       1.

         Since    all    the     inputs       are    priced       equally       and    enter    symmetrically           in the

production       functions,       all the input producing                      firms   operate     at the same scale,

x(z) = x, and earns            the same revenue            and the profit,              By denoting       the revenue       of

a firm by S = px = Wx,              its wage bill B and its profit                       11 are expressed          as



                                    B     =   W(ax+F)         =
                                                                   [1
                                                                    l-~        S+WF,                                      (5)
and



                                                n=s-B=~-wF.                                                                 (6)



respectively.

         Finally,        there is no barrier              to entry or to exit in the intermediate                      inputs

sector, which make all the input producing                          firms earn zero profit                 in equilibrium.




3.       The Autarkv        Equilibrium.

         Although        the ultimate       goal of the analysis             is to examine             the world economy,

consisting        of     a continuum        of    small     open     economies,            let    us   first    look   at    the

equilibrium         allocation         of     each     economy       in     autarky,         which       offers    a   useful

benchmark        for the subsequent              analysis.

         Because       of the Cobb-Douglas            preferences,          all the consumption                goods must be

consumed    by a positive          amount.        Hence,     in the absence            of trade, each economy               must

produce    all the consumption                goods,       which    means    that their           prices       must be equal

to their        costs:    that    is, from        (4),


                                                                       >                                                    (7)

Since     the    representative         consumer           spends    ~iY on       Good       i,    and   Sector     i spends

100ai% of its revenue              on intermediate            inputs,       the    total         revenue    of the inputs

                                                                                                                            (8)

                                                               8
autarky.         (Here, superscript               A stands         for Autarky.)               This parameter          can also be

interpreted        as    the    degree       of    the       aggregate         demand        externality,         measuring        the

extent    to which an increase                in the aggregate                income generates            additional          revenue

to the monopolistically                 competitive               inputs     sector.

         Likewise,        Sector       i spends         100(l-ai)%          of its revenue           on labor,         wage    income

         The downward-sloping                 curve         in Figure        1 depicts         eq.   (12) , showing           how the

revenue       of an     intermediate          input         producing         firm,       S, depends        on the number               of

firms,     N.      In    the    present       model,          the profit            of   each     firm    declines        with     its

revenue;        see eq.    (6) .       This       is to say that,              given      the degree         of the aggregate

demand     externality,          O*, the presence                  of more          firms,     and   hence       that    of a wide

range    of     inputs,    merely        reduces            the market         size      per    firm,     hence,       the profit.

Figure    1 thus        suggests       that    a small            N implies         an excess        profit,      and a large            N

implies       a loss,     and any plausible                  entry-exit         process         would     lead    to the unique

intersection,           where    11 =    O,       or     S/aW      = F.        Hence,        from    (12),       the    variety         of

intermediate          inputs     (and the nutier                  of firms producing              them)    is

equilibrium          of    the    world       economy,         where      the     terms       of    trade    are     determined

endogenously.




4-A.    The Small          ODen    Economy.

         For each         small    open       economy     the relative           price        of Good      1 and Good     2, q =

pl/p2, is exogenously              given       in the world market.                Unlike       in autarky,        whether      the

economy produces           Good 1 or Good 2 now depends                     on the ratio of the production                     cost

in the two sectors,                From       (4), it can be expressed                   as

which   increases           with    N, due      to the intensity                        assumption,       (3) .    This           is to say

that    an        economy     with       a     small       N        has       a    comparative          advantage         in        Good       1

(Agriculture),            which    uses the locally                  available              intermediates        less intensively,

and an economy            with     a large      N has a comparative                          advantage      in the       intermediate

input     intensive         Good     2   (Manufacturing)                  .       The    threshold       level     of N,          N(q),    is

determined         by the equality,             q = C1/C2:


                                                                              a-1
                                                      N(q)           =    q“-”          .


If N < N(q),         then the economy               produces             only two of the three               consumption               goods,

Good 1 and Good 3.               By denoting         the output               of sector         1 by Ql, the income                identify

takes   the form,           Y = PIQI + fi3Y , or


                                                     PIQI =          (1-133)Y.                                                          (17)

        In Figure       2, the solid       curve depicts         how the revenue         of a firm depends       on

the number      of firms    in the open economy.                Equation     (22) applies      if N c N(q),     and

eq.   (24) if N > N(q),        and there        is a jump at N = N(q) .             The revenue      function    in

the autarky      case,     (12), is also depicted            in the figure, by the dotted            curve.     The

relative    locations       of the    two revenue          curves       reflect   the   intensity     assumption

(3), which        implies    that    the    three        aggregate       demand    externality       parameters,

defined    in    (9),    (19 , and    (25 # must         satisfy     the following        inequalities:


                                                                                                              (26)


        Unlike     in the autarky       case,      the revenue          of a firm,      and hence    its profit,

no longer       declines    monotonically         with    the number       of firms.        This   is because    an



                                                          12
entry     of firms,       when        it pushes      the economy        over    the threshold          level,    causes     a

shift     in comparative              advantage,       which     increases      the aggregate           demand    for    the

intermediate          inputs.

          Figure      2 is also         drawn    under     the additional         condition       that    the terms       of

(As     will     be    seen      later,       this       condition      must     hold    in      the    world      economy

equilibrium,          once    the terms         of trade       is endogenized.)

         As the figure           shows,      there       are   three    equilibria,      in which        the profit       is

equal     to zero;      N = Nl, N = N(q),                N = N2.       Of these     equilibria,         N = N(q)        is a

knife-edge       case,       where     the number        of firms      is such    that    the economy’s          relative

cost     of production          in the       two     tradeable        sectors    coincides       with     the    terms    of

trade.     If the economy              is slightly       below      the threshold       level,    N(q) , the economy

specializes        in Good 1, which makes less use of the local intermediate                               inputs, and

the firms       make    losses         and   there    is an      inducement      to exit.         If the economy          is

slightly       above    the     threshold,         the    economy      specializes       in Good       2, which     makes

greater    use of the intermediate                   inputs,     and the firms make profits,              which    induce

more    firms to enter.               Thus , with a slight          perturbation        and any plausible          entry-

exit process,          this equilibrium            would not be observed.            The other two equilibria,

N . N1 and N = N2, are both                     stable     in any plausible         entry-exit         process     in the

sense    that,     if N is slightly              smaller       than    the    equilibrium     value,       there    is an

excess    entry       and hence        an incentive        to enter,         and if N is slightly          larger       than

the equilibrium          value,       there is a loss and hence an incentive                         to exit.        Under the

condition        (27) , there     are two stable               equilibria            of this economy.3

         The present          model    thus predicts            that the equilibrium                allocations        of each

country       drastically       change        from     the     autarky         to the      open    economy    case.      It is

worth    pointing       out    that     this     change        is not      caused       by a change        in the relative

price    of the two tradeable                goods.         To see this, note              that the relative          price    is

under    autarky       can be expressed               as



                                                                                                                         (28)


from    (7) and        (13).     Hence,        the     condition         for multiple            equilibria     in the      open

economy       case,    (27), can be rewritten                  to

Note that the lower bound                   is less than one, while                  the upper bound        is greater      than

one.    Therefore,       international               trade can cause the drastic                  change    in each country

even without          affecting       the relative            price      of the tradeable           goods.

         In     what    follows,        superscript            i     =   1,     2,    is   used     to     distinguish        the

equilibrium       values       of endogenous               variables,         depending     on whether        N . Nl or N .

N2 .    (Stiscripts,          on the other            hand,    continue          to indicate        the goods.)         First,

note    that    the economy       produces           Good     i when N = Ni, so that                the production          cost

of Good       i must    be equal        to its price.               From       (7), this     condition        pins   down     the

increase       in q . P1/P2 improves         the welfare,              while       it reduces       the welfare     if N =

         we are now ready        to endogenize            the terms        of trade,          q = P1/P2, and to look

at the world economy          as a whole.         As shown in the previous                    section,       there are two

possible       equilibrium     allocations         for each          country:           N = Nl or N = N2.        Let f be

For these    countries,          the relative                 cost of producing                   the two tradeable         goods    is

For the countries          at the first               equilibrium,                   it is equal            to

         At the intersection           of the two curves,                       the relative            price             of Good    1, q*,

in Good 1.       The intersection,             (f*, q’), thus depicts                        an equilibrium                 of the world

economy.4

         It is easy to see that the equilibrium                             of the world              economy             is not unique.

        4A similar geometrical           representation                  of the equilibrium               is used in yanagawa

                                                                  17

        Despite       a plethora       of equilibrium,          indexed by f ~ [f-, f+] , the equilibrium

conditions      impose such strong restrictions                  on possible         allocations         that the model

is rich     in its implications,            which    will be discussed               in this      section.




5-A.    Cross-Country          Comparisons.

        One major       implication         of the model,         indeed       the main      purpose       of building

this model,      is that,       without     any innate          differences      across       the countries,          some

countries      (at least       1 - f+ fraction           of the world      economy)         must    be in the first

equilibrium      and others        (at least f- fraction) must be in the second equilibrium.

The model thus offers           a theory of endogenous             variations        across the countries;             two

different      types    of economies        w       co-exist      in the world         economy.          Therefore,     it

makes   sense    to talk       about    cross-country           comparisons.

        First,    let us look at the differences                    in their         standard      of living.       From

advantage      of the aggregate            demand   externality,          and    thereby       achieve      the higher

standard-of-living,            than those specializing             in Good 1.        Hence,      the model predicts

an endogenous         separation       of the world       economy       into “Rich” and           “Poor” countries.

        This     is     also     true      when     looking        at    the     factor          price     and    income

         One of the classical                problems        of development            economics         is “Why Are Services

Cheaper        in    the     Poor     Countries?”                 Many     studies,            including     Balassa        (1964) ,

Samuelson           (1964),    Kravis        and     Lipsey         (1983),      Bhagwati          (1984),    and    Panagariya

(1988) , have         addressed        this       issue,         but    they    all started         from    some    exogenously

postulated          differences        across         the    Rich       and    Poor     regions.         Although      no    innate

difference          across    the countries               is assumed,         the world        economy     equilibrium       in the

present    model       can explain           the correlation               of price       levels        and the income        level

across    the countries,             by looking           at the cross-country                 difference     of the price of

Services       are cheaper          in the Poor countries.

5-B.     The Welfare          Effects       of Trade.

         The    mere       fact     that    international               trade    made      some     countries       poorer     than

others    does not necessarily                    imply     that trade made             them poorer         than before.         To

answer this, we must compare                      the utility          levels before            and after the trade.           From



      5Although the factor mobility plays no role in creating the cross-country
differences   in this model, introducing a mobile factor might be an interesting
extension   of the model.     For example,  suppose that there are two factors,
immobile   labor L, and mobile capital K, which jointly forms a “generalized
factor, ” Z = F(K,L).  If the restriction of capital mobility is imposed, then the
present model can be directly applied by reinterpreted       by replacing L by Z.
Then, if we allow capital to mover then capital flows from the Poor to the Rich,
which offers an answer to the question posed by Lucas (1990) . And the resulting
capital outflow magnifies the wage difference across the two regions.

                                                                   19

and




Thus , the Rich countries            unambiguously           have benefitted          from trade.           For the Poor

countries,        the lower       bound    on U1/UA is less than one, hence                   it is possible          that

they may have lost from trade.                    However,    the upper bound may be greater                   than one,

so that     the    Poor    may    have     also    benefitted       from    trade.G     This     is because          there

are     offsetting        gains     from    specialization,           despite     the    Poor        have     lost    some

benefits     of    the     aggregate       demand     externality,          captured     by    the     change    in    its

parameter     from 6A to .91. One necessary                   (but not a sufficient)            condition        for the

Poor to gain from trade             is that the terms of trade move                   in their       favor,     relative

to the autarky:          if the relative          price remains       at the same level with the autarky,

5-c.     The Effects       of Development           Stratecfies: An Individual            Country       Perspective .

         Regardless        of     whether     the     Poor        countries     have    gained         or    lost     from

international        trade,       it is certainly        in their          interest    to switch        from    the bad

equilibrium       to the good one and to become                    Rich.    The natural        question       to ask is

what    the government          of a Poor country            can do to facilitate             such a transition.

         Recall     that    Figure       2 captures     the       situation    faced    by each        country.        The

Poor    countries,        trapped     in the bad        equilibrium,          suffer    from     the    coordination



     ‘For example, if al = 0.2, CYz= 0.8, IY3= 0.1, 61 = 0.6, Dz = 0.2, and p3 =
0.2, then   81 = 0.18,   02 . 0.66,   and 6A = 0.3, and the upper      bound  is

                  .

failures.       Among a list of prescriptions                   commonly         offered      in the economics             of the

coordination         failure,     the least         interventionist              approach        is for the government

to direct    a coordinated         entry of the intermediate                       input producing          firms,    through

some sorts of “indicative               plaming.        “    The announcement             of a government           guideline

may help the private            sector    to coordinate             their expectations,                 thereby    succeeding

in reaching      a better        equilibrium.               In Matsuyama           (1992),       I have    argued,     in the

context    of the Murphy-Shleifer-Vishny                       model,        that    the effectiveness              of such     a

policy    announcement          depends,        among       other     things,        on    the    gap     between     the     bad

equilibrium      and     the    threshold        level.        The     same        argument       can    be applied         here.

(Indeed,    Matsui       and Matsuyama           (1995) discuss              the    logic     in an abstract          game     of

coordination.)            Hence,        the     government           may     also      want       to     cotiine      such     an

announcement         with a more    interventionist                 policy    to narrow          the gap between           Nl and

N(q) .    For    example,       imposing        the    import       tariff       on Good      2, taxing           Sector     1 or

subsidizing      Sector       2 could    lower        the threshold           level    in this model,             which makes

it easier       to    create    a coordinated               entry     of   the      firms.        In the      extreme,        the

intervention         can reduce     N(q)       to such an extent              that N(q)          K Nl, which        eliminate

the bad equilibrium.             The only equilibrium                is then N = N2.              (Rodrik    (1996) argues

that the secret         of East     Asian       miracles       can explained              along    this     line.)

         As a more direct         measure,       a temporary          autarky        may work.          If NA > N(q), then

the    autarky       policy    generates        a     sufficient           industrial         base,       which     helps     the

economy    to move       toward    the better           equilibrium           when    the government              removes     the

trade barriera.




5-D.     The Effects      of Development              Strategies:          A Global        Perspective.

         In 5-C, I have discussed               a few policy          options        the government          might    want to

take in order         to facilitate           successful       development,            from the perspective                of an



                                                              21
individual      country.         These    policies     cannot      make all the countries           rich, but may

work for some countries.                 Although    the model      is silent       about which     countries       can

succeed,      it is useful        for thinking        about      the possible       spillover     effects    of such

an “economic       miracle. ”

         To simplify       the argument,        I will assume        that, once some countries             succeeded

in moving      from the bad equilibrium               to the good equilibrium,                they remove    all the

interventions         that helped        them become     Rich.      As more countries          manage    to join the

club of the Rich countries,                f increases       along the upward-sloping             curve in Figure

3.     As a result,     q goes up and the terms of trade move in favor of the countries,

which    remain    Poor.         On the other       hand,     the terms      of trade       deteriorates     for the

Rich    countries.          Hence,       successful      developments         of     some    countries,      while     a

Pareto-improving          move     from    their    viewpoint,       are     not   Pareto-improving         from    the

viewpoint      of the world         economy.

         Furthermore,       the terms of trade effect of such an “economic                        miracle”    on the

countries      who remain         Poor may be a mixed            blessing.         As an improvement        in their

terms of trade,         the Poor countries           benefit       from an increase          in q, provided        that

they remain       Poor.     However,       an increase        in q, by raising         the threshold        level of

development,       N(q),    makes       their   chance      of a successful         development     smaller.         As

discussed      above,      the    effectiveness       of the government             announcement        to direct     a

coordination       among    the private         firms harder       as the gap between          Nl and N(q) grows.

The bigger      gap also       implies     that a bigger         intervention        is required        to eliminate

the bad equilibrium.              Furthermore,        an increase       in q could          lead to NA K N(q) , so

that    the   return      to the       temporary     autarky      may   no   longer     generate     a sufficient

industry      base,     when     the     economy    removes       the   trade      barriers.       In    summary,     a

successful      industrialization           in some countries,             and more generally           the presence

of early      industrializers,           may help     the Poor agricultural            producers        by causing    a



                                                            22
favorable     terms of trade change,               and yet makes           it harder       for them to follow.               In

the      extreme     case,         after      f+    fraction          of      the        world      economy         finished

industrializing,           it is no longer possible              for the remaining                countries        to become

Rich     (without    impoverishing          the currently         Rich      countries.)

         Hence,     the    present     model       captures      the       view     of    the     world     held    by     many

radical     economists,       who    believe       that   the world         trading        system       keeps      the South

poor    at the expense        of    the earlier       industrializers               in the North.           Some of them

even argued        in the past       that    the Southern         countries          could       develop    only     if they

severed    the link with the established                  North,      and formed          their own economic             union

among    them.      (This was the idea behind               some      ill-fated          common     market       agreements

in Latin American          in the sixties.)           The model        applies       equally       to any subgroup           of

the    countries     that    choose        to trade   only      among       themselves.            So,     if a group        of

e~ally     Poor countries          forms their own trade union                    and isolates          from the rest of

the world,       it would     also    separate      into the Rich and the Poor                      countries        through

a     symmetry-breaking.             Those     unlucky        enough        to      remain       Poor      may     hence     be

disappointed        and choose       to drop out of the union.’




6.       Concluding       Remarks.

         Models     with     multiple        equilibria         are     the       most     natural         framework        for

explaining       the diversity.            In a model      with       unique      equilibrium,            any attempt        to

explain    the variations          of per capita      income across regions                  forces us to introduce

variations       in other variables,          such as saving rates and education,                          as is commonly


      71n the present model,  whether the Poorer countries   in the union want to
drop out of the Lion   depends solely on the terms of trade prevailing inside and
outside of the union.     One can modify the model, such as adding monopolistic
competitive  tradeable goods, so that there exist some benefits of trading in a
larger world.    Then, when countries became Poorer in the union, they have an
incentive to drop out of the union, because, if they had to be poorer, they would
rather be poorer in a larger trading community.

done     in growth         accounting       exercises.         Yet     the      variations        in    these    variables

themselves          are     left    unexplained,         or    need        to    be    explained        by   introducing

variations          in another      set of variables.               This    is not to deny            the importance         of

growth      accounting       exercises,         as a useful        way of summarizing             the correlations           of

key    variables          across    the    regions.        But , it         tells      us   little      about     why    poor

countries       remain poor,        because      of the simultaneity              of the key variables.                On the

other       hand,    the    economics      of    coordination         failures,         as a model        with     multiple

equilibria,         can explain       the diversity        across      economies        without       assuming     inherent

differences,          and hence       they serve      as a theory           of endogenous            inequality.

         One major         drawback    of models      with multiple             equilibria,       as the critic might

argue,      is that they often            seem to allow       so many possibilities                  on the equilibrium

behaviors,          and    hence    have    little     predictive           content.           The    previous        work   on

coordination          failures      in the area of economic                 development         is subject       to such a

criticism.           In    these    studies,      each   country           is modelled          independently,          as   an

isolated       entity.       Hence,     multiple      equilibria           merely      suggest       the possibility         of

the co-existence            of Rich and Poor countries;                the models           do not tell us anything

about    the degree         of inequality         in the world        economy.          This paper,       by developing

a model       of the world         economy,      explained         the inequality           as an inevitable           aspect

of    the    world     trading      system,      derived      some     predictions             concerning       the    cross-

country       differences,         and thereby       offered        different         implications       for the way we

think of trade            and development         and the inequalities                 among    nations.
