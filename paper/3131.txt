      COST AND PRICE MOVEMENTS IN BUSINESS CYCLE THEORIES AND EXPERIENCE:
                     HYPOTHESES OF STICKY WAGES AND PRICES


                                    ABSTRACT
     In the post-World War II period, wage and price levels reacted much less

to business contractions than they did in earlier times.    Inflation prevailed

and its persistence increased.   The contractions themselves became relatively

short and mild.   All these developments have some cornmon roots in the major

structural, institutional, and policy changes of the era.

     This paper takes a look at the assumptions concerning wage and price

behavior in types of contemporary macroeconomic theories and their

implications for the analysis of the business cycle.   The various hypotheses

of real and nominal "rigidities" are then related to each other and to

alternative theories of how markets clear.

     Long-term stable wage and price arrangements or contracts have important

equilibrium aspects that are consistent with high degrees of competition; or,

to put it differently, there are good reasons for market clearing by nonprice

mechanisms.   Further, imperfections of competition, information, and markets

make some stickiness of wages and prices inevitable.   Changes in relative

prices and costs, productivity, and profitability play an important role in

the process of propagation of business cycles.
