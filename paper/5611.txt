                                             ABSTRACT

       The Employment       Act of 1946 created the Council of Economic Advisers as an institution,

and serves     as a convenient    marker   of a broader    change   in opinions   and sentiments:     the

assumption    by the federal government of the role of stabilizing the macroeconomy.
       The magnitude of this shift should not be understated: before the Great Depression strong

currents of macroeconomic       theory held that stabilization policy was positively unwise. It solved
problems in the present only by storing up deeper and more dangerous problems for the future.
Yet as a result of the shift in opinions and sentiments marked by the 1946 Employment            Act, no

government     since WWII has dared do anything other than let fiscal automatic stabilizers swing
into action during recession.     This may well have been a significant force tending to moderate

the post-WWII business cycle.
        But the bulk of the CEA’s time and energy now and in the past has been devoted not to

macroeconomic      but to macroeconomic     issues.   The CEA has been one of the few advocates of
the public interest in allocative efficiency present in the government.      The CEA has been more

successful    in its microeconornic   role than many would have predicted         ex ante.   Its relative

success can be traced to the staffing pattern set up by two strong early chairs—Arthur        Burns and

Walter Heller—who      made sure that the CEA staff was largely composed of short-term appointees
whose principal loyalties were to the discipline of economics,         and who as a result were less
vulnerable    to the processes that block pressure for allocative efficiency in other parts of the

government.

         The 1946 Employment Act declared that it was the “continuing policy and responsibility” of the

federal government to “coordinate and utilize all its plans, functions, and resources... to foster and

promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare; conditions under which there will be

afforded usefti employment for those able, willing, and seeking to work; and to promote maximum

employment, production, and purchasing power” (see Heller (1966), Bailey (1950)). The Act also

established the President’s Council of Economic Advisers and the Congress’s Joint Economic

Committee,     and called on the President to estimate and forecast the current and future level of

2 I have little to say abou tthe Congressional Joint Economic Committee. At times it has served as an
interesting forum for debate on issues of economic policy. The split between the majority and the
                                                     4


economic activity in the United States. It thus committed the federal government to the business of

macroeconomic management.

        Or did it?

        Consider a more recent piece of legislation with a similar tone and more expansive declared

goals that has had next to no effect on American macroeconomic policy. In 1978, the Hurnphrey-

Hawkins Act committed the federal government to reducing the unemployment rate to four percent by

1983 ad to maintaining it ttiea.er.    It committed the federal government to reducing the inflation rate

to zero by 1988. It also called for the reduction of federal government spending to “the lowest level

consistent with national needs,” and for spending more money on farm price supports (Weir ( 1992)).

Finally, it required the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to testify before the Congress twice a year on

the state of the macroeconomy.

        In spite of its broad goals, sweeping language, and bold commitments,     the Humphrey-

Hawkins Act has had no effect on anything, save that the Federal Reserve Chairman does give his

periodic “Humphrey-Hawkins       testimony”; as a result the workload of the Federal Reserve staff is

slightly higher (and perhaps the “transparency” and accountability of Federal Reserve actions has

improved.)

       One possible conclusion from Humphrey-Hawkins         is that laws which mairdy establish goals

and do not build institutions have no independent effects. However, laws that establish goals can and

do serve as markers of changes in opinions, perceptions, and aims. When people then speak of the

effects of such a law, in many cases they are using “the law” as a shorthand marker to describe

changes in the hearts and the minds of the people. Whether the goal is achieved or pursuit of the goal

effects and constrains public policy depends on the depth of the change in hearts and minds.




minority SM has often been very wide, and the standard pressures from other committees seeking to
maintain their jurisdiction unimpeded have had the expected effects.
                                                     5


          The 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins      Act in large part went against the flow of shifting opinions and

sentiments. It was passed for short-term political advantage, and was correctly expected to be a dead

letter. The law created no institutions, and marked no changes in hearts and minds toward its goals,

and so it had no effect.

          The Employment Act of 1946 is a much more complicated case. It certainly marked the

commi~ent      of the federal government to the macroeconomic management business. As originally

introduced, the Full Employment Act required the president to submit a “National Production and

Employment Budget,” or NPEB, that would set out a spending and legislative program for the current

legislative session that would “assure a ftil employment volume of production” in the following fiscal

year–a     fiscal year that would begin approximately six months after the submission of the NPEB. This

institutional setup would have solidly entrenched a strong bias toward active countercyclical fiscal

policy in the core of the American Executive Branch.

          As finally enacted, the Employment Act called for an annual Ecommic Report “setting forth...

current and foreseeable trends in the levels of employment, production, and purchasing power... and a

program for carrying out the policy” to promote “conditions under which there will be afforded useful

employment for those able, willing, and seeking to work.” The enacted bill is a weaker signal of the

government’s commitment to macroeconomic management than was the initial proposal, but it is a

signal.

          The Employment Act of 1946 dso created an institution: the Council of Economic Advisers, or

CEA. But its creation of the CEA as we know it today-one       chair, two members, and a senior staff of

15, almost invariably drawn from and planning to return to the professoriate-is    best described as an

incident. The original proposal was for an expansion of the Budget Bureau, or perhaps for an “~lce

of Director of the National Budget.” Other institutional arrangements were proposed—a Federal Trade

Commission or Federal Reserve Board-like structure for the Council of Economic Advisers, with

members cotilrmed     by the Senate for five-year overlapping terms; the Treasury Secreta~’s proposal

of a cabinet-level economic policy coordination committee chaired by (who else?) the Treasury
                                                       6


Secretary; and other institutional mgements.        The staffs of such alternative institutions would have

likely not been economists on one-or two-yew rotations from the professoriate, but the mix of civil

servants and ex-campaign workers that makeup the operating levels of the White House staff.3

         My reading of the legislative history is that the Truman Administration dropped the ball. It

should have been much more concerned about institutional arrangements. I believe that Congress

thought (incorrectly, it turned out) that use of the Senate’s advise-and-consent   power over CEA

nominees (and appropriations) could influence macroeconomic policy planning in the Executive Office

of the President.

         Only because of the institution-building   of Arthur Bums and Walter Heller did the CEA acquire

the recruitment and staffing patterns that it has today.

         Thus there are two strands to follow in analyzing the 1946 Employment Act. First come the

institutions: how they functioned and whether they mattered. Second comes the shift in sentiments and

aims that led to the passage of the Employment Act, and of which the Act serves as a convenient

marker. The two strands are interwoven in part because the CEA has served as the channel through

which shifts in the climate of opinion have their effect on the Executive Branch of the U.S.

government, and in part because the authority of the Council has been in large part derived from the

same intellectual currents that underpinned the enactment of the Act.




Stabilization       Policy

        The largest shift in policy marked by the 1946 Employment Act is the post-WI          practice of

allowing the government’s automatic stabilizers to function. Not since the Great Depression have


S Such a cabinet-level economic policy coordinating committee has often existed (and, when it has
existed, has often been chaired by the Secreta~ of the Treasu~).     The head of such a committee (when
not the Secretary of the Treasury) and the staff of such a committee have, however, typically been very
different from the members and staff of the CEA.

mainstream legislators or opinion leaders called for fiscal austerity in the midst of recession. As a

result, the federal government’s budget exhibits substantial cyclical variation, sliding into deeper deficit

in recessions, and moving toward balance or into surplus as the economy expands.

        There have been powerful (and I believe correct) arguments that the federal government has

neither the knowledge of wonomic structure nor the institutional capacity to do any more than allow

fisd   automatic stabilizers to function (see Friedman (1953); Eisner (1%9); Stein (1%9, 1980,

1984)). But in political terms, a simpler argument has held sway: that the federal deficit in time of

recession is “eyelid,”        and that steps to reduce it immediately would aggravate the recession, have

been effective trump cards in public policy debates. Since World War II, at least, this argument has

kept policy makers from seeking budget balance when unemployment is high.

Pre-Keynesian      Fiscal   Theory

        The gap between this calm acceptance of automatic stabilizers and the cyclical fiscal deficits

they produce and pre-WWII attitudes is extremely large. Recall that Franklin Roosevelt made Herbert

Hoover’s failure to balance the federal budget in 1932 an issue in the 1932 presidential election. Or

consider Joseph Schumpeter (in Brown, 1934), writing from Harvard in the middle of the Great

Depression that there was a:




        presumption agaimt remedial measures . . . ~cause] policies of this class are
        particularly apt to.. ,produce additional trouble for the future .... For depressions are]
        not simply evils, which we might attempt to suppress, but.. forms of something which
        has to be done, namely, adjustment to.. change... [and] most of what would be
        effective in remedying a depression wotid be equally effective in preventing this
        adjustment.



        In what Haberler (1937) classified as “monetary over-investment”     theories of the business

cycle, depressions were born either from excessively easy monetary policy or out of ex post

overoptimistic expectations. When monetary policy ceased to be too easy, or when investors and

businesses recognized that their forecasts of future growth had been overoptimistic,   the economy was

left with a large inventory of investment projects that were unprofitable. True and sustainable economic

recovery was not possible until the economy’s overinvestment overhang had been “liquidated” —and

the painful depression was this process of liquidation. Monetary and fiscal policies to moderate the

depression would, in this conceptual framework, keep workers and firms producing in unsustainable

lines of business and levels of capital intensity. Such attempts to alleviate the depression would make

the depression less deep only at the price of making it longer, and would add to the total sum of human

misery (Hayek (1935)).
                                                    9


        Indeed, Lionel Robbins (1934) went as far as to blame the tiny steps tow~d moderating the

decline in the money stock and boosting fiscal demand that governments undertook over 1929-1933

for the persistence of the Great Depression into the mid-1930s.

        This doctrine –that in the long run the Great Depression would turn out to have been “good

medicine” for the economy, and that proponents of stimulative     monetary and fiscal policies in the

1930s were shortsighted enemies of the public welfare —did draw some anguished cries of dissent

(Salant (1989)). For example, Keynes (1931) tried to ridicule it:




       Some austere and puritanical souls regard [the Great Depression] both as an inevitable
       and a desirable nemesis on so much Date 1920s] overexpansion, as they call it; a
       nemesis on man’s speculative spirit. It would, they feel, be a victory for the mammon
       of unrighteousness if so much prosperity was not subsequently balanced by universal
       bankruptcy. We need, they say, what they politely call a ‘prolonged liquidation’ to put
       us right. The liquidation, they tell us, is not yet complete. But in time it will be. And
       when sufficient time has elapsed for the completion of the liquidation, all will be well
       with us again ....

               I do not take this view. I find the explanation of the current business losses, of
       the reduction in output, and of the unemployment which necessarily ensues not in the
       high level of investment which was proceeding up to the spring of 1929, but in the
       subsequent cessation of this investment. I see no hope of a recovery except in a revival
       of the high level of investment. And I do not understand how universal bankruptcy can
       do any good or bring us nearer to prosperity . . .



Ralph Hawtrey (1938), an advisor to the British Treasury and the Bank of England, called it the

equivalent of “crying, ‘Fire! Fire!’ in Noah’s flood” (Temin (1989)). The doctrine was not universally

taught; it was, as Milton Friedman would later recall absent from Chicago. But perhaps the presence of

such doctrines at other universities —which Salant (1989) terms the “crime and punishment” theory of

business cycles– helped induce bright economists to rebel and become Keynesians.

Automatic            Stabilizers

       Automatic stabilizers may not have significantly reduced post-WWII business-cycle variability

below pre-Depression levels (Romer (1986). And any belief that automatic stabilizers have a

si@lcant        effect on business cycle variability does depend on liquidity constraints being pervasive in

the economy (~             bng       and Summers (1986)). Nevertheless, the shift in the cyclical behavior of the

federal budge~ considered as a sea-anchor for the wonomy’s                                    level of total spending, is impressive.

       A good ded of this increase in the magnitude of automatic stabilizers comes from the increase

in the size of the government as a share of national product. The post-WWII federal government taxes

and spends one-sixth or more of national product in peucetime. The Depression-era government taxed
                                                     11


5 to 7 percent and spent 8 to 10 percent of national product. The pre-Depression government taxed and

spent at most 5 percent, and more typically 2 of national product in peacetime.

        With a large federal government, automatic stabilizers are significant. If revenues are one-fifth

of national product, a 5-percent fall in output relative to previous forecasts would “automatically”

produce a deficit of 1 percent of national product from the revenue side alone, even in the absence of

overall progressivity. When, as before the Great Depression, both spending and revenues are 5 percent

of national product or less, “automatic stabilizers” cannot have any macroeconomic significance.

        Table 1 summarizes how the federal fiscal balance responded to cyclical shifts in production

and employment using simple regressions of the federal fiscal balance (as a share of national product)

on the unemployment     rate (using annual data, for fiscal years, and applying Romer’s (1986) suggested

correction to pre-Depression estimates of unemployment         rates). These regressions combine the effects

of automatic stabilizers that were allowed to operate (and not offset by attempts to move toward budget

balance in recession) and discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy.

        To no one’s surprise the pre-WWI era shows no signs of stabilizing fiscal policy: the federal

budget balance is correlated with unemployment, but the small size of the federal government means

that a 5 percentage-point rise in the unemployment rate would be associated with only an 0.28

percentage-point rise in the federal deficit as a share of national product.

       The interwar period shows a degree of stabilization: a 5 percentage-point increase in the

unemployment rate is associated with a 1.6 percentage-point increase in the deficit as a share of

national product. The bulk of this effect comes from discretionary federal relief expenditures during the

Great Depression, rather than from the tax side: between 1929 and 1933 revenues remained roughly

contrast, nominal federal expenditures rose by 50 percent.

        The post-World War II period shows the greatest cyclical responsiveness of fiscal balance to

unemployment. A 5 percentage-point increme in the unemployment rate is associated with a 4.5

percentage-point increase in the federal deficit as a share of national product over the post-World War

11period m a whole. Allowing for a one-time jump in the structural deficit in the early 1980s as a result

of the change in America’s budget politics from the Reagan 1981 tax cut leads to a slightly smaller

estimate of overall fiscal cyclical stabilization: a five percentage-point increase in the unemployment

rate is associated not with a 4.5 but with a 3.5 percentage-point increase in the federal deficit as a share

of national product.

Post-World         War II Discretionary        Fiscal        Policy

        The btik of this increase across time in the countercyclicality of the federal budget is the result

of the budget’s growing size. The commitment to macroeconomic management has checked pressures

for fiscal “prudence” that would otherwise have led to procyclical discretionary fiscal policy. In the

post-WWII era, at least, discretionary fiscal policy has given little aid to stabilization, and the degree of

countercyclical movement in the federal budget balance has been very close to that which would have

been generated by the automatic stabilizers alone.

        Looking back at the budget since World War II, it is difflctit to argue that on balance

“discretionary” fiscal policy has played any stabilizing role (see Gordon (1980); De bng                             and
                                                       15


Summers (1986)). Walter Heller could find one case of successful discretionary stabilization

stabilization policy-the   Kennedy-Johnson     tax cut —to cite in his New Dimensions o~Political

Economy (Heller (1966)). But other concrete cases are lacking (see, for example, Eisner (1%9)).

        The basic difficulty is that recessions are not expected, are not forecasted, and develop rapidly.

Economic policy makers work with shaky data from one quarter or so in the past. Enacting legislation

takes two or three quarters if not two to three years. Appropriated funds require two additional quarters

before they are spent on any substantial scale. And by that time the “need” for stimtius has passed.

        The U.S. government lacks the knowledge to design and the institutional capacity to execute a

countercyclical discretionary fiscal policy in response to any macroeconomic cycle of shorter duration

than the Great Depression itself.

        By contrast, automatic stabilizers swing into action within the current quarter. A fall in incomes

leads to a shortfall in revenues–and    an increase in the deficit-as   soon as witholdings reach the

Federal Reserve. It is difficult to imagine how alternative policy instruments could deliver such a

within-the-quarter   response to shifts in spending and employment.

        Whether the growth of automatic stabilizers has been accompanied by a reduction in post-

WWII business cycle variability below pre-Depression levels is a matter of debate, in view of Romer’s

(1986) convincing demonstration that any such reduction has not been very large. Those who, like me,

believe that automatic stabilizers have had beneficial effects point to large shocks-like   the oil-price

supply-shock of 1973 —found in the post-WWII but absent from the pre-Depression period. We argue

that point estimates of cylicial variability show some stabilization. We claim that the issue is not

stabilization relative to pre-Depression but relative to pre-WWII experience, and that the Great

Depression is a draw from the universe of potential pre-Keynesian business cycles.

        I believe these arguments. I make each of them at least once a month. Nevertheless, attempting

to reconcile the quantitative estimates of Romer (1986) with a belief in the effectiveness of automatic

stabilizers does not leave me feeling entirely ... comfortable.

“Structural”     Deficits

        There is an important argument that the belief in fiscal policy as a tool of economic stabilization

has had harmful consequences for the economy as a whole. Buchanan and Wagner (1977) argue that

deficits are dangerous because voters are myopic: when spending is raised and taxes are raised to

finance the extra government spending, voters feel both the pain of reduced after-tax incomes and the

benefits of spending programs and can judge whether the one is worth the other; when spending is

raised and financed by borrowing, voters feel the benefits from spending but do not sense the true

resource cost imposed by the higher future taxes (or the hyperinflation) required by indebtedness. The

consequence? A government that is “too large,” in that in engages in spending programs that do not

provide social benefits equal to their resource costs, and a heavier tax burden on future generations.

        Democratic politics applied to government spending, Buchanan and Wagner (1977) argue,

function well only as long as deficits are effectively prohibited–regarded     as a dire moral evil. Thus

arguments that deficit spending cotid be useful as a tool of stabilization policy might undermine the

polity’s immune system that prevents the emergence of borrow-and-spend         as standard political

operating procedure. The adoption of borrow-and-spend        threatens economic growth: here in the

United States we are still waiting for even the first sign of any endogenous rise in private savings to

offset the “structural” federal budget deficits of the past fifteen years.

        It is hard to look back at the politics of America’s federal deficit since 1980 and not conclude

that there is a good deal of truth in Buchanan and Wagner’s argument. The basic economic message is

simple enough: “Cyclical deficit —good. Structural deficit-      bad.” Yet this message appears to be a

message that is just a little bit too hard for official Washington to hold on to.

        There are alternative explanations for the emergence of structural deficits in the 1980s. For

example, Auerbach (1994) stresses the necessity of slowing the preplanned growth of federal spending
                                                      17


in the aftermath the post-1973 productivity growth slowdown and its consequent effect on the growth

of the revenue base. Yet it is hard to argue that these alternative explanations are the whole story.

       It is a heavy irony that made the American political party usually seen as most sympathetic to

Buchanan’s general philosophy–the       Republicans-the    earner of the policies that he feared would

emerge tim     the use of fiscal policy for macroeconomic stabilization.

Monetary      Policy

        Whether the fall in nominal monetary aggregates during the slide into the Great Depression best

seen as a mistake of monetary policy or as a shortfall in demand for money is an old argument. In the

first case, the underlyin gproblem was the failure of the Federal Reserve to shovel enough reserves

into the system fast enough; in the second, it was the temporary collapse of the economy’s financial

intermediation “technology” under debt and deflation (Bemanke (1994)). Would a marginally more-

rapid expansion of the high-powered money stock have reduced the size of the Great Depression, or

simply led to a marginally larger decline in the deposit-reserves ratio? I am not cofildent that I know

the answer.

        I do, however, know that the same shifts in opinion and sentiment that made Congress

announce in 1946 that macroeconomic stabilization was “the continuing responsibility and policy” of

the federal government have also led the post-WW 11Federal Reserve to make monetary policy with an

eye not just on price stability but on a whole host of other factors as well. It is impossible to believe

that we will see a repeat of the 1929-1933 experience, during which the Federal Reserve largely

ignored the fall in monetary aggregates because it saw money and credit as “easy” in the sense that

credit-worthy borrowers (of whom there were very few by 1933) could still borrow at very low

wminul (but high real) rates of interest.

        The adoption by the Federal Reserve of the mission of trying to keep unemployment from

rising “too much” above its natural rate has had costs: monetary policy carried out in the pre-WWII

manner would not have allowed the irdlation of the 1970s. But even in the aftermath of the Volcker

disinflation, the Federal Reserve continues to act as though bringing unemployment down whenever it

rises far above its natural rate is a high priority: in the most recent business cycle, the Federal Reserve

pushed real short-term interest rates to and held them at wgative levels from late 1991 until the

beginning of 1994. Here, too, the shift in the concerns and missions of economic policy makers

signalled by the 1946 Employment Act continues to hold.

Macroeconomic        Efficiency

         In recent years, at least, macroeconomic policy management has not been the most time-

consuming mission of the CEA. In the absence of belief in and plans for discretionary fiscal policy, the

macroeconomic stabilization policy roles of the CEA are smaller. One role remaining is the protection

of the fiscal automatic stabilizers from policy changes that might disrupt their operation; for example,

across different administrations the CEA has been an effective lobbyist against versions of balanced-

budget proposals that would enforce year-by-year balance no matter what the level of the

unemployment rate

        The CEA does communicate its own view of the economy to the Federal Reserve, with the

hope of reducing the possibility that the Federal Reserve will talk itself into a false vision of the

economy. It attempts to communicate the Federal Reserve’s view of the universe to the rest of the

Administration.   It attempts to persuade various Assistants to the President that Federal Reserve-

bashing has significant costs and few benefits. It helps the President convince the press that he

understands how the economy is working, and that the current Administration’s        economic policies are

appropriate. And it writes the annual Economic Report of the President.

        But these tasks all together consume perhaps 70 senior staff and member person-months a

year. The Council of Economic Advisers has some 180 senior staff and member person-months

available.

        The rest of the Council of Economic Advisers’ time is spent on “macroeconomic” issues,

attempting to inject a sense of the public interest (sir, consumers aren’t organized and demanding

meetings with you eve~ week, but they would be significantly harmed by this policy); of the fact that

the economy is an equilibrium system in which accounting identities hold (sir, if private savings

remain anemic and the administration is lucky enough to see an investment-led recovery, we will see a

sharply-rising trade deficit which will increase pressures for protection); and of the speed with which

firms, workers, and consumers respond to incentives (sir, under this proposal a small low-wage firm

pays $2,000 less for health coverage for a minimum wage worker than a large firm, so if it is enacted
                                                      20


you will see a lot of large firms fire their minimum-wage     workers and a lot of small firms hire such

workers).

           Often the CEA gets flattened. To paraphrase one not-very-senior White House official, the

public interest is just one more interest among many, so why should it deserve special consideration?

To quote one ex-member of the Council of fionomic          Advisers, “in this business 0.250 is still a very,

very good batting average.” The logic of government is not allocative efficiency enforced by market

discipline. The logic of government is the logic of politics: power exercised, influence used, and

reciprocal favors returned. And it is not clear that this political logic is inappropriate for what are at

bottom political questions.

        But sometimes the CEA does make a macroeconomic difference. And this maybe its most

significant contribution to economic welfare. That the CEA is able to make a positive contribution to

the rnicroeconomic efficiency of public policy is in large part the consequence of the s~lng       pattern

established by Burns and Heller. Members and staff come from academic and think-tank positions,

look forward to returning to academic positions, and view academic and think-tank researchers as the

primary reference peer group whose approval they seek. Evelyn Waugh (1937) wrote of a tyrannical

boss– Lord Beast– with whom people dared disagree only very gingerly: “Up to a point, brd

Beast.” Those who make a career of government are well aware that those in authority are rarely

pleased by bad news, and find themselves under immense pressure to say “up to a point...” The

Council of fionomic     Advisers is somewhat less likely to say “Up to a point,” when what is called for

is “No!”


       Perhaps this institutional capability to sometimes make a difference in terms of macroeconomic

efficiency is due to the operation of an Invisible Hand. Certainly it is not an outcome that anyone

planned. Establishing in the White House staff a group of short-term employees with a primary

allegiance to economists’ sense of the public interest may have been the furthest thing from the minds

of those who wrote Section 4 of the 1946 Employment Act. Their goal was to reduce the freedom of
                                                    21


action of the President and his staff by fixing responsibility for stabilization policy planning on

identifiable individuals chosen with the consent of the Senate.




Conclusion:      Hearts   and Minds

        The principal key to understanding the 1946 Employment Act is that it should be taken as a

signal: a signal that henceforth an administration that failed to achieve acceptable macroeconomic

performance was a failed administration.

        What if there had been no 1946 Employment Act? One possible answer is that things would

have been little different the same pressures that led to the passage of the 1946 Employment Act would

still have existed. Fiscal and monetary policy would still have been shaped with both eyes on

macroeconomic performance. And there would probably have been an Employment Act of 1947, or

1948, or 1949.

        A second possible answer is that there could have been no 1946 Employment Act only if the

shifts in sentiment and opinion of which the 1946 Employment Act was a signal had not occurred, and

if attitudes toward Zaissez-faire as a principle, toward government responsibility for the economy, and

toward the likely effectiveness of government macroeconomic intervention in 1946 had been much

more like attitudes in 1929.

        A world in which opinion leaders and policy makers had not learned the lessons taught by the

Great Depression and World War II would have been a very different world—presumably           a world in

which post-World War II macroeconomists      called themselves Hayekians rather than Keynesians,

discoursed on how deep recessions were a necessary price for the dynamic growth efficiencies of

market-led economic development, and one in which governments responded to depressions by cutting

spending and raising tax rates to keep the budget in balance (thus preventing investors from losing

cotildence   and making the depression worse). In such a world an outbreak of inflation like that seen in

the 1970s would have been very unlikely. In such a world a repeat of the Great Depression wotid
                                                    22


have been somewhat more likely. I do not think that many of us would think that it would have been a

better world than the one in which we have lived for the past fifty years. But my opinion depends on a

belief that the social and economic costs of the outbreak of inflation in the 1970s were low relative to

the probability and cost of another episdoe like the Great Depression.

        There is yet a third answer. In the absence of the @uZur     institutional structure setup by the

1946 Employment Act, economists in government would have been fewer and less powerful. To some

degree the then-Budget Bureau— now the Office of Management and Budget —and its director would

have fulfilled missions now fulfilled by the CEA: career civil servants in Executive Branch cabinet

departments do refer to OMB and CEA as “sister agencies,” and many times the Director of OMB has

been drawn from the set of economists also on the natural short list for CEA chair.4 But in the absence

of the CEA to serve as an institutionalized voice for macroeconomic efficiency, macroeconomic

efficiency as a goal of public policy would have likely played a smaller and feebler role in economic

policy making.
