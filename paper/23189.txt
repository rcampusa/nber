                                           ABSTRACT
This chapter revisits the history of the origins, operation and demise of the Bretton Woods
International Monetary System. The Bretton Woods system was created by the !944 Articles of
Agreement to design a new international monetary order for the post war at a global conference
organized by the US Treasury at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods ,New
Hampshire at the height of World War II. The Articles represented a compromise between the
American plan of Harry Dexter White and the British plan of John Maynard Keynes. The
compromise created an adjustable peg system based on the US dollar convertible into gold at $35
per ounce along with capital controls. It was designed to combine the advantages of fixed
exchange rates of the pre World War I gold standard with some flexibility to handle large real
shocks. The compromise gave members both exchange rate stability and the independence for
their monetary authorities to maintain full employment.

It took over a decade for the fully current account convertible system to get started. The system
only lasted for 12 years from 1959 to 1971 but it did deliver remarkable economic performance.
The BWS evolved into a gold dollar standard which depended on the US monetary authorities
following sound low inflation policies. As the System evolved it faced the same severe
fundamental problems as in the interwar gold exchange standard of: adjustment, confidence and
liquidity. The adjustment problem meant that member countries with balance of payments
deficits, in the face of nominal rigidities, ran the gauntlet between currency crises and recessions.
Surplus countries had to sterilize dollar inflows to prevent inflation.

The U.S. as center country faced the Triffin dilemma. With the growth of trade and income
member countries held more and more dollars instead of scarce gold as reserves generated by a
growing US balance of payments deficit. As outstanding dollar liabilities grew relative to the US
monetary gold stock confidence in the dollar would wane raising the likelihood of a run on Fort
Knox.This led to the possibility that the US would follow tight financial policies to reduce the
deficit thereby starving the rest of the world of needed liquidity leading to global deflation and
depression as occurred in the 1930s. Enormous efforts by the US, the G10 and international
institutions were devoted to solving this problem.

As it turned out, after 1965 the key problem facing the global economy was inflation, not
deflation, reflecting expansionary Federal Reserve policies to finance the Vietnam war and the
Great Inflation. US inflation was exported through the balance of payments to the surplus
countries of Europe and Japan leading them in 1971 to begin converting their outstanding dollar
holdings into gold. In reaction President Richard Nixon closed the US gold window ending the
BWS.

      1. Introduction

      The Bretton Woods system was established to avoid the perceived problems of

      the interwar period: protectionism ( the devolution of international trade from

      multilateralism to bilateralism and autarky), beggar thy neighbor devaluations (

      ‘currency wars’), hot money flows and unstable exchange rates1; and to provide

      a framework of monetary and financial stability to foster global economic

      growth and the growth of international trade.

      The system established in the 1944 Agreement was a compromise between the

      fixed exchange rates of the gold standard, seen as conducive to rebuilding the

      network of global trade and finance, and the greater flexibility to which

      countries had resorted to in the 1930s in the effort to restore and maintain

      domestic economic and financial stability.

      It was a compromise between John Maynard Keynes’ UK plan for the

      establishment of a supra national central bank, The International Clearing Union,

      and Harry Dexter White’s US plan for a United Nations Stabilization Fund. It was

      designed to combine the advantage of fixed exchange rates of the pre World War

      I war gold standard with some flexibility to handle large real shocks. Each

      member would declare a par value of its currency in terms of dollars while the

      United States declared the par value of the dollar as $35.00 per ounce of gold.

      The Articles of Agreement formally obliged member countries to ask the IMF for

      permission in advance before adjusting their parities, as a way of preventing

      opportunistic, beggar-thy –neighbor exchange rate changes. Adjustment would

                                                                                     3
      occur in the face of a fundamental disequilibrium which was never defined but

      has been later construed to mean an imbalance requiring a change in the real

      exchange rate. Thus the Bretton Woods system was set up as an adjustable peg

      system.

      The Agreement further obliged countries to remove restrictions on the current

      account while permitting them to maintain controls on transactions on capital

      account (so as to limit destabilizing capital flows). Capital controls and the

      ability to adjust parities in the face of shocks gave members the flexibility to use

      domestic monetary and fiscal policy to alleviate business cycle shocks but

      adherence to the pegged parities limited the size of these policy actions. The IMF,

      based on the principle of a credit union, whereby members could withdraw

      more than their original gold quotas2 was to provide relief to members for

      temporary current account shortfalls.

      The system evolved differently from what the framers of Bretton Woods first

      imagined. Originally currencies were treated as equal in the Articles. In theory

      each country was required to maintain their par values by intervening in terms

      of the currency of every other country but because the United States was the

      only country which pegged its exchange rate to gold, the others set their parities

      in terms of dollars and intervened in the dollar market. Thus the system evolved

      into a gold dollar standard which in many ways resembled the interwar gold

      exchange standard.

The dollar emerged into prominence in the 1950s because of the sheer size of

the role that the U.S. played in the world economy, its importance in world trade

and its open and deep capital markets. Thus the dollar emerged in the 1950s as a

private international money (McKinnon 1988). By the 1960s it was used as a

unit of account in invoicing imports and exports, as a medium of exchange in

serving as a vehicle currency for interbank transactions, and as a store of value

for private claims for much of the world, although some countries closely linked

to British trade and payments primarily used sterling. At the same time, the

dollar emerged as an official international money. This stemmed from its use as

a unit of account to define the parities of the member countries and because the

dollar was used as the primary intervention currency. Finally because of its role

as a unit of account and a medium of exchange and its growing private

acceptance, it became the dominant international store of value to be used as

reserves. The growing private and official demands for dollars were supported

through private and official long-term capital outflows in excess of a current

account surplus which produced a series of official settlement balance of

payments deficits beginning as early as 1950 (Bordo 1993, page 47).

This paper focuses on the Bretton Woods System in the period 1958 to 1971

after the Western European members declared current account convertibility

until the closing of the gold window by President Richard Nixon on August 15

1971, which effectively ended it. I describe the problems in getting the system

started ,the operation of the System and the problems faced by the United States.

I also discuss the problems faced by other key members, the policies adopted by



                                                                               5
governments, the IMF and other international institutions to preserve the

System Finally I describe the breakdown of the System between 1968 and 1971.



2. Getting the System Started

   It took close to fifteen years to get the Bretton Woods system fully operating.

   A number of overwhelming obstacles stood in the way. The first was

   bilateralism -- for most countries, with the major exception of the United

   States, there were pervasive exchange controls and controls on international

   trade. Along with exchange controls, every country negotiated a series of

   bilateral agreements with each of the trading partners. The rationale for the

   use of controls and bilateralism was a shortage of international reserves. The

   devastated economies of Europe and Asia were unable to produce the

   exports needed to generate foreign exchange.

   The second problem facing the System was a dollar shortage. By the end of

   World War II the US held two thirds of the world’s monetary gold stock and

   gold and dollar reserves were depleted in the rest of the world. Europe ran a

   massive current account deficit reflecting the demand for essential imports

   and the reduced capacity of its export industries. The dollar shortage was

   aggravated by overvalued official parities by the major European industrial

   countries set at the end of 1946. The IMF pressured its members to declare

   par values as soon as possible and if the exchange rate chosen was

   inappropriate, it could be corrected later. Indeed most countries adopted

   their prewar parities on the assumption that wartime and post war inflation



                                                                                6
did not seriously disrupt their competitive position relative to the United

States (Triffin 1957).

By the early 1950s both problems had been solved by two developments; the

Marshall Plan and the European Payments Union (EPU). The Marshall Plan

funneled approximately $13 billion in grants and loans to Western Europe

between 1948 and 1952. The Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, which

created the Marshall Plan was designed to help the European countries

expand their economies, restore their export capacity, and, by creating

economic stability preserve political stability. These results would follow

from providing relief from the burden of financing a massive payments

deficit.

The EPU was established      in 1952 under the auspices of the OEEC (

Organization of European Economic Cooperation) to simplify bilateral

clearing and pave the way to multilateralism ( Kaplan and Schlieminger

1989). The EPU followed the basic principle of a commercial bank clearing

house. At the end of each month, each member would clear its net debit or

credit position against all of its members with the EPU, with the Bank for

International Settlement (BIS) acting as its agent. The EPU became the center

of a worldwide multilateral settlement area, including the countries of the

sterling and franc zone. The process of multilateralism continued until eight

European countries declared their currencies convertible for current account

transactions on December 27, 1958 (Bordo 1993 page 431).




                                                                           7
The third problem getting started concerned the role of the IMF. The IMF, by

intention, was not equipped to deal with the postwar reconstruction

problem. Most of the structural balance of payments assistance in this period

was provided by the Marshall Plan and other U.S. aid including the Anglo-

American loan of 1945.        In a sense the U.S. replaced the IMF. As a

consequence new institutions such as the OEEC and existing institutions such

as the BIS emerged as competing sources of international monetary

authority. Moreover the Fund did very little to speed up the process of

achieving multilateralism .

The Fund also was criticized for seeking a declaration of par values too soon.

The resultant fixed parities then set in motion forces within each country to

resist devaluation until it was done in the face of a currency crisis. The crisis

associated with the 1949 sterling devaluation ( consequent on the 1947

sterling crisis) in turn created further resistance by monetary authorities to

changes in parity ( Schenk 2010), which ultimately changed the nature of the

international monetary system from the adjustable peg intended in the

Articles to a fixed exchange rate regime.

The Fund’s prestige was dealt a severe blow by three events in the pre

convertibility period (Mundell 1969a).        The first occurred when France

devalued the franc in 1948 and created a multiple exchange rate system. This

violated Article IV, section 5 of the Articles and France was then denied

access to the Fund’s resources until 1952. Since France had access to

Marshall plan aid, the Fund’s actions had little effect.



                                                                               8
Second was the sterling devaluation of September 1949 when the Fund was

given only twenty four hours advance notice which also violated Article IV,

section 5. This event revealed the Fund’s inability to deter a major power

from following its sovereign interest.

Third was Canada’s decision to float its currency in 1950 again in violation of

the Articles. The Fund was highly critical of the action. The Canadian

authorities assured the Fund that it was only a temporary expedient

reflecting a massive capital inflow from the US during the Korean war. As it

turned out Canada did not return to the par value system until 1961 and in

contrast to the Fund’s warnings, while the Canadian dollar freely floated

there were only limited swings in it and the Canadian economy performed

better than it did when it was part of the par value system (Bordo, Dib and

Schembri 2010).

Fourth, the Fund’s resources were inadequate to solve the emerging

perceived liquidity problem of the 1960s. The difference between the growth

of international reserves required to finance the growth of real output and

trade and avoid deflation and the growth in the world’s monetary gold stock

was met largely by an increase in official holdings of U.S. dollars resulting

from U.S. balance of payments deficits. By the time full convertibility was

achieved, the U.S. dollar was serving the buffer function for which the

Articles intended the Fund’s resources (Mundell 1969a, page 481).

The final development that preceded the full operation of the Bretton Woods

system was the decline of sterling as a reserve currency. At the outset it was



                                                                             9
expected that sterling would play an important role in the postwar period. At

the end of World War II, Britain ran a massive balance of payments deficit in

gold and dollars. It also had an outstanding sterling debt of 3.7 billion pounds

amassed by borrowing from the British Empire, most of which was made

inconvertible into dollars. The 1946 Anglo American loan of $3.75 billion

from the U.S. and $1.25 billion from Canada was to allow Britain to ratify the

Bretton Woods Articles and restore current account convertibility in dollars.

Current account convertibility was restored in July 15 1947 quickly followed

by a run on sterling which rapidly depleted the UK’s reserves and led to the

suspension of convertibility on August 20 1947. This event as well as the

devaluation of sterling in 1949 greatly weakened sterling’s credibility as a

reserve currency. Sterling’s     devaluation was quickly followed by 23

countries.

The devaluation of 1949 was important for the system because it and

Marshall Plan aid ( by both boosting trade liberalization and removing

political uncertainty) helped move key European countries from a current

account deficit to a surplus which was important to the eventual restoration

of convertibility. It was also important because it revealed a basic weakness

with the adjustable peg arrangement – the one way option of speculating

against parity.   By allowing changes in parity only in the event of a

fundamental disequilibrium the system encouraged the monetary authorities

to delay adjustment until they were sure it was necessary. By then,




                                                                             10
   speculators would also be sure and they would take a position from which

   they could not lose (Friedman 1953).



3. The Operation and Flaws of the BWS

The Bretton Woods system became functional in December 1958 almost 15

years after the original conference, when the Western European countries

declared current account convertibility. Japan followed in 1961. The convertible

Bretton Woods sytem that began at the end of 1958 differed in a number of ways

from the system intended by its architects. These included the dominance of the

United States in the international monetary order, the reduced prestige of the

IMF, the rise of the dollar as a key currency and the decline of sterling, a shift

from the adjustable peg system towards a de facto fixed exchange rate and

growing capital mobility. Despite the prevalence of capital controls in most

countries, private long-term capital mobility increased considerably in the

1950s, and speculative short-term capital movements (through leads and lags in

the invoicing of exports and imports) emerged as a force to threaten the attempt

by monetary authorities to maintain a parity far from fundamentals.

Although the Bretton Woods system was short-lived, it lasted in its convertible

phase from 1959 to 1971, and as we discuss below it had many problems, yet

economic performance during its existence was remarkable. The Bretton Woods

system( along with trade liberalization under the GATT) was associated with

higher and more stable economic growth than in any other period in the past

150 years with the exception of the Great Moderation from 1983 to 2006. In


                                                                               11
    addition inflation performance, both in terms of levels and variation was also

    superior to previous and subsequent regimes with the principal exception of the

    classical gold standard and the Great Moderation periods. (Bordo and Schwartz

    1999, Benati and Goodhart 2010) . However, as we discuss below inflation

    began to rise in 1965 leading to the Great Inflation of the 1970s.

    Problems for Bretton Woods began well before the declaration of current

    account convertibility. First came a series of speculative attacks on the members

    that had misaligned currencies. The UK devaluation of 1949 was followed by

    that of 23 countries. Other adjustments driven by speculative attacks occurred in

    the 1950s and 1960s.3

     Second, the UK as the second reserve country was under continued pressure

    and frequent attack because of a basic overvaluation of sterling reflecting slower

    productivity growth and higher inflation than its competitors. A series of four

    currency crises from 1961 to 1967 led to massive rescues by the IMF, the G10

    and the Federal Reserve culminating in the devaluation of November 1967 and

    the effective end of sterling’s role as a reserve currency (Bordo, MacDonald and

    Oliver 2010).

    Third, as the system evolved into a gold dollar standard, the three big problems

    of the interwar gold exchange standard re emerged: the adjustment, confidence

    and liquidity problems.

    The Adjustment Problem


3Canada devalued in 1949 and floated in 1950, France devalued in 1957, 1958 and
1969, Italy devalued in 1961, the Netherlands revalued in 1961 and Germany
revalued in 1961 and 1969.


                                                                                   12
      The adjustment problem in Bretton Woods reflected downward rigidity in

      wages and prices which prevented the normal price adjustment of the gold

      standard price specie flow mechanism to operate. Consequently, payments

      deficits would be associated with rising unemployment and recessions. The

      reluctance to follow tight monetary and fiscal policies (in most advanced

      countries with the principal exceptions of Germany and Switzerland) except in

      the face of a currency crisis, reflected the strong commitment to full employment

      and a social safety net .For surplus countries inflationary pressure would ensue

      which they would try to block by sterilization and capital controls.

      The United Kingdom between 1959 and 1967 alternated between expansionary

      monetary and fiscal policies designed to maintain full employment and

      encourage economic growth and austerity programs—a strategy referred to as

      stop-go. The connecting link was the state of the balance of payments.

      Expansionary policy inevitably led to deterioration in the current account, a

      decline in international reserves and speculation against the sterling parity.

      On several occasions, standby loans were drawn from the IMF and rescue

      packages arranged by the G10 through the BIS.4 (referred to as Basle Operations

      and Arrangements, Bordo and Schenk 2017). These took place in 1957, 1961 and

      1964. The final crisis occurred in 1966-67 ending in sterling’s devaluation in

      November 1967, in which the Federal Reserve and other central banks

      contributed to a $3 billion rescue package which was insufficient to stem the

      speculative attack. After the November 1967 devaluation and the 1968 Basel


4   Referred to as Basel Operations and Arrangements ( Bordo and Schenk 2017).


                                                                                       13
      Agreement( in which the members of the Sterling area received a dollar

      guarantee of their sterling holdings ) sterling ceased to be an effective

      international reserve currency (Schenk 2010).

      The experience of the UK was important for the adjustment issue because it was

      a country with a chronic balance of payments deficit forced to take corrective

      action 5. For the U.S. sterling as an alternative reserve currency was viewed as a

      first line of defense for the dollar ( Bordo, Humpage and Schwartz 2015).

      During this period, every technique and tool recommended by the Organization

      for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Working Party 3 on

      adjustment was used. Other facilities to provide the liquidity needed for

      adjustment were developed (Basel arrangements, short-term swaps (extensions

      of inter-central bank credit lines) and longer term facilities. The IMF instituted

      the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) in 1961, in which the G10 countries

      provided a $6 billion line of credit in hard currencies to the IMF.



West Germany (1959-67) (also the Netherlands) was a surplus country facing the

opposite problem to the UK. Rapid economic and export growth and relatively slow

inflation led to a series of current account surpluses and reserve inflows in the

1950s and 1960s. Concern over the inflationary consequences of the balance of

payments surplus led the German monetary authorities in 1955 to both follow tight

monetary policy and to institute measures to prevent capital inflows, including the

prohibition of interest payments and discriminatory reserve requirements on


5   France had been in a similar position in 1950.


                                                                                     14
foreign deposits. Finally, in 1961 the Deutsche Mark was revalued by 5%. The

package of tight money and capital controls was repeated again in 1964-66 and

1968. Germany resisted adjustment during the Bretton Woods era. The German

monetary authorities believed that the key problem of the international monetary

system was inflation imported from abroad ( Bordo 1993 pp 54-55).



   Asymmetric adjustment between the United States and the Rest of the

   World

   In the Bretton Woods pegged exchange rate system the United States as central

   reserve country did not have to adjust to its balance of payments deficit. It was

   the n-1th currency in the system of n currencies (Mundell. 1969b). Other

   countries had to intervene in their foreign exchange markets and buy or sell

   dollars to maintain their pegs. The US Treasury only had to intervene in the gold

   market to maintain the fixed dollar price of gold at $35 per ounce. Indeed, as a

   matter of routine the Federal Reserve automatically sterilized dollar outflows.

   This asymmetry of adjustment was resented by the Europeans. The Germans

   viewed the U.S. as exporting inflation to surplus countries through its deficits

   (Emminger 1967). The French resented U.S. financial hegemony and the

   seigniorage that the U.S. earned on its outstanding liabilities (Rueff 1967). They

   preferred jettisoning the gold dollar system and returning to the classical gold

   standard.

   The U.S. monetary authorities began to worry about the balance of payments

   deficit because of its effect on confidence. As official dollar liabilities held



                                                                                     15
abroad mounted with successive deficits, the likelihood increased that these

dollars would be converted into gold and that the U.S. monetary gold stock

would eventually reach a point low enough to trigger a run. This was actually

what happened to the Gold Exchange standard in the interwar period. Indeed, by

1959, the U.S. monetary gold stock equaled total external dollar liabilities and

the rest of the world’s monetary gold stock exceeded that of the United States. By

1964, official dollar liabilities held by foreign monetary authorities exceeded the

U.S. monetary gold stock. See figure 1.

A second source of concern, which also echoed the interwar, was the dollar’s role

in providing liquidity to the rest of the world. Elimination of the U.S. balance of

payments deficit (as the Germans and French urged) could create a worldwide

liquidity shortage. Much concern through the 1960s was over how to provide

this liquidity.

Robert Triffin (1960) captured the problems in his famous dilemma. Because the

Bretton Woods parities which were declared in the 1940s had undervalued the

price of gold, gold production would be insufficient to provide the reserves to

finance the growth of global trade. Moreover, the main source of supply at the

time, the USSR and South Africa were unreliable (Gilbert 1968). Under the gold

dollar standard, the shortfall would be met by US dollars provided by capital

outflows from the US manifest in its balance of payments deficit. Triffin posited

that as outstanding US dollar liabilities mounted they would increase the

likelihood of a classic bank run when the rest of the world’s monetary

authorities would convert their dollar holdings into gold ( Garber 1993).



                                                                                16
    According to Triffin, when the tipping point would occur the US monetary

    authorities would tighten monetary policy and this would lead to global

    deflationary pressure and, in the face of nominal rigidities, global depression as

    in the 1930s (Bordo Erceg and Evans 2000)6. Triffin’s solution was to create a

    form of global liquidity like Keynes’s (1943) bancor to act as a substitute for US

    dollars in international reserves. This was achieved in 1969 with the creation of

    the SDR (special drawing rights sometimes referred to as paper gold). This was

    too little and too late to save the system.

    Another way to think about the problems of Bretton Woods is in terms of the

    open economy trilemma posited by Obstfeld and Taylor (2004). According to

    the trilemma only two of three conditions could prevail; fixed exchange rates; an

    open capital account; and independent monetary policy. In the Bretton Woods

    system the trilemma would be solved by imposing capital controls. This would

    allow the domestic monetary authorities to maintain full employment and low

    inflation while keeping the exchange rate pegged. As events unfolded member

    states followed financial policies inconsistent with the pegged rates and capital

    controls were increasingly evaded leading to speculative attacks.




6As it turned out Triffin’s predictions never came true. As it is argued below , the
System did not collapse into deflation but exploded into inflation . Bordo and
Mccauley 2017.


                                                                                       17
4.Policies to Shore Up the System



The problems of the Bretton Woods System were dealt with by the IMF, the G10

plus Switzerland and by the U.S. monetary authorities. The remedies followed

often worked in the short-run but not in the long-run. The main threat to the

system as a whole was the Triffin problem which was exacerbated after 1965

by expansionary U.S. monetary and fiscal policy which led to rising inflation.

Misalignments between member countries other than the U.S. also aggravated

the basic problem because deficit countries like the U.K. would settle their

imbalances with surplus countries like Germany in dollars, which in turn

increased the threat of eventual conversion into U.S. monetary gold. The ongoing

U.S. balance of payments deficits and depleting gold stock, which were initially

viewed as temporary were dealt with by actions taken both by the Treasury and

the Federal Reserve.

The event which galvanized action was a spike in the London price of gold to

$40.50 in October 1960. It was based on the fear in the financial markets that if

John F Kennedy were to be elected as President that he would pursue

inflationary policies. The Treasury developed policies to both discourage

conversion of dollars into gold by the Europeans, e.g. moral suasion on Germany

with the threat to pull out U.S. troops, the creation of the Gold Pool in 1961

(eight central banks pooled their gold reserves to be used to keep the London

price of gold close to the $35 per ounce parity price), the issue of Roosa bonds(

foreign currency denominated bonds to discourage US allies from converting



                                                                              18
   dollars into gold, originated by Robert Roosa, Undersecretary of the Treasury for

   Monetary Affairs) , The General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB) 1961 which

   created an IMF lending facility large enough to offer substantial credit to the

   United States.),Operation Twist in 1962( the U.S. Treasury bought long term

   debt to lower long term interest rates and encourage investment while the

   Federal Reserve simultaneously sold short –term Treasury bills to raise short –

   term interest rates to attract capital inflows), and the Interest Equalization Tax

   in 1963 (which imposed a tax on capital outflows).

   The U.S.Treasury also engaged in sterilized exchange market intervention, both

   spot and forward, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which had been

   created in 1934 from the proceeds of Roosevelt’s devaluation of the dollar

   (Bordo, Humpage and Schwartz 2015 chapter 3). In 1961, to tap the Fed’s

   greater resources, the Treasury requested it to join in the intervention. The main

   instrument used by the Fed to protect the gold stock was the swap network. It

   was designed to protect the U.S. gold stock by temporarily providing an

   alternative to foreign central bank conversion of their dollar holdings into gold.

   In a typical swap transaction, the Federal Reserve and a foreign central bank

   would undertake simultaneous and offsetting spot and forward exchange

   transactions typically at the same exchange rates and equal interest rates.

The swaps in turn became valuable to foreign monetary authorities in the face of a

currency crisis, e.g. the UK 1961 to 1967 and France 1968-69. The Federal Reserve

swap lines increased from $ 900 million to $11.2 billion between March 1962 and

the closing of the gold window in August 1971 (Bordo, Humpage and Schwartz



                                                                                  19
2015). See Figure 2 and Figure 3 .As can be seen in figure 3 until 1967 sterling took

up the lions share of the swap lines.

The swaps and the ancillary Treasury policies did protect the U.S. gold reserve until

the mid 1960s and were viewed at the time as successful policies. Indeed during the

period 1959 to 1967 the Bretton Woods system functioned reasonably well with the

various cooperative arrangements that had been worked out by the G10, the BIS and

the IMF (Bordo and Schenk 2017).

In addition to the many policies designed to solve the U.S. adjustment problem,

following Triffin’s approach, a number of plans were instituted to provide

alternative forms of liquidity for the international monetary system to gold and

dollars. Triffin’s own solution was to go back to the Keynes plan and have the IMF

serve as the world’s central bank and issue bancor (international fiat money). An

alternative plan was Edward Bernstein (first Research Director of the IMF)’s plan to

issue CRU-- a composite reserve unit. Under the Bernstein plan, each member of the

G10 would subscribe an amount of its own currency to a pool and receive in

exchange a corresponding amount of CRUs which could then be used as equivalent

to gold. An extension of the CRU was the Special Drawing Right (SDR) which was

adopted under the First Amendment to the IMF articles in 1969. In the SDR scheme,

a special drawing account was set up at the Fund, separate from the general

account. In contrast to the CRU, access to SDRs was made available to all members,

not just the G10. Members were credited SDRs in proportion to their quotas. Also

unlike the CRU, the SDR was a fiat obligation and was not backed by gold, although it

was valued in terms of gold at par with the U.S. dollar. Its acceptability derived from



                                                                                    20
the obligation by other members to accept SDRs in exchange for providing hard

currency. Members had to accept SDRs when the Fund mandated their acceptance,

as long as their holdings were less than three times their cumulative allocation. The

IMF Articles were amended in 1969 creating the SDR. It was activated in 1970.

Several plans were also suggested to alleviate the confidence problem. These

included: substituting SDRs for gold and dollars as reserve assets “the substitution

account” ( McCauley and Schenk 2015). Many felt that this would just put the

pressure onto the new asset; doubling the official price of gold (Rueff 1967, Gilbert

1968). It would create sufficient liquidity to alleviate both the liquidity and

adjustment problems. Also, the rise in the official price of gold would encourage gold

production and discourage private demand. Growth in the world monetary gold

stock would be sufficient to finance the growth of real output and prevent a threat

to US gold reserves for the foreseeable future. It was opposed on the grounds that it

was time inconsistent, that if the official price of gold were raised once why would it

not happen again? Market agents would expect a change in gold’s price in the future

and would reduce their holdings of dollars permanently. Second it would only

postpone the problem because eventually, in the face of rapid real growth scarcity

would reappear (Bordo 1993 page 72).



   5. The Breakdown of Bretton Woods 1968 to 1971



A key force that led to the breakdown of the BWS was the rise in inflation in the

center country, the United States, beginning in 1965. Until that year Federal Reserve



                                                                                    21
Chairman William McChesney Martin had maintained low inflation. It also attached

high importance to the balance of payments and the US monetary gold stock in its

policy deliberations (Bordo and Eichengreen 2013). Beginning in 1965 the Martin

Fed shifted to an inflationary policy which continued until the early 1980s and in

the 1970s became known as the Great Inflation .See figure 4. The shift in policy

reflected the accommodation of growing fiscal deficits—a strategy referred to as

fiscal dominance (Leeper and Walker 2011.). Rising deficits reflected the increasing

expense of the Vietnam War and Lyndon Baines Johnson’s Great Society. One way

that fiscal pressure led to accommodative monetary policy was by the use of “Even

Keel” policies under which the Federal Reserve would stabilize interest rates during

Treasury funding operations. This operation prevented the Fed from tightening

monetary policy to offset inflationary pressure (Meltzer 2010, Humpage 2015).

The Federal Reserve shifted its stance in the mid 1960s away from monetary

orthodoxy in response to the growing influence of Keynesian economics in the

Kennedy and Johnson administrations with its emphasis on the primary objective of

full employment and the belief that the Fed could manage the Phillips Curve tradeoff

between inflation and unemployment ( Meltzer 2010 Vol 2 Book 1) In addition, as

the inflation rate ratcheted up, fear that the tight monetary policies required   to

reduce it would lead to rising unemployment and a political backlash against the

Fed made first Chairman Martin and then Arthur Burns, his successor, reluctant to

stop it ( Bordo and Orphanides 2013. Introduction)

Increasing U.S. monetary growth led to rising inflation. Rising U.S. inflation then

spread to the rest of the world through growing US balance of payments deficits. A



                                                                                  22
well understood transmission mechanism was via the classical price specie flow

mechanism supplemented by capital flows .This led to growing balance of payment

surpluses in Germany and other countries. The German monetary authorities ( and

other surplus countries) attempted to sterilize the inflows but were eventually

unsuccessful leading to growing inflationary pressure. (Darby, Lothian,et al 1983).

In addition to the rise in US inflation as a source of strain on the international

monetary system, world gold production leveled off in the mid 1960s and even

declined in 1966. While at the same time private demand for gold increased leading

to a drop in the world monetary gold stock after 1966. Beginning in 1966, the Gold

Pool became a net seller of gold.

After the devaluation of sterling in November 1967 pressure mounted against the

dollar via the London gold market. From December 1967 to March 1968, the Gold

Pool lost $3 billion in gold with the U.S. share at $2.2 billion (Solomon 1976, Bordo,

Monnet and Naef 2017). In the face of the pressure the Gold Pool was disbanded on

March 17, 1968 and a two-tier arrangement put in its place. The monetary

authorities of the Gold Pool agreed neither to sell nor to buy gold from the market

and would transact amongst themselves at the official $35 price. As a consequence,

the link between gold production and other sources of gold and official reserves was

cut. In the following three years the U.S. put considerable pressure on other

monetary authorities to refrain from converting their dollar holdings into gold.

The world had switched to a de facto dollar standard. However gold convertibility

still played a role. Although the major industrial countries tacitly agreed not to

convert their outstanding dollar liabilities into U.S. monetary gold the threat of



                                                                                   23
doing so was always present. The system also developed into a de facto fixed

exchange rate system. Exchange rates became more rigid out of the fear of the

consequences of members allowing them to change. Moreover because of increased

capital mobility the pressure for altering the parities of countries with persistent

deficits and surpluses became harder to stop through the use of domestic policy

tools and the aid of international rescue packages.

1968-1969 was characterized by currency crises in France and Germany leading to

a devaluation in France and a temporary float and then revaluation in Germany

taking the pressure temporarily off the U.S..In 1970 U.S. interest rates fell in

response to rapid monetary expansion and the U.S. balance of payments

mushroomed to $9 billion. The deficit exploded to $30 billion by August 1971. The

dollar flood increased the reserves of the surplus countries auguring inflation.

German money growth doubled from 6.8 % to 12% in 1971 and the German

inflation rate increased from 1.8% in 1969 to 5.3% in 1971 (Meltzer 1991, page 73).

In April 1971 the dollar inflow to Germany reached $3 billion. On May 5 1971 the

Bundesbank suspended official operations in the foreign exchange market and

allowed the deutsche mark to float. Similar actions by Austria, Belgium, the

Netherlands and Switzerland followed (Solomon 1976, page 179).

In April 1971, the U.S. balance of trade turned to a deficit for the first time. The

decision to suspend gold convertibility by President Richard Nixon on August 15

1971 was triggered by French and British intentions in early August to convert

dollars into gold. The U.S. decision to suspend gold convertibility ended a key aspect




                                                                                   24
of the Bretton Woods System. The remaining part of the system, the adjustable peg

disappeared by March 1973.

The Bretton Woods system collapsed for three basic reasons. First inflationary US

monetary policy was inappropriate for the key currency country of the system.

Although the acceleration of inflation from 1965 to 1971 was low compared to what

happened in the 1970s, it was sufficient to trigger a speculative attack on the

world’s monetary gold stock in 1968, leading to the collapse of the Gold Pool (

Garber 1993). Once the system had evolved into a de facto dollar standard after the

collapse of the Gold Pool, the obligation of the United States was to maintain price

stability. Instead it conducted an inflationary monetary policy that ultimately

destroyed the system. Indeed the Bretton Woods System was based on rules. The

most important of which was to follow monetary and fiscal policies consistent with

the official peg. The U.S. violated this rule after 1965 ( Bordo 1993 page 84).

Second, the surplus countries were increasingly unwilling to adjust and absorb

dollar balances and revalue their currencies. This reflected basic differences in the

underlying inflation rates that they were willing to accept. It also reflected growing

productivity differences between Germany and Japan on the one hand and the

United States on the other which changed real exchange rates ( Marston 1987). The

growing gap between the sovereign interests of the United States and the other

major powers likely reflected the decline in U.S. power. At the same time as U.S.

power declined relative to the continental countries European countries and Japan

the G10 lost effectiveness and no other focal points of power emerged. The stage

was set for a decentralized system.



                                                                                   25
Finally, the collapse of the Bretton Woods System was related to two major design

flaws. The first was the gold dollar/ gold exchange system which placed the United

States under threat of a convertibility crisis. In reaction it pursued policies that in

the end made adjustment more difficult. The second flaw was the adjustable peg.

Because, in the face of growing capital mobility, the costs of discrete changes in

parities were deemed so high, the system evolved into a reluctant fixed exchange

rate system without any effective adjustment.



6 .Conclusion

The collapse of the Bretton Woods syatem between 1971 and 1973 led to the

general adoption by advanced countries of a managed floating exchange rate system

which is still with us. Yet this outcome (at least at the time) was not inevitable.7 As

was argued by Despres, Kindleberger and Salant (1966) in contra distinction to

Triffin, the ongoing U.S. balance of payments deficit was not really a problem. The

rest of the world voluntarily held dollar balances because of their valuable service

flow—the deficit was demand determined. They viewed the U.S. as supplying

financial intermediation services to the rest of the world. Europeans borrowed long

–term capital from the U.S. because the U.S. capital markets were deeper and more

efficient and interest rates were lower. In turn, Europeans maintained short-term

balances in American banks because of a higher return. In their view the Bretton

Woods System could have continued indefinitely .

This of course was not the case, but although the par value system ended in 1973

7See Bordo and Eichengreen (1998 )for an analysis based on a model of the global
gold standard of how the life of Bretton Woods could have been prolonged.


                                                                                    26
the dollar standard without gold is still with us as McKinnon (1969, 1988, 2014) had

long argued. Both private entities and official agencies hold dollars because of their

superior attributes as money. This was the case in the 1960s when under the gold

dollar standard and still is the case today with fiat money. The key requirement to

maintain the pure dollar standard is for the Federal Reserve to follow a policy of

credible monetary policy geared to price stability. In the 1970s the Federal

Reserve’s inflationary policy led to a shift out of dollar holdings in the rest of the

world and culminated in a speculative attack on the dollar in 1978. Paul Volcker was

appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve to end the inflationary spiral and

restore credibility. He succeeded in doing this by following a vigorous

disinflationary policy which by the mid 1980s greatly reduced the inflation rate but

at the expense of a serious recession in 1980-82. Since the mid 1980s the Fed has

followed a policy to maintain credibility for low inflation and the international

stature of the dollar has been more than fully restored (Eichengreen 2010).

The dollar standard was resented by the French in the 1960s and referred to as

conferring “the exorbitant privilege” on the U.S. and the same argument was made in

2010 by the Governor of the Central Bank of China. However the likelihood that the

dollar will be replaced as the dominant international reserve currency in the

foreseeable future seems remote. The alternative candidates are the euro and the

Chinese renminbi. The euro is still in crisis and the likelihood that the Eurozone will

ever be a secure and stable political and economic entity is doubtful. China is not yet

financially developed and does not have the open financial system free from capital

controls or the presence of the rule of law necessary to backstop a true international



                                                                                    27
reserve currency. The dollar standard and the legacy of the Bretton Woods system

will be with us for a long time.
