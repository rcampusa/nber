                                           ABSTRACT

We use data from multiple national surveys to describe trends in private elementary school
enrollment by family income from 1968-2013. We note several important trends. First, the
private school enrollment rate of middle-income families declined substantially over the last five
decades, while that of high-income families remained quite stable. Second, there are notable
differences in private school enrollment trends by race/ethnicity, urbanicity, and region of the
country. Although racial/ethnic differences in private school enrollment are largely explained by
income differences, the urban/suburban and regional differences in private school enrollment
patterns are large even among families with similar incomes. In particular, the 90-50 income
percentile difference in private school enrollment rates in 2013 is more than three times as large
in cities as in the suburbs, and these gaps are larger in the South and West than in the Northeast
and Midwest. Factors contributing to these patterns may include trends in income inequality,
private school costs and availability, and the perceived relative quality of local schooling options.

               Long-Term Trends in Private School Enrollments by Family Income



Introduction

       Family income inequality in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last few decades (Stone et

al., 2016). One of the consequences of this has been rising residential segregation – affluent

families, especially those with school-aged children, increasingly live in different communities

than lower-income families (Reardon and Bischoff, 2011; Owens, 2016). Since most children

attend a public school close to their home, this has resulted in increased segregation of public

schools by income (Owens, Reardon, and Jencks, 2016). This, in turn, contributes to inequality

in educational outcomes through at least three mechanisms: peer effects, student mobility effects,

and teacher quality effects (Duncan and Murnane, 2014).

       Rising inequality may also have led to increasing economic segregation between public

and private schools. There is, however, surprisingly little information about whether this has

happened. This paper seeks to close this knowledge gap by describing trends over the last several

decades in private school enrollment rates by children from high-, median- and low-income

families.

Background and Context

       Parents send their children to private elementary schools for many reasons. In 2007, 31

percent reported that they did so to obtain a better academic program than that offered by

available public schools. Thirty-six percent reported that they wanted their child’s school to

provide instruction in a particular religion or value system. Eight percent reported that they

wanted a small school, and four percent reported that they wanted a safer environment or better

discipline than available public schools provided.1



                                                                                                   3
       The effects of growing income inequality on patterns of private school enrollment are

unclear. As families have become more aware of the remarkably high recent labor market

payoffs to educational attainments, and as private school tuitions have risen, private schooling

may be one more way that high-income families seek to give their children an advantage in

preparing for post-secondary education. With increasing wealth and income, relatively affluent

families are increasingly able to afford the high tuitions that most nonsectarian and some

religious private schools charge. They may also increasingly want to substitute payment of

private school tuitions for the time they would otherwise spend in monitoring their child’s

experiences in public schools.

       On the other hand, increasing residential and school segregation by income may obviate

the need to seek educational advantage through private schooling. In many states, the size of the

local per-student property tax base is a strong predictor of school district spending. Buying into

suburban communities with high housing prices typically provides access to public schools

perceived to be of high-quality and to a variety of real or perceived amenities associated with

having affluent neighbors. Since interest on mortgage payments is deductible from income in

computing federal income tax liability, while private school tuitions are not, residential moves

may have financial advantages over sending children to private schools.

       There are three groups of families for which increasing income inequality may have had

an especially large impact on private school enrollment rates. The first are black and Hispanic

families. Reardon and Bischoff (2011) show that the increase in residential segregation by

income was greater among black families than among white families over the last three decades.

Nonetheless, affluent black and Hispanic families still live in much lower-income neighborhoods

than equally affluent white families (Pattillo, 2013; Reardon, Fox, & Townsend, 2015; Sharkey,



                                                                                                     4
2014). This may lead a larger percentage of affluent black and Hispanic families to choose

private schools for their children than equally affluent white families.

       The second group are families living in cities. Many urban public schools struggle as they

serve increasingly low-income student populations. Affluent families that choose to live in cities

may find private schools an increasingly attractive educational option for their children.

       The third are families living in the South. School districts in most southern states are

geographically large. Consequently, it is more difficult for affluent families to purchase high-

quality public schooling for their child by moving to a school district with high housing prices

than it is in parts of the country in which school districts are geographically small.

       Given that less than 10 percent of American children attend a private elementary or

secondary school, why should we care if gaps by family income in private school enrollment

rates have grown? One reason is that if the private schools affluent families choose for their

children provide a better education than the schools available to children from lower-income

families, these choices pass on economic advantage to the next generation, and undercut the

potential for intergenerational economic mobility. Even if the instruction in the private schools

that affluent parents choose is not better than that which public schools provide, the opportunity

to build relationships with children from other affluent, well-connected families may confer

long-term economic advantage.

       Another reason to care about trends in private school enrollments by family income is

that well-educated affluent parents that send their children to private schools may be less

interested in devoting their time and their political and social capital to advocating for better

public schools.2

       Finally, the mix of private schools in the United States has changed dramatically over the



                                                                                                     5
last half century. These changes, which we describe below, may have altered the role of private

schools in educating children from different parts of the family income distribution.

Research Design

Datasets

       The ideal dataset for answering our research questions would provide detailed

information on the family incomes, demographic characteristics, residential locations, and

elementary schooling choices of large representative samples of American children for every

year over the last five decades. For children who attended a private school, the dataset would

indicate whether the school was Catholic, affiliated with another religion, or nonsectarian. It

would also indicate the annual “sticker price” (published tuition and fees) each private school

charged, the net annual cost that individual families paid, and the average amount the school

spent each year in educating each student.3

       Unfortunately, no such ideal dataset exists. This led us to use many nationally

representative datasets, each of which contains information useful in addressing some of our

questions. In describing the years for which particular datasets provide information on private

elementary school enrollments, we use the calendar year pertaining to the beginning of the

school year. The datasets include:

   -   46 October Current Population Surveys (CPS), including education supplements, each

       providing information on a nationally representative sample of American households for

       one of the years from 1968-2013;

   -   4 IPUMS datasets, each providing information on a nationally representative sample of

       households from one of the decennial Censuses of Population from 1969-1999;

   -   8 National Household Education Surveys (NHES), each of which provides information



                                                                                                  6
       on a nationally representative sample of children enrolled in U.S schools in a particular

       year, between 1992 and 2013;

   -   3 NCES longitudinal datasets, each of which tracks over time a nationally representative

       sample of children in elementary school;

   -   13 Private School Universe Surveys (PSS), each of which provides information on almost

       all private elementary and secondary schools in operation in the U.S. during a particular

       year, from 1989 to 2013.

   -   6 surveys conducted for Phi Delta Kappan, each of which provides information on the

       attitudes toward local public schools of a nationally representative sample of adults for

       one of the years from 1982 to 1992.

We provide information on the characteristics of these datasets in the online appendix.

Samples

       The CPS and Census survey households. Since our research questions concern the

elementary schooling choices of families, we created samples from these datasets that included

all children enrolled in any grade from 1-8 in a public or private school. For ease of exposition,

we refer to these as the elementary grades. The NCES longitudinal datasets are samples of

children enrolled in school. We included all of the children in these datasets in our analytical

samples. The NHES datasets are samples of children, including children who are home-schooled.

To retain comparability with other datasets used in this study, we constructed analytic samples of

NHES participants enrolled in either public or private elementary schools.

       The unit of observation in each of the 13 PSS datasets is a private school. We used the

PSS datasets to track trends in the number of private schools in operation in the U.S. and in the

number and percentage of American children enrolled in particular types of private school. We



                                                                                                     7
compared estimates of enrollment trends based on data from the PSS to those derived from

responses to household surveys. Since 1995, trends in private school enrollments estimated from

these data sources have been very similar.4

Procedures

        Preparing the many samples for analysis involved several steps. One was to verify the

accuracy of information on key variables in the many data sets. A second was to create standard

definitions for all variables. This was challenging because the questions about demographics,

family income, and schooling choices for children varied among datasets and across years for the

same survey. One example concerns racial and ethnic classifications. Prior to the 1980s,

individuals could identify their race only as white, black, or other. By the late 2000s, there were

25 racial self-identity categories.

        Another step in data preparation was dealing with missing data on family income. As

explained in the online appendix, we used multiple imputation with 20 imputed datasets to fill in

values of family income for respondents who did not complete the relevant survey question.

Measures

        The variables used in our analyses include type of school attended, family income

percentile, child race/ethnicity, and indicators of residential location.

School type. In the datasets that provide the requisite information (NHES, all NCES longitudinal

datasets, and the 1994 and 1997 CPS), we coded school type as public or as one of three types of

private school: Catholic, other religious, or nonsectarian. Some datasets (CPS 1979, 1985, 1988,

and 1991; Census 1969 and 1979) only distinguished church-related private schools (either

Catholic or non-Catholic) from nonsectarian private schools. Others (CPS and Census in other

years) only distinguished private schools from public schools.



                                                                                                      8
       Unfortunately, the datasets that provide information on family incomes do not provide

information on trends over time and location in the distribution of private schools. However, the

PSS does provide this information. The PSS also allows us to distinguish conservative Christian

schools from other schools in the non-Catholic religion-affiliated elementary school category, a

distinction relevant in interpreting the evidence we report in the next section.5 Table 1 provides

descriptive statistics on the national distribution of private elementary schools and students in

1989 and 2013. Table 2 provides information on the distribution of each type of private school

and enrolled students by region, locale type, and year.

                                   <Tables 1 and 2 about here>

       In 1989, one-third of the nation’s 23,500 private elementary schools were Catholic. These

schools, almost half of which were located in cities, tended to be large relative to other private

schools, with an average of 31 students per grade. In 1989, they served 56 percent of the nation’s

private elementary school students. Twenty-four years later, only 22 percent of the 25,903

private elementary schools in the United States were Catholic, and they served only 42 percent of

private elementary school students. The decline in the number of students attending Catholic

elementary schools in Northeastern cities was particularly great, with enrollment falling from

282,746 in 1989 to 91,967 in 2013.

       In 1989, half of the private elementary schools in the U.S. were associated with a religion

other than Catholicism. One-third of these were conservative Christian schools. Both

conservative Christian and other religion-affiliated elementary schools tended to be small,

averaging 12 to 13 students per grade. Together they served one-third of the private elementary

school student population. Over the next 24 years, the number of Conservative Christian

elementary schools increased by 9 percent, with growth concentrated in the South. In 2013,



                                                                                                     9
almost half the students attending conservative Christian elementary schools lived in this region.

       In 1989, 16 percent of private elementary schools were nonsectarian and these schools

served 10 percent of private elementary school students in the U.S. Over the next 24 years, the

number of nonsectarian private elementary schools increased by almost 60 percent, with growth

concentrated in the Northeast. In 2013, they served 18 percent of the nation’s students enrolled in

private elementary schools.

       Family income percentile. Some surveys, such as the Census, asked respondents to report

the individual income for each family member and estimated family income from the sum of the

reported individual incomes. Others asked parents to report into which of 10-18 pre-specified

ranges their family income fell. To obtain a metric that was common across years in constructing

trends in private school enrollment rates for children in elementary school, we used the method

described in the online appendix to convert ordinal income categories into percentiles of the

national distribution of incomes for families with children between the ages of 5 and 21 who

were enrolled in grades one to eight.

       Our original plan was to report trends in private school enrollments by family income

percentile from 1968 to 2015. However, as we explain in the online appendix, CPS-based

estimates of private school enrollment rates by family income for the years 2014 and 2015 are

inconsistent with those from the larger American Community Survey. For that reason, we ended

our CPS-based estimates with the year 2013.

       Family race/ethnicity. We classified children in our analytic samples as belonging to one

of four mutually exclusive racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white (henceforth white), non-

Hispanic black (henceforth black), Hispanic, or other. In our Findings section below, we describe

trends in the private school enrollment rates of children from different racial/ethnic groups



                                                                                                  10
whose families are in the top, middle, or bottom of the U.S. family income distribution, not the

income distribution of families of a particular race/ethnicity. This is also the case for all

subgroup comparisons. This is important to keep in mind because the income distributions of

black and Hispanic families lie to the left of the income distribution for white families. For

example, in 1969, 2 percent of black children and 4 percent of Hispanic children in elementary

school lived in families with incomes that were in the top 10 percent of the national distribution

of incomes of families with children in elementary school. The comparable figures for 2013 are 3

percent of black children and 4 percent of Hispanic children. At the other end of the family

income spectrum, in 1969, 50 percent of black children and 34 percent of Hispanic students in

elementary school lived in families in the bottom 20 percent of the national income distribution

for all families with children in elementary school. In 2013, the comparable figures are 36

percent of Black students and 28 percent of Hispanic students.

       Region. We classified children as living in one of four regions: Northeast, Midwest,

South, and West. Over the half century in which we examined private school enrollment

patterns, the geographic distribution of American elementary school students changed, with the

South and West gaining at the expense of the Northeast and Midwest. In 1969, 23 percent lived

in the Northeast; 28 percent lived in the Midwest; 32 percent in the South; and 17 percent in the

West. The comparable percentages for the year 2013 are 16, 22, 38, and 24.

       City/Suburb/Rural. Between 1969 and 2013 the distribution of U.S. elementary school

students among three types of locales, cities, suburbs, and rural areas, changed markedly, with

suburbs gaining at the expense of cities and rural areas. In 1969, 30 percent lived in cities, 41

percent lived in suburbs, and 28 percent lived in rural areas. The comparable figures for 2013 are

22, 60, and 18 percent.



                                                                                                    11
Data-Analytic Plan

       The details of our analytic methods are described in the online appendix. Here we

provide a brief outline of the methods. We estimate the private school enrollment rate in each

year, conditional on a family’s percentile rank in the income distribution, by fitting a polynomial

logit model in which the outcome is a dichotomous variable assuming a value of 1 if a child in

elementary school in the relevant year attended a private school and zero otherwise. The

predictors include a polynomial function of a family’s percentile rank in the national income

distribution of the families of children in elementary school. Fitting this model provides an

estimate of the function that describes the association between the probability of private school

enrollment and family income percentile in a particular school year. Using this estimated

function, we compute the estimated proportion of students enrolled in private school in the

relevant year at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the income distribution. We refer to these

family-income percentiles as low, middle (or median), and high.

       To estimate private school enrollment rates in each year by race/ethnicity, region, and

urban/suburban location), we fit logit models on the relevant subpopulaton data. To estimate the

proportion of students enrolled in different types of private schools in each year, we fit

polynomial multinomial logit models rather than simple logit models.

       To estimate trends in private school enrollment rates by family income percentile, we fit

regression models through the estimated data points. These models estimate the enrollment rate

(or in one case, median tuition) as a polynomial function of school year, family income

percentile, and their interactions. We base hypothesis tests regarding trends and differences in

trends on the coefficients of the estimated regression models, reporting p values in parentheses.

To illustrate our findings, we plot the fitted polynomial trends. To provide a sense of goodness of



                                                                                                      12
fit, we include the underlying estimated data points in the graphs. Throughout the description of

our research findings, the private school enrollment rates we present are estimates based on the

fitted regression models. To facilitate exposition, we omit the word “estimated” even though all

are estimates generated by the analytical methods described above and explained in greater detail

in the online appendix.

       In addressing some questions, we report evidence from the 1968-69 school year to the

2013-14 school year (henceforth, 1968 to 2013). To make clear the time period for which we

have evidence bearing on each question, we use the same horizontal scale representing time for

all graphs. In some cases, such as trends in rates of enrollment in particular kinds of private

schools by family income, the graphs illustrate that we have no evidence prior to 1987 or after

2011. To remove the effects of inflation on purchasing power, we express all family incomes and

private school tuitions in 2015 $.

       In reporting our results, we pay particular attention to changes in the size of the gap in

private school enrollment rates between families at the 90th and 50th income percentiles

(henceforth, the “90-50 gap”). We do this because the growth in inequality in incomes among

families with children of school age since the early-1980s has been overwhelmingly in the top

half of the distribution (Stone et al., 2016). For example, among families with school-aged

children, the 90th percentile income in 1979 ($124,250) was 2.03 times as large as the 50th

percentile income ($61,118). In 2013, the comparable 90th percentile income ($183,959) was

2.70 times as large as the 50th percentile income ($68,256).6 We report p values in parentheses

from tests of null hypotheses that the 90-50 gaps were the same size in different years. We base

all such tests on the estimated parameters of the regression models.

Findings



                                                                                                    13
National trends

        The percentage of American elementary school students attending private elementary

schools increased from 10 percent in 1948 to more than 15 percent in 1958. The percentage

remained close to 15 through the mid-1960s, but then fell back to 10 percent by the mid-1970s.

The private elementary school enrollment rate remained between 9 and 11 percent for the rest of

the 20th century. After 1999, the rate declined slowly but steadily, from 11 percent in 1999 to 9

percent in 2015.7

        Figure 1 displays fitted trends in private school enrollment rates over the period from

1968 to 2013 for all U.S. children enrolled in grades one to eight whose family incomes were at

particular points in the national distribution. The figure illustrates the strong positive role of

income in predicting private school enrollment rates. For example, in 1968, 18 percent of

elementary-school-aged children living in high-income families attended a private school, while

the corresponding percentages for children from median- and low-income families are 12 and 5

respectively. This pattern is no surprise because, in the absence of scholarships, families must

pay tuitions to send a child to a private school, but not to a public school.8

                                        <Figure 1 about here>

        Figure 1 also illustrates that the income mix of children attending private elementary

schools changed markedly over the last several decades. The proportion of children from middle-

class families who attended private schools declined by almost half, while the proportion of

children from affluent families attending private schools remained quite steady. As a result, the

90-50 gap in private elementary school enrollment rates grew from 5.5 percentage points in 1968

to 9.3 percentage points in 2013 (p<0.001). To gain greater insight into trends in the schooling

decisions of families from different parts of the income distribution, we now to turn to



                                                                                                     14
enrollment trends by private school type.

National trends by private school type

       In 1965, 89 percent of American children who attended a private elementary school were

enrolled in a Catholic school; in 2013, the comparable figure was 42 percent. In contrast, the

percentage of private elementary school students who attended a non-Catholic religious

elementary or secondary school increased from 8 percent in 1965 to 40 percent in 2013. During

this same period, the percentage of private elementary school students enrolled in nonsectarian

schools increased from 4 to 18 percent.9 We now turn to enrollment trends by family income for

the three mutually exclusive categories of private elementary schools that can be differentiated in

national data, albeit in two cases beginning only in 1987.

       The left panel of Figure 2 displays trends in rates of enrollment in private nonsectarian

elementary schools, by family income, from 1969 to 2011. Only a small percentage of the

nation’s elementary school students attend these schools, and a growing percentage who do come

from relatively affluent families. In 1969, one percent of students from median-income families

attended a private nonsectarian school, and the enrollment rate for children from middle-income

families remained between one and two percent through 2011, the last year for which we have

the relevant data.

                                      <Figure 2 about here>

       In 1969, the enrollment rate in private nonsectarian elementary schools for children from

high-income families was only 2 percent, and consequently the 90-50 enrollment rate gap in

these schools was only one percentage point. However, the enrollment rate in private

nonsectarian elementary schools for children from high-income families increased slowly but

steadily, reaching 6 percent in 201l. Consequently, the 90-50 gap in enrollment rates in private


                                                                                                   15
nonsectarian elementary schools in 2011 was almost five percentage points, more than three

times the size of the comparable gap in 1969 (p<0.001).

       The middle panel of Figure 2 displays trends in enrollment rates in Catholic elementary

schools, by family income, over the period from 1987 to 2011. Catholic school enrollment rates

for students from families in the bottom half of the family-income distribution fell slowly but

steadily over the 24-year period. The enrollment rate for middle-income families in 2011 was 3

percent, half the comparable enrollment rate in 1987.

       In contrast, the Catholic school enrollment rate for high-income families declined by only

one percentage point over the 25-year period, from 11 to 10 percent. As a result, the 90-50 gap in

enrollment rates grew from 4 to almost 7 percentage points. Unfortunately, as a result of having

only 11 data points to estimate Catholic school enrollment rate trends at each family income

percentile, the slope differences displayed in Figure 3 are only suggestive; we cannot reject the

null hypothesis that the 90-50 gap in 2011 is the same size as the 90-50 gap in 1987 (p=0.18).

       The right panel of Figure 2 illustrates that enrollment trends in non-Catholic religious

elementary schools are quite different from those for the other two groups of private schools.

Over the period 1987 to 2011, the enrollment rate in other religious elementary schools of

children from median-income families increased from 3 to 4 percent, while that of children from

high-income families declined from 6 to 5 percent. As a result, the 90-50 gap in enrollment rates

in non-Catholic religious elementary schools in 2011 was half the size of the comparable gap in

1987. As with the Catholic school enrollment trends, these patterns are only suggestive. Due to a

lack of power, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the 90-50 gaps are the same size in the

two years (p=0.13).

       In summary, the relatively stable private elementary school enrollment rate for children



                                                                                                    16
from high-income percentile families displayed in Figure 1 masks a shift from religious to non-

sectarian schools from 1970-2010. The declining private school enrollment rates for children

from middle-income and low-income families displayed in Figure 1 are due to a decline in

Catholic school enrollment rates for these groups. These declines were somewhat offset by

increases in the enrollment rates of children from these groups in other religious private schools.

Trends for subgroups of families

Race/ethnicity. In 1959, enrollment rates in private elementary schools for white, Hispanic, and

black students were 16, 13, and 3 percent respectively.10 Over the next half century, the private

elementary school enrollment rate of white students declined slowly, with 11 percent enrolled in

private elementary schools in 2013. During this same period, the comparable enrollment rate of

Hispanic students declined quite rapidly, while that of black students increased slightly. In 2013,

5 percent of black children and 3 percent of Hispanic children of elementary-school-age were

enrolled in a private school.11

       The left panel of Figure 3 displays trends in rates of enrollment in any type of private

elementary school for black students whose families were at different points on the national

family income distribution. In 1968, two percent of black children from low-income families

attended private elementary schools. This rate rose slowly over the next four decades, reaching

four percent in 2013. The private school enrollment rate for black children from middle-income

families was quite steady over this time period, with a 2013 enrollment rate one point higher than

the 5 percent enrollment rate in 1968. In contrast, the private school enrollment rate for black

students from high-income families experienced a substantial initial upward trend, increasing

from 11 percent in 1968 to more than 16 percent in the mid-1990s. After the mid-1990s, the

private school enrollment rate for children from high-income black families fell slightly,


                                                                                                    17
reaching 14 percent in 2013. The net effect of these trends is that the 90-50 gap in the private

elementary school enrollment rate of black students in 2013, 8 percentage points, was only

slightly larger and not statistically different from the comparable gap of 6 points in 1968

(p=0.32).12

                                      <Figure 3 about here>

       The right panel of Figure 3 displays trends in private school enrollment rates, by income,

from 1969 to 2013 for Hispanic children. Private school enrollment rates fell over this period for

children from Hispanic families in all parts of the income distribution. The rate of decline was

most rapid for children from middle-income Hispanic families, falling from 15 percent in 1969

to three percent in 2013. Since the decline was more modest for children from high-income

Hispanic families (from 18 percent in 1969 to 15 percent in 2013), the 90-50 private school

enrollment rate gap experienced a statistically significant increase from 3 points in 1969 to 12

points in 2013 (p<0.001).

       One question that the panels of Figure 3 prompt is whether private school enrollment

rates for black and Hispanic students from high-income families differ from those of non-

Hispanic white students from equally high-income families. To address this question, we fitted

regression models estimating trends in private school enrollment rates for black, Hispanic, and

white children from families in the 90th percentile of the family income distribution in the

relevant year. In 1970, only 12 percent of children from high-income black families attended a

private elementary school, compared to 18 percent of children from high-income white and

Hispanic families. However, as illustrated by Figure 4, the racial/ethnic gaps in the private

elementary school enrollment rates of children from high-income families narrowed after 1980.

While we reject null hypotheses that the private school enrollment rates of children from the



                                                                                                   18
three high-income ethnic groups were equal in 1989, 1999, and 2009 (p<0.05, p<0.001, and

p<0.01, respectively), the differences were less than three percent in every year. In summary,

differences in family income explains much, but not all, of the differences in private school

enrollment rates for children from black, Hispanic, and white families.

                                   <Figure 4 about here>

Urban/Suburban. In 1968, 19 percent of children living in cities and 13 percent of those living in

suburbs attended a private elementary school.13 Over the next half century, both percentages

declined, as did the difference between the private elementary school enrollment rates of urban

and suburban children. In 2013, the respective enrollment percentages were 10 and 8.

       The left panel of Figure 5 displays trends in private elementary school enrollment rates,

by income percentile, for families living in cities. The pattern is a more vivid version of that

displayed in Figure 1 for all American elementary school students. The private school enrollment

rate for children from median-income families declined quite steadily from 20 percent in 1968 to

7 percent in 2013. This decline is linked to the closing of many urban Catholic schools over this

time period. However, it is not clear how much this is due to changes in the demand for urban

Catholic schools (stemming from changes in the religious and racial demographics of cities) and

how much is due to changes in the ability of the Catholic Church to maintain urban schools with

the same relatively low tuition rates that parishes had provided historically.

                                       <Figure 5 about here>

       In 1968, 26 percent of elementary-school-age children from high-income urban families

attended a private school. Over the next two decades, the private school enrollment rate climbed

slightly, reaching 30 percent in 1989. Since then, the private school enrollment rate has fallen to

a rate of 24 percent in 2013, slightly lower than the 1968 rate. A result of these trends, especially



                                                                                                   19
the dramatic decline in the enrollment rate of children from middle-income families, is that the

90-50 gap in private school enrollment rates for children living in cities increased from 6

percentage points in 1968 to 17 points in 2013 (p<0.001).

       As the right panel of Figure 5 illustrates, the private elementary school enrollment rate

for children from middle-income families living in suburbs fell quite steadily over the last

several decades, from 11 percent enrolled in 1968 to 6 percent in 2013. The comparable

enrollment rate for children from high-income suburban families remained quite steady at a level

between 15 and 18 percent from 1968 until quite recently, but fell in the years following the

onset of the Great Recession. A result of this recent decline in the private school enrollment rate

of high-income suburban families is that the 90-50 gap in private school enrollment rates was the

same in 2013 as it had been in 1968 – 7 percentage points.

Region. In 1968, private elementary school enrollment rates were considerably higher in the

Northeast and Midwest than in the South and West.14. In 2013, they were still higher, but the

differences were much smaller. The reason is that private school enrollment rates in the

Northeast and Midwest fell substantially while those in the South and Midwest held quite steady.

The respective enrollment rates by region were 22, 16, 6, and 8 percent in 1968 and 10, 9, 8, and

7 percent in 2013.15

       The four panels of Figure 6 show trends in private school enrollment rates, by income,

for students living in each of four regions. In 1968, more than 20 percent of children from

median-income and high-income families in the Northeast attended private elementary schools,

with the vast majority attending Catholic schools. Over the next 45 years, the percentage of

children from median-income families in the Northeast attending private elementary schools

declined steadily, falling to 9 percent in 2013. The private school enrollment rate for children



                                                                                                   20
from high-income families in the Northeast also fell during this period, but more slowly. As a

result, the 90-50 gap in private school enrollment rates in the Northeast increased from two to

five percentage points (p=.103).

                                       <Figure 6 about here>

       Private school enrollment rates of children from high- and middle-income families in the

Midwest fell by approximately the same amount between 1968 and 2013. As a result, the 90-50

enrollment rate gap in 2013 (6 points) was not significantly different from the 1968 gap of 8

percentage points (p=0.47).

       Trends in private elementary school enrollment rates in the South and West are quite

different from those in the other two regions. The private school enrollment rate of children from

median-income families in the South held quite steady between 1968 to 2013, with six percent of

children attending private elementary schools in both the first and last years of this period. In

contrast, the private elementary school enrollment rate of children from high-income families in

the South increased from 14 percent in 1968 to 19 percent in 2013. As a result, the 14 percentage

point gap in 2013 between the private school enrollment rates of children from high- and middle-

income families in the South was twice as large as the comparable gap in 1968 (p<0.001).

       Trends in private school enrollment rates by income in the West are similar to those in

the South, although more muted. The private school enrollment rate of children from median-

income families in the West fell slightly, from 7 percent in 1968 to 5 percent in 2013. During this

same period, the private school enrollment rate of children from high-income families in the

West increased, and the 14 percent enrollment rate in 2013 was 3 percent higher than the

comparable rate in 1968. A result of these trends is that the 90-50 enrollment rate gap

experienced a statistically significant increase from 4 points in 1968 to 9 in 2013 (p<0.001).



                                                                                                    21
Explaining the Patterns

      To summarize, we have described several striking patterns:

      1. The gap between the private elementary school enrollment rates of children from

          high- and median-income families grew substantially between 1968 and 2013,

          especially during the last two decades of the 20th century. It grew largely because the

          private school enrollment rate of middle-income families declined considerably

          during that time period.

      2. The growth in the 90-50 enrollment rate gap among students of private nonsectarian

          elementary schools has been particularly large and is almost entirely due to a

          substantial increase in the enrollment rate of children from high-income families.

      3. Catholic elementary school enrollment rates have shown a substantial long-term

          decline, especially among children from low- and middle-income families. This

          accounts for much of the growth in the 90-50 gap in private school enrollment rates.

      4. Conditional on family income, private school enrollment rates are much higher

          among families living in cities than among those living in suburbs, and the 90-50 gap

          grew more among urban families.

      5. Private elementary school enrollment rates are lower for black and Hispanic families

          than for white families, but differences in income account for a large part of

          enrollment rate differences.

      6. Private school enrollment trends are quite different in the South and West than in the

          Northeast and Midwest. In both of the former regions, the private school enrollment

          rates of children from high-income families increased, while they declined in the

          other two regions. The 90-50 gap in private school enrollment rates increased much



                                                                                               22
            more in the South than in other regions.16

       We frame explanations for these patterns in terms of a simple economic model of

families. We assume that parents seek to maximize their family’s welfare, subject to the

constraints they face. Quality of their children’s education, as they define it, is one element of

welfare. Relevant constraints include their family income and the cost and perceived quality of

the public and private schools available to them. The cost of public schools depends on the price

of housing in different communities. The cost of private schools is the net tuition and fees the

parents would be charged. We want to emphasize that our potential explanations are hypotheses

supported by descriptive evidence that we offer to motivate future research. We do not claim to

present evidence of causation.

       The decline in the number of Catholic schools and the increasing cost of those that

remain contributed to the decline in the percentage of families sending their children to private

elementary schools, especially among those of modest means. Between 1970 and 2010, the

number of Catholic elementary schools in the United States declined 37 percent and the number

of students attending these schools fell 60 percent. In part, this was because inflation-adjusted

tuition in Catholic elementary schools increased 570 percent (from $873 to $5,858).17 During this

period, the median real income of families with school-aged children increased only 33 percent,

and that of families at the 10th percentile of the income distribution declined by three percent.

Dynarski, Gruber, and Li (2009) show that the demand for Catholic elementary school education

is more sensitive to price the lower a family’s income. The rapid tuition increases help explain

why Catholic elementary schools increasingly serve students from relatively high-income

families.

       One factor contributing to the increasing cost and declining supply of Catholic schools is



                                                                                                     23
the decline in the number of clergy and members of religious orders who provided low-cost

teaching services to Catholic schools. Between 1970 and 2016, the percentage of the staff of

Catholic elementary schools who were clergy or members of religious orders fell from 48 to less

than 3.18

       Another factor contributing to the decline in Catholic school enrollments may have been

the sexual abuse crisis, which was concentrated in the Northeast in the first decade of the 21st

century. Publicity about this scandal may have led some parents to withdraw children from

Catholic schools or to make other choices for children entering school. Settling the court cases

that arose from the abuses reduced the ability of many dioceses to subsidize their schools, a long-

standing practice that had allowed parishes to keep tuitions well below average per-student

operating cost and to offer substantial scholarships to students from low-income families.19

Fallout from the crisis may have contributed to the 44 percent decline between 2001 and 2011 in

the number of students attending Catholic elementary schools in the Northeast. As illustrated in

Figure 7, this was a much more rapid enrollment decline than that experienced by Catholic

elementary schools in other regions of the country during this decade or in the Northeast in the

previous decade.20

       While tuitions at Catholic schools have increased especially rapidly in recent decades,

tuitions in other types of private schools also increased more rapidly than the median income of

families with children. Measured in 2015 dollars, the average full tuition in nonsectarian private

elementary schools rose from $4,120 in 1979 to $22,611 in 2011.21 Given the high tuitions in

nonsectarian private elementary schools, it is not surprising that enrollment in these schools rose

faster among students from high-income families than among those from low-income families,

or that the 90-50 enrollment gap increased substantially.



                                                                                                   24
       Tuitions have also increased substantially in non-Catholic religious elementary schools.

In 1993, average full tuition (in 2015$) in these schools was $3,896. In 2011, it was $9,134

(Snyder and Dillow, 2015, Table 205.50). Since the average income of high-income families

increased by much more than that of median-income or low-income families during this period,

it is surprising that 90-50 enrollment gap did not increase between 1987 and 2011. We return to

this puzzle below, when we discuss differences across regions.

       Another factor relevant to explaining trends in private school enrollments is the perceived

quality of the public schools with which private schools compete. Nationwide, the gap between

the average score of students in public schools and private schools on the grade 4 National

Assessment of Educational Progress mathematics assessment declined markedly between the

1990s and 2011 (Dynarski, 2016). This may explain why the percentage of elementary school

students attending private schools declined slightly during this period.

       A consequence of the increase in residential segregation by income over the last several

decades, especially among families with school-aged children, is that urban public schools

increasingly serve low-income student populations (Owens, 2016; Owens, Reardon, and Jencks,

2016). Average mathematics and reading scores are considerably lower for students attending

urban public schools than for those attending suburban public schools (Blagg, 2016). Student

discipline problems are more frequent (Snyder, DeBrey, and Dillow, 2016, Table 230.10).

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s (the only period for which consistently coded data are

available), a lower percentage of urban parents with children of school age rated their local

public schools as A or B than suburban parents with the same income did. Moreover, as

illustrated in Figure 8, a higher percentage of high-income suburban parents gave their local

public schools a grade of “A” or “B” (on an A-F scale) than did lower-income suburban parents



                                                                                                25
(p<0.01). This probably reflects the greater capacity of high-income parents to choose to live in

suburban communities with high-quality public schools. In contrast, high-income parents living

in cities did not rate their local public schools more favorably than lower-income urban parents

did.22 This helps to explain why high-income parents who choose to live in cities are more likely

than those living in suburbs to send their children to private elementary schools.23

       Differences across regions in the composition of private school enrollments help to

explain differences in private school enrollment trends. Historically, Catholic school enrollment

rates in the South and West were much lower than those in the Northeast and Midwest.

Consequently, declining availability and increasing cost of Catholic elementary schools affected

private school enrollment rates in the South and West less than those in the other two regions.

       During the 1970s, efforts by the courts to desegregate public schools in the South resulted

in white flight to private schools (Rossell, 1983). This contributed to the increase in the private

school enrollment rate in the South during that decade, especially among white and high-income

families. Reardon and Yun (2003) show that the private school enrollment rate of white children

living in predominantly black counties in the South remained high throughout the last three

decades of the 20th century.

       The disproportionate number of conservative Christians in the South may also play a role

in explaining regional differences in private school enrollment rate trends. In the wake of

Supreme Court decisions banning prayer in schools, many conservative Christians felt that

public schools did not reflect their values (Cooper, 1984). This may explain why the percentage

of median-income families living in the South who sent their children to non-Catholic religious

elementary schools increased over the past several decades despite the marked increase in

tuitions at these schools. Interestingly, the percentage of high-income families in the South who



                                                                                                      26
sent their children to non-Catholic religious elementary schools declined over this same period,

and the 90-50 gap in enrollment rates in other religious elementary schools declined (p<0.05).

However, high-income Southern families increasingly sent their children to nonsectarian private

schools (p<0.01). This helps to explain why 90-50 gaps in private elementary school enrollment

rates increased in the South between 1987 and 2011.24

Implications of the Trends

       Relative to residential mobility patterns, trends in private school enrollments play only a

modest role in explaining increases in school segregation by income. The reason is that the

percentage of American children attending private elementary schools has declined from 15 to

less than 9 percent in recent decades. However, this role is not inconsequential. Over the last

three decades, Catholic schools and nonsectarian private schools have increasingly served

students from high-income families. These trends, especially among urban families and those

living in the South and West, are one of several mechanisms through which increases in family

income inequality have contributed to increases in school segregation by income.

       It is more difficult to judge whether trends in private school enrollment rates by family

income have contributed to increases in gaps in educational outcomes by family income. If

average per student expenditure is an indicator of instructional quality, this may be the case. The

reason is that the 90-50 enrollment rate gap has increased the most in nonsectarian elementary

schools, which are more than twice as expensive, on average, as religious schools (Baker, 2009).

       It is also the case that median-income parents who enrolled their child in a particular type

of private elementary school paid less than high-income parents who did so. For example, the

median tuition paid by a middle-income family that sent a child to a nonsectarian private school

in 2001, the latest year for which we have the relevant data, was $2,100 less (in 2015 $) than that



                                                                                                   27
paid by high-income families.25 Part of the difference may reflect scholarship aid to median-

income families. However, it also reflects differences between the high-priced private schools

that children from affluent families attend and the lower-priced, and perhaps less effective

private schools that students from lower-income families attend. Indeed, Braun, Jenkins, and

Grigg (2006) and Lubienski and Lubienski (2014) document that differences in the effectiveness

of private schools within each private school type are much greater than differences between the

average effectiveness of each type of school. We know of no evidence about whether the more

expensive private schools are more effective than the less expensive ones. Certainly, the school

choices of affluent families indicate that they believe they are.

       The limited available evidence on the average effectiveness of different types of private

schools does not support a clear inference about whether trends in private school enrollments by

family income have increased or decreased the size of income-related gaps in student

achievement. Using data from the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress, Braun,

Jenkins, and Grigg (2006) and Lubienski and Lubienski (2014) find that, net of family

background influences, the average mathematics and reading achievement of children enrolled in

conservative Christian elementary schools was approximately one-half a standard deviation

lower than that of demographically similar children enrolled in public schools. This is consistent

with the very low average per student expenditure in these schools (Baker, 2009) and the weak

average academic qualifications of their teaching staffs (Lubienski & Lubienski, 2014).

Unfortunately, there is no systematic evidence on the reading and mathematics achievement, net

of family background influences, for the 65 percent of children enrolled in non-Catholic religious

private schools that are not conservative Christian schools.

       Enrollment of students from high-income families in non-Catholic religious private



                                                                                                 28
schools declined in recent decades, while that of students from middle-income and low-income

families increased. The low average reading and mathematics achievement of children enrolled

in conservative Christian academies suggests that these enrollment trends may have contributed

to the increase in the reading and math test score gap between children from low- and high-

income families, although the effects would likely be very modest, given the small proportion of

students in such schools.

       On the other hand, trends in Catholic elementary school enrollments may have reduced

income-related gaps in test scores. Using data from the period 1998-2004, Reardon, Cheadle, and

Robinson (2009) report that, by fifth grade, Catholic school students have math skills 3–4

months behind those of socioeconomically similar public school students who started

kindergarten with the same level of initial skills.26 Using NAEP data from 2003, Braun, Jenkins,

and Grigg (2006) and Lubienski and Lubienski (2014) report similar patterns. In recent decades,

the percentage of children from low- and medium-income families who attend Catholic

elementary schools has fallen rapidly while the percentage attending public schools has risen. If

the change in the distribution of low- and middle-income students reflected movement from

Catholic schools of average effectiveness to public schools of average effectiveness, this would

have resulted in improved mathematics achievement for students from low- and middle-income

families. However, we have no way to judge whether this assumption holds. Nor do we know if

the relative performances of Catholic and public elementary schools has changed in the last

dozen years.

       We conclude by reminding the reader of the dramatic changes that have taken place in

the distribution of private elementary school enrollments in the U.S. over the last 45 years. One

illustration is that non-Catholic religious elementary schools today serve more students whose



                                                                                                 29
family incomes are in the bottom half of the distribution than Catholic elementary schools do.

Another is the substantial increase in recent decades in the percentage of students from high-

income families that attend private nonsectarian private schools. Much less is known about these

groups of private schools than is known about Catholic schools, which historically were the

dominant supplier of private school services in the U.S. and the subject of a great deal of

research.

       The key trends we document in this paper have, together, troubling implications for the

segregation of low-income students. As a result of growing residential segregation by income,

low-income families are increasingly concentrated in urban areas. In such places, one quarter of

high-income families enroll their children in private schools; but a much smaller—and

declining—proportion of middle- and low-income families in urban areas do so. This is, in part,

a result of rising tuition and reduced availability of Catholic schools, which in the past enrolled

many middle and low-income students in urban areas. As a result, both urban public schools and

urban private schools have less socioeconomic diversity today than they had several decades ago.

       Higher income families, however, increasingly live either in the suburbs or enroll their

children in private schools. Moreover, the private schools their children attend are more likely to

be expensive nonsectarian schools than was the case four decades ago. Together these trends

indicate an increasingly polarized pattern of school enrollment. As a result, American schools—

both public and private—are increasingly segregated by income.

    Authors’ tabulations of data from the 2007 National Household Education Surveys (NHES).
2
    Another possibility is that affluent parents who send their children to private schools may be

less likely to vote in favor of the taxes needed to fund high quality public education. We know of

no evidence that directly addresses this hypothesis. However, Boustan et al. (2013) and Corcoran

and Evans (2010) find that rising income inequality is associated with increases in spending on

public education. They point out that this is consistent with a median voter model in which rising

income inequality reduces the median voter’s tax share.
3
    As Baker (2009) points out, many private schools spend more per student each year than the

tuition and fees they charge, making up the difference from returns on endowments or from

annual voluntary donations.
4
    The estimates of private school enrollments from the first administrations of the PSS (1989,

1991, and 1993) were considerably higher than CPS-based estimates. Williams (1987) explains

that surveys of private schools conducted by the U.S. Department of Education during the 1970s

and early 1980s also produced estimates higher than those obtained from the CPS (a household

survey). We had hoped to use information from the PSS to estimate birth and death rates for

different types of private schools. However, we concluded that our estimates were inaccurate

because many private schools did not respond to the PSS questionnaire in some years.
5
    The U.S. Department of Education classifies conservative Christian schools as those that have

membership in at least one of four associations: Accelerated Christian Education, American

Association of Christian Schools, Association of Christian Schools International, or Oral Roberts

University Education Fellowship (Kena et al., 2016, p. 83).

    Had we chosen to report private school enrollment trends for 95th income percentile families

                                                                                                     31
instead of those for 90th income percentile families, the patterns we describe would have been

even more striking. We chose to report the 90th income percentile trends because they are less

sensitive to limitations in the family-income data and assumptions about the functional form of

our estimating equations than the 95th income percentile trends are.
7
    Estimates of private school enrollment rates for the years prior to 1968 were taken from Bruno,

1982, Table 1, p. 20. The authors estimated rates for subsequent years from October Current

Population Survey data. In all of the statistics we report in this paper on the percentages of

American elementary school students enrolled in private school, the denominator is the

combined total number of students enrolled in either private or public schools. Excluded from

the denominator is the number of students of elementary-school age who are home-schooled. We

do this because there is no reliable estimate of the number of children who are home-schooled

prior to the first administration of the NHES in 1995 that specifically asks whether children are

home-schooled. Data from the NHES indicate that the percentage of children of elementary

school age who are home schooled increased from 2.4 percent in 2000 to 3.0 percent in 2006.

(Due to a change between 2006 and 2011 in the method of administering the NHES, the estimate

of the home schooling rate from the 2011 survey is not comparable with those from earlier

administrations of the NHES.)

    Families do pay for high-quality public schools by paying premiums for housing in relevant

attendance zones.

    The authors calculated the distribution of student enrollments in different categories of private

schools in 1965 using information in Statistics of Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Schools

1965-66 (1968), Tables 7a and 8a, pp. 24 and 26. Authors’ calculations of data from the 2013

PSS provided the analogous information for 2013.

     Part of the explanation for the recent decline in the private elementary school enrollment rate

for children from high-income black families lies in relatively long-lasting income and wealth

shocks from the Great Recession that were greater, on average, than those experienced by white

families (McKernan et al., 2013). However, the decline started before the onset of the Great

Recession.

     For reasons of parsimony, we do not include in this paper evidence on trends in private school

enrollment rates for secondary school students. These trends are quite similar to those for

elementary school students, with the following qualifications. The percentage of high school

students attending private schools has been consistently lower than that of elementary school

students, but the difference has declined from four percentage points to one over the last half

century. The 90-50 gap in private school enrollment rates grew less among high school students

than among elementary school students. Finally, point estimates indicate that trends by family

income in enrollment rates in particular types of private schools are somewhat different at the

high school level than at the elementary school level. However, the differences are primarily due

to the small amount of data available to estimate these trends.

     Between 2001 and 2011, the number of students attending Catholic elementary schools

declined by 27 percent in the Midwest and by 19 percent in the South and West. Between 1991

and 2001, Catholic elementary school enrollment in the Northeast declined by 10 percent.

     Bruno (1982), Table 7, page 27 provides the mean tuition in 1979 in current dollars. The

tuition figure for 2011 came from Snyder and Dillow (2015), Table 205.50, pp. 118-119. These

23
     Another factor that may have contributed to the decline in the private school enrollment rate of

children from median-income and low-income urban families after the mid-1990s is the

increasing availability of charter schools in many cities. These are public schools that provide

families with another schooling option free of tuition payments. Chakrabarti (2013) shows that

the decisions of low-income families to enroll their children in private school is very sensitive to

modest costs such as paying for transportation, even when the schools charge no tuition. We

know of only one study that examines the causal impact of greater charter school availability on

private school enrollment rates. Using data from Michigan, Chakrabarti and Roy (2016) do not

find evidence supporting the substitution hypothesis.

26
     In contrast, several studies (for example, Coleman, Hoffer, & Kilgore, 1982; Evans & Schwab,

1995; Neal, 1997) find that Catholic high schools located in cities are more effective than urban

public schools in enabling students to graduate and to enroll in college.

    Appendix to “Long-Term Trends in Private School Enrollments by Family Income”

This appendix provides the details of the data and methods we used to produce the results
reported in the text of our paper.


Data Preparation


       Variable definitions
The definitions of some variables in the Current Population Survey (CPS) that were relevant to
sample definitions changed between the first year for which we used CPS data, 1968, and the last
year, 2013. For example, “child” is defined as a person 3-14 years by CPS in years 1984
forward; child is defined as a person 3-13 years by CPS in 1979 and in other years. To be sure
that we used consistent definitions of variables in the CPS, we carried out the analyses required
to replicate the sample sizes and descriptive statistics in published tables based on CPS data for
each relevant year.


As stated in the text, variables used to identify race and ethnicity varied across datasets and
within datasets over survey years. From these variables, we created four mutually exclusive
categories for race/ethnicity: white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, “other.”


   Sample Definitions


Appendix Table A.1 provides information on the definitions and sizes of the samples used in the
statistical analyses described in this appendix that produced the results described in the text and
illustrated in figures 1-6, and 8.

   Imputation of family income


In all of the datasets with missing values of family income (CPS, ECLS, and NELS), respondents
were asked to specify into which pre-specified income range their family income fell. In some
years, up to 15% of the cases were missing information on family income. We used ordered
logistic regression models and Stata’s –mi impute– command to generate 20 imputed datasets to
address missing family income. The predictors used in the imputation process included parental
educational attainments, parental occupations, parental ages, family structure, state of residence,
and race/ethnicity. Stata’s –mi estimate– commands and post-estimation commands were used
to perform all analyses. This routine performs the command on each imputed dataset, and then
pools the results to produce one final estimate.


       Construction of family income percentile


In each of the datasets we analyzed, except for the Census, family income is reported in discrete
ordered categories, with survey respondents self-identifying the income category into which their
family income falls. To include family income as a continuous predictor variable, we followed
the method outlined in Reardon (2011) by replacing the income categories with the midpoint of
the range of income percentiles associated with that income bin. We used the income as reported,
and did not adjust for non-cash benefits such as food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit.


To construct the income percentile distribution, we first found the total weighted population of
students in grades 1st – 8th grade enrolled in any type of schooling in a given year. Next, we
calculated the proportion of the total population of students in each income category, and used
this distribution to determine the midpoint percentile for each income category. In determining
the total population and the distribution of students across income percentiles, we used sample
weights specific to households and assigned the same weight to each child in a particular
household.


       Exclusion of CPS data for 2014-15


Our original intent was to include data from the 2014 and 2015 October CPS administrations in
our analyses of trends in private school enrollments. However, we found that the trends in
private school enrollment rates by income for these two years differed from those in previous
years in unexpected ways. This led us to compare the CPS-based estimates with those obtained
from the much larger ACS for the years 2001-2015. We found that the CPS-based trends track
closely the ACS-based trends for the years 2001-2013. However, they do not do so for 2014 and

                                                                                                   58
2015. Moreover, the CPS-based estimates of private school enrollment rates by income for these
two years are inconsistent with trends in real income by income percentile. In contrast, the ACS-
based estimates are consistent. For this reason, we did not include the CPS-based estimates of
private school enrollment rates for 2014 and 2015 in our analyses. One hypothesis to explain the
puzzling CPS-based estimates for these years is that they reflect an increase in the severity of
long-standing problems with income-reporting in the CPS (Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan, 2015).
       Reason for not including data from the American Community Survey (ACS)

With the exception described just above, we did not use ACS data in our analyses. The reason is
that the ACS does not distinguish students attending private schools from those that are home-
schooled. Since 2008, one response option to the ACS question about whether a child has been in
school during the last three months has been “Yes, private school, private college, home school.”
Prior to 2008, the relevant option was “Yes, private school, private college.” It is not clear how
parents who home-schooled their children would have responded to the prompt before 2008.




Data Analysis Strategy


Estimating private school enrollment rates, by income


In each data set, for each observation, we typically have a categorical measure of family income
and a binary indicator of whether a child is enrolled in private school (or in a particular type of
private school). We convert income to percentiles, as described above. Let 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ∈ (0,1) and 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 ∈
{0,1} denote the income percentile (scaled from 0 to 1) and private school enrollment status,
respectively, of child 𝑖𝑖.


We estimate the association between private school enrollment and family income by fitting a
polynomial logit model of the form
                                                                        𝐾𝐾
                                          Pr[𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 1]
                          𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 = 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 �                  � = 𝐏𝐏𝐏𝐏 = � 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 ,
                                        1 − Pr[𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 1]
                                                                      𝑘𝑘=0

                                                                                               [A1]
where we choose the order 𝐾𝐾 of the polynomial through visual inspection. Reardon (2011), used
a cubic function of income to measure income achievement gaps; following this, we set 𝐾𝐾 = 3,
but then examine plots based on models with 𝐾𝐾 = 2 and 𝐾𝐾 = 4 as well. In cases where the 𝐾𝐾 =


                                                                                                  59
2 or 𝐾𝐾 = 4 plot fit the data better, we use the appropriate polynomial, although in almost all
cases, the 𝐾𝐾 = 3 model fit best.


Fitting this model provides an estimate of the function that describes the association between
private school enrollment and family income. Given this estimated function, we compute the
estimated proportion of students enrolled in private school at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of
the income distribution. That is, for 𝑝𝑝 ∈ {0.10, 0.50, 0.90}, we compute the estimated enrollment
rate 𝑟𝑟̂𝑝𝑝 :

where 𝐩𝐩 = [1, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝2 , … , 𝑝𝑝𝐾𝐾 ] and 𝐩𝐩 = �𝛽𝛽̂0 , 𝛽𝛽̂1 , … , 𝛽𝛽̂𝐾𝐾 �′. We obtain standard errors of 𝑟𝑟̂𝑝𝑝 via the
Delta method. Let 𝐕𝐕 � denote the estimated sampling covariance matrix of 𝐁𝐁                � . Then the delta
method yields:

Modeling trends in private school enrollment rates and enrollment rate differences


We model the trends in private school enrollment rate as a polynomial function of time. To fit
the trends shown in Figure 1, for example, we do the following: Let 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 indicate the private
school enrollment rate of students at the 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡ℎ percentile of the income distribution in year 𝑦𝑦. Let
               2
𝑟𝑟̂𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 and 𝜔𝜔
            �𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 be our estimate of 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 and its sampling variance, respectively, as defined in A2 and
A3 above. Let 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 = 𝑦𝑦 − 1990 and let 𝐷𝐷50𝑝𝑝 = 𝐼𝐼[𝑝𝑝 = 0.50] and 𝐷𝐷90𝑝𝑝 = 𝐼𝐼[𝑝𝑝 = 0.90] be
dummy variables indicating if an observation pertains to the 50th or 90th percentiles, respectively.
We would like to fit the model

          𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = ��𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗10 �𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 � + 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗50 �𝐷𝐷50𝑝𝑝 ∙ 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 � + 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗90 �𝐷𝐷90𝑝𝑝 ∙ 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 �� + 𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ; 𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ~𝑁𝑁[0, 𝜏𝜏 2 ].

                                                                                                                            [A4]
This model allows the trend at each income percentile to be an independent polynomial function
of order 𝐽𝐽. We do not observe 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , however, but only an estimate of it 𝑟𝑟̂𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 . So the feasible
regression model is
                           𝐽𝐽
                                       𝑗𝑗                        𝑗𝑗                        𝑗𝑗

                                                                                                                            [A5]
Model A5 has two error terms—one (𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) that indicates the true deviation in year 𝑦𝑦 of the
enrollment rate among children from families with income percentile 𝑝𝑝 from the polynomial
trend, and one that indicates the error in our estimate of 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (i.e., 𝜖𝜖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 𝑟𝑟̂𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 − 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ). We know the
variance of 𝜖𝜖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (and it may vary among observations); we must estimate 𝜏𝜏 2 , which we assume is
constant across observations. To fit this model—sometimes called a precision-weighted
regression model or a meta-analytic regression model—we use Stata’s –metareg– command.
This provides a more flexible error structure than ordinary least squares regression (which would
                                           2
be equivalent in this case to assuming 𝜔𝜔𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is constant across 𝑝𝑝 and 𝑦𝑦) or weighted least squares
regression (which would be equivalent in this case to assuming 𝜏𝜏 2 = 0).


In order to determine 𝐽𝐽, the order of the polynomial time trend in A5, we first set 𝐽𝐽 = 3, since a
cubic function appears to fit the data well. We fit the model with 𝐽𝐽 = 3, and then test the null
hypothesis that all three order 𝐽𝐽 terms in the model are 0 (𝐻𝐻0 : 𝛾𝛾𝐽𝐽10 = 𝛾𝛾𝐽𝐽50 = 𝛾𝛾𝐽𝐽90 = 0). If we reject
𝐻𝐻0 , we use the results from this model; if we cannot reject 𝐻𝐻0 , we set 𝐽𝐽 = 𝐽𝐽 − 1 and repeat the
process until either 𝐽𝐽 = 1 or we can reject the null.


We compute standard errors of private school enrollment rate gaps and of differences in gaps
between years using the estimated parameters and variance-covariance matrix from Model A5.


We follow an analogous approach to estimate the trends shown in Figures 2-6. In figure 2, we
use 𝐽𝐽 = 1, because in each case we could not reject the null hypothesis that it fit as well as the
higher order models. In Figures 3-6, we use 𝐽𝐽 = 3.

       Evidence on Private School Tuitions

NCES datasets and CPS datasets for certain years provide information on the net tuitions
families paid for a particular type of private school. We used information from these datasets to
estimate the tuition differences by family income that we report in the text. All tuition values are
reported in 2015$. We carried out the following steps. We estimated the median tuition paid by
families in each income bin by type of private school. We then fit meta-regressions of median

The October 1994 CPS contains information on both net private school tuition paid for a child
and on full tuition at the school the child attended. We considered using this information to
examine the extent to which private schools of different types provided financial aid to students
from families at different points in the income distribution. However, nearly three-quarters of
families reported paying full tuition. As a result the size of the subsample of private elementary
school students who received financial aid is small. Dividing this subsample into subgroups
defined by type of private school attended would have resulted in extremely small groups of
students receiving financial aid from each type of private school.


       Evidence on the public’s opinions of their local public schools


We used data from Phi Delta Kappan surveys to examine whether the percentage of parents with
children who rated their local public schools as A or B (on an A – F scale) varied over time, by
family income percentile, and by location of residence (urban versus suburban). We started with
a model that included interactions among time, location of residence, and income percentile. We
fit the model with ordinary least squares. We then used the results of hypothesis tests to simplify
the model. We found that the percentage of parents who rated their local public schools as A or
B did not vary over the decade for which we had data. We found that the structure of the model
was different for suburban parents than urban parents. The estimated parameters of the final
model are listed in Table A.9.

        Evidence on reasons parents sent children to private schools.


In 2007, the National Household Education Survey (NHES) asked respondents whose children
attended private schools for the primary reason they chose the school. Families could choose
from among 22 different reasons for making their choice. To better understand families’
motivations, we analyzed the responses for students enrolled in grades 1 through 8. We
categorized all responses into one of six primary reasons. In Table A.10 below, we show the
proportional breakdown of these responses for students in all types of private schools, and by
Catholic, other religious, and nonsectarian private schools. The two primary reasons that parents
report for sending their children to private school are for moral and religious reasons and
academic performance or programs. Unsurprisingly, among families whose children attend
religious private schools, nearly half cite religious concerns for choosing private schools.
Conversely, 60% of families whose children attend nonsectarian private schools cite academics
as their primary motivation.
