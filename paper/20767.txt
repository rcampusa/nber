This paper develops a framework for estimating preferences in two-sided matching markets with non-transferable
utility using only data on observed matches. Unlike single-agent choices, matches depend on the preferences
of other agents in the market. I use pairwise stability together with a vertical preference restriction
on one side of the market to identify preference parameters for both sides of the market. Recovering
the distribution of preferences is only possible in an environment with many-to-one matching. These
methods allow me to investigate two issues concerning the centralized market for medical residents.
First, I examine the antitrust allegation that the clearinghouse restrains competition, resulting in salaries
below the marginal product of labor. Counterfactual simulations of a competitive wage equilibrium
show that residents’ willingness to pay for desirable programs results in estimated salary markdowns
ranging from $23,000 to $43,000 below the marginal product of labor, with larger markdowns at more
desirable programs. Therefore, a limited number of positions at high quality programs, not the design
of the match, is the likely cause of low salaries. Second, I analyze wage and supply policies aimed
at increasing the number of residents training in rural areas while accounting for general equilibrium
effects from the matching market. I find that financial incentives increase the quality, but not the number
of rural residents. Quantity regulations increase the number of rural trainees, but the impact on resident
quality depends on the design of the intervention.

1       Introduction
Each year, the placement of about 25,000 medical residents and fellows is determined via
a centralized clearinghouse known as National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) or
"the match." During the match, applicants and residency programs list their preferences
over agents on the other side of the market, and a stable matching algorithm uses these
reported ranks to assign applicants to positions. Agents on both sides of the market are
heterogeneous but salaries paid by residency programs are not individually negotiated with
residents. Therefore, preferences of residents and programs, rather than prices, determine
equilibrium outcomes. The medical match is iconic for the stable matching literature, but
with few exceptions this literature has been primarily theoretical. Particularly, there is
little evidence on the e¤ects of government policies or the design of the market. These
interventions can substantially a¤ect the physician workforce in the United States because
medical residents are a key component of current and future physician labor.1
     This paper develops a new techniques for recovering the preferences of both the residency
programs and residents (market primitives) using data only on …nal matches. The method
may be useful for studying other matching markets because data on matches is common
compared to stated preferences. As in the medical match, these primitives are important
determinants of outcomes in matching markets when agents are heterogeneous and prices are
not highly personalized. Examples include schooling, colleges and many high-skilled labor
markets.
     I estimate the model using data from the market for family medicine residents in the
U.S. to empirically analyze two issues that have received particular attention from acad-
emic researchers as well as policy makers. First, I investigate the antitrust allegation that
the centralized market structure is responsible for the low salaries paid to residents. The
plainti¤s in a 2002 lawsuit argued that the match limited the bargaining power of the resi-
dents because salaries are set before ranks are submitted. They reasoned that a "traditional
market" would allow residents to use multiple o¤ers and wage bargaining to make programs
bid for their labor. Using a perfect competition model as the alternative, they argued that
the large salary gap between residents and nurse practitioners or physician assistants is a
symptom of competitive restraints imposed by centralization. Although the lawsuit was dis-
missed due to a legislated congressional exception, it sparked an academic debate on whether
in‡exibility results in low salaries (Bulow and Levin, 2006; Kojima, 2007). Observational
studies of medical fellowship markets do not …nd an association between low salaries and
    1
    According to the "2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book" (ww.aamc.org/workforce), in 2010,
678,324 physicians were reported as actively involved in patient care, whereas 110,692 residents and fel-
lows were in training programs.


                                                   1
the presence of a centralized match (Niederle and Roth, 2003, 2009). While these studies
strongly suggest that the match is not the primary cause of low salaries in this market, they
do not explain why salaries in decentralized markets remain lower than the perfect competi-
tion salary benchmark suggested by the plainti¤s. I use a stylized theoretical model to show
that residents’preferences for programs result in an "implicit tuition" that depresses salaries
in a decentralized market. I then quantify the magnitude of this markdown using estimates
from the empirical model.
     Second, I study policy interventions for lowering the perceived under-supply of residents
and physicians in rural areas of the U.S. Although a …fth of the U.S. population lives in rural
areas, less than a tenth of physicians practice in rural communities (Rosenblatt and Hart,
2000). The Patient Protection and A¤ordable Care Act of 2010 addresses the shortage of
rural physicians by funding an increase in the number of residency programs in rural areas,
redistributing unused Medicare funds originally allocated for residency training in urban
hospitals, and increasing the funding of loan forgiveness programs used to recruit physicians
to shortage areas. Broadly speaking, the act uses a combination of supply interventions
and …nancial incentives to address the disparity in access to care. Such regulations are not
unique to the United States. Recently, Japan reduced capacities in urban residency programs
to mitigate their rural resident shortage (Kamada and Kojima, 2010). Similar regulations
a¤ecting prices and quantities are common in a variety of matching markets but their e¤ects
on assignments are not well understood.2
     Analyzing the general equilibrium e¤ects of government policy as well as predicting out-
comes under alternative market structures using counterfactual simulations require estimates
of the preferences of both sides of the market. Direct data on these market primitives is fre-
quently not available. Although the rank order lists submitted by residents and programs
are collected by the NRMP, they are highly con…dential. Preference lists may not even be
collected in other labor or matching markets. When only data on …nal matches are available,
it is not immediately clear how to use these data to estimate preferences.
     This paper develops methods for estimating preferences using only data on …nal matches.
The techniques apply to a many-to-one two-sided matching market with low frictions. Mo-
tivated by properties of the mechanism used in the medical match, I assume that the …nal
matches are pairwise stable (Roth and Sotomayor, 1992). According to this equilibrium
concept, no two agents on opposite sides of the market prefer each other over their match
partners at pre-determined salary levels. Following the discrete choice literature, I model
   2
    Tuition regulations in public universities and …nancial aid programs are a salient example of price
interventions in matching markets. Schooling reforms establishing new public schools or closing dysfunctional
school programs are common interventions that directly a¤ect supply.



                                                     2
the preferences of each side of the market over the other as a function of characteristics of
residents and programs, some of which are known to market participants but not to the
econometrician. I use the pure characteristics model of Berry and Pakes (2007) for the pref-
erences of residents for programs. This model allows for substantial heterogeneity in the
preferences. However, a similarly ‡exible model for the program’s preferences for residents
raises identi…cation issues and other methodological di¢ culties due to multiple equilibria.
In the medical residency market, anecdotal evidence suggests that residents are largely ver-
tically di¤erentiated in skill because academic record and clinical performance are the main
determinants of a resident’s desirability to a program.3 These factors are not observed in
the dataset but should be accounted for. I therefore restrict attention to a model in which
the programs’preferences for residents are homogenous and allow for an unobservable de-
terminant of resident skill. The assumption also implies the existence of a unique pairwise
stable match and a computationally tractable simulation algorithm.
    The empirical strategy must confront the fact that "choice sets" of agents in the market
are not observed because they depend on the preferences of other agents in the market.
Instead of a standard revealed preference approach, I identify the model using observed sort-
ing patterns between resident and program characteristics, and information only available in
an environment with many-to-one matching. For example, residents from more prestigious
medical schools sort into larger hospitals if medical school prestige is positively associated
with human capital and hospital size is preferable. If residents from prestigious medical
schools have higher human capital, they will not sort into larger hospitals if small hospitals
are preferable. Furthermore, the degree of assortativity between medical school prestige and
hospital size increases with the weight agents place on these characteristics when making
choices. However, sorting patterns alone are not su¢ cient for determining the parameters of
the model. A high weight on medical school prestige and a low weight on hospital size results
in a similar degree of sorting as a high weight on hospital size and low weight on medical
school prestige. Fortunately, data from many-to-one matches has additional information
that assists in identi…cation. In a pairwise stable match, all residents at a given program
must have similar human capital. Otherwise, the program can likely replace the least skilled
resident with a better resident. Because the variation in human capital within a program
is low, the variation in residents’medical school prestige within programs is small if med-
ical school prestige is highly predictive of human capital. The within-program variation in
   3
     Conversations with Dr. Katz, Program Director of Internal Medicine Residency Program at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, suggest that while programs have some heterogeneous preferences for resident attributes,
the primarily trend is that better residents get their pick of programs ahead of less quali…ed residents. Further,
academic and clinical record, and recommendation letters are the primary indicators used to determine
resident quality.



                                                        3
medical school prestige decreases with the correlation of human capital with medical school
prestige. Note that it is only possible to calculate the within-program variation in a resident
characteristic if many residents are matched to the same program. Finally, to learn about
heterogeneity in preferences, I use observable characteristics of one side of the market that
are excluded from the preferences of the other side. These exclusion restrictions shift the
preferences of, say residents, without a¤ecting the preferences of programs, thereby allowing
sorting on excluded characteristics to be interpreted in terms of preferences.
    I estimate the model using the method of simulated moments (McFadden, 1989; Pakes
and Pollard, 1989), and data from the market for family medicine residents between 2003 and
2010. Approximately 430 programs and 3,000 medical residents participate in this market
each year. Moments used in estimation include summaries of the sorting patterns observed in
the data and the within-program variation in observable characteristics of the residents. The
small number of markets and the interdependence of observed matches creates additional
challenges for estimation and inference. Instead of considering asymptotic approximations
based on independently sampled matches or many markets, I mimic a data generating process
in which the market grows in size. The characteristics of the market participants are drawn
iid from a population distribution and the pairwise stable match for the realized market is
observed. The dependence of matches on characteristics of all agents necessitates the use of
a parametric bootstrap for constructing con…dence sets for the estimated parameter.4
    I show how to modify the model to correct for potential endogeneity between salaries and
unobserved program characteristics. The technique is based on a control function approach
and relies on the availability of an instrument that is excludable from the preferences of the
residents (see Heckman and Robb, 1985; Blundell and Powell, 2003; Imbens and Newey,
2009). This approach can be used in other applications in labor markets where endogeneity
may arise from compensating di¤erentials or other in‡uences on equilibrium wages. For
this setting, I construct an instrument using Medicare’s reimbursement rates to competitor
residency programs, which are based on regulations enacted in 1985. The results from the
instrumented version of the model are imprecise but indicate that salaries are likely positively
correlated with unobservable program quality.
    I assess the …t of the model, both in-sample and out-of-sample. The out-of-sample …t
uses the most recent match results, taken from the 2011-2012 wave of the census. These data
were not accessed until estimates were obtained. The observed sorting patterns for resident
groups mimic those predicted by the model, both in-sample and out-of sample, suggesting
   4
    Agarwal and Diamond (in progress) studies asymptotic theory for a single large market and the special
case with homogeneous preferences on both sides. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the root mean squared
error drops with sample size and con…dence sets have close to correct coverage.



                                                   4
that the model is appropriately speci…ed.
    Counterfactual simulations are used to analyze the issues related to the lawsuit and policy
interventions for rural training. In the lawsuit, the plainti¤s used a perfect competition model
to argue that residents’salaries are lower than those paid to substitute health professionals
because of the match. This reasoning does not account for the e¤ects of the limited supply
of heterogeneous programs and residents. A shortage of desirable residency programs due
to accreditation requirements may lower salaries at high quality programs. Symmetrically,
highly skilled residents can bargain for higher compensation because they are also in limited
supply. Equilibrium salaries under competitive negotiations are in‡uenced by both of these
forces. I use a stylized model to show that when residents value program quality, salaries in
every competitive equilibrium are well below the benchmark level suggested by the plainti¤s.
The markdown is due to an implicit tuition arising from residents’ willingness to pay for
training at a program, and is in addition to any costs of training passed through to the
residents. I estimate an average implicit tuition of at least $23,000, with larger implicit
tuitions at more desirable programs. Although imprecisely estimated, estimates from models
using wage instruments are much higher, at $43,000. The results weigh against the plainti¤s’
claim that in the absence of competitive restraints imposed by the match, salaries paid to
residents would be equal to the marginal product of their labor, close to salaries of physician
assistants and nurse practitioners. At a median salary of $86,000, physician assistants earn
approximately $40,000 more than medical residents. The upper-end of the estimated implicit
tuition can explain this di¤erence. These results imply that the low salaries observed in
this market and those observed by Niederle and Roth (2003, 2009) in the related medical
fellowship markets without a match are due to the implicit tuition, not the design of the
match.
    Second, regulations aimed at increasing the number of residents in rural areas also a¤ect
sorting through general equilibrium e¤ects. A reduction in urban training positions displaces
residents who can in-turn displace other residents who get assigned elsewhere. Financial
incentives for rural training and increases in the number of positions in rural areas cause
similar re-sorting. The net impact of policy interventions is a function of the preferences of
both residents and programs as well as the overall composition of the market. Using estimates
from the model, I show that …nancial incentives have only a moderate e¤ect on the number of
residents matched to rural programs. An incentive of $10,000 per year increases the number
of residents in rural areas by about 17, or 5% of the total number of positions in rural
programs. At a total cost of $3.3 million, each additional resident in a rural program costs
$200,000 on average. This large per-resident cost arises because most of the incentives accrue
to residents occupying positions that would have been …lled without the incentive. Only 7.7%


                                               5
of rural residency positions are un…lled to begin with, which allows little scope for salary
incentives to increase numbers. Instead, the primary impact of this policy is an increase
in the quality of residents in rural areas. As expected, policy interventions directed at the
supply of positions are more e¤ective at increasing the number of residents placed at rural
programs. Depending on the design of the regulation, supply interventions can either increase
or decrease the quality of residents matched at rural programs through general equilibrium
re-sorting e¤ects. I …nd that a policy reducing positions o¤ered in urban programs forces
residents into rural programs, but due to re-sorting, does not signi…cantly lower the quality of
residents matched at rural programs. An increase in the number of positions o¤ered in rural
programs, on the other hand, increases the quality of residents training in rural communities
through disproportional take-up in higher quality rural programs.
    The empirical methods in this paper contribute to the recent literature on estimating
preference models using data from observed matches and pairwise stability in decentralized
markets.5 The majority of papers focus on estimating a single aggregate surplus that is
divided between match partners. Chiappori, Salanié, and Weiss (2010), Galichon and Salanie
(2012), among others, build on the seminal work of Choo and Siow (2006) for studying
transferable utility models of the marriage market in which an aggregate surplus is split
between spouses. Fox (2010) proposes a di¤erent approach for estimation, also for the
transferable utility case, with applications in Bajari and Fox (2013), among others. Sorensen
(2007) is an example that estimates a single surplus function, but in a non-transferable utility
model. Another set of papers measures bene…ts of mergers using similar cooperative solution
concepts (Weese, 2014; Gordon and Knight, 2009; Akkus, Cookson, and Hortacsu, 2012;
Uetake and Watanabe, 201). A common data constraint faced in many of these applications
is that monetary transfers between matched partners are often not observed, so the possibility
of estimating two separate utility functions is limited.
    Since salaries paid by residency programs are observed, this paper can estimate pref-
erences of each of the two sides of the market, with salary as a (potentially endogenous)
additional characteristic that is valued by residents. I use a non-transferable utility model
because the salary paid by a residency program is pre-determined. Similar models are esti-
mated by Logan, Ho¤, and Newton (2008) and Boyd et al. (2013), although in decentralized
markets, with the goal of measuring preferences for various characteristics. Logan, Ho¤, and
Newton (2008) proposes a Bayesian method for estimating preferences for mates in a mar-
riage market with no monetary transfers. Boyd et al. (2013) uses the method of simulated
   5
     See Fox (2009) for a survey. The approach of using pairwise stability in decentralized markets may yield a
good approximation of market primitives if frictions are low. Many studies are devoted to understanding the
role of search frictions as a determinant of outcomes in decentralized labor and matching markets (Mortensen
and Pissarides, 1994; Roth and Xing, 1994; Shimer and Smith, 2000; Postel-Vinay and Robin, 2002).

moments to estimate the preferences of teachers for schools and of schools for teachers. Both
papers use only sorting patterns in the data to estimate and identify two sets of preference
parameters. Agarwal and Diamond (2014) prove that even under a very restrictive model
with no preference heterogeneity on either side of the market, sorting patterns alone cannot
identify the preference parameters of the model. Such non-identi…cation can yield unreliable
predictions for both counterfactuals studied in this paper. To solve this problem, I leverage
information made available through many-to-one matches, in addition to sorting patterns,
for identifying two distributions of preferences.
    The results on equilibrium salaries paid to residents may also be of independent interest
for their analysis of labor markets with compensating di¤erentials, especially those with
on-the-job training. It is well known that compensating di¤erentials can be an important
determinant of salaries in labor markets (Rosen, 1987). Stern (2004), for instance, …nds
that scientists often accept lower salaries from …rms that allow their employees to publish
research. Previous theoretical work on markets with on-the-job training has used perfect
competition models to show that salaries are reduced by the marginal cost of training (Rosen,
1972; Becker, 1975). Counterfactuals in this paper using the competitive equilibrium model
compute an implicit tuition at residency programs, which a markdown due to the value of
training that is in addition to costs of training passed through to the resident.
    The paper begins with a description of the market for family medicine residents and the
sorting patterns observed in the data (Section 2). Sections 3 through 7 present the empirical
framework used to analyze this market, the identi…cation strategy, the method for correct-
ing potential endogeneity in salaries, the estimation approach, and parameter estimates,
respectively. These sections omit details relevant exclusively to the applications related to
the lawsuit and the analysis of policy for encouraging rural training. Background for each
issue is presented along with counterfactual simulations in Sections 8 and 9 respectively. All
technical details are relegated to appendices.


2       Market Description and Data
This paper analyzes the family medicine residency market from the academic year 2003-
2004 to 2010-2011. The data are from the National Graduate Medical Education Census
(GME Census) which provides characteristics of residents linked with information about the
program at which they are training.6 Family medicine is the second largest specialty, after
    6
    I consider all non-military programs participating in the match, accredited by the Acceditation Council
of Graduate Medical Education and not located in Puerto Rico. I restrict attention to residents matched
with these programs. Detailed description of all data sources, construction of variables, sample restrictions
and the process used to merge records are in Appendix E. Data on matches from the Graduate Medical


                                                     7
internal medicine, constituting about one eighth of all residents in the match. Graduates
from family medicine residency programs provide the bulk of medical care in rural United
States (Rosenblatt and Hart, 2000).
     I focus on …ve major types of program characteristics: the prestige/quality of the program
as measured by NIH funding of a program’s major and minor medical school a¢ liates;7 the
size of the primary clinical hospital as measured by the number of beds; the Medicare Case
Mix Index as a measure of the diagnostic mix a resident is exposed to; characteristics of
program location such as the median rent in the county a program is located in and the
Medicare wage index as a measure of local health care labor costs; and the program type
indicating the community and/or university setting and/or rural setting of a program.
     Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of programs in the market. The market has ap-
proximately 430 programs, each o¤ering approximately eight …rst-year positions. Except for
program type (community/university based), there is little annual variation in the composi-
tion of programs in the market. Salaries paid to residents have roughly kept up with in‡ation
with a distribution compressed around $47,000 in 2010 dollars.8
     In general, rural programs are smaller than urban programs. They typically consist of
about …ve residency positions, are at smaller hospitals as measured by the number of beds,
and are a¢ liated with medical schools with lower NIH funding. Even though family medicine
physicians provide the majority of care in rural communities where 20% of the US population
resides, only about 10% of residency positions in this specialty are in rural settings.
     For residents, the data contains information on their medical degree type, characteristics
of graduating medical school and city of birth. Table 2 describes the characteristics of
residents matching with family medicine programs. The composition of this side of the
market has also been stable over this sample period with only minor annual changes. A
little less than half the residents in family medicine are graduates of MD granting medical
schools in the US. A large fraction, about 40%, of residents obtained medical degrees from
non-US schools while the rest have US osteopathic (DO) degrees.9 One in ten US born
medical residents are born in rural counties.

      Major a¢ liates of a program are directly a¢ liated medical schools of a program’s primary clinical
hospital. Other medical school a¢ liations between programs and medical schools, via secondary rotation
sites or other a¢ liates of the primary clinical site, are categorized as minor. See data appendix for details.

      Resident salaries after the …rst year is highly correlated with the …rst year salary with a coe¢ cient that
is close to one and a R-squared of 0.8 or higher.

      As opposed to allopathic medicine, osteopathy emphasizes the structural functions of the body and its
ability to heal itself more than allopathic medicine. Osteophathic physicians obtain a Doctor of Osteopathy
(DO) degree and are licensed to practice medicine in the US just as physicians with a Doctor of Medicine
(MD) degree.

2.1     The Match
A prospective medical resident begins her search for a position by gathering information
about the academic curriculum and terms of employment at various programs from an online
directory and o¢ cial publications. Subsequently, she electronically submits applications to
several residency programs which then select a subset of applicants to interview. On average,
approximately eight residents are interviewed per position (Table 1). Anecdotal evidence
suggest that during or after interviews, informal communication channels actively operate
allowing agents on both sides of the market to gather more information about preferences.
Finally, residency programs and applicants submit lists stating their preferences for their
match partners. The algorithm described in Roth and Peranson (1999) uses these rank
order lists to determine the …nal match. The terms of participating in the match create a
commitment by both the applicant and the program to honor this assignment. Programs do
not individually negotiate salaries with residents during this process.
    The centralized market for medical residents was established in the 1950s to create a
uniform transaction date, primarily as a remedy for discernible ine¢ ciencies caused by early
and exploding o¤ers (Roth, 1984; Roth and Xing, 1994). In 1998, the clearinghouse was
redesigned amid concerns that the existing design was not in the best interest of applicants
and to lower di¢ culties with solving colocation problems for residency applicants married to
other applicants (Roth and Peranson, 1999). The algorithm currently in use substantially
reduces incentives for residents and programs to rematch by producing a match in which
no applicant and program pair could have ranked each other higher than their assignments.
It is adapted from the instability-chaining algorithm of Roth and Vande Vate (1990) and
shares features with the applicant proposing deferred acceptance algorithm introduced by
Gale and Shapley (1962).
    A few positions are …lled before the match begins and some positions not …lled after the
main match are o¤ered in the "scramble." During the scramble, residents and programs are
informed if they were not matched in the main process and can use a list of unmatched
agents to contract with each other.10


2.2     Descriptive Evidence on Sorting
Motivated by the properties of the match, the empirical strategy uses pairwise stability
to infer parameters of the model by taking advantage of sorting patterns between resident
and program characteristics observed in the data and features of the many-to-one matching
  10
     A new managed process called the Supplemental O¤er Acceptance Program (SOAP) replaced the scram-
ble in 2012. A total of 142 positions in family medicine (approximately 5%) were …lled through this process.
The scramble was likely of a similar size in the earlier years. See Signer (2012) (accessed June 12, 2012).

structure to infer preferences. I defer the discussion of the many-to-one aspect to Section
4.2.
    There is a signi…cant degree of positive assortative matching between measures of a
resident’s medical school quality and that of a program’s medical school a¢ liates. Figure 1
shows the joint distribution of NIH funding of a resident’s medical school and of the a¢ liates
of the program with which she matched. Residents from more prestigious medical schools,
as measured by NIH funding, tend to match to programs with more prestigious medical
school a¢ liates. Table 3 takes a closer look at this sorting using regressions of a resident’s
characteristic on the characteristics of programs with which she is matched. The estimates
con…rm the general trend observed in Figure 1. Programs that are associated with better
NIH funded medical schools tend to match with residents from better medical schools as
well, whether the quality of a resident’s medical school is measured by NIH funding, MCAT
scores of matriculants, or the resident having an MD degree rather than an osteopathic or
foreign medical degree. This observation also holds true for programs at hospitals with a
higher Medicare case mix index as well. Rent is positively associated with resident quality,
potentially because cities with high rent may also be the ones that are more desirable to
train or live in. Also note that the coe¢ cient on the rural program dummy is not statistically
signi…cant. Ceteris paribus, rural programs are not matched with signi…cantly lower quality
residents than urban programs. Further, statistics from Table 1 show that about 90% of
positions in rural programs are …lled, while 93% are at urban programs. These …ndings are
consistent with survey evidence in Rosenblatt et al. (2006), which shows that rural training
programs are matched with residents of a similar type as urban programs.11
    To highlight the geographical sorting observed in the data, Table 4 regresses characteris-
tics of a resident’s matched program on her own characteristics and indicators of whether the
program is in her state of birth or medical school state. Residents that match with programs
in the same state as their medical school tend to match with less prestigious programs, as
measured by the NIH funds of a program’s a¢ liates. Residents also match with programs
that are at larger hospitals and have lower case mix indices. Column (5) shows that rural-
born residents are about seven percentage points more likely to place at rural programs than
their urban-born counterparts.
    Since these patterns arise from the mutual choices of residents and programs, estimates
from these regressions are not readily interpretable in terms of the preferences of either side
of the market. In particular, none of the coe¢ cient estimates in these regressions can be
interpreted as weights on characteristics in a preference model. The next section develops a
  11
    Unlike Rosenblatt et al. (2006), my analysis includes positions in rural residency training track programs
that are satellites of urban host programs.

3     A Framework for Analyzing Matching Markets
This section presents the empirical framework for the model, treating salaries as exogenous.
I demonstrate how an instrument can be used to correct for correlation between salaries and
unobserved program characteristics in Section 5.


3.1     Pairwise Stability
I assume that the observed matches are pairwise stable with respect to the true preferences
of the agents, represented with k for a program or resident indexed by k. Each market,
indexed by t, is composed of Nt residents, i 2 Nt and Jt programs, j 2 Jt . The data consists
of the number positions o¤ered by program j in each period, denoted cjt , and a match, given
by the function t : Nt ! Jt . Let t 1 (j) denote the set of residents program j is matched
with.
    A pairwise stable match satis…es two properties for all agents i and j participating in
market t:

    1. Individual Rationality

           For residents:         t   (i)        i    where            denotes being unmatched.
                                       1                                   1                       1                                    1
           For programs: j                  (j)j       cjt and         t       (j)       j     t       (j) n fig for all i 2        t       (j) :

           If j   t   (j)j = cjt , then for all i0 2               t       (j),      t       (j)       j   (   t   (j) n fi0 g) [ fig

    A pairwise stable need not exist in general or there may be multiple pairwise stable
matches. The preference model described in the subsequent sections guarantees the existence
and uniqueness of a pairwise stable match.
    Individual rationality, also known as acceptability, implies that no program or resident
would prefer to unilaterally break a match contract. Because I do not observe data on
unmatched residents, I assume that all residents are acceptable to all programs and that
all programs are acceptable to all residents. Almost all US graduates applying to family
medicine residencies as their primary choice are successful in matching to a family medicine


                                                                   11
program, and the number of un…lled positions in residency programs in this speciality is under
10%.12 The primary limitation this assumption is the inability to account for substitution
into other professions or entry by new residents.
    Under the no blocking condition, no resident prefers a program (to her current match)
that would prefer hiring that resident in place of a current match if the program has exhausted
its capacity. If the program a resident prefers is empty, the program would not like to …ll
the position with that resident.
    Theoretical properties of the mechanism used by the NRMP guarantees that the …nal
match is pairwise stable with respect to submitted rank order lists, but not necessarily with
respect to true preferences. Strategic ranking and interviewing, especially in the presence
of incomplete information, is likely the primary threat to using pairwise stability in this
market.13 The large number of interviews per position suggests that this may not be of
concern in this market, however, it may be implausible in some decentralized markets.
    This equilibrium concept also implicitly assumes that agents’preferences over matches
is determined only by their match, not by the match of other agents. This restriction
rules out the explicit consideration of couples that participate in the match by listing joint
preferences.14 According to data reports from the NRMP, in recent years only about 1,600
out of 30,000 individuals participated in the main residency match as part of a couple. I
model all agents as single agents because data from the GME census does not identify an
individual as part of a couple.


3.2     Preferences of the Residents
Following the discrete choice literature, I model the latent indirect utility representing res-
idents’preferences i as a function U zjt ; jt ; wjt ; i ; of observed program traits zjt , the
program’s salary o¤er wjt , unobserved traits jt , and taste parameters i . I use the pure
  12
     While residents may apply to many specialties in principle, data from the NRMP suggests that a typical
applicant applies to only one or two specialties (except those looking for preliminary positions). A second
specialty is often a "backup." Greater than 95% of MD graduates interested in family medicine, however,
only apply to family medicine programs. Upwards of 97% residents that list a family medicine program as
their …rst choice match to a family medicine program in the main match (See "Charting Outcomes in the
Match" 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, accessed June 12, 2012).
  13
     The data and the approach does not make a distinction for positions o¤ered outside the match or during
the scramble. The no blocking condition should be a reasonable approximation for the positions …lled before
the match as it is not incentive compatible for the agents to agree to such arrangements if either side expects
a better outcome after the match. The condition is harder to justify for small number of the positions …lled
during the scramble. Note, however, that residents (programs) that participate in the scramble should not
form blocking pairs with the set of programs (residents) that they ranked in the main round.
  14
     Couples can pose a threat to the existence of stable matches (Roth, 1984) although results in Kojima,
Pathak, and Roth (2013) suggest that stable matches exist in large markets if the fraction of couples is small.



                                                      12
characteristics demand model of Berry and Pakes (2007) for this indirect utility:

                                                  z           w
                                     uijt = zjt   i   + wjt   i    +   jt :                          (1)

In models that do not use a wage instrument, I assume that the unobserved traits jt have
a standard normal distribution that is independent of the other variables. I normalize the
mean utility to zero for (z; w) = 0. The scale and location normalizations are without loss in
generality. The independence of jt from wjt is relaxed in the model correcting for potential
endogeneity in salaries.
    Depending on the ‡exibility desired, i can be modelled as a constant, a function of
observable characteristics xi of a resident and/or of unobserved taste determinants i :


                                             i   = xi +       i:                                     (2)

The taste parameters i are drawn from a mean-zero normal distribution with a variance
that is estimated. The richest speci…cation used in this paper allows for heterogeneity via
normally distributed random coe¢ cients for NIH funding at major a¢ liates, beds, and Case
Mix Index. This speci…cation also allows for preference heterogeneity for rural programs
based on a rural or urban birth location of the resident and heterogeneity in preference for
programs in the resident’s birth state or medical school state through interaction of xi and
zjt . These terms are included to account for the geographic sorting observed in the market.
     The pure characteristics model implies that residents have tastes for a …nite set of program
attributes. It omits a commonly used additive ijt term that is iid across residents, programs
and markets. These discrete choice models implicitly assume tastes for programs through
a characteristic space that increases in dimension with the number of programs. (Berry
and Pakes, 2007) discuss some counter-intuitive implications of including an ijt term on
substitution patterns and welfare e¤ects of changes in the number of programs.


3.3     Preferences of the Programs
Since the value produced by a team of residents at a program is not observed, I model
residency program preferences through a latent variable. A very rich speci…cation creates
two extreme problems. On the one hand, a pairwise stable match need not exist if a program’s
preference for a given resident depends crucially on the other residents it hires. On the other
hand, the number of stable matches can be exponentially large in the number of agents
when programs have heterogenous preferences.15 These problems are notwithstanding any
  15
    See Roth and Sotomayor (1992) for conditions of existence of a stable match in the college admissions
problem. The multiplicity of the match implied by heterogeneous preference may not be particularly impor-

                                                      13
di¢ culties one might face in identifying such a rich speci…cation.
     My conversations with residency program and medical school administrators suggests
that programs broadly agree on what makes a resident desirable, and refer to a "pecking
order" for residency slots in which the best residents get their preferred choices over others.
Anecdotal evidence also suggests that test scores in medical exams, clinical performance, and
the strength of recommendation letters are likely the most important signals of a program’s
preference for a resident, but are not observed in the dataset (see Footnote 3). Therefore, I
model a program’s preference for a resident using a single human capital index H (xi ; "i ) that
is a function of observable characteristics xi of a resident and an unobservable determinant
"i .16 I use the parametric form
                                        hi = xi + "i ;                                       (3)

where "i is normally distributed with a variance that depends on the type of medical school
a resident graduated from. For graduates of allopathic (MD) medical schools, xi includes the
log NIH funding and median MCAT scores of the resident’s medical school. Characteristics
also include the medical school type for residents, i.e. whether a resident earned an osteo-
pathic degree (DO) or graduated from a foreign medical school. I also include an indicator
for whether a resident that graduated from a foreign medical school was born in the US.
Without loss of generality, the variance of "i for residents with MD degrees is normalized to
1 and the mean of h at x = 0 is normalized to zero.
    This speci…cation guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a stable match and a com-
putationally tractable simulation algorithm that is described in Section 6.3.17 Finally, Sec-
tion 4.3 notes that identifying a model with heterogeneity relies on exclusion restrictions, in
this case an observable program characteristic that is excluded from the preferences of the
residents for programs.
    Since heterogeneity in the preferences over residents is probable, bias in estimates may
a¤ect conclusions from counterfactual simulations. In particular, the analysis of interven-
tions in rural residency training programs may be inaccurate if rural programs strongly
tant from an empirical perspective. In simulations conducted with data reported to the NRMP, Roth and
Peranson (1999) …nd that almost all of the residents are matched to the same program across all the stable
matches.
  16
     The model only allows for ordinal comparisons between residents and is consistent with any latent output
function Fj hi1 ; : : : ; hicj from a team of residents i1 ; : : : ; icj at program j that is strictly increasing in
each of its components. An implicit restriction is that the preference for a resident does not depend on the
other residents hired. The restriction may not be strong in this context becase programs cannot submit
ranks that depend on the rest of the team.
  17
     Existence follows since these preferences are responsive. The condition is similar to a substitutability
condition. See Roth and Sotomayor (1992) for details. Uniqueness is a consequence of preference alignment.
See Clark (2006) and Niederle and Yariv (2009).

prefer hiring rural-born residents. Appendix D.1 presents regressions showing that rural-
born residents in rural programs are of similar (observable) quality as urban-born residents
also matched to their residency programs. This suggests low heterogeneity in the preferences
of programs, at least on this dimension.


4     Identi…cation
In this section, I describe how the data provide information about preference parameters
using pairwise stability as an assumption on the observed matches. The discussion also
guides the choice of moments used in estimation. Standard revealed preference arguments do
not apply because "choice-sets" of individuals are unobserved and determined in equilibrium.
    Agarwal and Diamond (2014) study non-parametric identi…cation in a single large market
for a model without heterogenous preferences for programs. They …nd that having data
from many-to-one matches rather than one-to-one matches is important from an empirical
perspective. I intuitively describe the reason for this di¤erence. A formal treatment of
identi…cation is beyond the scope of this paper.
    The market index t is omitted in this section because all identi…cation arguments are
based on observing one market with many (interdependent) matches. For simplicity, I also
assume that the number of residents is equal to the number of residency positions and
treat all characteristics as exogenous. Identi…cation of the case with endogenous salaries is
discussed in Section 5, and does not require a reconsideration of arguments presented here.


4.1    Using Sorting Patterns: The Double-Vertical Model
Consider the simpli…ed "double-vertical" model in which all residents agree upon the rela-
tive ranking of programs. In a linear parametric form for indirect utilities, preferences are
represented with

                                      uj = zj +      j

                                      hi = xi + "i ;

where xi and zj are observed and j and "i are standard normal random variables, distributed
independently of the observed traits. Assume the location normalizations E [uj jzj = 0] = 0
and E [hi jxi = 0] = 0.
   A pairwise stable match in this model exhibits perfect assortative matching between u
and h. Because the set of residents with a higher value of x have a higher distribution


                                             15
of human capital, they are matched with more desirable programs. Conversely, programs
with larger z are more likely to match with residents with higher human capital. The data
exhibits positive assortativity between x and z . I now describe what learned from this
sorting.
    I begin with an example to show that a sign restriction on one parameter of the model
is needed to interpret sorting patterns in terms of preferences. Consider a model in which x
is a scalar measuring the prestige of a resident’s medical school and z measures the size of
the hospital with which a program is associated. In this example, residents from prestigious
medical schools sort into larger hospitals if the human capital distribution of residents from
more prestigious medical schools is higher and hospital size is preferable. However, this
sorting may also have been produced by parameters under which residents from prestigious
medical schools are less likely to have high human capital and smaller hospitals are preferable.
This observation necessitates restricting one characteristic of either residents or programs
to be desirable. Throughout the empirical exercises in this paper, I assume that residents
graduating from more prestigious medical schools, as measured by the NIH funding of the
medical school, are more likely to have a higher human capital index.18 Under this sign
restriction, the sorting patterns observed in Figure 1 can only be rationalized if a program’s
desirability is positively related to the NIH funding of its a¢ liates.
    The sorting patterns can also allow us to determine whether x = x0 for x 6= x0 or
conversely, if z = z 0 . Because z = z 0 , programs with characteristics z and z 0 are
equally desirable to residents. Given a choice between these two programs, the unobservable
characteristic is used to break ties. For this reason, the distribution human capital of
residents matched to the set of programs with observables z and z 0 are identical. Consider
two types of programs, one at larger but less prestigious hospitals than another program
at a smaller hospital. If residents trade-o¤ hospital size for prestige, then the residents
matched with these two hospital types have similar observable characteristics. Conversely,
the distribution of observable quality of residents is higher at hospitals with characteristics
z than at z 0 if z > z 0 . The nature of assortativity observed in the data thus informs us
whether two observable types of residents or programs are equally desirable or not.
    Agarwal and Diamond (2014) consider a more general model in which u and h are non-
parametric functions of x and z respectively with additively separable errors " and . They
prove that sorting patterns can be used to determine if x and x0 are equally desirable.
  18
    The sign restiction does not imply that all medical students at more prestigous medical schools have
higher human capital index.




                                                  16
4.2    Importance of Data from Many-to-One Matches
The preceding arguments using only sorting patterns do not contain information on the
relative importance of observables on the two sides of the market. For intuition, consider an
example in which x is a binary indicator that is equal to 1 for a resident graduating from
a prestigious medical school and z is a binary indicator for a program at a large hospital.
Assume that half the residents are from prestigious schools and half the programs are at
large hospitals, and that medical school prestige and hospital size is preferred ( > 0 and
   > 0). Sorting patterns from such a model can be summarized in a contingency table
in which residents from prestigious medical schools are systematically more likely to match
with programs at large hospitals. For instance, consider the following table:
                                          z=1 z=0
                                      x=1  30% 20%
                                      x=0  20% 30%
    These matches could result from parameters under which programs have a strong prefer-
ence for residents from prestigious medical schools (large ) and residents have a moderate
preference for large hospitals (small ). In this case, residents from more prestigious medical
schools get their pick of programs, but often choose ones at small hospitals. On the other
hand, the contingency table could have been a result of a strong preference for large hospi-
tals (large ) but only a moderate preference for residents from prestigious medical schools
(small ). There are a variety of intermediate cases that are indistinguishable from each
other and either extreme. This ambiguity contrasts with discrete choice models using stated
preference lists where the relationship between ranks and hospital size determines the weight
on hospital size. Here, the degree of sorting between x and z cannot determine the weights
on both characteristics because preferences of both sides determine …nal matches.
    In addition to sorting patterns, data on many-to-one matches also determines the extent
to which residents with similar characteristics are matched to the same program. In a
pairwise stable match, two residents at the same program must have similar human capital
irrespective of the program’s quality. Otherwise, either the program could replace the lower
quality resident with a better resident, or the higher quality resident is could …nd a more
desirable program. Residents training at the same program have similar observables if x
is highly predictive of human capital. Conversely, programs are not likely to match with
multiple residents with similar observables if they placed a low weight on x. The variation in
resident observable characteristics within programs is therefore a signal of the information
observables contain about the underlying human capital quality of residents.19
  19
    An analogy with measurement error models to explans why many-to-one matches allow us to identify
features we cannot in one-to-one match data. Since we expect that two residents matched to the same

                                                17
    This information is not available in a one-to-one matching market because sorting pat-
terns are the only feature known from the data. Agarwal and Diamond (2014) formally shows
that having data from many-to-one matches is critical for identifying the parameters of the
model, and provides simulation evidence to illustrate the limitations of sorting patterns and
the usefulness of many-to-one matching data.

4.2.1    Descriptive Statistics from Many-to-One Matching

Table 5 shows the fraction of variation in resident characteristics that is within a program.
Notice that almost none of the variation in the gender of the resident is across programs.
This fact suggests that gender does not determine the human capital of a resident. If gender
were a strong determinant of a resident’s desirability to a program, in a double-vertical
model one would expect that programs would be systematically male or female dominated.
Summaries of the other characteristics indicate that residents are more systematically sorted
into programs where other residents have more similar quali…cations. For instance, about
30% of the variation in the median MCAT score of the residents’graduating medical schools
decomposes into across program variation. This statistic is higher for the characteristics
foreign medical degree and MD degree.
    Table 6 presents another summary from many-to-one matching based on regressing the
leave one out mean characteristic of a resident’s peer group in a program on the characteristics
of the resident. Let x i;1 be the average observable x1 of resident i’s peers for a match ,
                           P
i.e. x i;1 = j 1 ( 1(i))j 1 i0 2 1 ( (i)) xi0 ;1 . I estimate the equation

                                          x   i;   = xi + e i ;

where xi is resident i’s observables. Not surprisingly, each regression suggests that a resi-
dent’s characteristic is positively associated with the mean of the same characteristic of her
peers. Viewing NIH funding, MCAT scores, and MD degree as quality indicators, there
is a positive association between a resident’s quality and the average quality of her peer
group. Further, the moderately high R-squared statistics for these regressions suggest that
resident characteristics are more predictive of her peer groups than what Table 5 might have
suggested.
program are very similarly quali…ed, the observable quality of two doctors at the same program act like
noisy measures of their identical true quality.




                                                    18
4.3    Heterogeneity in Preferences
I now discuss exclusion restrictions that can be used to learn about heterogeneity in prefer-
ences. Preferences based on observable characteristics of residents that do not a¤ect their
human capital index are re‡ected in heterogeneous sorting patterns for similarly quali…ed
residents. Assume, for instance, that the birth location of a resident does not a¤ect the
preferences of programs for the resident. Under this restriction, the propensity of residents
for matching to programs closer to their birthplace can only be a result of resident prefer-
ences, not the preferences of programs. Further, residents matching closer to home will do
so at disproportionately lower quality programs since they trade o¤ program quality with
preferences for location.
    The principle is similar to the use of variation excluded from one part of a system to
identify a simultaneous equation model. The exclusion restriction in the example above
isolates a factor in‡uencing the demand for residency positions without a¤ecting the distri-
bution of choice sets faced by residents. Conversely, one may use factors that in‡uence the
human capital index of a resident but not their preferences to obtain variation in choice sets
of residents that is independent of resident preferences. Conlon and Mortimer (2013) use a
similar source of variation arising from product availability to identify demand models with
unobserved heterogeneity.
    While only one restriction may su¢ ce in theory, the empirical speci…cations in this paper
use both restrictions. Ideally, one would be able to estimate preferences for programs that
are heterogeneous across residents with di¤erent medical schools or skill levels. Richer speci-
…cations that allows for this type of preference heterogeneity are di¢ cult to estimate because
quality indicators of residents only include the medical school, and do not vary at the indi-
vidual level. Even with more detailed information on residents, estimating the preferences
for residents with low quali…cations is likely to rely on parametric extrapolations from more
quali…ed residents because of the limited set of choices faced by less skilled residents.


5     Salary Endogeneity
The salary o¤ered by a residency program may be correlated with unobserved program
covariates. For instance, programs with desirable unobserved traits may be able to pay
lower salaries due to compensating di¤erentials. Alternatively, desirable programs may be
more productive or better funded, resulting in salaries that are positively associated with
unobserved quality. One approach to correct for wage endogeneity is to formally model
wage setting. I avoid this for several reasons. First, the allegation of collusive wage setting


                                              19
in the lawsuit is unresolved. Second, hospitals tend to set identical wages for residents in
all specialties, suggesting that a full model should consider the joint salary setting decision
across all residency programs at a hospital. Finally, a full model would need to account for
accreditation requirements that require salaries to be "adequate" for a resident’s living and
educational expenses.20


5.1     A Control Function Approach
I propose a control function correction for bias due to correlation between salaries wjt and
program unobservables jt (see Heckman and Robb, 1985; Blundell and Powell, 2003; Imbens
and Newey, 2009): The principle of the method is similar to that of an instrumental variables
solution to endogeneity. It also relies on an instrument rjt that is excludable from the utility
function U ( ). The instrument I use is described in the next section.
    Consider the following linear function for the salary wjt o¤ered by program j in period
t:

                                         wjt = zjt + rjt +        jt ;                                    (4)

where zjt are program observable characteristics, rjt is the instrument, and jt is an unob-
servable. Endogeneity of wjt is captured through correlation between the unobservables jt
and jt . Equation (4) is analogous to the …rst stage of a two-stage least squares estimator
and the equilibrium model of matches is analogous to the second stage.
     The control function approach requires jt ; jt to be independent of (zjt ; rjt ). This
assumption replaces weaker conditional moment restriction needed in instrumental variables
approach.21 Under this independence, although wjt is not (unconditionally) independent of
 jt , it is conditionally independent of jt given jt and zjt . The control function approach
uses a consistent estimate of jt from the …rst stage as a conditioning variable in place of its
true value.
     Since jt can be consistently estimated from equation (4) using OLS, treat it as any other
observed characteristic. As noted earlier, we need to allow for correlation between jt and
  20
     The ACGME sponsoring institution requirements state that "Sponsoring and participating sites must
provide all residents with appropriate …nancial support and bene…ts to ensure that they are able to ful…ll
the responsibilities of their educational programs."
  21
     Imbens (2007) discusses these independence assumptions at some length, noting that they are commonly
made in the control function literature and are often necessary when dealing with a non-additive second stage.
In this context, even though jt is additively separable from wjt , the observed matches are not an additive
function of jt and wjt . This fact prohits the approach used in demand models pioneered by Berry (1994)
and Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995), where an inversion can be used to to estimate a variable with a
separable form in the unobserved characteristic and the endogenous variable.



                                                     20
 jt to build endogeneity of wjt into the system. For tractability given the limited salary
variation, I model the distribution of jt conditional on jt as


                                          jt   =   jt   +       jt ;                               (5)

where jt     N (0; 1) is drawn independently of                 jt   and ( ; ) are unknown parameters.
Substitute equation (5) to re-write equation (1) as

                                          z             w
                             uijt = zjt   i    + wjt    i   +        jt   +   jt :                 (6)

Since variation in wjt given jt and zjt is due to rjt , the assumptions above imply that jt is
independent of wjt , solving the endogeneity problem.
    As a scale normalization, I set = 1. The term jt can arise from speci…cation error
and/or from unobservable determinants of salaries that do not directly a¤ect the preferences
of residents for a program. Note that the unobservable characteristic of the program jt ;
may be correlated across time through jt . For instance, jt may be the sum of a random
e¤ect rj that is constant over time for a given j and a per-period deviation djt as long as
each of the components is independent of (zjt ; rjt ).
    While this linear speci…cation may be di¢ cult to justify from economic primitives, it
may substantially reduce bias in estimates. Even in models of oligopolistic competition in
which the price has a nonlinear relationship with unobservables and the characteristics of
competing products, Yang, Chen, and Allenby (2003) and Petrin and Train (2010) …nd that
linear control functions can lead to signi…cant reduction in bias. The restriction that wjt
does not depend on characteristics of other programs may not be particularly strong in this
context. However, the single dimensional additive source of error, jt , remains a strong
assumption since it rules out heterogeneous e¤ects of the instrument. It may be feasible to
relax some parametric assumptions in equations (5) and (6) in settings with greater variation
in the endogenous variable.


5.2    Instrument
Table 7 presents regression estimates of equation (5), except using a log-log speci…cation
so that coe¢ cients can be interpreted as elasticities. The …rst four columns do not include
the instrument rjt , which is de…ned below. Columns (1) and (2) show limited correlation
between salaries and observed program characteristics except rents and the Medicare wage
index. The elasticity with respect to these two variables is small, at less than 0.15 in
magnitude. This suggests that models that do not instrument for salaries may provide


                                                   21
reasonable approximations for residents’preferences. To address potential correlation, I will
also present estimates from speci…cations that use reimbursement rates for residency training
at competitor hospitals as a wage instrument.
    Medicare reimburses residency programs for direct costs of training based on cost reports
submitted in the 1980s. Before the prospective payment system was established, the total
payment made to a hospital did not depend on the precise classi…cation of costs as training
or patient care costs. The reimbursement system for residency training was severed from
payments for patient care in 1985 because the two types of costs were considered distinct
by the government. While patient care was reimbursed based on fees for diagnosis-related
groups, reimbursements for residency training were calculated using cost reports in a base
period, usually 1984. Line items related to salaries and bene…ts, and administrative expenses
of residency programs were designated as direct costs of residency training. A per resident
amount was calculated by dividing the total reported costs on these line items by the number
of residents in the base period. Today, hospitals are reimbursed based on this per-resident
amount, adjusted for in‡ation using CPI-U.
    This reimbursement system therefore uses reported costs from two decades prior to the
sample period of study. More importantly, the per resident amount may not re‡ect costs
even in the base period because hospitals had little incentive to account for costs under the
correct line item. Newhouse and Wilensky (2001) notes that the distinction between patient
care costs from those incurred due to residency training is arbitrary and that variation in
per-resident amounts may be driven by di¤erences in hospital accounting practices or the
use of volunteer faculty rather than real costs. In other words, whether a cost, say salaries
paid to attending physicians, was accounted for in a line item later designated for direct
costs can signi…cantly in‡uence reimbursement rates today.
    These reimbursements are earmarked for costs of residency training and are positively
associated with salaries paid by a program today (Table 7, Column 3). Reimbursement rates
at competitor programs can therefore a¤ect a program’s salary o¤er because conversations
with program directors suggest that salaries paid by competitors in a program’s geographic
area are used as benchmarks while setting their own salaries (Column 4).22 I instrument

area of a program. The instrument is de…ned as

    Conversations with Dr. Weinstein, Vice President for GME at Partners Healthcare, suggest that salaries
at residency programs sponsored by Partners Healthcare are aimed to be competitive with those at other
programs in the Northeast and in Boston, by looking at market data from two publicly available sources
(the COTH Survey and New England/Boston Teaching Hospital Survey).

where rrk and f tek are the reimbursement rate and number of full-time equivalent residents
at program k’s primary hospital in the base period, and Gj are the hospitals in program
j’s geographic area other than j’s primary hospital. I base the geographic de…nitions on
Medicare’s physician fee schedule, i.e. the MSA of the hospital or the rest of state if the
hospital is not in an MSA. If less than three other competitors are in this area, de…ne Gj to
be the census division.23
    Consistent with the theory for the instrument’s e¤ect on salaries, Column (5) shows that
competitor reimbursements are positively related to salaries. Estimated in levels rather than
logs, this speci…cation is analogous to the …rst stage in a two-stage least-squares method.24
In Column (6), I test the theory that competitor reimbursements a¤ect salaries only through
competitor salaries. Relative to column (5), controlling for the lagged average competitor
salaries reduces the estimated e¤ect of competitor reimbursements by an order of magnitude
and results in a statistically insigni…cant e¤ect.
    The key assumption for validity of the instrument is that the program unobservable jt is
conditionally independent of competitor reimbursement rates, given program characteristics
and a program’s own reimbursement rate, which is included in zjt for speci…cations using
the instrument. This assumption is satis…ed if variation in reimbursement rates is driven
by an arbitrary classi…cation of costs by hospitals in 1984 or if past costs of competitors
are not related to residents’ preferences during the sample period. The primary threat is
that reported per residents costs are correlated with persistent geographic factors. To some
extent, this concern is mitigated by controlling for a program’s own reimbursement rate.
Reassuringly, Column (7) in Table 7 shows that the impact of competitor reimbursement
rates on a program’s salary changes by less than the standard error in the estimates upon
including location characteristics such as median age, household income, crime rates, col-
lege population and total population.25 Another concern is the possibility that programs

      Additional details on Medicare’s reimbursement scheme and the construction of the instrument are in
Appendix G.
   24
      Figure G.2 depicts this …rst stage visually. A strong increasing relationship between salary and competi-
tor reimbursements is noticable. Clustered at the program level, the …rst stage F-statistic for the coe¢ cient
on the instrument is 37.6. Since the control function approach is based on assuming independence rather than
mean independence, I test for heteroskedasticity in the residuals from the …rst stage. I could not reject the
hypothesis that the residual is homoskedastic at the 90% con…dence level for any individual year of data using
either the tests proposed by Breusch and Pagan (1979) or by White (1980). Figure G.3 presents a scatter
plot of the salary distribution against …tted values. The plot shows little evidence of heteroskedasticity.
   25
      Strictly speaking, the exclusion restriction requires that the instrument is not strongly correlated with
factors that may determine choices of residents. Appendix G shows that excluded location characteristics do
not explain much variation in addition to controls included in the model although a formal test of exogeneity

respond to the reimbursement rates of competitors by engaging in endogenous investment.
A comparison of estimates from Columns (2) and (5) shows little evidence of sensitivity of
the coe¢ cients on program characteristics (NIH, beds, Case Mix Index) to the inclusion of
reimbursement rate variables.


6     Estimation
This section de…nes the estimator, the moments used in estimation, the simulation technique
and a parametric bootstrap used for inference.


6.1     Method of Simulated Moments
The estimation proceeds in two stages when the control function is employed. I …rst estimate
the control variable jt from equation (4) using OLS to construct the residual

                                    ^jt = wjt          zjt ^   rjt ^:                     (8)

Replacing this estimate in equation (6), we get

                                           z            w
                             uijt   zijt   i   + wjt    i   + ^jt +     jt ;              (9)

where the approximation is up to estimation error in jt . The estimation of parameters de-
termining the human capital index of residents and their preferences over residents proceeds
by treating ^jt like any other exogenous observable program characteristic. The error due to
using ^jt instead of jt , however, a¤ects the calculation of standard errors. The …rst stage
is not necessary in the model treating salaries as exogenous.
    The distribution of preferences of residents and human capital can be determined as
a function of observable characteristics of both sides and the parameter of the model,
collected from equations (6), (2) and (3). The second stage of the estimation uses a simulated
method of moments estimator (McFadden, 1989; Pakes and Pollard, 1989) to estimate the
true parameter 0 . The estimate ^M SM minimizes a simulated criterion function

6.2     Moments

and then averaged across markets. The simulated counterparts m   ^ S ( ) are computed iden-
tically, but averaged across the simulations and markets. Mathematical expressions for the
population versions and other details are in Appendix A.1.

    The …rst set of moments include the covariances between program and resident charac-
teristics. These moments are the basis of the regression coe¢ cients presented in Tables 3 and
4. They quantify the degree of assortativity between resident and program characteristics
observed in the data. I also include the probability that a resident is matched to a program
located in the same state as her state of birth, or the same state as her medical school state.
    The second and third set of moments take advantage of the many-to-one matching na-
  26
    The objective function in the speci…cations estimated have local minima, and is discontinuous due to
the use of simulation. I use three starts of the genetic algorithm, which is a derivative-free global stochastic
optimization procedure, followed by local searches using the subplex algorithm. Details are in Appendix A.

ture of the market.27 Section 4.2 presents summaries of these moments from the data. The
moments cannot be constructed in one-to-one matching markets, such as the marriage mar-
ket, but are crucial to identify even the simpler double-vertical model. Since these moments
extract information from within a peer group, they e¤ectively control for both observable
and unobservable program characteristics.28


6.3     Simulating a Match
Under the parametric assumptions made on jt , "i , and i in Section 3, for a given parameter
vector , a unique pairwise stable match exists and can be simulated. Because residents only
participate in one market, matches of di¤erent markets can be simulated independently. For
simplicity, I describe the procedure for only one market and omit the market subscript t.

and the indirect utilities fuijs gi;j : The indirect utilities determine the program resident i
picks from any choice set.
    Begin by sorting the residents in order of their simulated human capital, fhis gN  i=1 , and
     (k)
let i be the identity of the resident with the k-th highest human capital.

       Step 1 : Resident i(1) picks her favorite program. Set her simulated match, s i(1) , to
       this program and compute J (1) , the set of programs with un…lled positions after i(1) is
       assigned.

       Step k > 1 : Let J (k 1) be the set of programs with un…lled positions after resident
       i(k 1) has been assigned. Set s i(k) to the program in J (k 1) most desired by i(k) .

    The simulated match s can be used to calculate moments using equations (11) to (13).
The optimization routine keeps a …xed set of simulation draws of unobservable characteristics
for computing moments at di¤erent values of .
  27
     Alternatively, one could combine moments of type 1 and 2 to include all entries in the within program
covariance of characteristics.
  28
     Note that the number of moments suggested increases rapidly as more characteristics are included in the
preference models. If the covariance between each observed characteristic of the resident and of the program
are included in the …rst set of moments, the number of moments is at least the product of the number of
characteristics of each side. On the other hand, the number of parameters is the sum of the number of
characteristics. This relative growth can create di¢ culties when estimating models with a very rich set of
characteristics.




                                                    26
    A model with preference heterogeneity on both sides requires a computationally more
complex simulation method, such as the Gale and Shapley (1962) deferred acceptance algo-
rithm (DAA), to compute a particular pairwise stable match. In the DAA, each applicant
simultaneously applies to her most favored program that has not yet rejected her. A set of
applications are held at each stage while others are rejected and assignments are made …nal
only when no further applications are rejected. This temporary nature of held applications
and the need to compute a preferred program for all applications at each stage signi…cantly
increases the computational burden for a market with many participants such as the one
studied in this paper.29


6.4     Econometric Issues
In a data environment with many independent and identically distributed matching markets,
the sample moments and their simulated counterparts across markets can be seen as iid
random variables. Well known limit theorems could be used to understand the asymptotic
properties of a simulation based estimator (McFadden, 1989; Pakes and Pollard, 1989). The
data for this study are taken from eight academic years, making asymptotic approximations
based on data from many markets undesirable. Within each market, the equilibrium match
of agents are interdependent through both observed and unobserved characteristics of other
agents in the market. For this reason, modelling the data generating process as independently
sampled matches is unappealing as well.
    Instead, I consider a data generating process in which the size of the market grows rather
than the number of markets. The family medicine residency market has about 430 programs
and 3,000 residents participating each year. Similar facts motivated theoretical work on the
structure of the set of stable matches and incentives of agents as the market grows in size
(Kojima and Pathak, 2009).
    Agarwal and Diamond (2014) studies the properties of the estimator for the double-
vertical model in a single market for a data generating process in which the number of
programs and residents increases. For each program, j, the capacity is drawn from the
distribution Fc , with support on the natural numbers less than c. They study the case where
                                        P
the total number of positions Ctot = j cj is equal to the number of residents N . Under
these asymptotics, the number of market participants on each side grows at a stochastically
proportional rate. The observed data is a pairwise stable match for N residents and J
  29
     Even with an insertion sort, a relatively ine¢ cient sorting algorithm, the computational complexity
of the algorithm used here is O n2 whereas if preferences were heterogenous on both sides, a simulation
to calculate the resident optimal match using deferred acceptance algorithm would have a computational
complexity of O n3 .

programs with characteristics (xi ; "i ) and zjt ; jt drawn from their respective population
distributions. Such data can be viewed as a joint distribution of observable characteristics of
programs and residents, with information also on each resident’s peer group in the program.
The challenge in obtaining asymptotic theory arises precisely from the dependence of matches
on the entire sample of observed characteristics. Similar challenges arise in the literature
on network formation models (see Kolaczyk, 2009; Christakis et al., 2010). Monte Carlo
evidence suggests that in a more general model like the one estimated in this paper, the root
mean square error in parameter estimates decreases with the sample size.


Calculating Standard Errors

   An additional challenge arises for constructing con…dence sets for the estimated parameter
because of interdependence of matches, and because bootstrapping the estimator directly is
computationally prohibitive. The covariance of the moments is estimated using a parametric
bootstrap to account for the dependence of matches across residents. With this estimate, I
approximate the error in the estimated parameter using a delta method that is commonly
used in simulated estimators (Gourieroux and Monfort, 1997):

                     ^ = ^ 0W ^
                                    1
                                        ^ 0W        1                          1
                                                V^ + V^ S W 0 ^ ^ 0 W ^            ;               (15)
                                                    S

where ^ is the gradient of the moments with respect to evaluated at ^M SM using two-sided
…nite-di¤erence derivatives; W is the weight matrix used in estimation; V^ is an estimate of
the covariance of the moments at ^M SM ; S is the number of simulations and V^ S is an estimate
of the simulation error in the moments at ^M SM .
    In this section, I describe the choice of W and outline the parametric bootstrap used to
estimate V^ for the simpler case with N = Ctot and exogenous salaries. Appendix A provides
additional details on estimating ^ . The bootstrap mimics the data generating process
described earlier. Three basic steps are used for each bootstrap iteration b 2 f1; : : : ; Bg :

  1. Generate a bootstrap sample of programs fzj;b ; cj;b gJj=1 by drawing from the empirical

    The variance of m  ^ b is the estimate for V^ used to compute ^ : Monte Carlo evidence
suggests that the procedure yields con…dence sets with close to the correct size. The model
using the control function correction has an additional step in this bootstrap to account for
uncertainty in estimating ^jt , also described in Appendix A.
    Finally, the weight matrix in estimation is obtained from bootstrapping directly from the
joint distribution of matches observed in the data. A bootstrap sample of matches f b gB  b=1
is generated by sampling, with replacement, J programs and along with their matched
residents. The moments from these matches are computed and the inverse of the covariance
is used as the positive de…nite weight matrix, W . The procedure does not require a …rst step
optimization and does not need to converge to V^ 1 .


7     Empirical Speci…cations and Results
I present estimates from three models. The …rst model has the richest form of preferences as
it allows for unobserved heterogeneity in preferences via normally distributed random coef-
…cients on Case Mix Index, NIH Funds of major medical school a¢ liates and the number of
beds. It also allows for heterogeneity in taste for program location based on a resident’s birth
location and medical school location. I use a second model that does not include random
coe¢ cients on Case Mix, NIH Funds or beds to assess the importance of unobserved prefer-
ence heterogeneity. These two models treat salaries as exogenous. The …nal model modi…es
the second model to addresses the potential endogeneity in salaries using the instrument
described in Section 5.2. This speci…cation includes a program’s own reimbursement rate in
addition to characteristics included in the other models.
    Estimates of residents’preferences for programs presented in the next section are trans-
lated into dollar equivalents for a select set of program characteristics. I also present the
willingness to pay by categories of programs. These are the most economically relevant
statistics obtained from preference estimates. Appendix B brie‡y discusses the underly-
ing parameters, which are not economically intuitive, and robustness using estimates from
additional models.


7.1    Preference Estimates
Panel A.1 of Table 8 presents the estimated preferences for programs in salary equivalent
terms. Comparing speci…cations (1) and (2), the estimated value of a one standard deviation
higher Case Mix Index at an otherwise identical program is about $2,500 to $5,000 in annual
salary for a typical resident. Likewise, residents are willing to pay for programs at larger


                                              29
hospitals as measured by beds, and for programs with better NIH funded a¢ liates. The
estimates from speci…cation (1) suggest a substantial degree of preference heterogeneity
for these characteristics as well. The additional heterogeneity in preferences relative to
speci…cation (2) results in a shift in the mean willingness to pay for NIH funding of major
a¢ liates, the Case Mix Index, and beds, but not whether they are desirable or not.
    Panel A.2 presents estimates of preferences for program types and heterogeneity in pref-
erences for program location. Both speci…cations (1) and (2) estimate that, ceteris paribus,
rural programs are preferable to urban programs. This result is consistent with the reduced
form evidence presented in Section 2, which shows a positive though statistically insigni…-
cant association between resident quality and rural programs, and that rural programs do
not have a signi…cantly larger fraction of un…lled positions than urban programs. Because
rural programs tend to be associated with smaller hospitals and medical school a¢ liates
with lower NIH funding, these estimates do not necessarily imply that rural programs are
preferred to urban programs. The next section presents the willingness to pay by program
categories and shows that overall, rural programs are less preferred to urban programs.
    Estimates from both speci…cations also suggest that residents prefer programs in their
state of birth or in the same state as their medical school. For instance, estimates from
speci…cation (1) imply that a typical resident is willing to forgo about $10,000 in salary to
match at a program in the same state as their medical school. Although rural born residents
prefer rural programs more than other residents, they prefer rural programs at a monetary
equivalent of under $1,200. The estimated willingness to pay for these factors is smaller in
speci…cation (2) although the relative importance for the di¤erent dimensions is similar.
    Panel B presents parameter estimates for the distribution of human capital, which deter-
mines ordinal rankings between residents. All speci…cations yield similar coe¢ cients on the
various resident characteristics and estimate that the unobservable determinants of human
capital have larger variances for residents with foreign degrees. The estimated di¤erence
between a US born foreign medical graduate and foreign graduates from other countries is
an order of magnitude smaller than the standard deviation of unobservable determinants of
human capital.

7.1.1   Estimates with Instruments

As compared to estimates from speci…cation (2), which treats salaries as exogenous, the
estimated willingness to pay for program characteristics is generally larger in speci…cation
(3). The estimates for NIH funding of Major Medical school a¢ liates is the only exception.
The increase in the estimated willingness to pay in speci…cation (3) is driven by a fall in the
coe¢ cient on salaries but similar coe¢ cient estimates for the other program characteristics.

                                              30
Appendix B discusses results from the instrumented version of speci…cation (1), which also
leads to a decrease in the coe¢ cient on salaries and little change in estimates for other
coe¢ cients. This speci…cation results in a small, positive coe¢ cient on salaries that is
not statistically signi…cant and implies an implausibly large willingness to pay for better
programs.
    The qualitative e¤ect of including the wage instrument on parameter estimates indicates
that, if anything, treating salaries as exogenous may lead to an understated willingness to
pay for more desirable programs. I interpret the magnitudes with caution given the lack of
robustness, which is likely a consequence of the limited salary variation in the data.30 Aside
for controlled geographic covariates such as rent and wage index, estimates in Column (2)
of Table 7 do not show strong evidence of substantial correlation of salaries with program
characteristics. My preferred approach is to focus on results from speci…cation (1) for most
counterfactual results and discuss the e¤ect of possible positive bias in the salary coe¢ cient
using speci…cation (3).

7.1.2    Distribution of Willingness to Pay

The distribution of willingness to pay for di¤erent programs is an important economic input
for analyzing salaries under competitive wage bargaining and for evaluating the e¤ect of
…nancial incentives for rural training. Figure 2 plots the estimated distribution of utility (in
dollars) across programs averaged over residents, net of salaries, for the 2010-2011 sample
year as implied by speci…cation (1). This sample will be used for all counterfactual exer-
cises. Table 9 presents summary statistics of this distribution by categorizing programs into
quartiles based on observed characteristics, and normalizing the mean across all programs
to zero. I estimate a large willingness to pay for programs with a high Case Mix Index, at
larger hospitals and in counties with larger programs. A typical resident is willing to accept
a $5,000 to $9,500 lower salary at the average urban program instead of a training in a rural
location. At under $1,200, the estimated additional preference of rural born residents for a
rural program is not su¢ cient to overturn the mean distaste for training in rural programs.
The …nding that the typical rural hospital is not substantially less attractive than their ur-
ban counterparts is consistent with conclusions of Rosenblatt et al. (2006). Using surveys
of program directors, they …nd that residents matched at rural programs and the number of
applications per position are similar to those in urban programs.
    Speci…cations (1) and (2) estimate the standard deviation in utility across residents and
programs of varying characteristics to be between $14,000 and $22,000. This measure doubles
  30
    The objective function for speci…cations using salary instruments is fairly ‡at along di¤erent combina-
tions of coe¢ cients on the wage and control variables.


                                                    31
from $14,000, but is imprecisely estimated, when Speci…cation (2) is modi…ed to account for
endogeneity in salaries. While di¤erences in the quality of training provided by a program
is likely the primary driver of willingness to pay for di¤erent programs, as evidenced by
tastes for geographically nearby programs, there may be some contemporaneous value for
desirable amenities. At …rst glance, the estimated standard deviation in willingness to pay
for programs may seem large with respect to the observed variation in salaries (about $3,200).
However, the ideal comparison is with the distribution of training value added in terms of
future income across residency programs, which is likely much larger. Such a comparison is
not possible given the available data.


7.2     Model Fit
In this section, I describe the in-sample and out-of-sample …t of estimates from speci…cation
(1). The …t of speci…cations (2) and (3) are qualitatively similar. The out-of-sample …t uses
data from the 2011-2012 wave of the GME Census, which was only accessed after parameter
estimates were computed.
    Estimates of the model only determine the probability that a resident with a given ob-
servable characteristic matches with a program with certain observables. The uncertainty
in matches arises from unobservables of both the residents and the programs. Therefore,
an assessment of …t must use statistics that average matches across groups of residents or
programs.
    For simplicity of exposition, I assess model …t using a single dimensional average quality
of matched program for a group of residents with similar observable determinants of human
capital. For each year t, I use the parameter estimates from the model to construct a quality
index for each resident i and program j by computing xi ^ and zjt ^ respectively. Then, I
divide the residents into ten bins based on xi ^ and compute the mean quality of program
with which residents from each bin are matched. Figure 3 presents a binned scatter plot of
this mean quality of program as observed in the data and predicated by model simulations.
Both the in-sample points and the out-of-sample points are close to the 45-degree line. The
90% con…dence sets of the simulated means for several resident bins include the theoretical
prediction.31
    This …t of the model provides con…dence that parametric restrictions on the model are
  31
    A more model-free assessment of …t using sorting regressions only on observed covariates is presented
in Table B.2. One may also worry predicting sorting patterns is is mechanical because there is little change
in the market composition across years. For counterfactuals directly impacting the composition of market
participants, it can be important for the model to capture changes in sorting as a function of changes in the
composition of the market. However, changes in the composition of the resident and program distribution
are negligible, resulting in little available variation to test the model with such a …t.


                                                     32
not leading to poor predictions of the sorting patterns in the market. Therefore, I am
comfortable using estimates as basis of counterfactual analysis.


8      Application 1: Salary Competition
In 2002, a group of former residents brought on a class-action lawsuit under the Sherman Act
against major medical associations in the United States and the NRMP. The plainti¤s alleged
the medical match is an instrumental competitive restraint used by the residency programs
to depress salaries.32 By replacing a traditional market in which residents could use multiple
o¤ers to negotiate with programs, they argued that the NRMP "enabled employers to obtain
resident physicians without such a bidding war, thereby arti…cially …xing, depressing, stan-
dardizing and stabilizing compensation and other terms of employment below competitive
levels" (Jung et.al. v AAMC et.al., 2002). A brief prepared by Orley Ashenfelter on behalf
of the plainti¤s argued that competitive outcomes in this market would yield wages close to
the marginal product of labor, which was approximated using salaries of starting physicians,
nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.33 Physician assistants earned a median salary
of $86,000 in 201034 as compared to about $47,000 for medical residents despite longer work
hours.35
    Recent papers have debated whether low salaries observed in this market are a results
of the match. Using a stylized model, Bulow and Levin (2006) argue that salaries may be
depressed in the match because residency programs face the risk that a higher salary may
not necessarily result in a better resident. Kojima (2007) uses an example to show that this
result is not robust in a many-to-one matching setting because of cross-subsidization across
residents in a program. Empirical evidence in Niederle and Roth (2003, 2009) suggests that
medical fellowship salaries are not a¤ected by the presence of a match, however, the study
does not explain why fellowship salaries remain lower than salaries paid to other health
professionals.
    The plainti¤s argued their case based on a classical economic model of homogeneous
…rms competing for the services of labor and free entry. However, such a perfect competition
  32
     Jung et.al. v AAMC et.al. (2002) states that "The NRMP matching program has the purpose and
e¤ect of depressing, standardizing and stabilizing compensation and other terms of employment." After the
lawsuit was …led, the Pension Funding and Equity Act of 2004 amended antitrust law to disallow evidence of
participation in the medical match in antitrust cases. The lawsuit was dismissed following this amendment,
overturning a previous opinion of the court upholding the price-…xing allegation.

     At 50 work-weeks a year and 80 hour a week, the cap imposed by the ACGME in 2003, a salary of
$50,000 yields a wage rate for a medical resident of $12.50. A more generous estimate with 65 hours a week,
45 work-weeks a year and a salary of $60,000 yields a wage rate of $20.50.

benchmark may not be a good approximation for an entry-level professional labor market.
The data provide strong evidence that residents have preferences for characteristics of the
program other than the wages and may, thus, reject a higher salary o¤er from a less desirable
program. Further, barriers to entry by residency programs are high and capacity constraints
are imposed by accreditation requirements. A program must therefore consider the option
value of hiring a substitute resident when confronted with a competing salary o¤er. High
quality programs may be particularly able to …nd other residents willing to work for low
salaries. Conversely, highly skilled residents are scarce and they may be able to bargain for
higher salaries. It is essential to consider these incentives in order to predict outcomes under
competitive salary bargaining.
    I model a "traditional" market using a competitive equilibrium, which is described by
a vector of worker-…rm speci…c salaries and an assignment such that each worker and …rm
demands precisely the prescribed assignment. Shapley and Shubik (1971) show that compet-
itive equilibria correspond to core allocations and satisfy two conditions. First, allocations
must be individually rational for both workers and …rms. Second, it must be that at the
going salaries no worker-…rm pair would prefer to break the allocation to form a (di¤erent)
match at renegotiated salaries. This latter requirement ensures that further negotiations
cannot be mutually bene…cial. Kelso and Crawford (1982) show that competitive equilibria
can result from a salary adjustment process in which the salaries of residents with multiple
o¤ers are sequentially increased until the market clears. The process embodies the "bidding
war" plainti¤s suggest would arise in a "traditional" market. Crawford (2008) proposed a
redesign of the residency match based on the salary adjustment process with the aim of
increasing the ‡exibility of salaries in the residency market and implementing a competitive
equilibrium outcome.
    I …rst develop a stylized model to derive the dependence of competitive equilibrium
salaries on both the willingness to pay for programs and the production technology of res-
idency programs. For counterfactual simulations, I adopt an approach that does not rely
on knowing the production technology of resident-program pairs because data on residency
program output is not available. Instead of calculating equilibrium salaries, I use the esti-
mates of only the residents’preferences to calculate an equilibrium markdown from output
net of training costs, called the implicit tuition. Loosely speaking, my calculation acts as
if the output produced by a program-resident pair accrues entirely to residents. The illus-
trative model shows that the approach is likely to understate the equilibrium markdown in
salaries since programs do not earn any infra-marginal productive rents due to their own
productivity. The theoretical model is also used to describe di¤erences with related models
of on-the-job training or salary setting with non-pecuniary amenities.


                                              34
8.1     An Illustrative Assignment Model
I generalize the model of the residency market in Bulow and Levin (2006) which assumes that
residents take the highest salary o¤er. I allow resident preferences to depend on program
quality in addition to salaries, and use a more ‡exible production function than Bulow and
Levin (2006).
    Consider an economy with N residents and programs in which each program may hire
only one resident. Resident i has a human capital index, hi 2 [0; 1), and program j has a
quality of training index, qj 2 [0; 1). To focus on salary bargaining, the training quality of
programs are held exogenous. Without loss of generality, index the residents and programs
so that hi hi 1 , qj qj 1 , and q1 and h1 are normalized to zero.
    Residents have homogenous, quasi-linear preferences for the quality of program, u (q; w) =
aq + w with a 0. The value, net of variable training costs, to a program of quality q of
employing a resident with human capital index h is f (h; q) where fh , fq , fhq > 0 and f (0; 0)
is normalized to 0.36 A program’s pro…t from hiring resident h at salary level w is f (h; q) w.
I assume that an allocation is individually rational for a resident if u (q; w) 0, and for a
program if f (h; q) w 0.
    A competitive equilibrium assignment maximizes total surplus. In this model, the unique
equilibrium is characterized by positive assortative matching and full employment. Hence,
in equilibrium, resident k is matched with program k and is paid a possibly negative wage
wk . The vector of equilibrium wages is determined by the individual rationality constraints
and the constraint

                          f (hk ; qk )   wk   f (hi ; qk )   wi + a (qk   qi ) :                  (16)

This constraint on wk requires that the pro…t of program k by hiring resident k must be
weakly greater than the pro…t from hiring resident i. At the going salaries, it is incentive
compatible for resident i to accept an o¤er from program k only if the wage is at least
wi a (qk qi ).
    There is a range of wages that are a part of a competitive equilibrium. Shapley and
Shubik (1971) shows that there exists an equilibrium that is weakly preferred by all resi-
dents to all other equilibria, and another that is preferred by all programs. Appendix C.1
characterizes the entire set of equilibria, and derives the expression for wages at these two
extremal outcomes. Since the plainti¤s alleged that salaries are currently much lower than
in a bargaining process, I focus on the worker-optimal equilibrium which has higher salaries
  36
    A complementary production technology is commonly assumed for studying on-the-job training (Becker,
1975, pp 34) or sorting in matching markets (Becker, 1973; Teulings, 1995).



                                                   35
for every worker than any other equilibrium. This outcome is unanimously preferred by
all residents to other competitive equilibria. The wage of resident k in the worker optimal
equilibrium is given by

                                               X
                                               k
                              wk =     aqk +         [f (hi ; qi )   f (hi 1 ; qi )] :                    (17)
                                               i=2

Resident 1 receives her product of labor f (h1 ; q1 ) (normalized to 0), the maximum her
employer is willing to pay. For resident 2, the …rst term aq2 represents an implicit price
for the di¤erence in the value of training received by her compared to that of program 1
(with q1 = 0). If a resident were to use a wage o¤er of w by program 1 in a negotiation
with program 2, the resident would accept a counter o¤er of w aq2 . The second term in
this resident’s wage, f (h2 ; q2 ) f (h1 ; q2 ), is program 2’s maximum willingness to pay for
the di¤erence in productivity of residents 1 and 2, which accrues entirely to the resident in
the worker-optimal equilibrium. The sum of these two terms measures the impact of the
outside option of each party on the wage negotiation determining w2 . For k > 2, these
(local) di¤erences in the productivity of residents add up across lower matches to form the
equilibrium wage.


Implicit Tuition

    The implicit price for training at …rm k, given by aqk , is based on the preferences for
training at a program rather than the cost of training. In models of general training that
use a perfect competition framework, such as Rosen (1972) and Becker (1975), the implicit
price is the marginal cost of training alone because free entry prevents …rms from earning
rents due to their quality.37 When entry barriers are large due to …xed costs or restrictions
from accreditation requirements, …rms can earn additional pro…ts due to their quality. I
argue that ruling out entry is appropriate because of accreditation requirements and to
focus on wage bargaining. Equation (17) shows that under these assumptions, program k
can levy the implicit tuition aqk on residents. This implicit tuition results from a force
similar to compensating di¤erentials (Rosen, 1987), but allows for heterogeneity in resident
  37
    Viewing f (h; q) as output net of costs of training, a constant training cost across residents and programs
would shift the wage schedule down by that constant. As can be seen from equation (17), training costs that
depend on program quality, but not the quality of the resident do not a¤ect equilibrium salaries as long as
fq remains positive. Also note that the implicit price aqk does not depend on the number of residents and
programs N , which could be very large, or the distribution of program quality. Intuitively, the important
di¤erence overturning results from perfect competition is that the number of …rms competing for a …xed set
of workers is not disproportionately large.



                                                        36
skill. Equilibrium salaries are the sum of the implicit tuition and a split of the value f
produced by a resident program pair.
    As mentioned earlier, the data does not allow us to determine f . I calculate the implicit
tuition using residents’preferences alone in order to evaluate whether a gap between f and
equilibrium salaries exists as a result of market fundamentals. The next result shows that
the implicit tuition bounds the markdown in salaries from below. Under free entry by …rms,
salaries would be equal to f because any pro…ts earned by …rms would be competed away.

Proposition 1 For all production functions f with fh ; fq ; fhq                 0, the pro…ts of the …rm
k is bounded below by aqk in any competitive equilibrium.

Proof. Corollary to Proposition 5 stated and proved in Appendix C.2.
    Hence, the implicit tuition aqk is a markdown in salaries that is independent of the
output. If residents have a strong preference for program quality, this implicit tuition will
be large and salaries in any competitive equilibrium are well below the product f (hk ; qk ).
    To interpret the implicit tuition as a lower bound for salary markdowns, consider two
particular limiting cases for the production function. If f (h; q) depends only on h so that
the value of a resident, denoted f (h), does not vary across programs, the worker-optimal
salaries are given by
                                      wk = f (hk ) aqk :                                 (18)

Under this production function, the resident is the full claimant of the value of her labor and
salaries equal her product net of the implicit tuition. Residents are able to engage programs
in a bidding war until their salary equals the output less the implicit tuition because all
programs value resident k at f (hk ).
    On the other hand, if f (h; q) depends only on q so that all residents produce f (q),
irrespective of their human capital, the worker-optimal salaries are

                                               wk =       aqk :                                         (19)

In this case, the program does not share the product f (qk ) with the resident since any two
residents are equally productive at the program. The resident still pays an implicit tuition
for training.38
    The production function directly in‡uences competitive salaries but Proposition 1 shows
that in all cases resident k pays the implicit tuition aqk . Equilibrium wages given in equa-
tions (18) and (19) highlight that the side of the market that owns the factor determining
  38
     In order to ensure that the match is assortative in these limiting cases, I assume that if a program
(resident) has two equally attractive o¤ers, the tie in favor of the resident (program) with the higher human
capital (quality).

                                                     37
di¤erences in f is compensated for their productivity in a competitive equilibrium. Residents
are compensated for their skill only if human capital is an important determinant of f . For
this reason, using a production function of the form f (h) results in a markdown in salaries
from f that is only due to the implicit tuition.
    This interpretation highlights a key di¤erence from results derived using models with
many …rms competing for labor with free entry. In those models, one expects all the product
to accrue to the workers because …rms enter the market to bid for labor services until a zero
pro…t condition is met. High compensation for residents is a result of free entry rather than
negotiations between a …xed set of agents.


8.2     Generalizing the Implicit Tuition
The expression for the implicit tuition derived above relied on the assumption that residents
have homogeneous preferences for program quality. For this reason, the results from the
illustrative model do not speak to competitive outcomes in a model with heterogenous pref-
erences. This section generalizes the de…nition of implicit tuition to make it applicable to
the model de…ned in Section 3.
    Notice that the pro…t earned by program k in a worker-optimal equilibrium under a pro-
duction function of the form f (h) is precisely the implicit tuition aqk because this production
function does not provide programs with infra-marginal productive rents. Under this pro-
duction function, markdowns from output are determined only by residents’preferences for
programs. Consequently, calculating …rm pro…ts using a production function of this type
may provide a conservative approach to estimating payo¤s to programs more generally. The
next result shows that under heterogeneous preferences for programs, the di¤erence between
salaries and output is the same for all production functions of the form f (h). This ensures
that an implicit tuition can be de…ned and calculated using only the residents’willingness
to pay for programs, circumventing the need for estimating f .
    For notational simplicity, I state the result for a one-to-one assignment model, and the
general result for many-to-one setting is stated and proved in Appendix C.4.39 With a slight
abuse of notation, let the total surplus from the pair (i; j) be afij = uij + f (hi ) 0:40 Here,
uij is the utility, net of wages, that resident i receives from matching with program j and
f (hi ) is the output produced by resident i. I now characterize the equilibria for a modi…ed
                                                                    ~
assignment game in which the surplus produced by the pair is afij = uij + f~ (hi ) 0 in terms
  39
     In the general formulation, I assume that the total output from a team of residents h1 ; : : : ; hqj is
                    Pqj
F h1 ; : : : ; hqj = k=1 f (hk ), where f (hk ) = 0 if position k is not …lled.
  40
     This formulation implicitly assumes that, at every program, it is individually rational for a worker to
accept a salary equal to her product. It further assumes that the output of every resident is non-negative.

of the equilibria of the game with surplus afij .
                                                                                               ~
Proposition 2 The equilibrium assignments of the games de…ned by afij and afij coincide.
                                                                              ~
Further, if ufi and vjf are equilibrium payo¤s for the surplus afij , then ufi = ufi + f~ (hi ) f (hi )
       ~
and vjf = vjf are equilibrium payo¤s under the surplus afij . Hence, a …rm’s pro…t in a worker-
optimal equilibrium depends on fuij gi;j but is identical for all production functions of the form
f (h).

Proof. See Appendix C.4 for the general case with many-to-one matches.
    As in the illustrative model, under a production technology that depends only on human
capital, the residents are the residual claimants of output. An increase or decrease in the
productivity of human capital is re‡ected in the wages, one for one. The …rms’pro…ts depends
only on the preferences of the residents. Thus, I refer to the di¤erence between output and
salaries in the worker-optimal competitive equilibrium for a model in which f depends only
on h as the implicit tuition. This de…nition uses the assumption that preferences of the
programs can be represented using a single human capital index in the empirical model but
also makes the additional restriction that the productivity of human capital, in dollar terms,
does not depend on the identity of the program.
    To the best of my knowledge, a closed form expression for competitive equilibrium salaries
is not available when preferences of the residents are heterogeneous. I calculate the implicit
tuition implied by estimated preferences using a two-step procedure.41 Each step solves a
linear program based on the approach developed in Shapley and Shubik (1971):

       Step 1 : Solve the optimal assignment problem, modi…ed from the formulation by
       Shapley and Shubik (1971) to allow for many-to-one matching.

       Step 2 : Calculate the worker-optimal element in the core given the assignments from
       step 1.

   Appendix C.3 describes the procedure in more detail. All calculations are done with the
2010-2011 sample of the data.
  41
     Since the total number of residents observed in the market is less than the number of positions and the
value of options outside the residency market are di¢ cult to determine, I will assume that the equilibrium
is characterized by full employment. This property follows if, for instance, it is individually rational for
all residents to be matched with their least desirable program at a wage that is equal to the total product
produced by the resident at this program and the product produced by a resident is not negative.




                                                    39
8.3     Estimates of Implicit Tuition
Estimates presented in Section 7 suggest that residents are willing to take large salary cuts
in order to train at more preferred programs, which can translate into a large implicit tu-
itions. Table 10 presents summary statistics of the distribution of implicit tuition using
estimates from speci…cations (1) through (3). I estimate the average implicit tuition to
be about $23,000 for speci…cations (1) and (2). This estimate rises to $43,500 when using
the instrument in speci…cation (3) because the coe¢ cient on salaries falls. As mentioned
in Section 7, the instrument used appears weak and yields non-robust point estimates, but
generally results in a larger willingness to pay and implicit tuitions through a decrease in
the coe¢ cient on salaries.42 The standard error in the estimate using speci…cation (3) is also
large, at $13,700, but can rule out an average implicit tuition smaller than $17,000. These
estimates are economically large in comparison to the mean salary of about $47,000 paid to
residents.
    The results also show signi…cant dispersion in the implicit tuition across residents and
programs. The standard deviation in the implicit tuition is between $12,000 and $25,000.
The 75th percentile of implicit tuition can be about three times higher than the 25th per-
centile, with even higher values at the 95th percentile. This dispersion primarily arises from
the di¤erences in program quality, which allows higher quality programs to lower salaries
more than relatively lower quality program.
    The estimated implicit tuition is between 50% to 100% of the $40,000 salary di¤erence
between medical residents and physician assistants. This …nding refutes the plainti¤s’ ar-
gument that the salary gap would not exist if residents’salaries were set competitively and
physician assistant salaries approximated the productivity of residents. However, the esti-
mated implicit tuition cannot explain the salary gap between starting physicians and medical
residents, which is approximately $90,000.43 As discussed earlier, the implicit tuition is a
conservative estimate of the salary markdown and part of this salary gap may be due to
di¤erences in the productivity of medical residents and starting physicians.
    When residents’preferences are heterogeneous, the implicit tuition is also a function of
the relative demand and supply of di¤erent types of residency positions, and is not simply
a result of compensating di¤erentials. Estimates from speci…cation (1) imply a willingness
to pay by residents for programs in the same state as their medical school, and programs in
the same state as their birth state. Therefore, the demand for residency positions is high
  42
      The instrumented version of speci…cation (1) results in implicit tuition estimates much larger than the
ones reported because of the smaller estimated coe¢ cient on salaries.
   43
      I use Mincer equation estimated using interval regressions on con…dential data from the Health Physician
Tracking Survey of 2008 to calculate the average salaries for starting family physicians. Details in Appendix
F.


                                                     40
in states where many residents were born or states where many residents went to medical
school. A supply-demand imbalance occurs, for instance, when the number of residency
positions in the state is low but many residents have preference for training in that state.
These forces will be important determinants of equilibrium salary if the residency market
adopts the design proposed in Crawford (2008) because the proposal is intended to produce
a competitive equilibrium outcome.
    To demonstrate the e¤ect of this imbalance on the estimated implicit tuition, I present
results from the regression

                  ln yj = zj   1   +   2   ln npossj +    3   ln grsj +   4   ln bornsj + ej ;

where yj is the average implicit tuition at program j estimated using speci…cation (1), zj
are characteristics of program j included in speci…cation (1), sj is program j’s state, npossj
is the number of residency positions o¤ered in sj , grsj is the number of residents from MD
medical schools in state sj and bornsj is the number of residents born in state sj . Column
(4) of Table 11 shows that the elasticity of the average implicit tuition at a program with
respect to the number of family medicine graduates getting their degrees in a medical school
in that state is positive, ^3 = 0:19. Conversely, the elasticity with respect to the number of
positions o¤ered in the program’s state is negative, ^2 = 0:16. The estimate for ^4 is not
statistically signi…cant, partially because the estimated preference for birth state is low and
because supply-demand imbalance based on birth-state is also lower.


8.4    Discussion
In matching markets, agents on both sides are heterogeneous and have preferences for match
partners. The e¤ects of this feature on market outcomes, especially when barriers to entry are
substantial, are not captured by a perfect competition model. Theoretical results presented
in Section 8.1 show that equilibrium salaries can be well below the product of labor, net of
costs of training, when residents value the quality of a program. Counterfactual estimates
show that the willingness to pay for programs results in a large markdowns in salaries in a
competitive wage equilibrium. The upper end of estimates can explain the salary gap between
physician assistants and medical residents assuming that physician assistant salaries are close
to the productivity of residents. My estimates also show that higher quality programs would
earn a larger implicit tuition than less desirable programs. To the extent that higher quality
programs are matched with higher skilled residents and are also intrinsically more productive,
the implicit tuition is a countervailing force to high dispersion salaries driven by productivity
di¤erences.

                                                     41
    The analysis suggests that instead of the design of the match, salaries are low because
programs are capacity constrained and barriers to entry are large due to …xed costs or accred-
itation requirements. The implicit tuition can therefore explain the empirical observations of
Niederle and Roth (2003, 2009) in fellowship markets and highlights why analyzing matching
markets using a perfect competition model can be quantitatively misleading.
    In this market, salaries may also be in‡uenced by the previously mentioned guideline
requiring minimum …nancial compensations for residents. While these forces may be impor-
tant, they seem unrelated to the match. In other words, programs may not have the incentive
to pay salaries close to levels suggested by the plainti¤s because of economic primitives.


9      Application 2: Rural Hospitals
Access to medical care is signi…cantly lower in rural communities of the United States:
about a …fth of the US resides in rural counties but only a tenth of physicians practice
in these areas (Rosenblatt and Hart, 2000). Increasing residency training in rural areas is
seen as an important part of solutions to this disparity in access to care because of the
empirical association between rural training or background with recruitment and retention
of rural physicians (Brooks et al., 2002; Talley, 1990). About 20% of urban born residents
graduating from family medicine programs start their initial practice in rural areas, roughly
in proportion to the population in rural communities of the US, whereas about 46% of
rural born family medicine residents begin their practice in rural communities (Table D.5).
Both urban-born and rural-born residents trained in rural areas are about 30 percentage
points more likely to enter a rural practice after residency (Table D.5). While some of this
association is probably driven by selection into rural residency training programs, it may also
partly be a causal e¤ect of rural training. The di¤erence in the nature of urban and rural
medicine and specialized experience useful for practicing in rural areas may be a contributing
factor.44
    The Patient Protection and A¤ordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) contains provisions for
increasing the training and recruitment of primary care physicians in rural areas. The
ACA provides an additional $1.5 billion to loan forgiveness programs focussed on recruiting
physicians into health physician shortage areas and creates targeted grants for increasing
  44
    Non-specialist primary care physicians tend to supply a disproportionately larger fraction of medical
care in rural counties, including emergency and obstetrics care. Family medicine residents training in rural
areas may consequently be more likely to receive speci…c experience for practicing rural medicine. Many
practitioners concerned with the rural physician shortage argue for an increased emphasis on rural residency
training through either rural programs or rotations (Rosenblatt and Hart, 2000; Rabinowitz et al., 2008).




                                                    42
residency training positions in primary care, especially in rural areas.45 Similar concerns
motivated Japan to institute regional caps that reduced the number of positions in urban pro-
grams proportionally to their size. Arguably, caps on urban programs could be implemented
in the United States through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME). In fact, the ACA moves a large number of unused Medicare funds allocated for
supporting costs of residency training in urban programs to states with disproportionately
low resident-to-population ratios and rural areas (see §5503 ACA, 2010).
    Broadly speaking, the ACA enacts recruitment incentives and quantity regulations to
encourage physician supply in rural areas. I study the e¤ects of these policies by comparing
simulated outcomes from environments with and without the intervention. A complete
model of the market makes it possible to account for general equilibrium e¤ects. I focus
on quantifying impact of these policy interventions on the sorting and number of residents
in rural programs because many of the private and social costs and bene…ts are di¢ cult to
quantify. Insight on the assignments resulting from these interventions may in‡uence the
decisions of a social planner considering such policies.
    All simulations are conducted using the 2010-2011 academic year of the data and speci-
…cation (1). I assume that the policies do not a¤ect the entry of residents into the market.
Speci…cations (2) and (3) yield qualitatively similar results. Speci…cation (1) does not use
an instrument for salaries, which Section 7 notes is likely to result in an overestimate of the
coe¢ cient on salaries. This is not a primary concern in the analysis of supply interventions
because salaries are kept …xed, and only the choices residents conditional on salaries are
important. The analysis of …nancial incentives, however, may overestimate the sensitivity of
residents to these policies.


9.1     Financial Incentives for Rural Training
I mimic the loan forgiveness programs of the National Health Services Corps, except for
medical residents. The program currently provides an annual incentive of $20,000 to $30,000
to primary care physicians for practicing in Health Physician Shortage Area, usually rural or
inner-city communities. To simulate the impact of such recruitment incentives for residents
training in rural areas, I exogenously increase the salaries at rural hospitals by $5,000, $10,000
and $20,000. The average estimated utility di¤erence between the rural and urban programs
is between $5,000 and $10,000 (Table 9).
  45
    The ACA supplements the budget of the National Health Services Corps loan forgiveness program.
Section 5301 provides grants for enhancing capacity at existing primary care training locations and Sections
10501 (I) 5508(a) provides grants speci…cally for establishing new programs in rural health clinics and
programs. See Bailey (2010) or Table 2 of the Congressional Research Service report titled "Discretionary
Spending in the Patient Protection and A¤ordable Care Act (ACA)."

                                                    43
    Panel A of Table 12 presents summaries from the baseline simulation from the model
using data from the year 2010 - 2011. The number of positions …lled in rural areas, as
observed in the data, is 310. The average predicted by the model is slightly higher at 313.37
although the inter-quartile range of simulations contains the observed number of matches.
According to baseline simulations, the quality of doctors matched with rural areas is similar
to the quality of doctors in urban areas. This is consistent with the reduced form evidence
presented in Table 3 that do not see a signi…cant disadvantage to currently operating rural
programs.46
    Panel B presents the impact of increased incentives for rural training. The incentive
a¤ects residents roughly indi¤erent between a rural and an urban program to rank the rural
program ahead of the urban program. Across the board, we see small increases in the
number of residents matches to programs in rural communities. An incentive of $20,000
increases the number of residents training in rural areas by about 17, or 5.5% of the number
of positions in rural programs. This incentive costs the government $325,000 per additional
resident matched to a rural program because most of the loan forgiveness accrues to residents
assigned to positions that would be occupied without the …nancial incentive. Instead of
a¤ecting numbers, the primary impact of incentives is an increase in the human capital of
residents matching to rural areas. As compared to a baseline of about an even chance, under
a small $5,000 incentive, a randomly chosen rural resident is about 9.4 percentage points
more likely to have a higher human capital than an urban resident. This increase in the
quality of residents is increasing with size of the incentives.
    These results can be explained by capacity constraints in rural areas. While price in-
centives directly increase the number of residents ranking rural programs ahead of urban
programs, the number that match with any given program is constrained by its capacity.
With 310 out of 334 positions …lled, there is little scope for the incentive to substantially
increase numbers. Consequently, although the incentives increase the pool of residents rank-
ing rural programs higher, capacity constraints prevent an increase in numbers but allow an
increase in the quality of residents matched at subsidized programs.
    One may ask whether a simpler analysis based on partial equilibrium reasoning with
unilateral salary increases by programs would lead to similar conclusions on the assignments
between residents and programs. The quasi-linear utility function implies that a uniform
increase in salaries of all residency programs would not impact assignments because the
comparison between any two programs remains unchanged. A partial equilibrium analysis
  46
    Unconditionally, rural programs are 7 percentage points more likely to be matched with residents that
have an MD degree. The average medical school median MCAT score of a resident matched with a rural
programs is less than a point lower, and the average NIH funding is 0.3 log points lower.



                                                   44
based on unilateral salary increases substantially deviates from this prediction. For smaller
interventions we expect general equilibrium e¤ects to be less pronounced. In Appendix D.2,
I compare general and partial equilibrium e¤ects of incentivizing rural training, and more
broadly, training in medically underserved states. I …nd that a partial equilibrium analysis
overestimates the number of positions allocated for small incentives, but for larger incentives,
overestimates aggregate increases in the quality of residents.


Welfare E¤ects and the Importance of Heterogeneity

    It is not obvious whether the small increase in numbers and a larger increase in the
quality of residents matched with rural programs is socially desirable. A complete cost-
bene…t analysis depends on the private surplus to programs and residents as well any social
bene…ts of rural training. The model only allows us to quantify the cost of …nancial incentives
and its impact on the total private surplus to residents. Table 12 shows that a $5,000
incentive results in a transfer of $1.6 million from the government to residents. However, the
estimated increase in residents’private welfare is 13.5% more than this amount. This result
is a consequence of heterogeneous preferences and the ability of …nancial incentives to realize
potential e¢ ciency gains by assigning residents with the lowest distaste for rural programs to
those positions. A small incentive for training in a rural program only induces a resident who
is roughly indi¤erent between a rural and an urban program to choose rural training. This
resident then opens up a position in an urban program that may be strongly preferred by
another resident. Therefore, general equilibrium re-sorting e¤ects of the …nancial incentive
result in an increase the e¢ ciency of assignments.
    The potential for …nancial incentives for targeting residents with low distaste for rural
areas only exists when preferences are heterogeneous. In a model that does not allow for
heterogeneity, the willingness to pay for training at a program is identical across residents.
Such a model would predict that a permutation of the assignment does not a¤ect residents’
welfare. The impact on the private bene…ts to residents, net of the transfer, is only through
the total number of positions …lled at di¤erent programs.


9.2    Supply Interventions
I assess the impact of supply regulations in this market by simulating outcomes after chang-
ing the number of positions o¤ered at di¤erent programs. I consider three types of policy
interventions. The …rst mimics the policy implemented in Japan and reduces the number
of positions in urban programs proportional to the size of the program (subject to integer
constraints) until further reductions would lead to fewer positions than the total number of

                                              45
residents in the market. The second intervention is motivated by the provisions in the ACA
for increasing the number of rural training positions. Since the characteristics of new pro-
grams are not known, I increase the number of positions in existing rural programs. This can
be thought of as creating copies of existing programs via grants funded by the ACA. The …nal
intervention combines the two by …rst increasing the number of positions at existing rural
programs followed by decreasing the number of positions in urban programs proportionally.
In all counterfactuals, the number of residents and observed characteristics are the same as
in the dataset. Consequently, the second intervention has signi…cantly more positions than
programs.
    Panel C of Table 12 presents the estimated e¤ects of these policy interventions. Since
a policy that reduces the number of positions o¤ered at urban programs displaces residents
from urban areas, it mechanically increases the number of residents matching at rural pro-
grams. However, the sorting e¤ects of these changes are not a priori clear. A naive reasoning
may lead to the conclusion that caps have a large adverse impact on the quality of residents
training at rural programs because displaced residents are disproportionately less desired by
the programs they are matched to. However, residents displaced from urban programs in
turn displace others, resulting in overall resorting. According to estimates from both models,
the distribution of resident quality matching at rural programs is similar to the distribution
before the caps.
    A major, perhaps not surprising, impact of the caps is the loss in private welfare of resi-
dents from the decreased availability of positions. This decrease results in a similar number
of additional residents in rural programs as a $5,000 …nancial incentive. However, price in-
centives result in an overall gain for residents in addition to the transfer. The observation
suggests that quantity regulations are a blunt policy instrument that do not target residents
with the least dislike for rural positions.
    Column (ii) presents the impact of increasing the number of positions in rural residency
programs by two each. This policy signi…cantly increases the number of residents matched
to rural programs and also results in an increase in the quality of residents in rural areas. As
compared to outcomes prior to the policy, the typical residents assigned to a rural program is
7 percentage points more likely to have a higher human capital index than a resident matched
to an urban program. The change in quality of residents in rural areas is due to increases in
the number of residents matched at the highest quality rural programs but decreases in the
number of residents matched at low quality residency programs in urban and rural areas.
Although not considered here, entry of additional residents into the family residency market
could mitigate adverse e¤ects of un…lled positions.
    Finally, the third policy combines the other two and, by construction, has a large e¤ect


                                              46
on the number of residents placed in rural programs. As compared to a singular increase
in positions o¤ered in rural areas, this policy can adversely a¤ect the quality of residents
assigned to rural programs. The reason is that residents with a low human capital are forced
into undesirable residency positions that were earlier left vacant under an increase in rural
positions.


9.3    Discussion
Many regulations target an activity in which levels alone determine social bene…ts. In the
context of residency training and other matching markets, a social planner may be concerned
about the type of resident training in a rural area in addition to the total number of residents.
For instance, if retention is an important goal, we may prefer a policy that yields residents
with higher intrinsic preference for rural areas in rural training locations. The costs imposed
on urban programs by these interventions are yet another factor that may in‡uence optimal
policy design. The analysis presented here sheds light on general equilibrium sorting impacts
of interventions that should be considered when designing policy towards rural training.
    The exercise also illustrates the ability of the model to understand policy interventions in
matching markets more broadly. In settings where sorting may be an important consideration
in policy decisions, the methods developed in this paper are a natural tool for analysis.
There are perhaps other equally important factors in‡uencing policy choices, such as the
endogenous decisions of participating in the market or setting salaries. It may be possible
to use an appropriately augmented version of this model to incorporate such decisions. In
this study, I hold these decisions held …xed to narrowly focus on the direct e¤ects of studied
interventions.


10      Conclusion
Two key features of two-sided matching markets are that agents are heterogeneous and that
highly individualized prices are often not used. Both properties have important implications
for equilibrium outcomes because assignments are determined by the mutual choices of agents
rather than price-based market clearing. A quantitative analysis of policy interventions may
therefore require estimates of preferences on both sides of the market.
    When data on stated preferences is available, extensions of discrete choice methods can
provide straightforward techniques for analysis (see Hastings, Kane, and Staiger, 2009; Ab-
dulkadiroglu, Agarwal, and Pathak, 2014, among others). A common constraint is that
only data on employer-employee matches or student enrollment records, rather than stated

preferences, are available. This paper develops empirical methods for recovering preferences
of agents in two-sided markets with low frictions using only data on …nal matches. I use
pairwise stability together with a vertical preference restriction on one side of the market
to estimate preference parameters using the method of simulated moments. The empirical
strategy is based on using sorting patterns observed in the data and information available
only in many-to-one matching. Sorting patterns alone cannot be used identify the parame-
ters of even a highly simpli…ed model with homogeneous preferences on both sides of the
market.
    These methods allow me to empirically analyze two important issues concerning the
market for medical residents. First, I address the academic debate on whether centralization
in this market causes low salaries. A stylized model shows that a limited supply of desirable
residency positions can depress salaries even under frictionless competitive negotiations.
Residents’ willingness to pay for desirable programs results in average salaries that are at
least $23,000 lower than levels suggested by a perfect competition model. Models using wage
instruments result in imprecise but higher estimated markdowns, of about $43,000. These
markdowns are due to an implicit tuition that can explain the gap between incomes of medical
residents and physician assistants, and also the empirical observations of Niederle and Roth
(2003, 2009). The result suggests that the limited supply of heterogeneous residency positions
is the primary cause of low salaries, and weighs against the view the match is responsible
for low resident salaries.
    Second, I show that policy interventions aimed at encouraging rural training have im-
portant e¤ects on the sorting of residents. For this reason, price incentives and quantity
regulations are not equivalent policy instruments. Furthermore, the size, scope and design
of these interventions signi…cantly in‡uence the qualitative and quantitative e¤ects of these
interventions. While supply regulations are more e¤ective at increasing the number of resi-
dents in rural areas, …nancial incentives are able to speci…cally target residents that do not
signi…cantly dislike training in rural areas. Analyzing the general equilibrium e¤ects of both
interventions on residents’private welfare and the sorting of residents into rural areas needs
a complete model of market primitives.
    The methods and analysis in this paper can be extended in several directions. The re-
striction on the preferences of one side of the market could be relaxed in other markets if
the data contain information that would allow estimating heterogeneous preferences on both
sides of the market. For instance, it may have been possible to estimate heterogenous pref-
erences for residents if program characteristics that can plausibly be excluded from resident
preferences were observed. Future research in other matching markets could use data from
several markets in which the composition of market participants di¤ers in order to estimate


                                             48
heterogeneous preferences on both sides. These extensions must also confront methodological
hurdles arising from a multiplicity of equilibria are important in other matching markets.
   General equilibrium e¤ects of price and supply interventions are important in other
matching markets as well. For instance, tuition regulations in public universities and public
school reforms introducing new schools or shutting down under-performing schools also a¤ect
the sorting of students. There are also additional e¤ects of these policies on other endoge-
nous choices such as entry decisions and price or capacity setting. In future research, I plan
to use theoretical and empirical tools to further investigate these interventions in matching
markets.

     Notes: Details on the construction of variables provided in the data appendix. A resident is classi…ed as rural born if her city of birth is not in an
     MSA. City of birth data is unreliable for about 7.3% residents - rural born is coded as missing for these residents. Country of birth is not known for
     14.6% of residents, and are treated as foreign graduates not born in the US.

     Notes: Linear regression of average characteristics of peers on the characteristics of a resident. A peer of a resident is another resident matched to
     the same program as that resident in the academic cohort of said resident. The calculation of peer averages for a resident excludes the resident
     herself. Samples pooled from the academic years 2003-2004 to 2010-2011. Column (1) restricts the sample to the set of residents with at least one
     peer that graduated from a medical school with non-zero NIH funding. Column (2) restricts the sample to the set of residents with at least one peer
     that graduated from a medical school with non-missing MCAT Score. Peer averages for columns (1) and (2) are constructed only from peers with
     non-missing observations of these characteristics. Columns (3-5) considers all residents with at least one peer. All speci…cations have medical school
     type dummies and a dummy for residents graduating from MD medical schools without NIH funding. See data appendix for description of variables.

     Notes: Regression of a program’s …rst year salary on program characteristics. Location characteristics include median age (county), log median
     household income (county), log total population (MSA/county), violent crime and property crime rates from FBI’s Crime Statistics/UCR (25 mi
     radius weighted by 1/distance), dummies for no data in that radius and log college share (MSA/rest of state). Columns (2-7) include dummy
     variables for programs with no NIH funding at major a¢ liates, for no NIH funding at minor a¢ liates, and a dummy for missing Medicare ID for the
     primary institution. All columns include a constant term. The Competitor Salary (Lagged) is the average of lagged salaries of other family practice
     residency programs in the geographic area of the program hospital. Therefore, columns (4) and (6) exclude data from the …rst year of the sample,
     2003-2004. The Competitor Reimbursement is a weighted average of the Medicare primary care per resident amounts of institutions in the
     geographic area of a program other than the primary institutional a¢ liate of the program. Geographic area de…ned as in Medicare DGME
     payments: MSA/NECMA or Rest of State unless less than 3 other observations constitute the area, in which case the census division is used. See
     data appendix for description of variables and details on the construction of the reimbursement variables. For columns (5-7), a program’s
     reimbursement rate is truncated below at $5,000 and a dummy for these 46 truncated observations is estimated as well. Standard errors clustered at
     the program level in parenthesis. Sample in all columns restricted to programs for which salary was not imputed from the regressions described in
     the data appendix. Signi…cance at 90% (*), 95% (**) and 99% (***) con…dence.

Notes: Detailed estimates and other models using instruments in Table B.1. Results from Panel A
estimates monetized in dollars (normalize wage coe¢ cient to 1). Panel A.1 presents the dollar equivalent
for a 1 standard deviation change in a program characteristic. All columns include median rent in county,
Medicare wage index, indicator for zero NIH funding of major associates and for minor associates. Column
(4) includes own reimbursement rates and the control variable. All speci…cations normalize the mean
utility from a program with zeros on all characteristics to 0. In all speci…cations, the variance of
unobservable determinants of the human capital index of MD graduates is normalized to 1. All
speci…cations normalize the mean human capital index of residents with zeros for all characteristics to 0
and include medical school type dummies. Point estimates using 1000 simulation draws. Standard errors in
parenthesis. Optimization and estimation details described in an appendix.

Notes: In Panel C, Column (i) decreases the urban positions in proportion to program size, subject to
integer constraints. Positions at urban programs were reduced in proportion until further reductions would
yield a greater number of residents than programs. In column (i), this yielded 32 more positions than
residents. In column (iii), the number of residents equals the number of positions. All simulations use 2010
- 2011 sample with 3,148 residents and 3,297 total number of positions. Baseline and counterfactual
simulations using 100 draws of structural unobservables. Inter-quartile range in parenthesis. Prob. X > Y
is the Wilcoxian statistic: probability that the human capital population X is drawn from is greater than
that of the population that Y is drawn from.

       Figure 3: Model Fit: Simulated vs. Observed Match Quality by Resident Bins




Notes: To construct this scatterplot, I used model estimates from speci…cation (1) to …rst obtain the
predicted quality on observable dimensions of the residents and of the programs. Quality for the program
is the "vertical component" zj for the programs. The residents were binned into 10 categories, starting
with Foreign graduates, US born foreign graduates and Osteopathic graduates and seven quantile bins for
MD graduates. Resident bins are constructed from pooling the sample across all years. The seven MD bins
are approximately equally sized, except for point masses at the cuto¤s. The horizontal axis plots observed
mean standardized quality of program that residents from each bin matched with. The vertical axis plots
the model’s predicted mean standardized quality of the program that a resident in each bin is matched
with. An observation is de…ned at the bin-year level. Simulated means using the observed distribution of
agent characteristics and 100 simulations of the unobserved characteristics. The 90% con…dence set for the
out-of-sample data is constructed from these 100 simulations.
