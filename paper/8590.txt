The Empirical Frequency of a Pivotal Vote

NBER Working Paper No. 8590
November 2001
JEL No. D72



                                               ABSTRACT


        Empirical distributions of election margins are computing using data on U.S. Congressional and
state legislator election returns. We present some of the first empirical calculations of the frequency of
close elections, showing that one of every 100,000 votes cast in U.S. elections, and one of every 15,000
votes cast in state elections, “mattered” in the sense that they were cast for a candidate that officially tied
or won by one vote. Very close elections are more rare than the independent binomial model predicts.
The evidence also suggests that recounts, and other margin-specific election procedures, are quite relevant
determinants of the frequency of a pivotal vote.
        Although moderately close elections (winning margin of less than ten percentage points) are more
common than landslides, the distribution of moderately close U.S. election margins is approximately
uniform. The distribution of state legislature election margins is clearly monotonic, with closer margins
more likely, except for very close and very lopsided elections. We find an inverse relationship between
election size and the frequency of one vote margins in both data sets over a wide range of election sizes,
with the exception of the smallest U.S. elections for which the frequency increases with election size.

       How often are civic elections decided by one vote? This question has been asked
numerous times in the economics literature and results derived from economic and statistical
models of voting have been offered as answers (eg., Beck 1975, Goode and Mayer 1975, Margolis
1977, Chamberlain and Rothschild 1981, Fischer 1999). The purpose of this paper is to carefully
compute empirical frequencies of close elections for the first time, and compare the empirical
frequencies predicted by some economic and statistical models.
       Perhaps it is common knowledge that civic elections are not often decided by one vote.1
But the costs of voting are often small, so a precise calculation of the frequency of a pivotal vote
can contribute to our understanding of how many, if any, votes might be rationally and
instrumentally cast. Furthermore, the distribution of electoral outcomes offers some information
about the validity of various models of voting. For example, two economic theories of voting
suggest that close elections should be more common than predicted by statistical models. One
suggests that competing candidates try to position themselves near or at the preferences of the
median voter, which makes close elections especially likely. The swing voter theory suggests
that voters themselves attempt to make elections close, so that the “right” voters are pivotal.
       Perhaps our data are consistent with the view that elections are never decided by a single
vote, because election procedures are margin-specific in such a way that the final election returns
determining the winning candidate might never exhibit a margin of zero or one votes. More
work needs to be done to understand exactly how election returns are calculated, but our study
suggests that such procedures are of potential theoretical importance.
       Our paper begins by introducing the set of elections studied, and providing an overview

        Although the Federal Election Commission appears to claim otherwise: “‘Just’ one
vote can and often does make a difference in the outcome of an election.”

of the returns in those elections. Section II then calculates frequencies of pivotal votes, for the
sample as a whole and as a function of election size. Section III compares the empirical
frequencies to probabilities calculated in the theoretical literature. Section IV looks at some of
the very close elections in some detail and suggest that elections may never be decided by a single
vote. Section V concludes.


I. Data
       Two data sets are used. The first is vote counts for elections to the United States House
of Representatives for the election years 1898-1992 (hereafter “US returns”). The second is state
legislative election returns in the United States for the years 1968-89 (hereafter “STATE
returns”).
       US returns are reported electronically in ICPSR study #6311, and are divided into two
samples. One sample is the “exceptions file,” containing those 839 U.S. House elections where
a minority candidate won, or a Democrat was not opposed by a Republican, or a Republican was
not opposed by a Democrat. These 839 elections are omitted from our tabulations. Another 3228
elections were omitted for which vote counts for Democrat or Republican were omitted (7), zero
(3081), or otherwise uncontested (140), leaving 16577 US returns for analysis.
       STATE returns are reported electronically in ICPSR study #8907. We analyze only
contested general elections in both single- and multi-member districts, except for those in multi-
member free-for-all districts of which there are 5785. Of the remaining elections, 2,478 are
reported as having missing votes (at either the candidate or election level) are which are
excluded. Of the remaining 51,262 elections, 11,047 are coded as being uncontested, and another
179 are de facto uncontested once vote totals for candidates with similar names have been
combined. This leaves 40,036 elections included in the analysis.2

       2
         As a further check for missing elections, we examined the chronological intervals
between elections for each district. If the intervals between elections were spaced irregularly
then these districts were flagged for further inspection. Of the 59,525 general elections in the
database, we found that there were 1495 chronological "gaps." Upon inspection of these gaps
we found that 586 were cases in which a senate election was held at a two year interval rather
than the usual four year interval; 280 were due to specially ordered state-wide elections; 129
were due to redistricting (e.g., changing from a single-member district to a multi-member
district with positions); leaving 24 for which we found no explanation in either the raw data
                                                                                       Pivotal – 3


       As reported by the ICPSR, New York STATE candidates running under multiple party
labels are listed multiple times, with their votes under each label listed separately. Since the
election outcome depends each candidate’s votes under all labels, we aggregated vote totals, in
each district and for each post, by name. In 173 cases (out of 93,142 candidate records for the
national sample of 40,036 elections satisfying the above selection criteria), we assume that names
spelled very similarly were the same candidate. We compute the election margin as the number
of votes cast for the winner with the least votes (usually, but not always, there was one winner)
minus the number of votes cast for the loser with the most votes.
       Summary statistics for both samples are displayed in Table 1. The US returns are for
many more years, as compared to STATE returns, but many fewer districts each year. The
median election in both samples is not close by any definition; the margin is 22% or 25% of total
votes cast. STATE elections are substantially smaller, both in terms of total votes cast and
absolute margins. The STATE distribution of total election votes seems to be more skewed than
the US distribution, with the STATE average total votes 1.7 times median total votes (compare
with 1.1 times for US elections).

all three were verified to be special cases when elections were not held.

     19 districts were omitted in 1988 because votes were not reported for the Democratic or
 Republican candidate. 62 more districts were omitted because either Democratic or
 Republican received zero votes.


          Since the samples include several years, two rows in our table are provided to give the
reader some information about the cross-section dimension of our data. Those two rows are the
number of elections and districts sample in 1988, the most recent election year included in both
datasets. The STATE sample has about ten times more districts in its typical cross section than
does the US sample. We also see that each district has exactly one election in 1988.


II. The Empirical Distribution of Election Returns


          Before comparing the returns data with particular voting theories, we first present the
                                                                                         Pivotal – 5


overall relationship between election margin and frequency. We then offer some calculations
of the empirical frequency of a pivotal vote, and how that frequency varies with election size.


II.A. The Overall Relationship between Margin and Frequency
       Figure 1a shows how the modal percentage US election margin (ie, the absolute election
margin divided by the sum of votes cast for Democratic and Republican candidates) is four or
five percent.3 Beyond four or five percent, the density of percentage election margin appears to
decline monotonically. Interestingly, as we look closer at the density in the range 0-4 percent,
as in Figure 1b, the density seems to be pretty near uniform except exactly at zero. Looking
closer still at elections decided by less than 100 votes (Figure 1c), margins of less than 25 seem to
be particularly rare.
       Figure 2a shows how the STATE distribution of percentage election margins is bimodal,
with one mode near zero and another near 100%.4 The distribution appears broadly uniform for
elections decide by less than 10%. Looking closer still at elections decided by less than 100 votes,
perhaps margins of less than 25 are more rare, although this is not as noticeable as with the US
elections. Figure 2d shows margins for STATE elections decided by less than 20 votes, and
suggests that margins of less than 5 are the most rare.


II.B. What is a Pivotal Vote?
       To begin, we refer to a “pivot election” as one in which the winner’s official and final
vote total exceeded the loser’s official and final vote total by no more than one vote. A “pivotal
vote” is a vote cast for the winner in a pivot election, or cast for either candidate in a tied
election. In other words, a “pivotal vote” is one for which it appears an election outcome would
have been different if it had been cast differently.
       Our defining “pivotal vote” may seem to be unnecessary, and verbose. But one
contribution of our paper is to present some facts suggesting that, even when the official and


       3
       If uncontested elections had been included, 100% would have been the modal
percentage margin.
       4
        Uncontested elections are omitted from the sample, but the histogram shows how
there quite a few barely contested elections.

final returns are known, whether or not the election was a pivot election is unclear because the
procedures for determining the official and final returns are both unclear and margin-specific.
We discuss this in some detail in Section IV, and for now stick with our definition above. For
now, we also assume that the vote totals reported in the ICPSR studies are official and final.
       Most economic models of voting assume that voters treat their vote as if it had
instrumental value, and therefore cast for the candidate whose policies are expected to yield the
voter higher income or utility. Pivot elections are interesting because those are the elections in
which, at least with perfect foresight, a vote indeed had instrumental value. Of course, a voter
typically does not know the precise election returns before he casts his ballot, so a pivot election
is only a subjective probability from his point of view, and the expected instrumental value of
his vote the product of that probability and the instrumental value of a vote cast in a pivot
election. Presumably this probability varies across votes, because those votes are cast in elections
of different sizes and different expected closeness and, within elections, cast by different voters
with perhaps different assessments of the probability.
       It would be nice to know how the subjective probability of a pivotal vote varies according
to election and voter characteristics. We attempt to empirically describe some of those
variations, but we begin by calculating the empirical frequency of a pivotal vote in our STATE
and US elections samples. If subjective probabilities are unbiased, this empirical frequency
might be interpreted as an estimate of the average subjective probability in the population of
elections with similar election and voter characteristics as those in our samples.


II.C. Calculations of the Frequency of a Pivotal Vote
       Of the 16577 US returns analyzed, only one (1/16577=0.00006) was decided by a single
vote.5 41369 votes were cast in that election, or a 0.00002 share of all of the votes in the US
elections analyzed.6 Two others were decided by 4 votes, one by 5, and two by 9 votes. All 16577


       5
         That election was in 1910 for the Representative for New York’s 36th congressional
district, with the Democratic candidate winning 20685-20684. See Section IV for more
details on this and other apparently pivot elections.
       6
        Of course, 20684 of those votes “did not matter” in the sense that they were cast for
the losing candidate, so we are left with a 0.00001 share of all of the votes in U.S. elections
                                                                                       Pivotal – 7


(16571/16577=0.9996) others were decided by at least 14 votes. Of the 40036 STATE elections
(with almost one billion votes) analyzed, two were tied and seven were decided by a single vote
(9/40036=0.0002). 61,328 votes were cast in those nine elections, or a 0.00006 share of all of the
votes in the STATE elections analyzed.
       These calculations do not make use of two dimensions of the data that are potentially
informative about the subjective probability of a pivotal vote: the frequency of “close” (but not
as close as 10 votes) elections and relationships between margins and election size. With a simple
model of the probability of a pivotal vote, we can use results from other close – but not pivot –
elections to increase the precision of our estimates. For example, suppose that the subjective
probability of margin m is independent of m for m 0 [1,M], for M very small relative to total votes
cast,7 and that the probability of a tied election is half of that.8 Then two estimates of the
frequency of a pivotal vote (ie, the probability of m=0 or m=1) are of interest, q and p:

                         j [ x i(M) % xi(0)]                          j vi [ x i(M) % xi(0)]

         In elections with thousands of votes cast, it seems that voters cannot, before the votes
are tallied, have a much different subjective probability for the outcome of m=1 or m=2, or
m=3, etc. Can a voter in an election with 1000 votes really claim to know that the outcome
504-496 any more (or less) likely than 502-408? Hence, as long as M is small relative to total
votes cast, we assume the subjective probability of margin m is independent of m for m 0
[1,M].

        With an even number v of voters, there only one way Democrat and Republican can
tie (namely, both get v/2), but two ways they can differ by two votes (namely, D gets (v/2)-1,
or (v/2)+1), two ways they can differ by four votes (namely, D gets (v/2)-2, or (v/2)+2), etc.
When v is odd, there are two ways to differ by one vote, two ways to differ by three votes,
etc.

are 1.5/(M+1) times a ratio of sums. q’s ratio of sums is the sample frequency of elections with
margin less than or equal to M, counting tied elections twice, and dividing this ratio by (M+1)
gives us an estimate of the probability that an election is decided by exactly, say, 1 vote.
Multiplying by 3/2 yields an estimate that an election is either decided by 1 or decided by 0 votes.
For example, if M = 9, we have q(M) = (3/20)(90/40036)=0.0003 in the STATE returns data
because there are 86 elections decided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 votes and two tied elections,
which means, in expectation, 9 (=90/10) elections would be decided by exactly 1 vote, 9 by
exactly 2 votes, 9 by exactly 9 votes, and 9 by exactly 4 votes – or 13.5 (=9*3/2) elections decided
by exactly 0 or one votes.


       p differs from q in only that it weights by votes cast in the election. Hence, while q is an
estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen election will be decided by zero or one votes,
p is an estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen ballot is cast in an election decided by
zero or one votes. Hereafter, we refer to q as the “unweighted frequency” and p as the “vote-
weighted frequency.”
       If all sample elections had the same number of votes cast, it would be straightforward to
compute standard errors for p and q, since both are averages of a binomial variable x. But sample
elections do vary in size, so we need to say something about how x’s success probability – ie, the
probability of margin m for some m 0 [1,M] – varies with election size v. Consider two possible
assumptions: (a) the probability of margin m is independent of v and (b) the probability of
margin m varies inversely with v. In either case, it is straightforward to compute the standard
error, or t-ratio, of q or p. With assumption (a), the expression for q’s t-ratio tq(M) is quite
intuitive.

The same is true for p with assumption (b), in which case we denote the t-ratio as tp(M). In both
cases, because p and q are so much less than one, the squared t-statistic can be very closely
approximated by a product of two terms. The first term is the expected number of elections
(unweighted for q, and vote weighted for p, and counting tied elections twice) where the margin
is less than or equal to M. The second term is a function of M only, and is approximately one.
Hence, the confidence intervals for p and q can, relative to those for p(1) and q(1), be shrunk
substantially by assuming the probability of a margin m does not vary on [1,M], even for M quite
small, and thereby including more “close” elections in the calculation. For example, for M = 1
we have only 7 close STATE elections, but we have 92 for M = 10 and 196 for M = 20.
       Figures 3a and 3b graph p(M) and q(M) vs M for the STATE data, and also display 95%
p and q confidence intervals as p(M)[1 ± 2/tp(M)] and q(M)[1 ± 2/tq(M)], respectively. We see
that p and q rise with M for M between 0 and 50, which is another version of what we see from
the histograms (Figures 1 and 2), namely that margins of 0 - 4 are substantially less like than, say,
margins of 20-24. We also see the confidence intervals shrink with M but, given the sensitive
of p and q to M for M less than 10, perhaps the increased confidence is not enough to justify using
M larger than 4.
       There are at least 2 STATE elections with margin m, for any m 0 [1,50], but there are
much fewer very close US elections. For example, there were no US elections that tied, or were
decided by 2, 3, 6, 7, or 8 votes. Hence a much larger M is needed to estimate the frequency of
a pivotal vote from the US sample with some confidence. Figures 4a and 4b graph p(M) and
q(M) vs M for the US data on M 0 [0,100], and also display 95% p and q confidence intervals. M
does not affect the point estimates as noticeably as in the STATE sample.

       In calculating the confidence intervals for our estimate of the average subjective
probability in the population of elections with similar election and voter characteristics as those
in our samples, we assume a form of “independence” across elections. More specifically, we
assume that, in a set of elections with the same election and voter characteristics, the factors
determining whether or not one of those elections has m # M are independently determined
across elections.   Perhaps the more interesting inference regards the average subjective
probability in a subpopulation of elections, such as the group of elections with 10,000 votes cast,
to which we turn below.

II.D. The Frequency of a Pivotal Vote as a Function of Election Size
         Figures 3a and 3b suggest that using M larger than 4 may be misleading, but there were
only 29 STATE and 3 US elections decided by a margin of 4 or less, so only a little can be said
about the relationship between election size and the frequency of pivotal vote without
considering M > 4. For example, we can divide the STATE sample into 3 subsamples, with equal
numbers of elections, by total votes in the election and compute q separately for each subsample.
Table 2 reports the results:

                   Table 2: Pivot Election Frequency by Election Size (STATE)

Not surprisingly, we see that the frequency of a pivotal vote falls with election size, and the
differences across STATE subsamples are statistically significant (standard errors for q(4), Fq(4),
are reported in the end-to-last column). Interestingly, the relationship does not appear to be 1/v,
where v is total votes cast in the election. For example, the average election in the medium
subsample is almost 3 times as large as the average small election, but the unweighted frequency
of a pivotal vote is only 2/3 as large, and the weighted frequency only 3/4 as large. 1/v also
misses the differences between the medium and large subsamples, although in the other
direction, where votes differ by a factor of 3.6 and pivotal frequencies by a factor of 10 or more.
However, it should be noted that q or p of 0.5 is not outside the confidence interval for the large
subsample.
         To analyze more subtle relationships between election size and the frequency of a pivotal
vote, we need to expand M beyond 4. We set M = 100 for the STATE sample, so that there are
                                                                                        Pivotal – 15


996 elections with m < M, and make 50 equally sized subsamples by total votes. Estimates of q,9
and a confidence interval for q are displayed in Figure 5, as functions of election size, for each of
the 50 subsamples. Both axes are on a logarithmic scale, and the relationship is apparently linear
with slope equal to -1, so the probability of pivotal vote appears to vary with 1/v rather than e-v.
Figure uses M = 100, and suggests a different functional form for the relationship between q and
M than suggested by Table 2, which uses M = 4.

       We set M = 500 for the US sample, so that there are 304 elections with m < M, and make

      Since elections are grouped by total votes, any subsample’s weighted (p) and
unweighted (q) frequencies are very similar.

34 subsamples by total votes.10 Estimates of q, and a confidence interval for q are displayed in
Figure 6, as functions of election size, for each of the subsamples. Both axes are on a logarithmic
scale. Notice that the US sample has larger elections than the STATE sample, with little overlap
in terms of total votes cast between Figures 5 and 6. For elections with more than 30,000 or
40,000 votes, the U.S. relationship between pivot election frequency and total votes cast is
apparently linear with slope equal to -1, as with the STATE elections. However, the frequency
of a pivot US election increases with total votes cast for elections smaller than 30,000 or 40,000
votes.11 We speculate that the increase is due to a large response of voter turnout to closeness,
but leave verifying our conjecture to future research.




       10
            The subsamples are not equally sized, but rather are larger with more total votes.
       11
        The increase over that range can also be seen if we set M=100, or smaller.

            Figure 6 Frequency of a Pivot US Election, as a function of Votes Cast
       One practical use of the frequencies calculated in Figures 5 and 6 is to estimate the
average subjective probability for an election of a particular size. It should be noted that, for this
purpose, the standard errors calculated in Table 2, Figure 5, and Figure 6 require a form of
“independence” across elections. More specifically, we assume that, in our sample of elections
with the same turnout, the factors determining whether or not one of those elections has m # M
were independently determined across elections. Might it be that there are, say, district effects
on closeness conditional on turnout, so that our independence assumption is violated because we
have multiple elections from the same district? This is hard to gauge with our data because there
are not so many close elections in our data, but the cross-district incidence of uncontested
elections suggests yes. Namely, conditional on voter turnout, some districts are more like to
                                                                                             Pivotal – 18


have an uncontested election.12 Hence we suggest that readers interpret our confidence intervals
with some caution.


III. Modeling Votes as Independent Binomial Variables
III.A. Theoretical Calculations of the Probability of a Pivot election


        The most common voting model in the literature used to study the probability of a
pivotal vote might be called the “independent binomial” model. The model election is between
two candidates, say, Democrat and Republican. There is a fixed number of voters v. A vote for
the Democrat is denoted z=1 and for z=0 the Republican. Denoting as zj the vote of the jth voter
(j 0 {1,...,v}), the election margin is (as a share of total votes cast):

                                                      j zj
                                               /0 2           & 1 /0
                                                0                  0
                                                      j

                                                          v




Modeling each vote as independently drawn from a binomial distribution with “success
probability” A, the sum (ie, aggregate Democrat votes) is the sum of i.i.d. binomial variables
with expectation vA and variance A(1-A)v. The expected Democratic percentage margin is A-(1-
A) = 2A-1.
        Computing the probability that Democrat votes total exactly v/2 is straightforward,
although extremely tedious and difficult to relate precise to one of the key parameters, v:


                     Pr j zj ' v / 2 /0 A , v even
                                                                       v
                                      00
                                                                 '           Av/2 (1&A)v/2            (1)
                        j                                              v/2



        12
          About half of our 40,036 STATE elections have an election margin of less than 25%
of the total votes cast. Among these, the 5040 district-office fixed effects predict 30% of the
variance of the percentage margin, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.06. The F-statistic is 1.27
for the null hypothesis that district-office fixed effects have no joint predictive power, with
critical value 1.00. These calculation ignore the bias involved with selecting elections based
on their percentage margin, but suggests that district-office fixed effects are of some limited
help in predicting closeness.

This is the probability of a pivotal vote conditional on the success probability A. Whether or
not voters know the success probability has been discussed in the literature (eg., Good and
Mayer 1975, Chamberlain and Rothschild 1981, Fischer 1999), and in the later case the probability
(from the perspective of a voter) is computed by integrating (1) over a prior distribution F for
A:


                    Pr j zj ' v / 2 /0 v even
                                                     1
                                                         v
                                     00              m v/2
                                                '            Av/2 (1&A)v/2dF(A)                     (2)
                       j
                                                     0




Of course, we do not know A for any one of our 56,613 elections, let alone know what voters in
each election knew about A. But, in order to generate predictions for the occurrence of pivot
elections in our data, the relevant calculation is functionally equivalent to a voter’s: integrate
over a prior distribution for A. The only difference is in the interpretation, with the voter’s
having expectations about A for his election, and our having priors for the distribution of A
across elections.
       Interestingly, not much has to be known about F to compute the unconditional
probability of a pivotal vote, because (2)’s integrand can be neglected everywhere except in the
neighborhood of A = ½. So (2) simplifies to (3):


          Pr j zj ' v / 2 /0 v even
                                                     1

where f is the density function corresponding to F.
       (3) calculates the probability of a tied election conditional on an even number of votes.
Of course, this probability is literally zero when the number of votes is odd. But, with v odd, (3)
does calculate half of the probability that the election margin is exactly one (either in favor of
Democrat or of Republican) so, heuristically, we can compute the probability of a pivot election

The probability of a pivotal vote is just (3) because only half of the votes in a pivot election with
odd total votes are pivotal.
        The estimates reported in Figure 5 suggest that f(½) . 2. For example, Figure 5 shows
the frequency of a pivot election, for elections of size v = 20,000, to be 1/6000, so f(½) =
(1/6000)(2/3)(20001) . 2. The model seems sensible in this regard, since f(½) = 2 if, say, A were
uniformly distributed on [0.25,0.75].14
        However, there are two senses in which the binomial model overpredicts the frequency
of a pivotal vote. First, the independence assumption is presumably invoked merely for
convenience, and it seems natural that voters are subject to correlated influences. For example,
few if any voters are completely unique in terms of their economic situation, social network,
perceptions of the candidates, and other latent factors expressed in his vote. We leave it to
future research to work this out more carefully,15 but we suspect that the effective number of
voters is less than the actual number of voters v, so that (4) overpredicts the frequency of a




        13
         With an even number of total votes, the probability of a pivot election is
approximately twice (3). If even and odd total votes are equally likely, the probability of a
pivot election is approximately the average of (3) and twice (3).
        14
          As emphasized by Fisher (1999), the formula (3) yields a very different estimate then,
say, (1) evaluated at some average percentage election margin. For example, setting v =
100,000 and A = .61 (roughly the averages for the US sample), (1) yields an estimated
probability of a pivot election of 10-1108 (here I follow Margolis 1977 and others in the liteture
using the normal density to compute (1)). Compare 10-1108 to my US sample frequency of
0.00005.
        15
       Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman (1996) study a binomial model of crime, and
emphasize the relationship between sample size and crime rates as a test for independent
behavior – presumably there are analogous tests for independent voting behavior.

pivotal vote.16
         Second, we find f(µ) to be significantly larger than f(½) for µ quite close to ½. This is
seen in Figures 2c and 2d where the frequency of STATE elections decided by 0-4 votes is
significantly less than, say, the frequency of elections decided by 20-24 votes, and in Figures 3a
and 3b where estimates of q and p increase significantly when the largest margin M included in
the calculation is expanded beyond 4 or 5. We discuss these extensions of the binomial model
below.


III.B. Recounts and other Margin-Specific Election Procedures
         Election procedures are simple, and independent of margin, in the binomial model above.
In particular, votes are counted for both candidates, and the winner is the one with the highest
count. If election procedures are not independent of margin, this can affect our calculations of
pivot frequencies, and interpretations of those calculations. To see this, consider a illustrative
model of such procedures.
         In any particular election, votes z 0 {0,1} are indexed by j = 1,...,v – as in the binomial
model. However, these votes are initially measured by election officials with error, so that the
combined quantity (zj + gj) is observed, where gj 0 {-1,0,1} is a measurement error.17 Denoting the
true and initially observed absolute margins in the ith election as mi and m
                                                                           ^ i, respectively, we have:


                                       mi ' /0 2 j zj & v /0
                                             00 j          00


                                       m̂i ' /0 2 j (zj % gj) & v /0
                                              00 j                 00




         16
          For example, if husbands and wives always voted alike, but each household’s vote
were independent drawn from a binomial distribution, then the probability of a pivotal vote
is (1.5)f(½)/(2v+1) rather than (1.5)f(½)/(v+1).
         17
       Reasons for errors include vote machine errors, misplacement of ballots, and
judgements about the legality of particular ballot.
                                                                                       Pivotal – 22


If the initially observed margin exceeds gi in the ith election, then the official election margin
   ^ i. Otherwise, a “recount” is held to eliminate18 measurement errors, and the official margin
is m
is the true margin, mi . gi varies by election, because these procedures may depend on juridiction,
or on the willingness of candidates to demand (and pay for) a recount.
        Although this is a stylized model of margin-specific election procedures, it clearly reveals
how such procedures could reduced the frequency of close elections as measured by the official
                                                        ^ i > gi , but no “far” elections are
margin – some close elections are misclassified because m
misclassified as close. Furthermore, a vote can have (instrumental) value even the election in
which it was not cast in a pivot election (as we have defined it) because a single vote can affect
whether there is a recount, which in turn has some probability of changing the outcome of the
election.


III.C. Other Extensions of the Binomial Model
        There two types of extensions of the binomial model that may be relevant for
interpreting our findings. First, dependence across voters could be modeled. Such dependence
might be created by correlation in the latent factors affecting a person’s vote, or may affect
strategic interactions as in the “swing voter models” (eg., Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1996). A
second extension might allow for competition among candidates, competition which tends to
make an election close, and competition which may be (endogenously) more intense when the
election is close.
        Building and studying such models are beyond the scope of our paper, but we believe that
these models would produce frequencies of pivot elections that are closer than in the independent
binomial model. Hence, our calculations with the latter model may overstate a frequency of
pivot elections that more faithfully represents the various strategic and competitive phenomena
studied in economic theories of elections.


IV. Can a Vote Ever Be Pivotal?: Some Evidence on Margin-Specific Voting Procedures


        18
         This is for simplicity only. A more realistic model would have separate (nonzero)
measurement errors before and after recount, perhaps with a smaller variance after the
recount.
                                                                                      Pivotal – 23


IV.A. What Really Happened to the Ballots in the Pivot elections?
       The calculations above assume that the vote totals reported in the ICPSR studies are
official and final. Systematically verifying this assumption for each of our 56,613 elections is
beyond the scope of our project, but we have done some research that reflects on this
assumption. Namely, for those 10 elections coded as tied or decided by one vote, we searched for
newspaper articles written after the election to verify that the election was in fact close, and to
verify that the winner and vote margin were coded “correctly” in our file. Somewhat to our
surprise, we learned from these ten cases that the procedure for determining the winner may be
flexible and margin-specific, and report some of our findings in Table 3.
       We report in the fifth column the candidate vote totals as reported in the computer file
which, with one exception, we found (according to newspaper reports) to be the official vote
totals recorded with the state election commission. But, except in the five cases indicated in
bold, it was later and different vote totals, reported in the next Table 3 column, that determined
the winner of the election. Generally speaking, it seems that the counting of votes is not an
exact science and, much like the model above, exact counts are not attempted unless the official
(and error-ridden) margin is close. Reasons for errors include human arithmetic errors (as in the
federal election), vote machine errors, misplacement of ballots (especially mail-in),19 and
judgements about the legality of particular ballot. These later counts typically reveal a larger
margin of victory than officially recorded – as in four cases shown in the Table – and the official
counts are not adjusted when the winner does not change.




       19
         Mail in ballots are a problem because they are usually not counted and are sometimes
not filed according to the correct office, district, etc. Even when one of the races is close
enough to count, most others in the jurisdiction are not, and it usually is not know whether
one of the mail ins was misplaced with another district’s mail ins, which are not being
counted (Evening Bulletin, 18 Nov. 1970).

     the “late count” was from another election run two months later to break the tie
                                                                                       Pivotal – 25


       In one Rhode Island case, another election was held to break the originally “tied” election,
even though according to (our reading of) Rhode Island election law, rerunning the election is
not one of the legal options. Exhaustive legal research on the conduct of close elections is
beyond the scope of our paper, but perhaps one moral of the ten stories told in Table 3 is that
election procedures are flexible when official counts are close, and cannot be accurately modeled
as the simple counting of a fixed population of ballots without regards for the situations of the
candidates, their parties, and other legal and political factors. In other words, even when the
election is over, one cannot know for sure whether or not the outcome hinged on one vote.
       Up to this point, we have used the fifth “official” column to compute the frequency of
a pivot election. One alternative calculation is to substitute the sixth column for the fifth in
those ten cases where we have the data. In other words, rather than two ties and eight one-vote
victories in the combined data set of 56,613 elections (an unweighted pivot election frequency q(1)
= (10+2)/56613 = 0.0002), we have one tie and four one-vote victories (a frequency q(1) =
(5+1)/56613 = 0.0001). This is a 50% reduction in the unweighted frequency and, since 76% of the
votes analyzed in Table 3 were not cast in a pivot election according to the “latest” numbers, a
76% reduction in the vote-weighted frequency. On the other hand, we might have increased
these frequencies if we had verified official margins in some of the other 56,603 elections decided
by a margin of two or more votes.


IV.B. Dips in the Margin Density Near Zero
       Our bar graph 3b also suggests that voting procedures might be margin-specific, at least
in the STATE elections. Remember that 3b’s point estimates would be flat if the sample
frequency of vote margins were independent of the margin m in the neighborhood of a tie.
Instead, we see that the frequency is nearly 50% higher for m > 4 vs. m # 4, and noted above how
the frequency for m # 4 is still too high because the official vote totals are not those determining
the winners.
       Is the change in frequency with m due to the behavior of voters, or candidates? A
complete answer is beyond the scope of this paper, but it may be that the procedures similar to
those revealed by our newspaper investigations (which transformed the “official” counts to
                                                                                           Pivotal – 26


counts determining the winner) also played out before the official count was determined.20 In
other words, think of elections as being counted in three stages: a first count, which is followed
by an independent “official” count only if the first count is close, which is in turn followed by
an independent “latest” count only if the official count is close. If we had data on all three
counts, we would expect, in the first count, to find the frequency of any margin m to be
independent of m (for m small), but the find a dip near m=0 in the official count (as we did in
Figure 3b), and an even bigger dip in the “latest” count (as our Table 3 suggests).


V. Conclusions
        If we take the official counts as perfectly identifying pivotal votes, our empirical findings
are perhaps best summarized in reference to the binomial voting model that has been used in the
literature to calculate the probability of a pivotal vote. First, the frequency of a pivotal ballot (ie,
one cast for a winner in an election decided by one vote, or for either candidate in a tied
election), and its relationship with total votes v cast in the election, is closely approximated by
2/v, which is broadly consistent with a binomial model. Second, smaller U.S. Congressional
elections are an interesting exception to the 2/v rule, because the frequency of a pivotal ballot
appears to increase with total votes cast. Third, 2/v seems to be somewhat less than a reasonably
calibrated binomial model would predict and, because the frequency of (official) STATE election
margin m is smaller for m < 5 than for m $ 5. For example, only two STATE elections tied and
only 29 were decided by 1-4 votes while 39 were decided by 11-14 votes, 46 by 21-24 votes, 29 by
31-34 votes, 46 by 41-44 votes, 49 by 51-54 votes, etc.
        It might also be argued that the official counts do not accurately identify pivotal votes,
because officially close elections would be recounted. So, conditional on a recount, a pivotal vote
is one cast for a candidate winning by no more than one according to the recount. Some
preliminary investigation of recounts suggest that the frequency of a pivotal ballot would only
be 1/v, rather than 2/v, according to this definition. 1/v is perhaps a further departure from the
standard binomial model, although not from one what is modified to include margin-specific

        Indeed, our newspaper investigations revealed some cases of this, but we did not
sytematically report them in the Table since our objective was to calculate the sixth column.

pivotal (ie, the election might be decided by one vote in the final recount), but also the value of
a ballot in affecting the probability of recounts that would change the winner of the election.
       We believe that the theory of voting can be enhanced by fitting it to the empirical
distribution of election returns documented here, but we leave the theoretical analysis to future
research (Becker and Mulligan 1999 is one attempt). Perhaps some relevant questions are “Is the
Swing Voter Model consistent with the empirical frequency of swing votes?”, or “Can models
of candidate competition for votes explain the empirical distribution of election returns?” Future
empirical research could also investigate the prevalence of votes in uncontested elections – these
were omitted from our calculations but are conspicuous in our data and probably relevant to the
theory of voting.
