        Does America face an affordable housing crisis and, if so, why? This paper argues that in much
of America the price of housing is quite close to the marginal, physical costs of new construction. The
price of housing is significantly higher than construction costs only in a limited number of areas, such as
California and some eastern cities. In those areas, we argue that high prices have little to do with
conventional models with a free market for land. Instead, our evidence suggests that zoning and other
land use controls, play the dominant role in making housing expensive.

    I.       Introduction


A chorus of voices appears to unanimously proclaim that America is in the midst of an
affordable housing crisis? Andrew Cuomo asserted the existence of such a crisis in his
introduction to a March 2000 report which documents the continuing, growing crisis in
housing affordability throughout the nation. Indeed, Secretary Cuomo regularly justified
aggressive requests for funding by pointing to this crisis. Pro-poor advocacy groups such
as the Housing Assistance Council pepper their documents with assertions that “the
federal government should commit to a comprehensive strategy for combating the
housing affordability crisis in rural America.” Trade associations such as the National
Association of Home Builders decree that “America is facing a silent housing
affordability crisis.” The National Association of Realtors agrees: “there is a continuing,
growing crisis in housing affordability and homeownership that is gripping our nation.”


Does America actually face a housing affordability crisis? Are home prices high
throughout the United States, or are there just a few places where housing prices become
extreme? In those places that are expensive, why are home prices so high? Is subsidized
construction a sensible approach to solving this crisis relative to other, deeper reforms?
This paper examines whether America actually does face an affordable housing crisis.
We then focus on why housing is expensive in high price areas.


In general, housing advocates have confused the role of housing prices with the role of
poverty. Both housing costs and poverty matter for the well-being of American citizens,
but only one of these two factors is a housing issue. Certainly, the country should pursue
sensible anti-poverty policies, but if housing is not unusually expensive, these policies
should not be put forward as a response to a housing crisis.1 To us, a housing
affordability crisis means that housing is expensive relative to its fundamental costs of



1
  This is not to say that housing vouchers might not be a sensible part of an anti-poverty program.
However, if housing is not expensive, then these should be thought of as a response to poverty and not a
response to a housing affordability crisis.


                                                                                                           1
production, not that people are poor. As such, empirically we will focus entirely on
housing prices, not on the distribution of income.


A second conceptual issue that is key in thinking about the existence of a housing
affordability crisis is the relevant benchmark for housing costs. Affordability advocates
often argue for the ability to pay (i.e. some percentage of income) as a relevant
benchmark, but this again confuses poverty with housing prices. We believe that a more
sensible benchmark is the physical construction costs of housing. If we believe that there
is a housing crisis, then presumably the correct housing response will be to build more
housing. However, the social cost of that new housing can never be lower than the cost
of construction. As such, for there to be a “social” gain from new construction it must be
the case that housing is priced appreciably above the cost of new construction.


This argument is not meant to deny that the existence of poor people who cannot afford
housing is a major social problem. However, if housing does not cost appreciably more
than the cost of new construction, then it is hard to think why policies oriented towards
housing supply would be the right response to this problem. Hence, we focus on the gap
between housing costs and construction costs.


To look at the housing affordability issue, we use the R.S. Means Company’s data on
construction costs in various U.S. metropolitan areas (hereafter, the Means data). This
data gives us information (based on surveying construction companies) on costs of
building homes of various characteristics. As a basic number, the Means data suggests
that construction costs for the lowest of the four quality types they track (termed an
economy home) are about $60 per square foot. Construction costs for the next highest
quality type (termed an average home) are about $75 per square foot. Ultimately, we
compare this information with data on housing prices.


To get a better sense of the distribution of housing prices throughout the U.S., we will
turn to the American Housing Survey (AHS), but for a quick look at the affordability issue
it is useful to examine the 2000 Census. The Census reports that the self-reported median



                                                                                            2
home value is $120,000.2 Sixty-three percent of single-family detached homes in
America are valued at less than $150,000. Seventy-eight percent of these homes are
valued at less than $200,000. The American Housing Survey reports that the median size
of a detached owned home is 1704 square feet. Using the construction costs of an
average home, this implies that this home should cost about $127,500 to build, with a
lower quality economy home costing $102,000 to construct.3


Together these numbers provide us with the first important lesson from housing markets.
The majority of homes in this country are priced—even in the midst of a so-called
housing affordability crisis— at close to construction costs. The value of land generally
seems small—probably 20 percent or less of the value of the house. To us this means
that America as a whole may have a poverty crisis, but its housing prices are basically
being tied down by the cost of new construction. Unless state intervention can
miraculously produce houses at far less than normal construction costs, such programs
are unlikely to radically reduce the distribution of housing costs in America.


But if housing costs in the U.S. are so low, what about the horror stories? What about the
tear-downs going for millions in Palo Alto? What about the multi-million dollar
apartments in Manhattan? The American Housing Survey allows us to see the
distribution of house prices across the country. In addition, this source improves on the
census in that it provides much better information on housing characteristics. Thus, we
can better compare the self-reported value of the house with the cost of building the home
from scratch. When combined with the Means data, this source allows us to examine
housing prices in a wide range of cities, as well as the gap between these prices and new
construction costs.


These data suggest that America can be divided into three broad areas. First, there are a
number of places where housing is priced far below the cost of new construction. These

2
  Goodman and Ittner (1992) document that self-reported values tend to be about seven percent higher than
true sales prices.




                                                                                                        3
areas are primarily central cities in the Northeast and the Midwest, such as Detroit and
Philadelphia. These places were the subject of our previous work (Glaeser and Gyourko,
2001), and in these areas there is almost no new growth. In general, these places had
significant housing price appreciation over the 1990s, but values are still below
construction costs.


In large areas of the country, housing costs are quite close to the cost of new construction.
These places generally have robust growth on the edges of cities where land is quite
cheap. These areas represent the bulk of American housing, although they seem to be
somewhat underrepresented in the AHS.


Finally, there is a third category of cities and suburbs where the price of homes is much
higher than the cost of new construction. Manhattan and Palo Alto are two of these
places. Indeed, many of these places are in California, but the 1990s saw an increase in
the number of these areas in the Northeast and South as well. While there are a number
of areas with extremely expensive homes, they do not represent the norm for America.
However, both poor and non-poor people suffer from higher housing costs in such areas.


After first surveying housing costs within the U.S., we try to understand why the
expensive places have such high housing costs. It is noteworthy that we do not focus on
the housing demand side of this equilibrium. High cost places generally have either very
attractive local amenities (great weather or good schools) or strong labor markets. The
Rosen-Roback (1979, 1982) framework has proved useful in such studies, and one of us
(Gyourko and Tracy, 1991) has previously worked in that area.


Instead, we focus here on the role of housing supply. What is it that creates places where
the cost of housing is so much higher than the physical construction costs? We offer two
basic views. First, there is the classic economics approach which argues that houses are
expensive because land is expensive. According to this view, there is a great deal of

3
  Another relevant question is to look at changes over time. The Census reports a significant (15 percent)
increase in the median value of a home over the 1990s. However, when we look at repeat sales indices



                                                                                                             4
demand for certain areas, and land, by its very nature, is limited in supply. As such, the
price of housing must rise. Traditional models, such as the classic Alonso-Muth-Mills
framework, take this view.


Our alternative hypothesis is that homes are expensive in high cost areas primarily
because of government regulation, i.e. zoning. According to this view, housing is
expensive because of artificial limits on construction created by the regulation of new
housing. This view argues that there is plenty of land in high cost areas, and in principle
new construction might be able to push the cost of houses down to physical construction
costs. However, the barriers to building create a potentially massive wedge between
prices and building costs.


We present three pieces of evidence that attempt to differentiate between these two
hypotheses. First, we look at two different ways of valuing land. The first, classic way is
to use a housing hedonic and compare the price of comparable homes situated on lots of
different sizes. With these comparisons, we are, in principle, able to back out the value
that consumers place on larger lots. Our second methodology is to subtract the
construction cost from the home value and then divide by the number of acres. This
gives us another per acre value of land that is implied by the home price. The first or
hedonic methodology can be thought of as giving the intensive value of land—that is,
how much is land worth on the margin to homeowners. The second methodology gives
the extensive margin or how much it is worth to have a plot of land with a house on it.


The two hypotheses outlined above offer radically different predictions about the
relationship of these two values. The neoclassical approach suggests that land should be
valued the same using either methodology. After all, if a homeowner does not value the
land on his plot very much, he would subdivide and sell it to someone else. The
regulation approach suggests that the differences can be quite large. Empirically, we find
that the hedonic estimates produce land values that often are about ten percent of the



which control for housing quality, there is much less increase over the 1990s.


                                                                                              5
values calculated with the extensive methodology. We believe that this is our best
evidence for the critical role that zoning may play in creating high housing costs.


Our second empirical approach is to look at crowding in high cost areas. The
neoclassical approach tells us that if these are areas with a high cost of land, then
individuals should be consuming less land. The regulation approach argues that highly
regulated areas will have both large lots and high prices. Our evidence suggests that
there is little connection across areas between high prices and density. This again
suggests the critical role of regulation.


Our third approach is to correlate measures of regulation with the value of housing prices.
This approach is somewhat problematic because high values of land may themselves
create regulation. Nonetheless, we find a robust connection between high prices and
regulation. Almost all of the very high cost areas are extremely regulated—even though
they have fairly reasonable density levels. Again, we interpret this as evidence for the
importance of regulation.


As a whole, this paper concludes that America does not uniformly face a housing
affordability crisis. In the majority of places, land costs are low (or at least reasonable)
and housing prices are close to (or below) the costs of new construction. In the places
where housing is quite expensive, zoning restrictions appear to have created these high
prices.


One implication of this analysis is that the affordable housing debate should be
broadened to encompass zoning reform, not just public or subsidized construction
programs. While poor households almost certainly are not consuming the typical unit in
areas with extremely high prices, we suspect that any filtering model of housing markets
would show that they, too, would benefit from an increased focus on land use constraints
by affordability advocates.




                                                                                               6
All that said, we have done nothing to assess the possible benefits of zoning (well
discussed by Fischel, 1992, for example), so we cannot suggest that zoning should be
eliminated. However, we do believe that the evidence suggests that zoning is responsible
for high housing costs and, to us, this means that if we are thinking about lowering
housing prices, we should begin with reforming the barriers to new construction in the
private sector.


    II.      Housing Prices in the United States


We start with our analysis of housing prices across the U.S. This work follows the
methodology of Glaeser and Gyourko (2001). In this paper, we use the American
Housing Survey and the U.S. census to gather data on housing characteristics and values.
We use the R.S. Means data for construction costs. We then create measures relating
home prices to construction costs.


R.S. Means monitors construction costs in numerous American and Canadian cities. The
Means Company reports local construction costs per square foot of living area. The
Means data on construction costs include material costs, labor costs, and equipment costs
for four different qualities of single unit residences. No land costs are included.4


The Means data contain information on four qualities of homes—economy, average,
custom, and luxury. The data are broken down further by the size of living area (ranging
from 600ft2 to 3200ft2), the number of stories in the unit, and a few other differentiators.
We focus on costs for a one story, economy house, with an unfinished basement, with the
mean cost associated with four possible types of siding and building frame, and that
could be of small (<1550ft2), medium (1550ft2-1850ft2), or large (1850ft2-2500ft2) size in
terms of living area. Generally, our choices reflect low to modest construction costs.
This strategy will tend to overestimate the true gap between housing prices and

Data, 19th annual edition, (2000) and Square Foot Costs, 21st annual edition (2000), both published by the
R.S. Means Company.


                                                                                                             7
construction costs. If the relevant benchmark is an average quality unit, not an economy
quality unit, construction costs should generally be increased by about 20 percent.

The housing price data used in this paper to create the relationship between home prices
and construction cost comes from the American Housing Survey (AHS). We focus on
observations of single unit residences that are owner occupied, and exclude
condominiums and cooperative units in buildings with multiple units even if they are
owned.


Excluding apartments simplifies our analysis, but in some ways the connection between
construction costs and home prices is easier with apartments. In general, the marginal
construction cost of an apartment is the price of building up. For example, Means data
indicate that the price per square foot of building in a typical high rise of from 8 to 24
stories was nearly $110 per square foot in New York City in 1999.5 This implies that the
purely physical costs of construction for a new 1500 square foot unit in New York City is
about $166,500. Anyone familiar with the New York housing market knows that a large
number of Manhattan apartments trade at many multiples of this amount.


Because house price will be compared to construction costs, and the latter is reported on a
square foot basis, the house price data must be put in similar form. This is
straightforward for the AHS, which contains the square footage of living area. For every
single unit reported in the 1999 or 1989 AHS, we can then compute the ratio of house
value to construction costs (as long as it is in an area tracked in the Means data).6 From
this, we can calculate the distribution of homes priced above and below construction
costs and are able to do so for nearly 40 cities in both 1989 and 1999. We look at two
measures—first the share of housing in the area that costs at least 40 percent more than
new construction costs. These are the homes in the area where land is actually a
significant share of new construction costs. If the appropriate benchmark is an economy

5

  The actual computation is more complicated, as adjustments are made to correct for depreciation,
inflation, the fact that owners tend to overestimate the value of their homes, and for regional variation in
the presence of basements. See the Appendix for the details. In addition, we also performed the analysis
using the 1991 AHS and the results are virtually unchanged from those for 1989.


                                                                                                               8
home, then for these homes land is about 40 percent or more of the value. If the
appropriate benchmark is an average home, then for these homes land is approximately
20 percent of the value of the home. Our view is that homes below this cutoff are sitting
on relatively cheap land. We also calculate the share of homes with prices more than 10
percent below the cost of new construction.


Table 1 shows the distribution of homes—relative to construction costs—for the nation as
a whole and for the four main census regions. These data highlight that at last half of the
nation’s housing is less than 40 percent more expensive than economy quality home
construction costs, or no more than 20 percent more expensive than average quality home
construction costs. It also suggests that a large share of the nation’s housing has its price
roughly determined by the physical costs of new construction, as most of the housing
value is within 40 percent of physical construction costs. That said, the regional
breakdowns reported in Table 1 emphasize that much land in western cities looks to be
relatively expensive.


Figures 1 and 2 give an overall impression of the underlying data. In Figure 1, for central
cities, we have graphed the share of homes in the 1999 AHS with prices more than 40
percent above construction costs on the share of homes in the 1989 AHS with prices more
than 40 percent above construction costs. The straight line in the figure is the 45 degree
line. In Figure 2, we have repeated this for the suburban parts of the metropolitan areas.




Figure 1 makes two major points. First, there is a great deal of permanence in these
measures. The correlation coefficient between the 1989 and 1999 measures is 82 percent.
The average of this variable across central cities was 47.8 percent in 1989 and 50.2
percent in 1999, so it does not look like the 1990s was a watershed in housing price
changes. Second, there is a great deal of heterogeneity across places. A number of
places—primarily those in California—have almost no homes that cost less than 1.4
times construction costs. However, in a number of places almost all of the homes cost
less than this benchmark.



                                                                                             9
Figure 2 makes similar points. The correlation between the 1989 and 1999 measures is
lower, but remains high at 0.70. There is also heterogeneity across space in suburban
areas, but in general these places are more likely to have land values that are substantially
higher than construction costs. The unweighted mean across the 37 suburban areas was
61 percent in 1989 and 63 percent in 1999. We suspect that one reason for the higher
fractions of expensive housing is that suburban homes are newer and are likely to be of
high quality. A second reason is that suburban homes have more land and suburban land
is more expensive.


The data by local area also are shown in Tables 2 and 3. These exhibits also report the
share of the housing stock that is priced at least 10 percent below construction costs.
Across the U.S., there are many areas with extremely cheap housing. However, in this
sample only Philadelphia and Detroit have extremely large values of this measure in
1999.7 We should also note that previous work we have done using the 1990 census
suggests that there is more cheaper housing than indicated by the AHS. Our suspicion is
that the Census is more representative, but we leave further examination of these
discrepancies for later work.


However, our focus here is not on the cheap areas, but on the expensive ones. And, we
believe that this data confirms that there are some areas of the country that do, indeed,
have a dearth of affordable housing. Still, for much of the country prices are determined
by new construction costs. As discussed in the Introduction, for us this means that there
is not an affordable housing crisis in such areas. The problem there probably lies in the
labor market, not the land market. We now turn to trying to understand why home prices
are high in the areas that are expensive relative to construction costs.


   III.    Discussion: Demand for Land vs. Zoning




                                                                                            10
Housing prices are determined by both demand and supply concerns. High housing
prices must reflect high consumer demand for a particular area. However, they must also
reflect some sort of restriction on supply. Data from sources such as Means suggests that
physical houses can be supplied almost perfectly elastically. As such, the limits on
housing supply must come from the land component of housing. The usual urban
economics view of housing markets suggests that the restriction on housing supply is the
availability of land. Because land is ultimately inelastically supplied, this naturally
creates a limit to the supply of new housing at construction costs. An alternative view is
that land is itself fairly abundant, but that zoning authorities make new construction
extremely costly. These costs can take the form of classic impact fees or more Byzantine
approval processes that slow construction and put up costly hurdles to construction.
Obviously, there could be some truth to both views. In this section, we provide an
analytical framework for our attempts to empirically distinguish between the two views
of limits on building: expensive land vs. zoning. Section IV then examines a variety of
data to determine if the weight of the evidence more strongly supports one view over the
other.


As noted above, we have decided to ignore the housing demand component of the
housing prices. Two reasons underpin this decision. First, housing demand has been
studied much more extensively than housing supply. A distinguished literature including
Alonso (1964), Muth (1968), Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982) has considered the
determinants of housing demand. Labor market demand and consumption amenities,
such as weather and school, are both important causes of particular demand for some
areas. We have little to add to these findings. Second, policy responses to housing prices
are unlikely to change housing demand. Increasing supply is a much more natural policy
response to high housing prices than reducing demand.


To clarify the issues, consider a jurisdiction with a supply of land equal to “A.” Assume
that the construction cost for a home is K—here, we are not interested in the margin of

7
 The Philadelphia numbers for 1989 are not typos. They reflect a small sample bias associated with the
number of units with basements. This is a statistical oddity that does not show up in other samples,



                                                                                                         11
interior space. The free market price of land equals p. We will represent zoning with a
tax T on new construction. In principle, zoning could also work by limiting the total
number of homes in the area to a fixed number or, equivalently, by constraining lot size
to be greater than a given amount. As we assume homogenous residents, a minimum lot
size and a constraint on the number of residents will be equivalent. Also, as we are not
interested in the incidence of the policy, a tax and a quantity limit will yield the same
outcomes.


As such, the supply price of building a house with L units of land will be K+T+pL. We
will not generally directly observe either p or T. The sales price of the home will be
denoted P(L), where P(L) refers to the price of a home with L units of land. In
equilibrium P(L) must equal K+T+pL so P’(L)=p.


Our primary interest is in the relevant magnitudes of pL and T in creating expensive
housing. We do not directly observe either p or T, but we do observe P(L) and K. As
such, we can compute P(L)-K which gives us an estimate of T+pL. Using standard
hedonic analysis, we can estimate P’(L), which is the amount the housing price increases
within a given neighborhood as the amount of land rises. By estimating P’(L), we are
implicitly estimating p—the implicit price of land. Even in communities where new
houses are not being built, the hedonic value of land still gives us an implicit price of
land. We can then compare p with (P(L)-K)/L which equals p+T/L. The difference
between these two values gives us a sense of the relative importance of land prices and
zoning controls.


A second test of the model requires us to look across communities with different levels of
some local amenity that we denote as B. In this case, we write the home price function as
P(L,B). If we differentiate across communities, and T changes across communities, but
                    dP( L, B ) dp     dT
K does not, then              =    L+    . The value of T might differ across
                      dB        dB    dB
communities because impact fees differ, but more likely T will differ if zoning takes the


whether in the AHS or decennial censuses.


                                                                                            12
form of quantity controls. If zoning takes the form of minimum lot size or maximum
residents, then the implicit tax will be higher in high amenity communities. In a sense,
                                                                dp       dT
our interest lies in determining the relative magnitudes of        L and    . One way to
                                                                dB       dB
examine this is to look at our implied measures of p and T found using the methodology
discussed above.


Another way is to look at land densities. We specify utility as a function of the location-
specific amenity B, consumption of land, and consumption of a composite commodity
denoted C which is equal to income (denoted Y) minus housing costs. Thus, total utility
equals U(B, L, Y-P(L,B)). This implies an optimal level of land, denoted L*, which
satisfies U L = P ′( L*)U C (where U X denotes the derivative of U(.,.,.) with respect to an

argument X). For simplicity, we will assume that U(B, L, Y-P(L,B)) equals
W(B)+V(L)+Y-P(L,B), so the first order condition for land becomes V’(L*)=p.
Differentiating this with respect to B then yields: dL*/dB=(dp/dB)/V”(L*). If V(L)
                                                  Log (vα )    1
equals vLα , then this tells us that Log ( L) =             −     Log ( p) . This yields the
                                                   1−α        1−α
clear implication that if dp/dB is big—we should expect there to be lower densities in
areas with large amenities and high costs. Conversely, if there is no connection between
housing costs and density, then this is more evidence for the zoning model against the
neoclassical housing price model.


Our third empirical approach relies on the existence of zoning. If we have measures of
the difficulty of obtaining building permits in a particular area, then we should expect
them to drive up housing costs (holding B constant). This is just documenting that
dP/dT>0. Obviously, this approach is likely to be compromised if high amenity areas
impose more stringent zoning. Nonetheless, a connection between the strength of zoning
rules and housing prices seems like a final test for the zoning view. As an added test,
across communities, if we have measures of zoning controls, we would expect the
estimated value of T/L to be higher.




                                                                                               13
      IV.      Evidence on Zoning: The Intensive Margin and the Extensive Margin


As our first test, we follow the framework and attempt to estimate “p”—the market price
of land and T/L—the implicit zoning tax. Using data from the 1999 American Housing
Survey, we begin by estimating “p” using the standard hedonic methodology in a
regression of the following specification:


(1)         Housing Price=p*Land Area + Other Controls.


The other controls include the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the
number of other rooms, an indicator variable that takes on a value of one if the home has
a fireplace, an indicator variable that takes on a value of one if the home has a garage, an
indicator variable that takes on a value of one if the home is in a central city, an indicator
variable that takes on a value of one if the home has a basement, an indicator variable that
takes on a value of one if the home has air-conditioning, and the age of the home. We
ran each regression separately for 26 metropolitan areas for which there were 100
observations so that trait prices would be reasonably precisely estimated.8


Column (1) in Table 4 reports the hedonic price of land for different metropolitan areas
using this linear specification. The hedonic literature has generally argued that non-
normal errors terms make a logarithmic specification more sensible. As such, we have
also estimated logarithmic equations of the following form:


(1’) Log(Home Price)=p’*Log(Land Area) + Other Controls.

To transform the estimate of p’, which is an elasticity, into a value of land, we take this
coefficient and multiply it by the ratio of mean home price to mean land area. After this
transformation, our elasticity-based estimates should be comparable to those in column
(1) and we report those in column (2).

8
 There are 96 observations in the Baltimore metropolitan area, which is the smallest number across all
cities. Visual inspection of the findings found sensible results for most traits when the number of
observations was at or above 100.


                                                                                                         14
The two hedonic estimates are strongly correlated (ρ=.5), although the implicit prices
arising from the logged specification tend to be slightly higher. In any event, functional
form does not lead one to materially different conclusions regarding the value of a small
change in lot size about the sample mean in these areas. In general, the hedonic estimates
suggest that land is relatively cheap on this margin. In some cities, the estimated price is
below $1 per square foot. While estimates in those places tend not to be precise, the t-
statistics reported still do not imply really high prices even at the top end of the 95
percent confidence interval. In places where the point estimate is reasonably precise,
land prices tend to be between $1 and $2 per square foot. In these areas, this implies that
an average homeowner would be willing to pay between $11,000-$22,000 dollars for an
extra quarter acre of land.9 The estimates are higher in some cities, primarily in
California. For example, in San Francisco it appears that homeowners are willing to pay
almost $80,000 dollars for an extra quarter acre of land.10 While we do not have really
good benchmarks with which to compare these prices, intuitively they seem reasonable to
us as a whole.


To implement our first test, we then need to compare these prices with the implicit price
of land found by computing the difference between home prices and structure costs.
Subtracting structure costs (provided by the Means data) from reported home values and
then dividing by the amount of land generates an estimate of “p+T/L” as described
above—the value of land including the implicit tax on new construction. These average
values of p+T/L for each metropolitan area are in column 3 of Table 4.


Comparing columns 1 and 2 with column 3 illustrates the vast differences in our
estimates of the intensive and extensive prices of land, or p and p+T/L. In many cases,
our estimate of p+T/L is about ten times larger than p. For example, in Chicago our
imputed price of land per square foot from the extensive margin methodology is $13.16.
This means that a home on a quarter acre plot (or 10,890 square feet) will cost over

9
    There are 43,560 square feet in an acre of land.




                                                                                           15
$140,000 more than construction costs. In San Diego, this quarter acre plot is implicitly
priced at nearly $285,000. The analogous figure is even higher in New York City at just
over $350,000. And, in San Francisco the plot is apparently worth just under $700,000.


This is our first piece of evidence on the relative importance of classic land prices and
zoning. In areas where the ratio is 10-to-1, the findings suggest that for an average lot,
only 10 percent of the value of the land comes from an intrinsically high land price as
measured by hedonic prices.


While the hedonic land prices from the linear specification (column 1) are not
significantly correlated with mean house prices, both the hedonic prices from the logged
model (column 2) and the extensive margin prices (column 3) are strongly positively
correlated with mean prices. Simple regressions of each of the three land price series on
mean house price finds that dollar impact of house price with respect to land price is far
larger for the series that reflects the implicit development tax. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in house price (which equals $82,239 in this 26 city sample)
about its mean is associated with a $13.82 increase in land price as reflected in our p+T/L
measure. The analogous standardized effect with respect to our measure of p arising
from the logged hedonic model is $1.10.11 While these results are based on an admittedly
small sample, we believe the difference in the scale of the changes provides evidence
consistent with the hypothesis that high home prices appear to have more to do with
regulation than with the operations of a free market for land.


     V.      Evidence on Zoning: Density and Housing Costs


Our second test is to look at the connection between housing prices and density. As
described in the model, the neoclassic land model strongly suggests that there should be a
positive connection between density and housing prices. The free land market view

10
  The estimate from the linear specification is much lower, but logging materially improves the overall
hedonic in the case of San Francisco.




                                                                                                          16
suggests that higher amenities will lead to higher land prices and lower consumption of
land. The zoning view suggests that higher amenities will just lead to a higher implicit
zoning tax. This zoning tax does not impact the marginal cost of additional land and,
therefore, there should be little connection between the cost of land and density.


To test this implication, we correlated land density within a central city with our various
measures of housing prices within that city. As the framework suggested the relationship
             Log (vα )    1
Log ( L) =             −     Log ( p) , we will estimate a logarithmic equation. We use as
              1−α        1−α
our land area measure the logarithm of the land area in the city divided by the number of
households.12 Obviously, density is higher the lower the value of this variable.


Table 5 presents the results from a series of regressions exploring the relationship of our
density measure to the index of expensive homes and land in our sample of cities. In
regression (1), we use our measure of the share of houses that cost at least 40 percent
more than construction costs as the independent variable. In this case, the relationship is
negative so that a higher concentration of expensive homes is associated with greater
density. However, there still is no meaningful statistical relationship. Figure 3 plots the
relationship with the regression line included. The figure highlights the extraordinary
amount of heterogeneity in the relationship between density and the distribution of house
prices. For example, Detroit, Seattle, and Los Angeles have similar land densities per
household, but radically different fractions of units sitting on expensive land.
Analogously, New York City and San Diego have similarly high fractions of expensive
land, but very different residential densities.


In regression (2), we control for median income in the city in 1990 to control for the
possibility that richer people live in expensive areas and demand more land. However,
there still is not a really strong relationship between density and the fraction of expensive


11
   The coefficients are precisely estimated in the underlying regressions and are available upon request.
Because the hedonic land price arising from the linear model is virtually uncorrelated with mean house
price, the analogous impact is near zero for that land price series.
12
   Using population per square mile yields similar results.


                                                                                                            17
land and homes. Density is slightly higher in more expensive areas on average, but the
relationship is tenuous even when controlling for income. In regression (3), median
house price in 1990 is used as the independent variable. There is a statistically significant
negative relationship between density and price in this case, with the elasticity being –
0.56. However, there is much heterogeneity here, too, as the statements made just above
regarding Detroit, Seattle, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Diego still hold true
when median price is on the right-hand side of the regression.


For regressions (4), (5) and (6), we take the model more seriously and use an amenity to
look at the impact of housing costs and land consumption. We focus on a particularly
well-studied amenity—average January temperature. In regression (4), we show that
there is a strong positive relationship between the fraction of expensive homes and land
and average January temperature. This relationship is necessary for this variable to
qualify as an amenity. In regression (5), we regress the logarithm of land area per
household on January temperature. In this case, the relationship is much less strong. The
t-statistic is 1.6. Taken together, these results show that warmer January temperature
may raise housing prices13, but there is no strong evidence that it increases densities—at
least, not by very much. Indirectly, this suggests that it is not raising the marginal cost of
land by much.


In regression (6), we follow the spirit of the framework most closely. We regress the
logarithm of land area per household on the distribution of housing prices using average
January temperature as an instrument. January temperature is meant to represent the
exogenous variation in amenities that causes prices to rise. Not only is there no
statistically meaningful connection between prices and land consumption, but these
instrumental variables results imply that higher prices are associated with lower, not
higher, densities. One possibility is that incomes are higher in these areas and that richer
people are demanding more land. Consequently, we redid the analysis adding median
family income as a control, but the results were largely unchanged. That is, there is no


13
  There is a statistically and economically significant positive relationship between mean January
temperature and median house price. Those results are not reported here, but are available upon request.


                                                                                                           18
statistically significant relation between instrumented prices and density, and the point
estimate still is slightly positive (albeit small). While we acknowledge that the sample is
small and that there could be other omitted factors, these results suggest to us that higher
prices have more to do with zoning than a higher marginal cost of land.


As a final test of this view, we regressed our two measures of land costs from Table 4
with average January temperature. We only have 26 observations, but the results are still
quite illuminating. A standard deviation increase of 14.7 degrees in mean January
temperature is associated with a $5.02 higher construction cost-based price of land. The
same increase in warmth is associated with only a $0.47 higher hedonic-based price of
land.14 Once again, amenities seem to have more of an effect on the implicit zoning tax
than on the marginal cost of land.


   VI.     Evidence on Zoning: Housing Costs and Zoning


Our last perspective on the role of zoning comes from an examination of the correlation
between land prices and measures of zoning. Such data are very difficult to obtain. Our
measures of zoning come from the Wharton Land Use Control Survey. This survey took
place in 1989 and is a survey of jurisdictions in 60 metropolitan areas. Because of the
limits of our American Housing Survey data, we are forced to consider only observations
on the central cities of 45 metropolitan areas.


The variable we focus on here is a survey measure of the average length of time between
an application for rezoning and the issuance of a building permit for a modest size, single
family subdivision of less than 50 units. This measure can take on values ranging from
one to five with a value of one indicating the permit issuance lag is less than three
months, a value of two indicating the time frame is between three and six months, a value
of three indicating a 7-12 month lag, a value of four meaning the lag is between one and
two years, and a five signaling a very long lag of over two years. Before proceeding to a




                                                                                            19
regression, we note that the correlation of the permit length variable with the fraction of
housing stock priced more than 40 percent above the cost of new construction is fairly
high at 0.43. The mean fraction of high cost housing among the cities with permit
waiting times of at least six months is (i.e., a value of 3 or more for this variable) is 0.75.
Difficult zoning seems to be ubiquitous in high cost areas.15


Table 6 reports some regression results using this variable. In the first column, we
regress our housing cost measure (again using the share of the city’s housing stock priced
more than 40 percent above the cost of new construction) on the first zoning measure—
time to get a permit issued for a rezoning request. We find a strong positive relationship,
so that when the index increases by one, 15 percent more of the housing stock becomes
quite expensive. This positive relationship also survives controlling for population
growth during the 1980s and median income, as shown in the second column.16


In the final column of Table 6, we return to our implied zoning tax--T/L from above.
This value is calculated using the data in Table 4. Specifically, we subtract the cost of
land estimated in the non-linear hedonic equation (i.e., p from column 2 of Table 4) from
the cost of land implied by subtracting structure cost from total home value (i.e., p+T/L
from column 3 of Table 4). We then regress this variable on our zoning measure. As the
results show, the implied zoning tax is strongly increasing in the length of time it takes to
get a permit issued for a subdivision. Increasing a single category in terms of permit
issuance lag is associated with a nearly $7 per square foot increase in the implicit zoning
tax. If the dependent variable is logged, the results imply that a one unit increase in the
index is associated with a 0.50 log point increase in the implicit zoning tax.17




14
   We used the price series from the non-linear hedonic in the underlying regression. Only the regression
involving the construction-based land prices (column 3 of Table 4) yields statistically significant results at
conventional levels.
15
   Other measures in the data base include the analogue to this rezoning question, except that the permit
length time applies to a completely new subdivision that does not require rezoning. We examined this and
other variables and found correlation patterns similar to those presented below.
16
   Adding region dummies to the specification eliminates any significant positive correlation between this
zoning control and the fraction of expensive housing in the area.
17
   Finally, similar results obtain if other approval time variables are used (e.g., that for a new subdivision).


                                                                                                              20
   VII.    Conclusion


America is not facing a nationwide affordable housing crisis. In most of the country,
home prices appear to be fairly close to the physical costs of construction. In some of the
country, home prices are even far below the physical costs of construction. Only in
particular areas, especially New York City and California, do housing prices diverge
substantially from the costs of new construction.


In the areas where houses are expensive, the classic urban model fares relatively poorly.
These areas are not generally characterized by substantially higher marginal costs of land
as estimated by a hedonic model. The hedonic results imply that the cost of a house on
10,000 square feet is usually pretty close in value to a house on 15,000 square feet. In
addition, these high prices often are not associated with extremely high densities. For
example, there is as much land per household in San Diego (a high price area) as there is
in Cleveland (a low price area).


The bulk of the evidence marshaled in this paper suggests that zoning, and other land use
controls, are more responsible for high prices where we see them. There is a huge gap
between the price of land implied by the gap between home prices and construction costs
and the price of land implied by the price differences between homes on 10,000 square
feet and homes on 15,000 square feet. Measures of zoning strictness are highly
correlated with high prices. While all of our evidence is suggestive, not definitive, it
seems to suggest that this form of government regulation is responsible for high housing
costs where they exist.


We have not considered the benefits from zoning which could certainly outweigh these
costs. However, if policy advocates are interested in reducing housing costs, they would
do well to start with zoning reform. Building small numbers of subsidized on housing
units is likely to have a trivial impact on average housing prices (given any reasonable
demand elasticity), even if well targeted towards deserving poor households. However,




                                                                                           21
reducing the implied zoning tax on new construction could well have a massive impact
on housing prices.


Of course, it may well be that the positive impact of zoning on housing prices is zoning’s
strongest appeal. If we move to a regime with weaker zoning rules, then current
homeowners in high cost areas are likely to lose substantially. To make this politically
feasible, it is crucial that any political reform also try to compensate the losers for this
change.

       Appendix 1: Construction of the House Value/Construction Cost Ratio

A number of adjustments are made to the underlying house price data in the comparison
of prices to construction costs. These include imputation of the square footage of living
area for observations from the IPUMS for the 1980 and 1990 census years. However,
because the results reported in this paper do not include census data, we omit the
description of that imputation. See our 2001 working paper for those details.


Two adjustments are made to the AHS house price data to account for the depreciation
that occurs on older homes and to account for the fact that research shows owners tend to
overestimate the value of their homes. The remainder of this Appendix provides the
details.


One adjustment takes into account the fact that research shows owners tend to
overestimate the value of their homes. Following the survey and recent estimation by
Goodman & Ittner, 1992, we presume that owners typically overvalue their homes by 6
percent.18


Empirically, the most important adjustment takes into account the fact that the vast
majority of our homes are not new and have experienced real depreciation. Depreciation
factors are estimated using the AHS. More specifically, we regress house value per
square foot (scaled down by the Goodman & Ittner, 1992, correction) in the relevant year
on a series of age controls and metropolitan area dummies. The age data is in interval
form so that we can tell if a house is from 0-5 years old, from 6-10 years old, from 11-25
years old, from 25-36 years old, and more than 45 years old. The coefficients on the age
controls are each negative as expected and represent the extent to which houses of
different ages have depreciated in value on a per square foot basis.




18
     This effect turns out to be relatively minor in terms of its quantitative impact on the results.


                                                                                                        24
Finally, we should note that our procedure effectively assumes that units with a basement
in the AHS have unfinished basements, so that we underestimate construction costs for
units with finished basements. Having a basement adds materially to construction costs
according to the Means data. Those units with unfinished basements have about 10
percent higher construction costs depending on the size of the unit. Units with finished
basements have up to 30 percent higher construction costs, again depending on the size of
the unit.


After these adjustments, house value is then compared to construction costs to produce
the distributions reported in the main text.
