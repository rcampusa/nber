              R&D and Productivity at the Industry Level:
                     Is There Still A Relationship?

                                ABSTRACT

     This paper is a re—examination of the relationship between research

and development (R&D) activity and total factor productivity (TFF) at the

industry level during the period extending from the early 1960's to the

mid—1970's. The data base consists of NSF data on applied R&D expendi-

tures by product class, matched to TFP indices derived from the detailed

Census—Penn—SRI manufacturing data file.

     A hypothesis suggested by previous research on the R&D—productivity

relationship is that, due, perhaps, to the depletion of scientific oppor-

tunities, the "potency" of R&D as a source of technological progress has

declined in recent years. Our findings indicate, however, that the rela-

tionship between an industry's R&D—intensity and its productivity growth

did not disappear; if anything, the relationship was stronger in recent

years. The overall deceleration in productivity in recent years has

affected R&D—intensive industries, but to a lesser extent than it has other

industries. What cannot be found in the data is strong evidence of the

differential effects of the slowdown in R&D itself. The time series appear

to be too noisy and the period too short to detect what the major conse-

quences of the retardation in the growth of R&D expenditures may yet turn

out to be.

1. Introduction

       A previous paper (ri1iches 1980) explored the time—series relation-

ship between total factor productivity (Tn) and cumulated past research and

development   (R&D) expenditures within diffeçent "2—1/2 digit" SIC level manu-
facturing industries. It used the BLS Input—Output (1—0) Sector level pro-
ductivity and   capital series and the NSF Applied Research and Development

series by product class as its data base and focused on the potential contri-

bution of the slowdown in the growth of R&D expenditures to the explanation

of the recent slowdown in productivity growth in manufacturing. Its main

conclusions were: (1) The magnitude of the R&D slowdown together with the

size of estimated elasticities of output with respect to R&D stock do not

account for more than a small fraction of the observed decline in productivity.

And, (2) When the data are disaggregated by period, there was almost no

significant relationship to be found between changes in R&D stock and

productivity growth in the more recent 1969—77 period.2 This led one

commentator (Nordhaus 1980) to interpret these results as evidence for the

hypothesis of the depletion of scientific opportunities. The paper itself

was more agnostic, pointing to the large unexplained annual fluctuations in

TFP and arguing that many of the recent observations were affected by

unexpected price developments and large swings in capacity utilization and
                                    —2—




hence could not be interpreted as being on the production possibilities

frontier and as providing evidence about changes in the rate of its out-

ward shift.

       A variety of problems were raised by the data and methodology used in

that paper, some of which we hope to explore and improve upon in this paper.

There were, roughly speaking, three kinds of problems: (1) those associated

with the choice of a particular R&D series; (2) those arising from the use

of a particular TFP series; and (3) those associated with the modelling of

the relationship between R&D and subsequent productivity growth. We shall

address these topics in turn in what follows. To foreshadow our conclusions:

we find that the relationship between an industry's R&D—intensity and its

productivity growth did not disappear. There has been an overall decline in

productivity growth which affected also the R&D intensive industries, but to

a lesser extent. If anything, this relationship was stronger in recent

years. What cannot be found in the data is strong evidence of the differential

effects of the slowdown in R&D itself. The time series appear to be too

noisy and the period too short to detect what the major consequences of the

retardation in the growth of R&D expenditures may yet turn out to be.



2. The R&D Data

       The major and only source of R&D data at the industrial level of detail

are the surveys conducted by the Census Bureau for the National Science

foundation (see, e.g., NSF 1977). These surveys are based, however, on company

reports and on the industrial designation of the company by its main line of
                                       —3—




activity. There are at least two problems with these data: (1) Many of

the major R&D performers are conglomerates or reasonably widely diversi-

fied firms. Thus, the R&D reported by them is not necessarily "done" in

the industry they are attributed to.     (2) Many firms perform R&D directed

at processes and products used in other industries. There is a significant

difference between the industrial locus of a particular R&D activity, its

"origin", and the ultimate place of use of the results of such activity, the

locus of its productivity effects. In addition, one should also keep in

mind the possibility of pure knowledge spillovers, the cross—fertilization

of one industry's research program by developments occurring in other

industries.

       There are various ways of trying to deal with such problems. We chose

to use the NSF data on Applied Research and Development expenditures by

product class as the basis for our series,4 The product—class classification

is closer to the desired notion of R&D by industry of use and it is available

at a reasonable level of SIC detail (28 distinct "2—1/2" digit groupings).

It does attribute the fertilizer research of a "textile" firm to the

fertilizer industry (but not to agriculture) and the work on bulldozers of

an "automotive" firm to the construction equipment industry (but not to

construction itself). It is thus based on a notion of proximate rather than

ultimate used, Nevertheless, it is much better conceputally than the straight

NSF industrial origin classification scheme.5

       Unfortunately, it is based on much more spotty reporting than the

overall R&D numbers. Moreover, after using these numbers in the earlier study

we discovered rather arbitrary and abrupt jumps in the historical series as

published by NSF. It appears to be the case that when the Census drew new
                                     —4--




samples in 1968 and 1977, it did not carry through the revisions of the

published data consistently backward, leaving large incomparabilities in

some of the years for some of the industries. What we had to do, therefore,

is to go back to the original annual NSF reports and splice together and

interpolate between the unrevised and revised numbers so as to keep them

somewhat comparable over time.6

       The industrial classification of a particular R&D data set determines

the possible level of detail of subsequent analysis. Since the two—digit

industrial categories are rather broad, we would like to use finer detail,

where possible, e.g., we would like to separate drugs from chemicals or

computers from all machinery. This, of course, influences our choice

of total factor productivity series, which will be discussed next.



3. The TFP Data

       Because we are interested in industrial detail below the usual two—

digit level breakdown, we could not use some of the already published and

carefully constructed total factor productivity sereis, such as the Gollop

and Jorgenson (1979) or Kendrick and Grossman (1980) ones. In the previous

paper we used instead the BLS Growth Study data based on the input—output

classification of 145 sectors ( 95    of them in manufacturing) [see BLS

l979a], and associated physical capital data series. These data
                                    —5—




are subject, however, to two major drawbacks: First, the, output con-

cept used by the BLS is based on the product rather than the establishment

classification, which introduces an unknown amount of incomparability

between the output measure and the associated labor and capital measures.

The latter are based on the industrial classification of establishnients

rather than products. And, second, the only available output concept is

gross output (not value added) and there are no consistent official numbers

on material or energy use below the two—digit industry level. The use of

gross output and the lack of data on materials introduces a bias of an

unknown magnitude which could be quite large during the seventies, when

materials and energy prices rose sharply relative to the prices of other

inputs.

          Because of these problems we turned to another source of data: the

4—digit level Annual Survey of Manufactures based series constructed by Fromm,

Klein, Ripley, and Crawford (1980) as part of a joint Bureau of the Census,

University of Pennsylvania, and SRI—International project.7 These data cover

the years 1959—1976 and contain also information on material use by industry.

There is also separate information on energy use since 1971. There are

several problems also with this data set: First, it only goes through 1976.

Second, the information on labor input available to us covered only production

worker manhours and we had to adjust it to reflect total employment. And,

third, the construction of these data is rather poorly documented, so that

one does not really know how some of the numbers were derived from or inter-

polated on the basis of the published sources. Nevertheless, they are very

rich in detail and we hope to explore them further in subsequent work.
                                  —6—




     We used these data after an adjustment of the labor input, to construct

Tornqvist—Divisia indexes of total factor productivity at the relevant levels

of aggregation (see Appendix A for more detail). Table 1 presents estimated      Table 1

rates of growth of TFP between sub—period averages for manufacturing indus-

tries according to the breakdown given in the NSF R&D publications. In these

data there is a clear retardation in             growth

industries already in the late sixties.

      Almost all Tfl data start with some gross sales or revenues concept

which is adjusted for inventory change and then deflated by some price index

to yield a measure of "output in constant prices". Such a measure is no

better than the price indexes used to create it. The price indexes are

components of the WPI

a set of deflators used in the detailed deflation of the GNP accounts. As

is well known, the quality of these deflators is quite variable.9 Moreover,

there is some reason to suspect that it may deteriorate further in periods

of rapid price change, such as 1974—75, where there may be a widening of the

gap between quoted prices and the average realized prices by sellers, many

of whose prices may have been set actually earlier or not changed as fast

as some of the more standard and widely traded and hence also collected items.

      We tried rather hard to pinpoint such a deterioration in the price

data and to find ways of adjusting for it, but without much success. Look—

ing at the detailed data (either the BLS 1—0--Sectors set or the Penn—SRI one)

it becomes quite clear that many of the large TFP declines that occurred in

1974 and 1975 are associated with above average increases in the output price
                                                             data. Table 2       Table 2

illustrates the negative relation between TFP and output price growth for
                                   —7—




selected industries (based on 4—digit detail) and its growth over time.

Some of the reported price movements are large and bizzare and raise the

suspicion that they may be erroneous. But without some alternative direct

price or output measurement, it is difficult to go beyond such suspicions

since, given the accounting identities and the assumption of competitive

behavior, declines in productivity would produce a rise in the associated
                      10
output   price indexes; We can either not believe in the reality of some of

the reported productivity declines, in which case we also cast doubt on the

price indexes that "produced" such declines, or we can accept both of them

as a fact. Both views are consistent with the data as we have them. It

would take an independent source of price or output data to adjudicate between

these two points of view.

         Before we turn to the analysis of the relationship of TFP growth

and R&D expenditures, which can be looked at only at the same level of in-

dustrial detail as is available for R&D data, we can use the available

4—digit detail to look at a few additional aspects of these data. An analy-

sis of variance of annual changes in TFP   at   the 4—digit level during the 1959—73

period illustrates the rather high level of noise in these data. Even in this

earlier relatively calm period only 20 percent of the variance is common at

the two—digit level. That is, most of the variance in TFP changes as computed

is within two—digit industries. Similarly, only 8 percent of the variance

is accounted for by common movements over time. The vast majority of the

computed Tn' movements are not synchronized. If these numbers are to be

interpreted on their face value, as reflecting changes in industrial effi-

ciency, these changes are highly idiosyncratic. Alternatively, if one
                                   —8—



believed that substantive causal changes jn technological levels occur to-

gether for sub—industries within a two—digit classification and follow

similar time patterns, then this lack of synchronization would indicate a

rather high level of error in these data.

       Another issue of potential interest is whether the observed retarda-

tion in TFP growth at the two—digit level is also apparent at the 4—digit

level and is not just an artifact of a faster growth of lower productivity

industries. Computations for three two—digit industries (35, 36, and 37)

presented in Appendix Table C—l indicate that this is indeed the case.   If


one   held the 4—digit industrial mix constant at the beginning period levels,
the recorded TFP growth would have been even lower. When one looks at the
computed rates of retardation (in the second part of Appendix Table C—l)
the effects are reversed, but the differences are quite small. The observed

retardation is not an artifact, a "mix" effect. It actually happened quite

pervasively at the 4—digit level of industrial detail!




4..   Modelling the R&D to Productivity Relationship

         Many of the theoretical issues that arise in the attempt to infer

the contribution of R&D to productivity growth from usual types of data were

discussed at some length in Griliches (1979) and will not be considered ex-

plicitly here. We want to mention though and try to deal with three specific

topics: (1) TFP measures as indicators of the growth in technological poten-

tial; (2) the lag structure of R&D effects; and (3) the functional form and

the econometric model within which such effects are to be estimated.
                                  —9—




       We have already discussed briefly the possibility that the TFP

measures as computed are subject both to significant measurement error (arising

mainly from errors in the level and timing of the output price deflators) and

to large short—run irrelevant fluctuations. Irrelevant in the sense that

though they do indicate changes in the efficiency with which resources are

used, these changes occur as the result of unanticipated fluctuations in de-

mand and in relative prices, forcing firms to operate their plants and

organizations in a sub—optimal fashion (at least from the point of view of

their original design). Whatever theory one has of such business cycle and

capacity utilization fluctuations, observations that are not on the production

possibilities frontier, are unlikely to be informative about the factors that

are intended to shift this frontier. By and large, R&D expenditures are spent

on designing new products, which will provide more consumer or producer value

per unit of resources used or new processes which would reduce the resource

requirements of existing products. TFP fluctuations obscure such effects

both because the observed efficiencies do not reflect the potential ones

and because during business cycle downswings     there is a significant

slowdown in investment with an associated, slower than normal, introduction

and diffusion of new products and processes.

       Within the limits imposed on usby our data we tried three different ways

of coping with such problems. The first was to assume that "true" produ—

tivity can only improve (no forgetting) and hence allow the TFP series onl'

to increase or stay constant, but not decline, by resetting every "lower"

observation to the previously observed peak level. The second approach

tried to rule out large downward shifts in TFP which appeared to be caused
                                    —10—




by large changes in the price deflator and seemed to be inconsistent with

the observed variable input (labor and materials) data. For example, if

sales went up by 10 percent, and variable inputs went up by 5 percent, while

the output price index went up by 15 percent, we would assume that perhaps

up to a half of the price movement was in error. The actual formula used

was more complicated than that (it is described in the footnotes to Table 3) Table 3

but the gist of it was that in 4—digit industries whose price deflators rose

by more than 5 percent than their respective 2—digit averages we would not

allow a decline in productivity of more than 3 percent than would be predicted

if one made output movements equal, in the short run, to the movement in

variable inputs. This adjustment affected about 24 percent (119 out of 48)

of our annual observations.

       Because neither of these procedures had a noticeable effect on our

final results, we ultimately turned to the third and simpler way of coping

with some of these problems ——   averaging.   We picked sub—periods, averaged

the total factor productivity within each of these sub—periods, and then

computed rates of growth between such sub—period averages. In particular,

the growth rate of TFP at the beginning of the 1959—1976 period was defined

by the average annual change between the mean level of TFP during 1959—1963

and its mean level during 1964—1968; the growth rates at the middle and end

of the period were defined in terms of the changes in the mean level of TFP

from 1964-1968 to 1969-1973, and from 1969-1973 to 1974—1976, respectively:

We hope, in this way, to mitigate, if not solve, some of the difficulties dis-

cussed above.

          iJe   hav venii€tle toofltribute bn the issue tf R&D lag effètts
In   the earlier work, only some of which was reported in Griliches (1980),

we experimented at length with various lag structures, but largely to no

avail. The data did seem to prefer, weakly, the no depreciation to any

depreciation assumption, and there was also some evidence of the possibility

of rather long lags. Unfortunately, given the shortness of the series and

the overall level of noise in the data, we could not really distinguish

between a small slowly decaying effect of R&D long past and fixed industry

differences in their average levels of TFP. Thus, in this paper, we do not

focus on this issue, but we hope to come back to it some day with better

methods and data.

          The coimnon approach to the estimation of such models is to use the

generalized Cobb—Douglas function in which a term involving some measure

of R&D "stock" is added on, paralleling the role of physicaF capital.

There is a problem, however, in applying such a framework across industries

since it is unlikely that different industries have the same production function

coefficients. The TFP      approach   goes some ways towards solving this problem,

by assuming that conventional inputs are used at their competitive equilibrium

levels and using the       observed factor shares as approximations to the relevant

production function elasticities. This allows each industry to have•

its own    (a   priori imposed) labor, capital, and materials coefficients. One

is left then, only with the estimation of trend and R&D effects.
              -                           —12—




             The usual procedure           (e.g.   Griliches 1980) still imposes

-J    I omnoitre 1atean&a common output—R&D. elasticity       on all. the   data;

     The common trend restriction can be lifted by shifting to an analysis of

      first differences, -the acceleration (or deceleration) in TFP growth, at the cost

     of magnifying the role of errors and short—term fluctuations in both the

     dependent and independent variables. The assumption of a common elasticity

     of output with respect to R&D stock is bothersome when the relationship is

     estimated across industries, with well known and long term differences in

     R&D intensity. Unless the difference between the observed R&D "sharest'

     in sales and the estimated overall common R&D elasticity parameter is to

     be interpreted as reflecting exact     differences between the level of social

     and private R&D returns, which is not very likely, the estimatal model is

     not consistent with any reasonable optimal R&D choice behavior. An alter-

     native approach, used earlier by Griliches (1973) and Terleckyj (1980), is

     to reparameterize the model in terms of a common rate of return (marginal

     product) of R&D across industries, rather than a common elasticity. Writing

     the contribution of the charge in the stock of R&D to TFP growth as



                   I K/K=!=   i= R-K R
                        aKQK PQ P Q -PQ

     where y is the elasticity of output (Q) with respect to changes in the

     stock R&D capital (K), p =    BQ/BK     is the rate of return or marginal

     product of R&D, 6 is the average rate of depreciation of R&D capital,

     the TFP growth rate can be expressed as a function of the R&D intensity of'

     an industry, provided that 6 is zero or close to it. This is the form

     which we will use in much of what follows.

       We estimated each of the three equations (4), (5), and (6) in order

to measure the contribution of research and development expenditures to

productivity. Although the deterministic versions of (4) and (5) are

equivalent, they are not stochastically equivalent: in general, OLS esti-

mation of (4) and (5) would yield different estimates of the parameter •y.

In (4) and (5), the output—elasticity of R&D capital is viewed as a para-

meter, i.e., invariant across observations; in (6) the marginal productivity

of R&D capital is a parameter. We argue below (see p. 19) that p may be

loosely interpreted as the social gross excess rate of return to investment in

R&D. While there is no reason toexject the social rate of return to be

equalized across industries, under the hypothesis that the aiscrepancy between

social and private returns is distributed randomly across industries (or is at

least uncorrelated with R&D intensity), an estimate of p obtained from (6)

will be a consistent estimate of the average excess of social over private

returns.

     A variant of equation (4) was estimated on pooled time—series data

(1959—1976) for 27 industries. Two modifications were made. First, each

industry was specified to have its own intercept term, log A. Rather than

including 27 industry dummies in the estimating equation, logT(t) and log

K(t) were measured as deviations from the respective industry means.

Second, the time trend was generalized to a set of time dummies. These time

dummies control for all "year effects" common to the included industries.

         The actual specification of the estimating equation is therefore

                It is well known that much of the year—to—year variation in total

        factor productivity is attribulable to fluctuation in the level of capacity

       .utilization. It is perhaps useful to view the TFP time series as the sum

        of a long—run trend and a serially correlated deviation from trend. We

        postulate that the level of the R&D stock is a determinant of the trend

        component of TFP, but not of its short run deviations from trend; the latter

       are primarily the result of fluctuations in capacity utilization. A complete

       model of TFP should include variables which account for both forces. Al-

       ternatively, if one is interested only in explaining the long—run behavior

       of TFP, one can attempt to remove some of the short—run variation from the

       observed series. We have tried both strategies in estimating equation (4').

       In several equations we included a variable, average annual hours of work,

       postulated to be an indicator of the level of capacity utilization.           In other

       equations we attempted to adjust Tn' to its full—capacity level or to eliminate

       observations in which TFP was below capacity.

            Table 3   presents regression results for variants of the model (4'). Line 1
       includes no variable other than R&D stock and year dummies. Line 2 includes a

           hurs of work per emDloyee. In linE 4, the dependent variable was defined

           as the minimuny of the current level of TFP and the previous peak level of

           TFP. Observations in which TFP was below its previous peak were excluded

           in estimating the equation on line 5. The dependent variable in line 6 is

          "adjusted" TFP; the adjustment formula is described at the bottom of the

          table. The coefficient on the R&D variable is negative in all cases, and

          insignificantly different from zero in all but one.
                 Before turning to a discussion of the results of estimating variants

Table 4   of the constant—My (or "R&D —   intensity")   model (6), we present in Table 4

          descriptive tatistics on TFP and private R&D intensity, or R&D per unit of

          output, by sub—period, for the 27—industry sample.12 The table indicates that

          both the (unweighted) mean growth of TFP and the (unweighted) level of R&D

          declined throughout the period, and that the larger absolute decline in both

          variables occurred early. There is also a striking increase in the variability

          of TFP growth over time; the standard deviation rises by over 40 percent.

                Plots of TFP growth against private R&D—intensity, by sub—period, are

          shown in Appendix Figures C—l, C—2, and C—3. Note that the computer industry

          (r) is a consistent outlier in these charts. This is an industry whose pro-

          ductivity growth is clearly underestimated by the conventional measures.

                    At the bottom of Table 4 we show correlation coefficients between

             TFP growth rates and R&D intensities. Note the

             correlations between period—specific R&D—intensities, indicating the stability

             of the industries' relative position with respect to R&D performance. An

             alternative (non—parametric) 'wayof analyzing the relationships between

            TIP—growth and R&D-intensity is to classify industries into groups, according

            to their rank in the R&D intensity distribution, and compute the mean rate

            of TFP growth for each group. Mean TFP growth rates, between adjacent sub—

           intensity model. This model was estimated separately, by sub—period, under

           alternative assumptions about the rate of depreciation of R&D capital)3       For

           each sub—period and depreciation rate assumption, two variants of the model

           were estimated: one in which R&D intensity is divided into privately—financed
       •


           and government—financed components, and one in which only total R&D is included.
rable 6    The estimates, reported in Table 6, indicate that substitution of the R&D

           measures classified by source of financing for the total R&D figure results uni-

           formly in an improvement in theR2; in the latter two periods, this

           improvement is dramatic. This improvement arises from relaxing the a priori
                                  —19—




corstraint that the coefficients on the two types of R&D be equal.

Obviously, the unconstrained coefficients differ greatly in magnitude, and

even in sign in half of the regressions. Since we can reject the hypothesis

of equality of coefficients for privately and government financed R&D, we shall

confine our attention to estimates with R&D disaggregated by source of

financing.

       The equation for each of the three TFP growth rates indicate that both

the highest      and the highest t—statistic on private R&D are obtained under

the 0 percent depreciation rate assumption, and that both of these statistics

decline monotonically as the assumed depreciation rises. In this sense, the

dat? clearly favor the hypothesis of no depreciation of R&D capital in terms

of Its effects on physical productivity of resources at the industry level.'4

       Although the coefficient on private R&D Is only marginally significant

in the 1959—63 to 1964—68 equation, the corresponding coefficients in he

two later equations are s.gnifièantly different from zero at the 99 percent

level. Both the coefficients and the associated t—statistics grow larger

over the period. Recall that the coefficient on R&D intensity in the TFP growth

equation may be interpreted loosely as the social gross excess rate of return

to investment in R&D. It is a social rate of return because it is based on

output in constant prices rather than profit calculations. It is gross be-

cause it includes also a possible allowance for depreciation. And it is

excessbeëause the conventional inputs of labor and capital already include
                                                  —20—




     most of the R&D expenditures once at "normal" factor prices.15 The estimates
     imply    an average 5.6    percent   social excess rate of return to privately

     financed R&D investment undertaken during 1959—63, a 20.5 percent rate of

     return to 1964—68 R&D, and a 36.0 percent return to 1969—73 invest-

     ments.

              The coefficient on gçvernment financed R&D is not significant in any

     of the three equations, and it has the wrong sign in the second one. In

     contrast to the private R&D coefficient, the government R&D coefficient is

     largest and most significant in the first period.

              The regressions reported in Table 6 are of the form

 Note the presence of Q o.n both sides of the equation. This suggests the

 TFP growth may be partly spurious, arising, for example, from errors in measuring

 current output. One way of eliminating this potential source of spurious correla-

 tion is to estimate the equation using the 1ag value of R&D intensity.
 Estimates of equations in which the lagged value of R&D intensity replaced

the   current value,        and equations in which both lagged and current values were
included      are presented     in Table 7.     For convenience, the zero—depreciation
equations for      the three sub—periods from Table 6 are reproduced in Table 7.
In   view of    our earlier results, the assumption of no depreciation of R&D capital
was maintained throughout.

                                      I

        Substituting   the lagged (i.e.,l959—63) value of total R&D investment

 per unit of output for the current (i.e., 1964—68) value in the 1964—68 to

 1969—73 TFP growth rate equation slightly increases the R2; when both variables

 are included,, the lagged value dominates, although both are insignificant.

 When R&D intensity is disaggregated by source of financing, the      of the

 current value equation is higher than that of the lagged value equation,

 although private R&D is significant in both cases. When both current and

 lagged intensity are included, current—intensity dominates.

        The current value of R&D intensity dominates the lagged value in all

 of the 1969—73 to 1974—76 Tif growth rate equations, although the lagged

 values are also generally significant, indicating that while perhaps slightly

 biased upward, the results reported earlier (in Table 6) are not entirely

 spurious.

       Although one's impressions about the timing and severity of the slow-

down in TFP growth are sensitive to the periodization scheme adopted —   i.e.,
the particular way in which the entire sample period is divided into sub—periods —

some experimentation with alternative schemes indicated that the TFP—growth/R&D—

intensity estimation results reported in this paper are not substantially

altered by changing the sub—period definitions. Indeed, the finding that the

association between productivity growth and R&D activity became increasingly

strong over the period is even more apparent in results not reported in the

paper (i.e., those obtained using the "peak—to—peak" periodization scheme

described in fn. 8) than it is in the evidence presented above,
                                       —22—




       To summarize the regression results reported above: variants of the

Constant—elasticity version of the TFP/R&D model (equation (4! )),    estimated

on pooled "within" annual data yielded estimates of the coefficient on R&D

which were negative and insignificantly different from zero, whereas the

constant—marginal—productivity version of the model (equation (5)) estimated

on a cross—section of sub—period averages yielded estimates of the R&D—

coefficient which were generally positive and significant, at least for

private R&D when R&D expenditure was disaggregated by source of financing.

tn principle, this m&rked difference in results could be an artifact of

either (a) difference in functional form; (b) difference in time—period of

observation (annual   vs. sub—period average); or Cc) both differences. 1n:
order to determine what the source of   the   difference in results was, we
estimated   the constant—elasticity version of the model on sub—period

averages, i.e., we estimated equations of the form.

As before, the model was estimated under alternative assumptions about R&D—

capital depreciation. The R&D—coefficients obtained from estimating these

equations were never significantly different from zero, and were negative in

the first and third sub—periods under all depreciation assumptions, We may

conclude that the relatively good R&D—intensity results (compared to the R&D—

stock results) are not due to the averaging of periods, but rather to the

difference in functional form, i,e,,, to the assumption of a constant marginal

product rather than a constant elasticity across industries.

                 A different source of data allows us a more disaggregated

          glimpse at the same problem. Estimates of the fraction of all employees

          engaged in research and development, by three—digit industry (N=139), are

          available from the 1971 Survey of Occupational Employment, and enable us

          to estimate the lET—growth/R&D intensity model on more detailed data.16

          Results based on these unpublished BLS data must be interpreted with caution,

          however, since their reliability is subject to question due to the under—

          representation of central office workers in the survey sample. In order to

          render the results of this analysis comparable to our earlier estimates, we

          multiplied the ratio of R&D employment to total employment by labor's share

          in total cost of production in 1971. Assuming real wages (adjusted for

          interindustry differences in labor quality) are equal across industries, the

          resulting figure is proportional to R&D employment expenditures per unit of

          output, a proxy for the desired measure, real net R&D investment per unit

          of output. Unfortunately, we have only a single cross—section for the year

          1971, and are therefore forced to assume stability with respect to relative

          R&D intensity (an assumption warranted by the evidence presented earlier).

                 Estimates of the TFP—growth/R&D-intensity equation based on the 139—

Table 8   Industry sample,for different periods of TFP growth, are shown'in Table 8.

          The results indicate a positive and significant coefficient on R&D intensity

          in all sub—periods. Given that the costs of R&D scientists account for about
                                  —24-




lalf of total R&D expenditures, the estimated R&D-intensity coefficients

should be divided by about a half to make them roughly comparable to those

reported in Tables 6 and 7.   The resulting numbers are significantly higher

than those reported for total R&D there but lower than the comparable numbers

for privately financed R&D alone. Since the employment numbers reflect both

privately and federally financed R&D activities, this is approximately as it

should be if the earlier results are attenuated because of aggregation. In

any case, here too there is no evidence of a decline in the "potency" of R&D.



6. Tentative Conclusion

      The relationship between the growth of total factor productivity and

R&D did not disappear in recent years,though it was obscured by the overall

decline in the average growth rate of Ti!?. While fine timing effects cannot

be deduced from the available data, when one does not impose a constant

elasticity coefficient across different industries, there appears to be a

rather strong relationship between the intensity of private (but not federal)

R&D expenditures and subsequent growth in productivity.

Key to Dependent Variable
(Note: All variables defined as deviations from industry means)

1: Unadjusted TFP

2:    MIN (TFP, past peak TFP)

3: Exc1udobservations in which TFP<past peak TFP

4:   "Adjusted" TFP, bas2d on following rule for adjusting data at the 4—digit level:
     if "variable input productivity" (output per unit of weighted index of labor,
     energy, and materials) declined by more than three percent, and the increase
     in the price of output exceeded the respective 2—digit industry average price
     increase by more than five percent, redefine output so that variable Input
     productivity declines exactly three percent.

*R&D data derived from 1971 BLS Survey of Occupational Employment.
         Appendix A: Total Factor Productivity Data

             The present investigation has the advantage of making use of a consistent

      body of data on intermediate inputs as well as on gross output and primary inputs.

      The index of total factor productivity used in the empirical analysis is defined

      as the ratio of real gross output (shipments adjusted for inventory change) to a

      Tornqvist index (a discrete approximation to the Divisia index) of four inputs:
                                                      17
      capital, labor, energy, and materials.

             The Tornqvist index of total input is constructed as follows:



                                                                              x
                                                                                  it
                         Ln (1t )        =E        (.5*(sit + s1,_i)) £n x
                              t— 1                                           i,,t—l



                         where I = index              of total input

                                     S        =   share of factor i in total cost, I = K,L,E,M
                                         it

                                     X1 =quantity of factor 1,                            1   K,L,E,M



    This formula generates a sequence of growth rates of aggregate input; the level of

    the index in any given year is determined by an arbitary normalization. The level

    of total factor productivity Is defined as the ratio of output to aggregate input;

    the latter is normalized so that TFP equals unity in 1972.

•
          The data base was developed jointly by the University of Pennsylvania, the

    U.S. Bureau of the Census, and SRI International, as part of a project under the

    direction of Gary Fromm, Lawrence Klein, and Frank Ripley. It consists of annual

    time series (1959—76) on the value of output (shipments adjusted for inventory

    change), capital, labor, energy, and materials, In current and constant (1972)

    dollars, for 450 SIC 4—digit industries in U.S. manufacturing.                The source for most

    of these series is the annual Survey and Census of Manufactures.                   Data for years

    prior to 1972 were reclassified to conform to the 1972 SIC scheme so that the

    industry classification is consistent throughout the period.
        The following is a brief summary of salient characteristics of the data

 underlying the total factor productivity indexes. For a more detailed discussion

adjusted for changes in finished goods and work—in—process inventories. Constant—

dollar output is derived by deflating the current—dollar series by deflators

developed by the Industry Division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These

deflators are constructed at the five—digit level and are generally weighted averages

of BLS producer price indexes.

       Capital. Consistent with the maintained hypothesis of constant returns to

scale, •the current—dollar value of capital services is computed as the difference

between the value of output and the sum of expenditures on labor, energy, and

materials.17 The real flow of capital services is assumed proportional to the real

capital stock; the capital stock concept is the gross fixed reproducible stock of

capital, i.e., the stock of plant and equipment net of discards (land and working cap-

ital are excluded). The stocks are computed from a perpetual inventory algorithm,

which takes account of the industry—, and year—specific distribution of expenditure on

investment goods across one plant and 26 equipment ctegories (based on a series of

capital flows matrices extrapolated from a 1967 matrix by the RAS procedure), This

information on the composition of capital purchases enables development of

industry— and year—specific weights for the construction of investment deflators

and service lives (weighted averages, respectively, of the PPI's and the service

life assumptions for the 27 types of investments).
        Labor. The current—dollarvalue of labor services is measured as total

expenditure by operating manufacturing establishments for employee compensation,

including wages, salaries, and both legally required and voluntary supplements to

wages and salaries. e adjusted for the compensation of employees in central admin-

istrative offices and auxiliaries. In the absence of data on hours of work of

nonproduction workers, real labor input is defined as the ratio of total wages

and salaries to average hourly earnings of production workers; under the assumption

that the relative wages of production and nonproduction workers is equal to their

relative marginal productivity, this ratio may be viewed as an index of "production—

worker—equivalent" manhours. No adjustment was made for changes in labor quality due,

for example, to shifts in the age— or sex—distribution of employment.

        Energy and other Intermediate materials. Current—dollar energy input is

defined as the value of energy consumed in the production process; it includes

energy produced and consumed within an establishment as well as purchases of energy

from other establishments. Real energy input is obtained by deflating the current—

dollar series by a fixed—weighted index of three principal energy prices. Current—

dollar cost of materials Is deflated by a fixed—weighted index of 450 4—digit manu-

facturing output price deflators and seven 1—digit nonmanufacturing price deflators.

The weights for both energy and materials deflators reflect the composition of the

industry's purchases of intermediate inputs as shown in the 1967 input—output table.

 Appendix B: Smoothing the Applied R&D Series


 1. 1972—1975 Data Revision

        The 1972 to 1975 data were revised in 1976 because a new sample was

 helped to improve respondents' interpretation of definitions of the survey.

 Consequently the 1976 data may not be directly comparable to earlier ones.

Among the 27 product fields (excluding Ordinance and Guided Missiles and

 Space craft), there were three kinds of revision:

Obviously, the first and second types of adjustment result in sharp de-

celeration of the growth rates between 1974 and 1975, relative to the original

series. The rationale behind this pattern of adjustment is unknown. As an

alternative the 1971 to 1975 original annual growth rates were scaled by the

1975 adjustment factor,0thereby.preserving the 1971 to 1975 overall growth

rates in the, smoothed series.


2. Stone, Clay and Glass Products

      The data for 1968 to 1970 are given as 130, 157 and 128. The 1970 figure
                                              —2—




      was originally reported as 159 and then revised to 128 in 1971, resulting

      in a big spike in 1969. The 1969 figure was set at 126 (157 x 128/159).

      is due to an abrupt increase of applied R&D done by the electrical equip-

     ment and communication industry in the fabricated metal product field, from

      49 million to 224 million. To smooth out the series, the 1962—1968 growth

     rate was used as a control total to adjust the annual growth rates within

     this period.


     4. Electrical Equipment

                 The data for this product field are not broken down Into four sub—fields

     between 1967 and 1970. The average shares in 1966—67 and 1971—72 were used

     to disaggregate the total figures.

           4. Other ways of dealing with this problem include the use of R&D by product—

                 class by industry—of_origin table
                                                      (Schankerman, 1979), input—output and capital—

                 flow-of—purchase table (Terleckyj 1974), and patents—class classified by

                 industry—of—origin and use—table (Scherer 1981) to redistribute the NSF

                 R&D data.


           5. NSF (1977, p. 70) instructs respondents •to the industrial R&D
                                                                             survey to
                 complete the "applied R&D by product field" item on the questionnaire as follows:

                     "Costs should be entered in the
                                                        field or product group in which the
                      research and development project was actually carried on regardless

                      of the classification of the field of manufacturing in which the results

                      are to be used. For example, research on an electrical component for

                      a farm machine should be reported as research on electrical machinery.

                      Also, research on refractory bricks to be used by the steel industry

                      should be reported as research on stone, clay, glass, and concrete

                      products rather than primary ferrous metals, whether performed in the

                      steel industry or the stone, clay, glass, and concrete industry.

                      Research and development work on an automotive head lamp would be class-

                     whether performed by an automotive or electrical company,"

             In fact, however, the majority of respondents interprets this question as rela-

             ting to. Itindustry of use" according to a recent internal audit by the Bureau

             of the Census.

             It should be painted out that, due to the volatility of the annt.ial TFP         -.




             series,   estimates of the timing and severity of the TFP slowdown — measured

             by the change in the average annual growth rate of TFP between two adjacent

             subperiods —    are quite sensitive to the particular way in which the entire

             sample period is divided into sub—periods. The weighted (by value of ship—

             ments) averages of the                 beginning—, middle—, and end—of—period

             TFP average annual growth rates shown in Table 1 are 1.72, 0.86, and 0.10,

            respectively. If instead of measuring changes between the mean level of

            TFP over several years, we compute average annual TFP changes between

            single "peak" years in business activity (as measured by the Federal Reserve

            Board index of capacity utilization for total manufacturing), the beginning,

            middle, and end sub—period definitions are 1959—1965, 196f—1973, and 1973—1976;

            and the corresponding weighted TFP growth rates are 1.67, 1.23, and —1.94; almost

            all of the apparent slowdown occurs at the end of the period.

      9. E,g., consider the obviously ridiculously low estimate of TFP growth for

            the computer industry in Table 1. It is due to the absence of a decent

            price index.


      10. In fact, given these identities, if factor prices move similarly for

            different industries and if factor shares do not change much, the correla—

            tion between TFP   changes   and product price changes should be close to —1.
           11. There is a question
                                     as to whether the coefficient of the R&D—stock

               variable should be included in.

       12. We dropped petroleum
                                     refining (sic 29) from our sample because of clearly
              erroneous Ti? numbers for the recent
                                                        years. The unadjusted numbers show
              Ti? declining at the rate of 10
                                                 percent per year during 1973—76, mainly
              because the material price deflators are for some reason
                                                                       not rising as
              fast as the output deflators.

      13. Note that the R&D—intensity is as of the beginning of the
                                                                            period. I.e.,
             the    associated with TFP growth between 1969—73 to 1974—76 is
                                                                             computed as
             (K73—K69)/5, where K is the R&D—capital stock
                                                                constructed on the basis of
             the various depreciation
                                         assumptions.

      14. In the class of constant
                                         geometric (declining balance) depreciation schemes.
             Earlier experimentation with other
                                                   depreciation schemes and lag structures
       •     indicates that this conclusion is rather robust.

  15, This is only approximately
                                          correct. See Schankerman (1981) for a more
            detailed discussion.

  17. Because expenditure on energy was included In materials expenditure in

      most years prior to 1971, the input indeSt for the yeats 1959—71 is based

      on only three inputs: capital, labor, and the energy—materials aggregate.

      energy increased dramatically trats energy äñd materials separately.
      Construction of the input index for the whole period consisted of de-

      fining a three—input index for 1959—71; defining a four—input index for 1971—76;

      normalizing both indexes to unity in 1971; and splicing the two indexes

      together in that year.

  18. Because expenditures for business services such as advertising and legal

      services are not accounted for, the value of capital services and capital's

      share in total cost of production are probably slightly overstated.
