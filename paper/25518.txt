Do Immigrants Delay Retirement and Social Security Claiming?

                                           ABSTRACT

As the share of older immigrants residing in the U.S. begins to rise, it is important to understand
how immigrants’ retirement behavior and security compare to that of natives. This question has
implications for the impact of immigration on government finances and for the retirement
security of immigrants. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine
how immigrants’ retirement and Social Security claiming patterns compare to those of natives.
We find that immigrants are significantly less likely than natives to retire or claim Social Security
in their early 60s. We do not find heterogeneous effects by ethnicity or age of arrival to the U.S.
We also find no evidence that immigrants exit the survey at higher rates than U.S. natives in their
late 50s through 60s, a finding that is consistent with immigrants retiring in the U.S. rather than
abroad.

1. Introduction

        Along with the aging of the general U.S. population, the share of older immigrants has
been growing as well. 1 However, the retirement behavior of immigrants remains understudied.
This behavior has implications for the impact of immigration on government finances, and for
the retirement security of an important subgroup of the population. Longer working lives
mitigate the pressure that aging populations place on both public budgets and private savings.
However, retirement can improve health and well-being (e.g., Gorry, Gorry, and Slavov 2018),
and differences across demographic groups in time spent in retirement can have important
distributional implications (Ghilarducci and Webb 2018). The timing of Social Security claiming
can also have important implications for retirement well-being. Social Security retired worker
benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70, with larger monthly benefits available for
later claims. Recent research has shown that this adjustment for delay is actuarially advantageous
for most primary earners and singles (e.g., Meyer and Reichenstein 2010, 2012; Sass, Sun, and
Webb 2013; and Shoven and Slavov 2014a, 2014b), and that delayed claiming can substantially
increase retirement living standards (Bronshtein et al. 2018). In this paper, we use data from the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine how immigrants’ retirement and Social Security
claiming patterns compare to those of natives.
        The existing literature on retirement has documented that in the population overall,
retirement hazards increase sharply at the early Social Security eligibility age (62) and the Social
Security full retirement age (which varies between 65 and 67 depending on birth year). (For
example, see Behagel and Blau 2012.) The probability of retirement is also influenced by health
(e.g., McGarry 2004), the availability of post-retirement health insurance (e.g., Gruber and
Madrian 1995; Kapur and Rogowski 2011; Marton and Woodbury 2006, 2012; Robinson and
Clark 2010; Blau and Gilleskie 2001; Madrian 1994; Strumpf 2010; Nyce et al. 2013), quality of
work (e.g., Siegrist et al. 2007), macroeconomic conditions that affect retirement wealth and job
opportunities (e.g., Gorodnichenko et al. 2013; Goda et al. 2012; Hurd and Reti 2001; Hurd,

  Between 1960 and 2000, the share of immigrants aged 65 and older dropped from 33 percent to 11 percent mainly
because the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act led to in an influx of younger, working-age immigrants (Batalova
2012). However, the share of older immigrants has been increasing recently, with 14.4 percent of the immigrant
population aged 65 years or older in 2016, due to the aging of these working-age immigrants as well as an increase
in the number of older immigrants sponsored by their adult children (Batalova 2012; Wilmoth 2012; Borjas 2011).


                                                                                                                2
Reti, and Rohwedder 2009; Kezdi and Sevak 2004; Coile and Levine 2010), and pension
incentives (e.g., Coile and Gruber 2007).
        There are reasons to believe that immigrants may display different retirement patterns
than the native born. First, immigrants may be less prepared for retirement. Immigrants tend to
have lower Social Security benefits compared to U.S. natives (Sevak and Schmidt 2014,
Favreault and Nichols 2011) due to both lower average earnings and shorter covered earnings
histories. 2 Further, unauthorized migrants residing in the U.S. are not entitled to Social Security
benefits even if they make payroll tax contributions. Immigrants also tend to have lower
retirement wealth and are less likely to take advantage of tax preferred retirement savings
opportunities (Cobb-Clark and Hildebrand 2006; Heim et al. 2012; Osili and Paulson 2009
Fontes 2011). Further, immigrants may have less access to pre-Medicare health insurance that is
independent of employment. These differences suggest that immigrants may work longer than
natives.
        Second, immigrants are likely to face smaller work disincentives from Social Security
compared to natives. Social Security benefits are based on the average of the top 35 years of
earnings, indexed for economy-wide wage growth. Zeros are averaged in for career lengths
shorter than 35 years. Longer careers translate into higher average earnings and monthly
benefits, but there are diminishing returns because the formula mapping earnings to benefits is
progressive. Once 35 years in covered employment have been reached, additional years of work
may have little to no impact on Social Security benefits (even if they are in the top 35 years they
displace a positive rather than a zero earnings year). This pattern creates work disincentives for
individuals with longer covered careers (Goda, Shoven, and Slavov 2009). Immigrants generally
have shorter covered earnings histories than natives because a portion of their working lives was
spent outside the U.S.; thus, they may face smaller work disincentives at older ages.
        Third, differences in health status between immigrants and natives may affect work
capacity. Johnson et al. (2016) report that 59 percent of Hispanic immigrants aged 65 and older
reported fair and poor health compared to 25 percent for non-Hispanic white natives. McGarry
(2004) shows that poor or worsening health reduces the probability of continued work. This
would suggest that immigrants may retire earlier.

2
  These differences are more likely among those who immigrated to the U.S. more recently (who have lower wages
relative to natives, as documented by Favreault and Nichols 2011) or at older ages (who have lower incomes, Social
Security benefits, and Medicare coverage, as documented by O’Neil and Tienda 2014).


                                                                                                                 3
       Finally, immigrants and natives may also have differences in Social Security claiming
patterns. Even though most primary earners and singles can increase their lifetime Social
Security wealth by delaying claiming, most people claim well before 70 (e.g., Goda et al. 2018).
A commonly observed pattern is claiming upon stopping work (e.g., Shoven, Slavov, and Wise
2018). If immigrants work longer than natives, then they may also claim Social Security later
than natives. Claiming need not coincide with retirement if individuals have the private savings
needed to delay claiming beyond retirement. However, most people do not appear to utilize such
a delay strategy even when it is feasible (Goda et al. 2018; Shoven, Slavov, and Wise 2018), and
the strategy may be less feasible for immigrants given the immigrant-native differences in
retirement resources noted above. Mortality also affects claiming incentives. In the U.S. and
other developed countries, researchers have documented an “immigrant paradox” where
immigrants tend to outlive natives despite their lower levels of education, lower levels of wealth,
higher levels of poverty, and poorer access to health care relative to U.S. natives (Blue and
Fenelon 2011; Dupre et al. 2012; Mehta et al. 2016). Empirically, individuals with greater
subjective or actual mortality tend to claim earlier (Goda, Ramnath, Shoven, and Slavov 2018;
Hurd, Smith, and Zissimopoulos 2004; Glickman and Hermes 2015; Beauchamp and Wagner
2012; Waldron 2002).
       Few studies have examined differences in retirement timing between immigrants and
U.S. natives. Mudrazija et al. (2017) show that foreign-born Hispanics tend to retire later than
U.S. born Hispanics or non-Hispanics. Borjas (2011) shows that becoming eligible for Social
Security benefits – which requires 10 years of covered employment – increases the probability of
retirement among older immigrants. Kaushal (2010) shows that older immigrants increased their
labor supply in response to becoming ineligible for Supplemental Security Income under the
1996 welfare reform. Our study is most closely related to Mudrazija et al. (2017), who use a
proportional hazard model to examine differences in retirement timing. We extend their work by
using a more flexible specification of retirement hazards (interacting individual age dummies
with immigrant status) to examine immigrant-native differences in the sharp increases in
retirement rates at key eligibility ages, such as 62 and full retirement age. We also separately
examine Social Security claiming and retirement timing, and we include both Hispanic and non-
Hispanic immigrants in our analysis.
       Finally, we attempt to shed more light on where immigrants retire by examining



                                                                                                 4
differences in the survey exit rates between immigrants and natives. It is possible that some
immigrants choose to retire in their native countries. De Coulon (2016) provides a theoretical
framework to study this decision, but no empirical studies have been done mainly due to the lack
of data on final destinations of immigrants. Kapteyn et al. (2006) document that foreign born
HRS respondents are more likely than average to exit the survey, a finding they argue could be a
result of immigrants returning to their native countries. Thus, we may be able to to gain some
insight into whether immigrants retire abroad by examining how these attrition rates vary with
age. A higher attrition rate for immigrants at ages that coincide with retirement (late 50s through
60s) may indicate a propensity to retire abroad. Trying to understand where immigrants retire has
important implications for both the host and source countries. For example, immigrants returning
to their countries of origin may reduce health care costs for the host country, but increase them
for the county of origin (De Coulon 2016).
       We find that immigrants are significantly less likely than natives to retire in their late 50s
or early 60s, and to claim Social Security before full retirement age. We do not find significant
heterogeneity among immigrants based on Hispanic ethnicity or age of arrival in the U.S. While
immigrants have a higher survey attrition rate overall, this gap seems to narrow at older ages
(late 50s through the 60s). Thus, we do not pick up any evidence of immigrants retiring abroad at
higher rates than natives.


2. Data and Descriptive Statistics

       We use data from the 1992 to 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a
biennial national longitudinal survey of individuals over the age of 50 and their spouses or
partners. The survey began in 1992 with individuals born between 1931 and 1941 (original HRS
cohort). New cohorts were added in 1993 (AHEAD cohort), 1998 (Children of Depression and
War Baby cohorts), 2004 (Early Baby Boomer cohort), and 2010 (Mid Baby Boomer cohort).
For most variables in this analysis, we use the RAND HRS data file (Version P). The RAND
HRS is a cleaned dataset with consistent variables across survey waves derived from a subset of
the original HRS data files. We refer to an individual’s baseline wave as the wave in which the
individual’s cohort entered the sample.
       We drop individuals with missing values for race or Hispanic ethnicity, gender, and
education. Because we are interested in studying transitions from work to retirement, we restrict


                                                                                                   5
the sample to individuals who were working for pay during their baseline wave. We construct
indicators for self-employment status, as well as the occupation and industry for the longest-held
job, during the baseline wave. We drop individuals with missing baseline self-employment
status, and we create separate categories for individuals with missing or “other” baseline
occupation or industry. We construct a measure of household wealth in the baseline wave by
summing the RAND HRS measure of non-housing financial wealth (which excludes retirement
wealth), the household’s total assets in individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and any balances
in the respondent’s or spouse’s defined contribution accounts from their current jobs. 3
         The main independent variable of interest is whether an individual is foreign born. The
HRS reports an individual’s place of birth as either as a Census Division or “not in the U.S.”
(including foreign countries and U.S. territories). We exclude individuals whose birthplace is
unknown. Individuals who were not born in the U.S. were asked about their year of entry into the
U.S. Responses to this question are only available in the original HRS data files; therefore, we
extract and merge this variable with the RAND HRS. Information on date of entry into the U.S.
was taken from the wave in which the individual’s cohort was added to the survey. 4 In addition
to a binary foreign-born indicator, we also construct two alternative indicators that subdivide the
foreign-born sample into Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals, and into immigrants who
entered the U.S. before age 40 and those who entered at age 40 or later. 5 Hispanic immigrants
have limited financial resources and Social Security benefits, and lower levels of education,
relative to other immigrants and U.S. natives, which may delay their retirement. However,
Hispanic immigrants also tend to hold more physically demanding jobs and be in worse health
relative to other immigrants and U.S. natives, which could accelerate their retirement (Johnson et
al. 2016). Immigrants who arrived later have spent a shorter portion of their careers in the U.S.
are more likely to still be accruing significant Social Security benefits at older ages and to have
limited Social Security benefits, factors that tend to delay retirement.

3
  Wealth is in nominal dollars at the time of the survey. Wave dummies in the regressions should absorb the effects
of inflation.
4
  From 1993 onwards, individuals could report either a year of entry, an age of entry, or the number of years ago that
entry occurred. The 1992 and 1993 surveys simply asked respondents when they arrived in the U.S. In 1998, 2004,
and 2010, respondents were asked when they first arrived in the U.S., whether they ever left, and when they
subsequently returned. For these waves, we record the date that the respondent first arrived in the U.S. The 2010
wave includes information about citizenship and naturalization. However, these questions only appear to be asked of
respondents entering the survey in 2010.
5
  The latter indicator also includes a category for foreign born individuals with missing information on age/year of
entry.


                                                                                                                    6
        After constructing baseline wave characteristics, we perform subsequent analysis at the
person-wave level, and we drop any person-wave observations with zero sampling weight; these
are generally individuals who are not part of the target population, such as spouses under the age
of 50 and institutionalized individuals. At the person-wave level, we construct an indicator for
married/partnered status. Because immigrants are more likely to live in larger households with
extended family, and because such living arrangements can affect retirement decisions, we also
create an indicator for whether the household includes members other than the respondent and
spouse. 6 The HRS additionally includes a measure of self-reported health in which individuals
rate their health on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). We construct an indicator that takes on a
value of 1 for excellent, very good, or good health and zero for fair or poor health. Because
retirement timing may depend on macroeconomic conditions and wealth shocks (e.g., Goda et al.
2011), we also merge in the monthly composite S&P 500 index (obtained from
http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) and the monthly regional unemployment rate
(obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics), both matched to the month and year of the
interview. Individuals who have a missing value for region are assigned the monthly national
unemployment rate.
        Defining retirement is problematic. Prior research has shown that retirement is often not a
clean transition. Many individuals who are in the process of retirement gradually reduce hours,
retire temporarily and then go back to work, continue to work after retiring from a career job, or
switch to self-employment with significantly reduced earnings (e.g., Maestas 2010; Ramnath,
Shoven, and Slavov 2017). We construct two separate indicators for retirement. First, we define
retirement as a transition from working for pay to not working for pay. This definition may also
include transitions from work to unemployment, disability, or being out of the labor force.
Second, we define retirement as a transition from self-reporting that one is not retired to self-
reporting that one is retired. It may include people who are working part time but still consider
themselves retired. Each indicator takes on a value of 1 if the individual was not retired in the

6
 In 2015, the foreign born were twice as likely to live in 5 or more person families than the U.S. born (see
http://www.pewhispanic.org/ph_stat-portraits_foreign-born-2015_trends-42b/ ) and Asians, Hispanics, and
immigrants were more likely than whites and U.S. natives to live in multigenerational family households (see
http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-
households/ and http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/03/chapter-3-demographics-of-multi-generational-
households/ )




                                                                                                               7
previous wave and retired in the current wave and zero if the individual was not retired in both
waves. It is missing in all other cases.
         We also construct two indicators for claiming Social Security. We first construct an
indicator for claiming that takes on the value of 1 if an individual was not receiving any Social
Security retirement income in the previous wave and currently receives Social Security
retirement income, and 0 if the individual was not receiving Social Security retirement income in
either wave. It is missing in all other cases. One concern is that some individuals who are not
observed to claim Social Security within the sample period may not be eligible for Social
Security. Unfortunately, the public use HRS data do not allow us to identify individuals who are
eligible. To address this concern, we construct a second claiming indicator that is identical to the
first, except that it excludes all individuals who are either not observed to claim during the
sample period or who leave the sample before age 70. 7 Since Social Security disability benefits
convert to retirement benefits at an individual’s full retirement age, we also exclude individuals
who have ever applied for disability benefits from the Social Security claiming regressions.
Unfortunately, the survey does not include information on the type of Social Security retirement
benefit received (e.g., retired worker, spousal, or survivor). Unlike worker benefits, spousal and
survivor benefits do not grow beyond full retirement age, although they may be claimed early
(subject to a reduction).
         To examine where immigrants choose to retire, we construct an indicator for attrition
that takes on a value of 1 if an individual responded to the survey in the previous wave but did
not respond in the current wave (and was also not indicated to have died). 8 The indicator takes
on a value of 0 if the individual responded in both the previous wave and the current wave. It is
missing in all other cases. In the absence of better data, such an indicator can provide some
preliminary evidence regarding whether immigrants choose to retire abroad.
         Table 1 summarizes our sample selection and indicates both the number of individuals
and the number of person-year observations after each sample restriction. After dropping
individuals who have missing baseline characteristics, we have 144,446 person-year observations

7
  Social Security benefits do not grow with delay past age 70. Thus, claiming after 70 is almost never optimal. A
possible exception is that some individuals (late life immigrants, for example) may not have not accumulated 10
years of covered work by age 70. If these individuals continue to work beyond 70, they could claim once they reach
the required 10 years. We think such cases are rare as most people do not work beyond age 70.
8
  Specifically, we set the attrition indicator to 1 if the RAND HRS variable riwstat is equal to 1 in the previous wave
and either 4 or 7 in the current wave. It is equal to 0 if riwstat is equal to 1 in both the previous and the current
waves.


                                                                                                                      8
and 16,805 individuals. Our retirement and claiming hazard regressions are based on the 67,939
observations (15,215 individuals) with non-missing values for at least one of the retirement or
claiming indicators, as well as non-missing values for all the independent variables (described in
the following section). The attrition hazard regressions are based on the 96,087 observations
(16,192 individuals) with a non-missing value for the dependent variable. Independent variables
in the attrition regressions include only baseline characteristics and age, as other time-varying
characteristics are not available for those who dropped out of the survey.
          Table 2 provides summary statistics for the full sample (left panel), for the foreign-born
subsample (middle panel), and for the Hispanic foreign-born subsample (right panel). The top
panel provides means and standard deviations for the dependent variables used in the analysis.
The next panel down provides means and standard deviations for the foreign-born indicators and
is based on the sample used in the retirement and claiming hazard regressions. Approximately
10 percent of the sample is foreign born, and roughly half of these are Hispanic. The majority of
the foreign born entered before age 40. The next panel down provides summary statistics for the
other independent variables used in the regressions, also based on the sample used in the
retirement and claiming hazard regressions. Comparing the full sample to the foreign born
sample suggests that immigrants are roughly the same age as the full sample, slightly more likely
to be married or partnered, and slightly less like to have some college or higher. Immigrants also
have lower total wealth at baseline and are less likely to report good health relative to the full
sample. Hispanic immigrants are younger, have lower wealth, are much less likely to have some
college or more, and are less likely to report being in good health relative to the full sample or
immigrants overall.

3. Methodology

          Our main objective is to examine immigrant-native differences in retirement and
claiming behavior by estimating the following equation:


(1) 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽7 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                     + 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖




                                                                                                                                         9
where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is one of the two retirement indicators or one of two claiming indicators described
above; 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable indicating whether individual 𝑖𝑖 is foreign born; 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an
indicator of whether individual 𝑖𝑖 has reached full retirement age in wave 𝑡𝑡; and 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector
of dummies for individual 𝑖𝑖’s age at the end of the wave 𝑡𝑡 interview. Age is truncated between
55 and 70 as most retirement and claiming transitions occur during this frame. Full retirement
age varies among individuals in our sample (based on year of birth), and prior research has
shown that individuals tend to retire and claim at whatever age is designated the full retirement
age (Behaghel and Blau 2012). To capture differences between foreign born and native
individuals, we interact the age dummies and the 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicator with our foreign-born
indicator. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is a vector of time-invariant controls for female gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity,
education, household wealth at baseline, occupation and industry of the longest job held at
baseline, and self-employment status at baseline. 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of time-varying controls
including marital status; an indicator for the presence of other household members; and changes
in health status, the log of the S & P 500 index, and the regional unemployment rate between the
current and previous interview. Finally, we include wave fixed effects 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 to control for any time-
invariant factors that affect all individuals in a wave.
        To explore whether attrition from the sample is more likely to occur for the foreign born
at key retirement ages, we estimate the following regression:
  (2) 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖
                       + 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
The dependent variable 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is our attrition indicator for whether individual 𝑖𝑖 left the sample
between wave 𝑡𝑡 − 1 and wave 𝑡𝑡. The independent variables are as defined above. For individuals
who leave the sample, age and full retirement age status are imputed by adding two years to the
age at the previous interview.
        We utilize ordinary least squares to estimate (1) and (2), making our regressions linear
probability models. The estimated coefficient on each age dummy represents the native born
hazard rate relative to the omitted age category (which we set at 55 and younger). The
coefficients on the interactions between the age dummies and foreign-born status indicate the
extent to which the foreign-born hazard rates depart from the native hazard rates at each age. We
explore heterogeneity by estimating equations (1) and (2) using the more detailed specifications
of foreign born (based on Hispanic ethnicity and age at arrival).


                                                                                                                                         10
4. Results

A. Main Results

       Figure 1 and 2 present our main results for retirement and claiming, respectively. Figure
3 presents our main results for attrition. Retirement and claiming hazard regressions include the
full set of control variables, and all regressions utilize HRS person-level analysis weights.
Results without controls are similar and are available upon request. In the left panel of each
figure, the vertical axis labels indicate the age dummies, the full retirement age dummy, and the
constant term from equation (1) (in Figures 1 and 2) or equation (2) (in Figure 3). The dots
indicate the point estimates of each coefficient, and the horizontal line running through each dot
represents a 95 percent confidence interval calculated using robust standard errors. The omitted
category of 55 (and younger) is represented by the constant term, and the remaining age
coefficients indicate the probability of a native-born individual retiring at the indicated age
relative to age 55. In the right panel of each figure, the constant term corresponds to the
coefficient of the foreign-born dummy and represents immigrant-native differences in the
probability of retiring (Figure 1), claiming (Figure 2), or leaving (Figure 3) at age 55 or younger.
This coefficient is insignificant in almost all our retirement and claiming regressions. The
remaining age coefficients correspond to the interaction terms between the age and the foreign-
born indicators, and they indicate the increase in the foreign-born hazard relative to the native-
born hazard.
       Figure 1a is based on the first definition of retirement (transition from working for pay to
not working for pay) and Figure 1b is based on the second definition of retirement (transition
from not retired to retired). The left panel of Figure 1a indicates that native born individuals are
15 percentage points more likely to transition to retirement at age 62 relative to age 55. The right
panel of Figure 1b indicates that the increase in the probability of retiring at 62, compared to the
omitted category of 55, is 9.5 percentage points lower for the foreign born than natives. Both
coefficients are significant at the 5 percent level as the confidence intervals do not cross the
vertical axis. In Figure 1b, natives are 22 percentage points more likely to retire at age 62 than at
age 55 (left panel), but the increase in the hazard of retirement at that age is 11 percentage points
less for immigrants (right panel). Overall, these figures suggest that immigrants are less likely to



                                                                                                  11
retire in their late 50s and early 60s than U.S. natives. Point estimates suggest that immigrants
may be more likely to retire in their late 60s than natives (conditional on still working at those
ages), but sample sizes at these older ages are small and most differences are statistically
insignificant.
        Figure 2 shows a similar pattern when it comes to claiming Social Security. In the two
left panels, the constant terms, and coefficients on ages 56 through 61, suggest that the
probability of claiming Social Security before age 62 is very close to zero. This result is not
surprising since 62 is the earliest eligibility age for a retired worker benefit (although survivor
benefits can be claimed as early as 60). The two right panels suggest that immigrant status does
not affect these pre-62 probabilities. The left panel of Figure 2a shows that, based on our first
indicator of claiming, the probability of claiming at age 62 for natives jumps to 16 percent. The
right panel shows that this probability is 5.9 percentage points lower for immigrants. It also
shows that immigrants are 24 percentage points more likely than natives to claim at age 69 and
12 percentage points more likely than natives to claim at age 70 (conditional on not having
claimed yet), possibly because natives who have not claimed by their late 60s are ineligible for
Social Security. We find similar results using our second indicator of claiming, which is
conditional on claiming within the sample period and being observed through age 70. However,
immigrant-native differences at older ages are not statistically significant when we condition on
claiming within the sample period.
        The left panel of Figure 3 shows that U.S. natives are less likely to leave the sample at
ages 64 and older relative to age 55. The right panel shows that while immigrants are more likely
than natives to leave the sample at age 55 and younger (the coefficient on the foreign-born
dummy is negative and significant), that gap narrows at traditional retirement ages in the late 50s
and 60s. These results provide no evidence to suggest that immigrants are retiring abroad. These
results are far from definitive, as there are many other reasons why people might leave the
survey. However, given how little is known about where immigrants retire, it is useful to learn
that this attrition indicator alone provides no evidence that immigrants leave the U.S. to retire in
their country of origin or another country.


B. Analysis of Heterogeneity




                                                                                                 12
       Examining differences in retirement and claiming patterns by ethnicity and age at arrival
can shed further light on the behavior of immigrants versus natives. Figures 4 and 5 report
retirement and claiming hazards with both the foreign-born and native-born sample split by
Hispanic ethnicity. Figures 6 and 7 report similar results with the foreign-born sample split by
whether they arrived in the U.S. before or after age 40. Figure 8a shows results for attrition
broken down by Hispanic ethnicity, and Figure 8b does the same for age of arrival. In each
figure, the top left panel shows the coefficients on the age dummies from equation (1) for the
omitted base group (native born non-Hispanic in Figures 4, 5, and 8a; and all native born in
Figures 6, 7, and 8b). The omitted age category is 55 and younger, represented by the constant
term. The remaining panels show coefficients on the interactions between the age dummies and
other categories. In Figures 4, 5, and 8a, the other categories include native-born Hispanic,
foreign-born Hispanic, and foreign-born non-Hispanic. In Figures 6, 7, and 8b, the other
categories include foreign-born who entered before age 40 and foreign born who entered after
age 40. The constant terms in these remaining panels represent the coefficient on the relevant
foreign-born sub-category and corresponds to the impact of that category at the omitted age
category of 55 and younger.
       Figure 4a presents results for our first retirement indicator. The left panel shows that the
probability of retiring for non-Hispanic U.S. natives rises sharply in the early 60s (relative to 55
and younger). There are no statistically significant differences in retirement behavior when non-
Hispanic U.S. natives are compared to Hispanic U.S. natives or Hispanic immigrants. However,
non-Hispanic immigrants are less likely than natives to retire at 62 (versus 55) and possibly more
likely to retire after full retirement age (conditional on not having retired by then). Figure 4b
shows results for our second retirement indicator, and again we find no statistically significant
differences in retirement between non-Hispanic U.S. natives and Hispanic U.S. natives.
However, Hispanic and non-Hispanic immigrants are less likely than non-Hispanic U.S. natives
to retire in their late 50s and early 60s. Figure 5 shows that there are almost no statistically
significant differences (at the 5 percent level) in Social Security claiming between non-Hispanic
natives and Hispanic natives. Compared to these groups, Hispanic and non-Hispanic immigrants
are less likely to claim before full retirement age.
       Figure 6 suggests that regardless of age of arrival, immigrants are less likely than natives
to retire in their late 50s or early 60s (relative to the omitted age group of 55 and below). These



                                                                                                 13
results are stronger for the second definition of retirement. Figure 7 shows that regardless of the
age when immigrants arrived, they are less likely than U.S. natives to claim at Social Security
early. Thus, it appears that nativity status is more important than either age of arrival or ethnicity
in driving retirement and claiming decisions.
       Finally, Figures 8a and 8b suggest that the attrition gap between immigrants and natives
either stays the same or narrows at traditional retirement ages regardless of age of arrival or
Hispanic ethnicity.


5. Conclusion
       This paper provides descriptive evidence of immigrant-native differences in the timing of
retirement and Social Security claiming. We show that immigrants are less likely than natives to
retire or claim Social Security early. Our analysis does not allow us to determine what causes
these differences. In fact, there are several plausible explanations. First, immigrants may be less
prepared for retirement. Our regressions control for household wealth in the baseline wave, and
controlling for wealth does not alter our key results. This finding suggests that retirement
preparedness may not be driving the differences we find. However, our measure of wealth is not
comprehensive, as it does not include defined benefit pensions or Social Security wealth, or
access to pre-Medicare non-employment-based health insurance. Second, because of the Social
Security benefit formula – which is based on the highest 35 years of earnings – immigrants are
more likely than natives to receive a substantial boost to their Social Security benefits from
additional years of work. Third, immigrants may differ from natives in terms of health status.
The generally lower self-reported health of immigrants would suggest that immigrants retire
earlier than natives, which is contrary to our findings. Moreover, controlling for self-reported
health does not alter our findings. We have obviously not controlled for all unobservable aspects
of health. As noted earlier, immigrants do tend to have lower mortality than natives even after
controlling for observables, and lower mortality may indicate an aspect of health that is not
captured by our self-reported health measure. If immigrants retire later than natives, it is not
surprising that they also claim Social Security later, as claiming Social Security upon retirement
is a common practice. Delaying claiming is also consistent with the lower mortality experienced
by immigrants. Finally, we show that immigrants are not more likely than natives to exit the
survey at traditional retirement ages in the late 50s and 60s. In the absence of better data, these



                                                                                                   14
attrition rates are a good starting point to better understand where immigrants are choosing to
retire.
          These results have implications for the retirement security and general well-being of
immigrants. While delaying both retirement and Social Security claiming can have a large
impact on retirement standard of living, differences in the length of retirement may represent an
inequity that policy makers care about. Retirement and claiming choices also have important
implications for the finances of Social Security, and the public sector budget more generally.
Finally, beginning to understand where immigrants might retire has important financial
implications         for      both        the      host       and        source        countries.
