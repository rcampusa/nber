                                                ABSTRACT

Defining as normal cash holdings the holdings a firm with the same characteristics would have had
in the late 1990s, we find that the abnormal cash holdings of U.S. firms after the crisis represent on
average 1.86% of assets. While U.S. firms held less cash than comparable foreign firms in the late
1990s, by 2010 they hold more. However, only U.S. multinational firms experience an increase in
abnormal cash holdings during the 2000s. U.S. multinational firms had cash holdings similar to those
of purely domestic firms in the late 1990s, but they hold over 3% more assets in cash than comparable
purely domestic firms after the crisis. Further, U.S. multinationals increased their cash holdings since
the late 1990s relative to foreign multinationals by roughly the same percentage as they increased their
cash holdings relative to U.S. domestic firms. A detailed analysis shows that the increase in cash holdings
of multinational firms cannot be explained by the tax treatment of profit repatriations, that it is intrinsically
linked to their R&D intensity, and that firms that become multinational do not increase their abnormal
cash holdings after they become multinational. There is no evidence that poor investment opportunities,
regulation, or poor governance can explain the abnormal cash holdings of U.S. firms after the crisis.

1. Introduction

    Since the financial crisis, considerable attention has been paid to the apparently record high cash

holdings of American firms. A common view is that companies have been hoarding cash while shying

“away from investing for the future.”1 As one headline puts it, “Firms have record $800 billion of cash

but still won’t hire.”2 The high cash holdings have been attributed to many factors, but many observers

have argued that firms do not invest and accumulate cash because of a poor regulatory climate and

excessive uncertainty. An article states, for instance, that “Companies are hoarding a record amount of

cash as fears of another Lehman-like credit crisis, weak demand and a lack of incentives from the Obama

Administration cause chief executives to choose a negative real return on their money over hiring workers

or building a new plant.”3 Another explanation frequently mentioned for the high cash holdings of

American firms is that repatriation of cash held abroad by multinationals has adverse tax consequences,

so that it is advantageous to keep their profits abroad in the form of cash. For instance, an article in the

New York Times noting the increase in cash holdings of multinationals states that “Tax policy is driving

much of this trend.”4

    In this paper, we investigate whether the cash holdings of American companies are abnormally high

after the financial crisis and whether these cash holdings can be explained by the theories summarized in

the previous paragraph. We show that the extent to which cash holdings are unusually high after the crisis

depends critically on the measure used. We would expect larger firms to hold more cash. Since corporate

assets tend to grow over time, the dollar amount of cash holdings would grow even if the ratio of cash to

assets stays constant. Consequently, at the very least, cash holdings should be measured relative to a

firm’s assets. Using all non-financial and non-regulated public firms with assets and market capitalization

greater than $5 million per year, the average cash/assets ratio is 20.18% in 2009-2010 compared to

20.50% in the 2004-2006 pre-crisis period. However, when we consider the median ratio, it is higher by

0.87% in 2009-2010 than in 2004-2006. Similarly, the asset-weighted ratio is higher by 0.74% in the

recent period. The larger increase in the asset-weighted ratio than in the equally-weighted ratio suggests

that large firms increased their holdings more and we show that this is the case. However, the changes in

cash holdings from 2004-2006 to 2009-2010 are dwarfed by the changes in cash holdings from 1998-

2000 to 2004-2006. Over that latter period, the average cash/assets ratio increases by 3.77%, the median

by 6.39%, and the asset-weighted average by 3.62%. When we distinguish between private and public

firms, we show that there is no evidence of an increase in the cash/assets ratio for private firms.

       Having established that cash holdings are much higher during the 2000s than in the late 1990s, and

higher after the crisis than before for some measures, we investigate whether this increase in cash

holdings is a U.S. phenomenon or a worldwide phenomenon. Cash/assets ratios increase across the world

in the 2000s compared to the late 1990s. However, the increase in average cash holdings across the world

is smaller than the increase in average cash holdings in the U.S. A striking result is that median cash

holdings in the US in the late 1990s are lower than median cash holdings in foreign countries, but the

opposite is true by 2010. As for U.S. firms, there is little evidence of an increase in average cash holdings

from the pre-crisis period to the post-crisis period for foreign firms.

       While univariate statistics of the cash/assets ratio are useful to understand how cash holdings have

changed over time and differ across countries, they are of little help in assessing whether the cash

holdings are somehow abnormal or unusual. There is a vast literature that explains that cash holdings are

related to firm characteristics. Among other results, this literature shows that firms with more growth

opportunities hold more cash, firms with more uncertain prospects hold more cash, and firms with higher

capital expenditures hold less cash.5 Over time, firms drop out or enter the sample, the characteristics of

firms that stay in the sample can change, and macroeconomic conditions evolve. As a result, comparisons

of cash holdings that do not take into account firm characteristics may be comparisons across firm

populations with different characteristics, so that it is possible that cash holdings have changed simply

because firm characteristics have changed. If this were the case, there might be nothing abnormal about

    See, for instance, Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (1999).

the large cash holdings of American firms in recent years. Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009) show that

changes in firm characteristics explain much of the increase in cash holdings in the 1980s and 1990s.

    To evaluate whether the cash holdings of American firms are abnormal, a benchmark is required. We

have to estimate what the cash holdings of American firms would be under normal circumstances. Ideally,

we would have good theoretical models that would predict cash holdings given the known motivations for

firms to hold cash. Unfortunately, such models do not exist. The alternative approach is to use an

empirical model that captures cash holdings well before the 2000s. The approach of using an empirical

model to assess normal cash holdings is widely used in the literature on cash holdings following its

introduction by Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz and Williamson (1999). With such a model, the empirical

analysis evaluates how cash holdings differ from the cash holdings predicted by that model. One approach

would be to estimate such a model of cash holdings for U.S. firms in the late 1990s and then use that

model in the 2000s to estimate abnormal cash holdings. The problem with this approach is that it does not

make it possible to evaluate whether the high recent cash holdings of U.S. firms are an American

phenomenon or a global one. The implications of the high cash holdings of American firms would be

quite different if American firms behaved like similar firms in other countries. If that were the case, many

of the explanations for the high cash holdings of U.S. firms would make no sense. In particular, features

of the U.S. tax code or of the U.S. regulatory system could not explain these holdings.

    We therefore use a model that explains cash holdings of firms across the globe. We find that at the

end of the 1990s, the holdings of cash of foreign firms are lower by 1.01% of assets than the holdings of

comparable U.S. firms. Estimating this model every year, we find that as the 2000s evolve, the gap

between foreign firms and comparable U.S. firms increases steadily, so that in 2009-2010 foreign firms

hold 3.19% less of their assets in cash than comparable U.S. firms. Strikingly, U.S. firms increased their

abnormal cash holdings relative to comparable firms from the Eurozone. We would expect that

macroeconomic uncertainty concerns would be greater within the Eurozone, so that this result makes it

questionable that the high cash holdings of U.S. firms can be explained purely by U.S. macroeconomic

uncertainty. A concern with this approach is that the regression model will fit cash holdings over time. On

                                                     3
average, cash holdings will not be abnormal across the globe. Hence, such a model could distort the

extent to which patterns of cash holdings have changed as it will try to explain them using firm

characteristics.

    Our sample has 45 countries and for 82% of these countries we find that in the 2009-2010 period

firms have lower cash holdings than comparable U.S. firms. While there are some types of countries

where firms held as much cash as U.S. firms at the end of the 1990s, there is no type of country other than

tax havens where firms hold more cash than U.S. firms after the crisis. In particular, U.S. firms hold more

cash than comparable firms whether these firms are in developed countries or not, in common law

countries or not, in countries that tax income worldwide or not, and in Eurozone countries or not.

Additionally, we use the cross-country comparisons to investigate whether the change in cash holdings of

firms in a country is related to how much that country was affected by the financial crisis. We find that

cash holdings increase more in countries that were less affected by the crisis.

    An alternative way to use the regression model is to estimate over time the cash holdings firms would

have if they held cash as they did in the late 1990s. This approach produces estimates of abnormal cash

holdings relative to the cash holdings firms would have if the determinants of cash holdings were the

same as in the late 1990s. With this approach, we again find that U.S. cash holdings become abnormal

over time. Strikingly, foreign firms hold abnormally low cash during much of the 2000s. While American

firms have abnormal cash holdings of 1.86% of assets on average during 2009-2010 relative to the 1998-

2000 benchmark, the average abnormal cash holdings of foreign firms are -0.14%.

    We investigate various hypotheses that have been advanced for the increase in cash holdings of U.S.

firms. The hypotheses discussed in the first paragraph of this section imply that different types of firms

have different changes in cash holdings. We therefore focus much of our analysis on comparing the

evolution of cash holdings for different types of firms. For each firm-type classification, we assign firms

before the start of the period we consider. Except for large firms, high capital expenditure firms, firms

with poor governance and financially constrained firms, all types of firms we consider have positive

abnormal cash holdings after the crisis. Since firms with high capital expenditures do not have abnormal

                                                      4
cash holdings, our results would seem to suggest that low investment is part of the explanation for high

cash holdings. However, the high investment firms do not experience a change in abnormal cash holdings

throughout the sample period, so that their lack of abnormal cash holdings after the crisis is not different

from their lack of abnormal cash holdings before the crisis. The agency hypothesis for the increase in cash

holdings suggests that firms with poorer governance should have a greater increase in cash holdings. We

find the opposite result when we measure governance by the GIM index. Further, firms whose stock price

was more adversely affected by the adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley did not increase their cash holdings more

from the late 1990s to the period after the adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley than the other firms. While

abnormal cash holdings increase for multinational firms, they do not increase for purely domestic firms.

Consequently, it is possible that the increase in abnormal cash holdings of U.S. firms could be explained

by the tax treatment of repatriations.

    Before examining the cash holdings of multinationals in more detail, we investigate how the cash

holdings of various types of U.S. firms compare to the cash holdings of similar types of foreign firms. We

find that typically the cash holdings of U.S. firms are higher than those of comparable foreign firms. For

instance, American firms that have high R&D expenditures have higher abnormal cash holdings than

similar foreign firms. Similar results obtain for multinational companies. However, the abnormal cash

holdings of American firms are not higher than those of foreign firms for the most profitable firms and for

the firms that have the highest capital expenditures. Further, large foreign firms have higher cash holdings

than similar U.S. firms. For all types of firms except for the firms with the highest cash flows, with the

highest capital expenditures, and the most reliance on equity financing, abnormal cash holdings of

American firms increase during the 2000s compared to abnormal cash holdings of foreign firms.

Strikingly, the increase in cash holdings of U.S. multinationals compared to foreign multinationals is

comparable to the increase in cash holdings of U.S. multinationals compared to U.S. purely domestic

firms.

    We find that U.S. multinationals held comparable amounts of cash than purely domestic firms in the

late 1990s, but now hold significantly more cash than similar purely domestic firms. Since the increase in

                                                     5
cash holdings of U.S. firms is concentrated among multinational firms, we investigate why the cash

holdings of U.S. multinationals increased so much and whether the increase is explained by the tax

treatment of repatriations. Foley, Hartzell, Titman, and Twite (2007) show that the tax treatment of

remittances makes it advantageous for multinationals to keep their earnings abroad and they find that

firms for which repatriation is more costly hold more cash. Our findings suggest that the tax costs of

repatriation are not the whole story for the increase in cash holdings of U.S. multinationals in the 2000s.

We find that the Homeland Investment Act of 2004, which was designed to reduce momentarily the tax

cost of repatriation, failed to reduce the cash holdings of multinational firms. There are at least two

explanations for this finding. First, it could be that the incentives of the Act were insufficient to affect

firms’ cash holdings. Second, the repatriation tax costs could affect more where firms locate their cash

rather than how much cash they hold. We expect that the tax cost of repatriation would be more important

for high cash flow multinationals, but empirically these multinationals do not hold more cash than low

cash flow multinationals. The increase in cash holdings of multinationals is strongly related to their R&D

intensity, so that multinationals with no R&D expenditures do not have an increase in abnormal cash

holdings compared to domestic firms with no R&D expenditures. Further, a striking result is that, among

high R&D spending firms, firms that were already multinationals before 1998 do not hold more cash now

than firms that were purely domestic firms before 1998. Among these firms, cash holdings increase

sharply for multinationals relative to purely domestic firms, but that is because the cash holdings of

multinationals are becoming more comparable to the cash holdings of purely domestic firms. Finally, and

perhaps most importantly, we find no evidence that firms that become multinationals start holding more

cash after they become multinationals. It appears that firms that become multinationals are firms with

attributes that lead them to hold large amounts of abnormal cash even before they become multinationals.

    The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we show how cash holdings evolved for U.S. public

firms, private firms, and foreign firms. In Section 3, we present our benchmark model, show how

abnormal cash holdings differ between U.S. and foreign firms over time, and explore whether country

characteristics can explain these differences. In Section 4, we use our benchmark model to test hypotheses

                                                     6
about the increase in cash holdings for U.S. firms. We examine why multinationals have such high cash

holdings in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.



2. The evolution of cash holdings

    In this section, we examine the evolution of cash holdings of American public firms since the late

1990s compared to American private firms and foreign firms.



2.a. The cash holdings of American public firms

    We first show that cash holdings of public firms evolved in the 2000s and whether they are higher

after the financial crisis than before. We use Compustat to construct our U.S. sample. We include all

publicly traded industrial firms with assets and market capitalization (in year 2000 dollars) greater than $5

million. Financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6999) and utilities (SIC 4900-4999) are excluded from our main

analyses, although we later examine utilities relative to industrial firms.

    Figure 1 shows the holdings of cash of the 2000s in a long-run perspective. The high cash holdings

after 2000 stand out relative to the experience of the U.S. over the last fifty years. The Figure shows that

the mean holdings reach levels in the 2000s that were not reached since data became available to compute

the mean in 1950.

    In Panel A of Table 1, we show three measures of cash holdings to total assets for each year from

1998 to 2010. We start in 1998 so that we can have a pre-2000s benchmark. The first measure is an

equally-weighted average. The second measure is the median. The third measure is an asset-weighted

average. Considering first the equally-weighted measure, it was at 15.51% in 1998 and 20.28% in 2010.

However, it was higher in 2004 and 2005 than in 2010. Its highest value in the 2000s was in 2004, when

it was 20.65%. Consequently, using the equally-weighted average, the cash holdings after the crisis are

not higher than the previous peak in cash holdings of 2004. Turning next to the median holdings, we see

that they increase more than the mean holdings. Further, the median holdings are higher after the crisis

than in the mid-2000s. The peak median cash/assets ratio before the crisis is 13.46% in 2005, which is 73

                                                       7
basis points less than the peak after the crisis of 14.19%. The last column of Panel A of Table 1 shows the

asset-weighted cash holdings. The asset-weighted cash holdings correspond to the total amount of cash

held by corporations in the sample divided by the total assets. The pre-crisis peak in asset-weighted

holdings is essentially the same as the post-crisis peak – 11.77% versus 11.83%.

    In Panel B of Table 1, we show the statistics for the three periods we will focus on in the remainder of

the paper. The first period is 1998-2000, the second is the pre-crisis period of 2004-2006, and the third

one is the post-crisis period of 2009-2010. The motivation for these periods is straightforward. We want

to understand the post-crisis holdings and whether they are different from pre-crisis holdings. Further, we

want to assess whether the change in cash holdings from before the crisis to after the crisis has similar

patterns to the change in cash holdings from the late 1990s to before the crisis. Note that all our cash

holdings data are end of year data, so that 2009 data are for fiscal year-ends after June 2009. Most of the

data for 2009 is for the end of December 2009. Consequently, the data for 2009 correspond to a time after

the end of the recession. It also corresponds to a time after the financial panic of 2008. Not surprisingly,

cash holdings are higher in 2004-2006 and 2009-2010 than in 1998-2000 for all measures.

    As much attention has been paid to the extremely large cash holdings of a handful of firms, we

explore whether dollar cash holdings have become more concentrated. The top five dollar holdings of

cash in 2010 are in decreasing order Apple, $51 billion, Microsoft, $46 billion, Cisco, $40 billion,

Google, $35 billion, and Oracle, $29 billion.6 We compute the Gini coefficient of cash holdings and of

assets for our sample. Figure 2 shows the results. We see that holdings of cash and assets are extremely

concentrated. By way of comparison, the Gini coefficient for income in the U.S. was 46.2 in 2000 and

46.8 in 2009. We see that there is an increase in the concentration of cash holdings, but that increase takes

place early in the 2000s. Since then, the concentration of cash holdings has remained about the same.




6
 Our measure of cash holdings, which is standard in academic research, includes cash and short-term investments.
Some companies include in statements they make about their cash holdings some items from long-term investments.
Consequently, public statements of cash available by companies may reveal larger cash holdings than the ones we
measure.

                                                       8
2.b. A comparison of cash holdings of public firms to those of private firms

    There is no database for private firms comparable to Compustat. Existing studies that investigate

holdings of cash on samples of private firms show that these firms have lower cash holdings than public

firms (Gao, Harford, Li (2011) and Farre-Mensa (2011)). To assess holdings of cash by private firms, we

use aggregate data from the flow of funds accounts and subtract from it the holdings by the Compustat

firms. More specifically, we use the data collected from the Federal Reserve flow of funds accounts

release Z.1. We use the data from B.102 “Balance Sheet of Nonfarm Nonfinancial Corporate Business,”

data items and line numbers are shown in the Data Appendix. From the quarterly Compustat data, we

determine public cash holdings based on all publicly traded firms (stko = 0), which are U.S. based

(fic=”USA”) and reported in U.S. dollars (curcd=”USD”). Additionally, we omit financial firms (SIC

between 6000 and 6999), but not utilities because SIC 4900-4999 would be included in the private firms.

In each quarter we calculate the sum of assets (atq) and cash and marketable securities (cheq) on

Compustat. We define assets (cash) held by private firms to be the total assets (cash) from the flow-of-

funds balance sheet data less the aggregate assets (cash) held by Compustat firms. Figure 3 shows the

results of this calculation. While the holdings of cash by public firms in the 1990s have been well

documented, those of private firms have not. Therefore, we start our sample period for private firms in

1990.

    Panel A of Figure 3 shows that about 45% of U.S. corporate assets are held by public corporations.

This figure is reasonably stable across the twenty years, with the range varying from 40% to 50%.

Conversely, the percentage of corporate cash held by public companies skyrockets from about 45% to

roughly 80% at the end of the sample. In Panel B of Figure 3, we plot the ratio of total cash held by

public firms to total assets. This ratio is equivalent to the asset-weighted ratio of Table 1. We plot the

same ratio for private firms. As shown in Panel B of Figure 3, in a direct comparison of aggregate cash to

assets, private firms’ cash/assets ratio decreases from 4% to 3% over the entire sample. Public firms on

the other hand have their cash/assets ratio increase from 5% in 1990 to almost 12% in 2010. It follows

from this that only public firms increase their cash ratios systematically over the 2000s. The holdings of

                                                    9
cash by private firms increase slightly after the crisis, but this increase stands in sharp contrast with the

increase for public firms.



2.c. A comparison of cash holdings of U.S. public firms to those of foreign public firms

    We use Compustat Global for our data on foreign firms. We only include firms that have at least $5

million in assets and market capitalization. Foreign currency data are converted to dollars using the

annual exchange rate from Compustat. For stock variables, we use the prevailing exchange rate at the end

of the firm’s fiscal year. For flow variables, we use the average of monthly exchange rates during the

fiscal year. Table 2 shows the distribution of firms, for which we have complete data, across countries

over our sample period. We eliminate financial firms and utilities. We require a country to have at least 5

firms with data in each of the 13 years. The average total number of firms per year is 14,209. We use the

definition of advanced countries from the IMF. All non-advanced countries are classified as developing

countries. We have data from 45 countries besides the U.S. of which there are 26 advanced countries and

19 developing countries. There is substantial variation in the number of firms across countries and within

countries over the sample period. We see that the mean number of firms from the U.S. is 2,963, but

twenty-one foreign countries have less than 100 firms per year on average. Japan has almost as many

firms on average as the U.S.

    Figure 4 and Table 3 show results. As in Table 1, we start in 1998. When comparing U.S. firms to

foreign firms, we could compare the U.S. firms to all foreign firms. The problem with this comparison is

that an average of foreign firms will be dominated by data from a handful of countries. To avoid this

problem, we compare average cash holdings across countries. We therefore compute a cash ratio mean (or

median) at the country level and then average these measures across countries. It is immediately clear

from Table 3 that U.S. firms hold significantly more cash than foreign firms when we compare mean

holdings across the world. They do so for each period. We consider separately advanced countries from

which we exclude Japan and the UK. The UK is a country that is more comparable to the U.S. than any

other, which makes the direct comparison especially interesting. Japan is already known from the

                                                     10
literature to be a country with higher cash holdings than other countries (see Pinkowitz and Williamson

(2003)). The U.S. holds more cash than advanced countries (without the UK and Japan), the UK, and

Japan for each period. The same result holds for developing countries and for Eurozone countries. When

we turn to medians, the U.S. firms have similar cash holdings as foreign firms in the late 1990s, except

that they hold less cash than Japanese firms. In the 2000s, the U.S. firms hold significantly more cash

than all groups of foreign firms except for Japanese firms in the most recent period.

    In Figure 4, we normalize all mean cash/assets ratios to 1 in 1998. As shown in Panel A of Figure 4,

cash holdings increase from the late 1990s to the 2000s for firms in most countries. The U.S. percentage

increase relative to 1998 is always higher than the comparison countries except in 2008 where developing

countries have higher cash relative to 1998 than the U.S. With the median holdings, the increase is

sharply less for all foreign groups of countries. Panel B of Figure 4 shows the evolution of the medians,

again normalizing to 1 for 1998. The U.S. stands out dramatically for the medians.

    When we turn to the change in cash holdings from the pre-crisis period to the post-crisis period, the

mean holdings do not change much in foreign countries or in the U.S. Similarly, median cash holdings are

not very different after the crisis compared to their peak before the crisis. In a comparison of cash

holdings between the peak before the crisis to after the crisis, the most striking difference is for the UK,

where cash holdings are noticeably lower after the crisis compared to their pre-crisis peak, and for Japan,

where cash holdings are noticeably higher after the crisis compared to their pre-crisis peak. In these

comparisons, the U.S. does not stand out.



3. Can firm or country differences account for the higher cash holdings of US firms?

    The comparisons presented in Section 2 were comparisons of the ratio of cash to assets. It is well-

known that there are predictable differences in cash holdings across firms. A classic theory of cash

holdings, which is that firms hold cash for transaction purposes (Miller and Orr (1966)), shows that cash

holdings as a percentage of assets should fall as firm size increases. Another classic theory, the

precautionary theory of cash holdings (Keynes (1936)), predicts that riskier firms and firms with more

                                                    11
growth opportunities should hold more cash. Finally, much attention has been paid in the literature to the

cash build-up resulting from a lack of investment opportunities for firms and the reluctance of managers

to pay out the cash to shareholders (Jensen (1986)). There is a large empirical literature that investigates

the relative importance of these motives to hold cash. It could therefore be that differences in cash

holdings between U.S. firms and foreign firms can be explained by differences in firm characteristics. In

this section, we first estimate a model of normal cash holdings, we then show how abnormal cash

holdings from that model changes over time and across countries. Finally, we explore whether abnormal

cash holdings are related to country characteristics.



3.a. The model of normal cash holdings

    To obtain estimates of predicted or normal cash holdings, we use the model of Bates, Kahle, and

Stulz (2009). This model makes cash holdings depend on variables that proxy for the motives to hold cash

that have been analyzed in the literature. Similar models have been used widely through the literature on

cash holdings of U.S. firms. Here, we differ from the literature in that we estimate a worldwide model of

cash holdings allowing for country fixed effects. Such a model is necessary for us to understand how cash

holdings of U.S. firms differ from holdings of comparable foreign firms.

    Table 4 shows time-series averages of country means and medians of firm characteristics that are

used in the model for the U.S. and for groups of foreign countries. The literature shows that cash is

increasing in the ratio of the market value of assets to their book value (see, for instance, Opler,

Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (1999)). Not surprisingly, this ratio differs substantially across

countries. It is also much higher for U.S. firms, which could help explain why U.S. firms have larger cash

holdings. The transactions motive predicts that the cash ratio should fall with firm size. We see that U.S.

firm size, measured by the logarithm of the real value of assets, is higher than for some countries and

lower than for others. Firms with higher cash flow accumulate more cash, but they also need to keep less

cash in reserve since they can replenish their holdings more quickly. Cash flow has a lower mean but

higher median for U.S. firms. The non-cash part of net working capital is a substitute for cash. We see

                                                        12
that U.S. firms have much higher net working capital than foreign firms. The argument that firms hold

more cash when they invest less suggests that capital expenditures are related to cash holdings. There is

little difference in capital expenditures across countries, except that they are lower in Japan and the UK.

We would expect leverage to be related to cash holdings as it would make little sense for a firm to hold

vast amounts of cash while it is heavily indebted. There are no dramatic differences in leverage across

countries. R&D expenditures are often viewed as a proxy for growth opportunities. Further, it is more

difficult to borrow to finance R&D expenditures than to finance capital expenditures. We would therefore

expect the precautionary motive to be stronger for high R&D spending firms. The Table shows that U.S.

firms have more R&D spending relative to sales than typical foreign firms. Dividend payments reduce

cash. U.S. firms are less likely to be dividend payers than foreign firms. U.S. firms are more likely to

spend on acquisitions than foreign firms. Finally, we show that U.S. firms raise more funds through

equity issuance than foreign firms but less through debt issuance. Existing evidence suggests that firms

retain more cash from equity issues than from debt issuance (see McLean (2011)).

    Table 5 shows our regression estimates across years. We estimate the model with country fixed

effects. We see that cash holdings increase with industry cash flow volatility, market-to-book, R&D

expenditures, debt issuance and equity issuance. Cash holdings decrease with size, cash flow, net working

capital, capital expenditures, leverage and acquisitions. Whether a firm is a dividend payer or not is not

related to cash holdings. The estimates are fairly similar to those of Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009) even

though the samples are very different. Here, we use a world-wide sample from 1998 to 2010. They

estimate their regressions over the period of 1980 to 2006 for U.S. firms. We estimate the regression year

by year from 1998 to 2010. The only noteworthy difference is that cash flow has a positive coefficient in

Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009), while here it varies over time, being mostly significantly negative but

significantly positive in the last year. Except for cash flow, there is no dramatic variation in the

coefficients over time. The only coefficient that loses significance in addition to cash flow is equity

issuance which is insignificant in 2001, 2002, and 2008. The regression has more explanatory power early

in the sample, but not dramatically so.

                                                    13
3.b. Country-level estimates of abnormal cash holdings

    To examine whether differences in firm characteristics explain cross-country differences in cash

holdings, we proceed in a way that is standard in the literature, in that we examine abnormal cash

holdings, which are cash holdings that are not explained by a regression model that reflects the

motivations to hold cash. We use the models presented in Table 5 and rely on the country indicator

variables to make our inferences. In these models, the country indicator variables measure how, for given

firm characteristics, cash holdings differ in each country relative to the U.S. These country indicator

variables are a measure of abnormal cash holdings of foreign firms relative to U.S. firms. Alternatively,

when the country indicator variable is multiplied by minus one, it measures the abnormal cash holdings of

U.S. firms relative to foreign firms. The results are shown in Panel A of Table 6. The first column shows

the average country indicator variable across all countries. The average indicator variable is not

significant in 1998, 2000 and 2001. In 1999, it takes a value of -1.08%, which means that on average

firms in a foreign country have 1.08% less of assets in cash than comparable U.S. firms. After 2001, the

indicator dummy variable is always significant. Except for a large increase in 2008, it never experiences a

material increase but it decreases substantially as by 2010 it is -3.11%. Comparing the abnormal cash

measure to the differences in cash holdings that are observed in Table 3, we see that firm characteristics

explain a substantial fraction of the differences in cash holdings. In 2010, American firms held 7.19% of

assets more in cash than the cross-country average in Table 3. Consequently, 57% of the higher cash

holdings of U.S. firms after the crisis are accounted for by the fact that the population of U.S. firms

differs from the population of foreign firms.

    The next column of Table 6 looks at the excess cash holdings of firms in advanced countries. We

exclude from advanced countries the UK and Japan as we consider these countries separately next. We

find that for firms in these countries, abnormal cash first became significantly less than for the U.S. firms

in 2002 and remained significantly lower through 2010 with the exception of in 2003. Turning to the UK,

which is the country most similar to the U.S., we see that cash holdings in the UK fall compared to the

U.S. and that the difference becomes large and significant after the crisis. Japan always has more cash

                                                     14
than U.S. firms, but the difference is rarely significant after 2002. Developing countries have significantly

less cash than U.S. firms after taking into account firm characteristics in every year but 1998. Finally,

Eurozone countries have significantly less cash than U.S. firms after 2001. For all subsets of countries,

the average indicator variable mostly increases in absolute value through time, but depending on the

subset, it peaks before the crisis or after.

    Panel B of Table 6 provides results for sub-periods. We show that there is weak evidence that the

American firms have abnormal cash holdings compared to the rest of the world in the late 1990s, but

strong evidence that they do after the crisis except for Japan. Firms from advanced countries, except for

UK firms, are less different from U.S. firms than firms from developing countries in their cash holdings.

While we see little evidence that average cash/assets ratios increased after the crisis, we see that average

abnormal cash/assets ratios increase for U.S. firms relative to foreign firms across the world except for

Japan.

    In the next panel, Panel C, we estimate the significance of the changes in the mean indicator

variables. We see that the mean falls significantly only for the Eurozone countries from the late 1990s to

2004-2006. It falls significantly for the world, advanced countries, developing countries, and the Euro

zone from the late 1990s to 2009-2010. Finally, the average indicator variable falls significantly from

2004-2006 to 2009-2010 for the whole world and the UK. In contrast, it increases for Japan.



3.c. Country characteristics and abnormal cash holdings

    The results of this section show that when one takes into account firm characteristics, U.S. firms have

abnormal cash holdings relative to comparable foreign firms in recent years. There is more evidence of an

increase in cash holdings of U.S. firms after the crisis once one controls for firm characteristics. We now

turn to an investigation of whether the differences in changes in cash holdings between U.S. firms and

foreign firms are related to country characteristics. In Table 7, we look at country characteristics related to

legal origin, economic development, financial development, and taxation. For country characteristics that

change over time, we assign countries to a type for a period using its status the year before the start of a

                                                      15
period. Irrespective of the type of country we consider, firms in a country of that type have significantly

less cash after controlling for firm characteristics than U.S. firms after the crisis. However, for a number

of country types, abnormal cash holdings are not significantly negative in the late 1990s.

    Following La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1998), there is a vast literature that

demonstrates the importance of legal origin for finance. In particular, that literature shows that common

law countries tend to be more financially developed and to protect investors better. We find that there is

no significant difference in cash holdings relative to U.S. firms between civil law and common law

countries. However, compared to the U.S., cash holdings fall sharply in civil law countries, but not in

common law countries, in the 2000s.

    We consider next economic and financial development. We collect economic and financial

development data from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Firms from low GDP per

capita countries hold less cash relative to U.S. firms. Controlling for firm characteristics, firms from

developing countries do not have less cash than U.S. firms before the crisis, but they do afterwards. We

divide sample countries in each period by the median GDP growth rate. We find no significant difference

between these two groups of countries relative to U.S. firms.

    Existing research suggests that the precautionary motive of cash holdings implies that firms in

countries with less developed credit markets should have more cash but fails to find that they do (Dittmar,

Mahr-Smith, and Servaes (2003), Kalcheva and Lins (2007)). For our sample period, financial

development does not seem to explain differences in cash holdings across countries relative to the US.

More importantly given our focus, differences in financial development are not related to changes in

abnormal cash holdings. There is no difference in the change in cash holdings between countries with

high credit to GDP versus countries with low credit to GDP. Both types of countries hold less cash after

the crisis relative to U.S. firms than in the late 1990s. Firms in countries with low stock market

capitalization to GDP hold less cash after the crisis relative to U.S. firms than countries with high stock

market capitalization to GDP, but not before. However, the differences in changes in cash holdings

between firms from these two groups of countries relative to the U.S. firms are never significant.

                                                    16
    Given that the recent crisis was a credit crisis, firms from countries more reliant on credit from banks

might have used up their excess cash to offset restrictions on bank credit. However, we find that the

extent to which credit markets are developed relative to equity markets does not seem to make a

difference for changes in cash holdings. From the end of the 1990s to after the crisis, firms from countries

with low capitalization of bond and equity markets decrease their cash holdings relative to the U.S.

compared to firms from countries with high capitalization of bond and equity markets. However, there is

no evidence that cash policies of firms in these two types of countries responded to the crisis differently.

    The next country characteristics we consider are tax related. We divide countries according to their

corporate tax rate. Using data from PwC, firms in countries with a marginal tax rate higher than the

median do not change their cash holdings relative to U.S. firms in the 2000s compared to firms in

countries with a lower marginal tax rate. The U.S. has a worldwide tax system where firms are taxed on

their worldwide income, though they can defer U.S. taxes until repatriation. Some other countries have

territorial tax systems where they only tax domestic income. The identification of tax systems is taken

from Markle (2010). In our sample, 23 countries have a worldwide tax system for most of the sample.

Differences in tax systems cannot explain differences in abnormal cash holdings. U.S. firms hold more

cash than firms in other countries that have a worldwide tax system, but firms from countries with a

worldwide tax system do not hold significantly more cash relative to U.S. firms than firms from a

territorial tax system.

    So far, in these comparisons, we have not considered on how a country fared during the crisis. We

now examine whether a country’s experience in the crisis affects the cash holdings of firms from that

country after the crisis. To investigate this issue, we regress the change in average abnormal cash holdings

of a country from before the crisis to after the crisis on the stock return of the country during 2008. If the

crisis played a role in cash holdings, we would expect the change in abnormal cash holdings to be related

to 2008 returns. We find (not tabulated) that the coefficient on the market return is 0.06 with a t-statistic

of 2.36. In other words, the firms from countries that fared better during the crisis increased their cash

holdings more from before the crisis to after the crisis.

                                                      17
4. Abnormal cash holdings using the late 1990s as a benchmark

    In this section, we investigate whether firms across the world hold more cash than they would if they

held cash in the same way as they did in the late 1990s. In other words, we use the model of the previous

section estimated over 1998-2000 and compare actual cash holdings in the 2000s to the cash holdings

predicted by that model. The model includes country indicator variables, so that it allows for differences

in cash holdings that are country-specific at the end of the 1990s. When we use the model to predict cash

holdings in other years, we include the country indicator variables. Consequently, we account for country

specific factors (including possibly accounting differences) that affect cash holdings as of the late 1990s.7

Our estimates of abnormal cash holdings, defined as actual cash holdings minus predicted cash holdings

from our model, correspond therefore to changes in abnormal cash holdings relative to a benchmark of

zero abnormal cash holdings at the end of the 1990s when the indicator variables are taken into account.

The indicator variables for the end of the 1990s correspond to the indicator variables shown for 1998-

2000 in Table 6.

    In Figure 5, we show the predicted average cash/assets ratio of U.S. firms using our model as well as

the actual ratio. We see that the predicted ratio increases in the 2000s but drops sharply in 2008 before

increasing again. It follows from this that part of the high holdings of cash are normal cash holdings in

that firms that hold cash as they did in the late 1990s would be holding more cash in the 2000s. In the first

part of this section, we show how abnormal cash holdings evolve across the world during the 2000s.

Abnormal cash holdings in this section are defined as abnormal cash holdings relative to what firms

would hold if they held cash as in 1998-2000. In the second part of this section, we investigate which

types of U.S. firms experienced the greatest increase in abnormal cash holdings. We then compare the

abnormal cash holdings of types of U.S. firms to similar foreign firms.




7
 To allow for differences in the accounting treatment of R&D, we also estimate the model interacting R&D with the
country dummies. None of our results are different when we do so.

                                                       18
4.a. Evolution of abnormal cash holdings across the world during the 2000s.

    In Table 8, we show the estimates of abnormal cash holdings across the world relative to the

benchmark of 1998-2000. Panel A shows the yearly results. We start with 2001, since the abnormal cash

holdings are set to zero at the end of the 1990s. We see that average abnormal cash holdings increase

quickly after the late 1990s to reach 1.75% for the U.S. in 2002. Abnormal cash holdings fall after 2002,

hovering around 1% until 2008 when they reach their peak of 2.19%. While raw cash holdings fall at the

peak of the crisis in Table 1, abnormal cash holdings increase. In other words, changes in firm

characteristics suggest that cash holdings should have fallen more than they did, which explains that

abnormal cash holdings increased during the crisis. Abnormal cash holdings fall slightly after 2008 as

they reach 1.73% in 2010. These results show that U.S. firms, keeping firm characteristics the same, hold

more abnormal cash at the end of the sample than they do in the late 1990s. In Panel B, we see that

abnormal cash holdings are 1.06% higher in 2004-2006 and 1.86% in 2009-2010.

    We now turn to abnormal cash holdings for foreign firms. As before, we look at averages across

countries rather than across firms. For the world as a whole, Panel A shows that abnormal cash holdings

are always extremely small and that they actually are negative every year after 2002 except 2008.

Abnormal cash holdings abroad do not show the increase they show in the U.S. during the 2000s. When

we turn to the advanced countries, we see that abnormal cash holdings are less than 0.7% in every year.

They are negative in five years and positive in five years. There is no clear pattern to the evolution of

abnormal cash holdings in advanced countries except that firms in these countries have significantly less

cash than U.S. firms. We turn next to two advanced countries separately. First, we see that abnormal cash

holdings in the UK are insignificantly different from U.S. firms in five years and significantly negative

otherwise. The UK experiences a very sharp decrease in abnormal cash holdings in the last year of the

sample. It is interesting to note that the UK changed the taxation of foreign income in 2009 so that it

moved from a country that taxes income worldwide to a country that taxes only domestic income that

year. Japan has significantly negative abnormal cash holdings throughout the 2000s, but the abnormal

cash holdings increase in the last three years of the sample and turn positive in the last two years. Japan

                                                    19
also moved to taxing only domestic income in 2009, but in contrast to the UK abnormal cash holdings did

not decrease in Japan, suggesting that a move to taxing domestic income only does not necessarily lead to

a decrease in cash holdings.

    The last two columns of Table 8 show abnormal cash holdings for developing countries and for

countries from the Eurozone. Both Eurozone countries and developing countries have typically negative

abnormal cash holdings. However, both types of countries have positive abnormal cash holdings in 2008.

Firms from these countries appear to have higher abnormal cash holdings after the crisis than before the

crisis. One would think that uncertainty is high in the Eurozone countries after the crisis as 2010 marks

the beginning of the Eurozone sovereign crisis. Yet, abnormal cash holdings fall after 2008 for Eurozone

countries. U.S. firms hold more abnormal cash holdings relative to Eurozone countries after the crisis than

before.

    We checked to make sure that the increase in abnormal cash holdings is not due to changes in the

composition of the sample. A legitimate reason to worry about this issue is that Dittmar and Duchin

(2011) provide evidence that firm age is an important determinant of cash holdings. We define young

firms to be firms that have been public for five or fewer years. Firms which have been public for 20 years

or more are old firms. When we split firms between young and old firms, we find that cash holdings

increase much more for old firms than for young firms from the late 1990s to after the crisis or from

2004-2006 to after the crisis. We also investigate abnormal cash holdings for a constant sample of firms

that exist in 1998. We find that the increase in abnormal cash holdings is roughly the same for that

sample.



4.b. Did increases in abnormal cash holdings differ across firm types in ways consistent with

potential explanations for the high cash holdings of U.S. firms?

    The often-heard view mentioned in the introduction about the implications of the tax treatment of

foreign income suggests that abnormal cash holdings should have increased more for multinationals if the

adverse tax consequences of repatriation lead firms to build up cash abroad rather than repatriate it to pay

                                                    20
dividends. The agency view of cash holdings would suggest that firms with poorer governance

experienced greater increases in abnormal cash holdings. The poor investment opportunities hypothesis

implies that firms that experienced a greater decrease in capital expenditures because of the crisis would

have higher cash holdings afterwards. The view that Sarbanes-Oxley led firms to increase cash holdings

as it made firms risk-averse suggests that firms that were more affected by Sarbanes-Oxley increased their

abnormal cash holdings. We examine these possible explanations for cash holdings, but also consider

other possible explanations.

    A simple explanation for the increase in abnormal cash holdings is the free cash flow hypothesis of

Jensen (1986). With that hypothesis, firms accumulate abnormal cash holdings when they have profits but

insufficient investment opportunities and do not want to pay out the cash they accumulate to shareholders

because of agency problems. If this hypothesis is correct, we expect firms with high cash flow to

accumulate abnormal cash holdings. We assign firms to the top quartile of cash flow and to the bottom

quartile of cash flow the year before the start of a period. We see that the high cash flow firms do not

accumulate abnormal cash holdings from the late 1990s to 2004-2006, but that they do so from 2004-

2006 to 2009-2010. It follows that Jensen’s hypothesis does not help understand the increase in cash

holdings from the end of the 1990s to the 2000s. While firms with low capital expenditures accumulate

abnormal holdings of cash from the end of the 1990s to the 2000s, they do not accumulate more cash than

the firms with high capital expenditures from before the crisis to after the crisis. We also consider firms

that have high cash flow but low capital expenditures. These firms have higher abnormal cash holdings

than the firms with high cash flow but high capital expenditures. However, there is no evidence that the

difference in abnormal cash holdings between these two types of firms increases during the 2000s.

    To further examine the agency hypothesis of high cash holdings, we use the GIM index of Gompers,

Ishii, and Metrick (2003). Harford, Mansi, and Maxwell (2008) show that firms with weaker governance

have less cash and spend it more quickly. Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007) find that cash is worth more at

better governed firms. The GIM index is calculated every two years and the most recent data is for 2006.

We use the 2006 data for the subsequent years. Firms with a higher GIM index are presumed to have

                                                    21
worse governance by the users of that index. We divide our sample into quartiles of the index and

compare firms in the top quartile with firms in the bottom quartile. Agency problems should be least

important for firms in the bottom quartile, but we find that these firms hold more cash than firms in the

top quartile. Cash holdings of firms in the bottom quartile increased sharply over time, but so did the cash

holdings of the firms in the top quartile. There is no evidence that abnormal cash holdings of weakly

governed firms increase more from the late 1990s to the 2000s. While firms in the top quartile have a

greater increase in cash holdings from before the crisis to after, these firms have no abnormal cash

holdings after the crisis. It follows from these results that there is no evidence that agency problems

explain the increase in abnormal cash holdings of U.S. firms from the late 1990s to after the crisis.

    One hypothesis discussed in the previous section is that the crisis led to high cash holdings. We saw

that this hypothesis does not appear to be supported with cross-country data. In this Section, we examine

this hypothesis for U.S. firms. One way that the crisis could have led to high cash holdings is that the

crisis adversely affected investment, so that firms had more cash to accumulate. Note that we cannot

exclude the possibility that firms invested less so that they could save more cash; however, the literature

would predict that firms that invest more out of cash are financially constrained firms and we show later

that financial constraints do not explain the growth in cash holdings, a result which is perhaps not

unexpected since cash holdings increase more for large firms. Our first look at this issue is to sort firms in

2008 by their capital expenditures (results not tabulated). The firms with low capital expenditures in 2008

have high abnormal cash holdings in 2009-2010. However, these firms do not experience a significant

increase in abnormal cash holdings from 2004-2006 to 2009-2010. Second, we split firms into quartiles of

capital expenditures in 2009-2010. Again, the firms that are in the bottom quartile hold more cash, but

their abnormal cash holdings do not increase significantly from before the crisis to after the crisis. Finally,

we regress the change in abnormal cash holdings from before the crisis to after the crisis on the change in

capital expenditures over the same period. For U.S. firms, the change in capital expenditures has no

explanatory power whatsoever. For foreign firms, the coefficient on the change in capital expenditures is

positive (0.16 with t-statistic of 7.34), so that firms whose capital expenditures dropped more decreased

                                                      22
their abnormal cash holdings. There is no evidence supportive of the view that firms have been

accumulating cash because of poor investment opportunities.

    We saw in Section 2 that the top five holders of cash in 2010 are firms for which R&D is extremely

important. This evidence raises the question of whether the abnormal cash holdings increase is

concentrated among high R&D firms. When we split the sample between the top R&D expenditure firms,

namely the ones in the top quartile of firms with R&D expenditures, we find that high R&D firms

increase abnormal cash holdings from the late 1990s to the 2000s much more than other firms. In fact,

abnormal cash holdings as a percentage of assets increase by 4.0 percentage points for high R&D firms

from 1998-2000 to 2009-2010, but only by 0.70 percentage points for firms with no R&D. At the same

time, cash holdings of high R&D firms do not increase from before the crisis to after the crisis, while cash

holdings of other firms increase by 1.10 percentage points.

    As discussed in the introduction, a frequent argument is that multinationals have high cash holdings

because they keep substantial amounts of cash outside the U.S. to avoid the adverse tax consequences of

repatriation. We use two different definitions of multinationals. With the first definition, a firm is a

multinational if it reports foreign income in any of the previous three years. Since we consider three

different periods in the Table, a firm is assigned to the multinational group for a period if it has foreign

income in any of the three years preceding the start of that period. The second definition is that a firm

becomes a multinational once it has 25% of its sales abroad according to Compustat Historical Segment

data. Since, in general, the results are the same for both definitions of multinationals, we only reproduce

the results for the second definition. This definition has the advantage of making comparisons between

U.S. and foreign multinationals straightforward as the definition is the same for both domestic and foreign

multinationals. Duchin (2010) shows that diversified firms hold less cash. Firms can be diversified across

countries as well as across industries. His study focuses on industry diversification. In the late 1990s,

there was no difference in abnormal cash holdings between multinational and domestic firms. We define

domestic firms as firms that have no foreign sales and no foreign income. However, in recent years,

multinationals’ cash holdings are large compared to the cash holdings of comparable domestic firms, so

                                                    23
that international diversification does not seem to affect cash holdings in the same way as industrial

diversification. As shown in Panel A of Table 9, after the crisis, multinationals hold 3.6% more of assets

in cash than comparable domestic firms. All this increase in cash holdings took place from the late 1990s

to before the crisis. Strikingly, while the cash holdings of multinationals increase sharply in the 2000s, the

cash holdings of the domestic firms do not. Not surprisingly, therefore, cash holdings of multinational

corporations increase significantly from the late 1990s to before the crisis. Neither multinational

corporations nor domestic corporations have higher cash holdings after the crisis than before.

      It is well-known that an important reason for firms to become multinational is that they have

intangible assets and that they can better protect their property rights on these assets abroad by exploiting

them directly.8 A major source of intangible assets is R&D. We already know from Panel A of Table 9

that high R&D firms hold more cash. One explanation in the literature for the high cash holdings of R&D

intensive firms is that R&D has high adjustment costs (Brown and Petersen (2011)). In Panel A of Table

9 we compare purely domestic high R&D firms to multinational high R&D firms. We find that cash

holdings increase for multinationals relative to purely domestic firms. We also estimate but do not report

in the table results for the balanced panel where firms are classified at the end of 1997. For that panel, we

find no significant difference in abnormal cash holdings between high R&D multinationals after the crisis

and high R&D purely domestic firms after the crisis. However, for that panel, multinational cash holdings

increase sharply over time relative to purely domestic firm cash holdings. The reason that multinationals

do not hold more cash than purely domestic firms after the crisis is that they held so much less, 7.0% of

assets, at the end of the 1990s.

      Financial markets experienced large changes in the 2000s. At the beginning of the 2000s, equity

markets saw a sharp downturn. Throughout the 2000s, there were few IPOs (Gao, Ritter, and Zhu (2011),

Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz (2012)). With the crisis, debt markets experienced sharp difficulties. These

facts raise the question of whether firms more dependent on outside financing increased abnormal cash

holdings more because financial markets became less reliable for them. Such a result would be consistent

                                                     24
with the existing literature which shows that financially constrained firms invest in cash out of cash flow

(Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004)) and are able to better take advantage of investment

opportunities because of their higher levels of cash (Denis and Sibilkov (2009)). We first contrast

financially constrained firms to other firms. To do this, we identify constrained firms as those in the top

7% of the Hadlock and Pierce (2010) Size-Age index, which is the rounded percentage of firms that are

constrained in their study using qualitative information from firms. We see that financially constrained

firms did not increase their abnormal cash holdings, but the other firms did. However, the differences in

changes in abnormal cash holdings are not significant across these two types of firms. We then turn to

firms that are dependent on equity financing. McLean (2011) shows that firms that raise funds with equity

save a substantial fraction of these funds in the form of cash. Though equity-dependent firms hold more

abnormal cash holdings than other firms at the end of the 1990s, they do not after the crisis. We find that

the firms that were dependent on equity financing do not increase their abnormal cash holdings in the

2000s, while the other firms do. Finally, we turn to the firms that had long-term debt. We see that these

firms increase their abnormal cash holdings significantly, but so do the firms without long-term debt.

    We now consider the role of regulation as a possible explanation of the increase in cash holdings. As

discussed earlier, our sample does not include utilities. It is interesting to note that when we use our

model to predict cash holdings of utilities, utilities hold much less cash than expected. It follows that it is

not necessarily the case that a heavier regulatory burden leads to higher cash holdings. Further, there is no

change in their abnormal cash holdings. In contrast, abnormal cash holdings of industrial firms increase

significantly over time. To examine further the role of regulation, we consider the cash holdings of the

firms that were most adversely affected by the adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). Sarbanes-Oxley is by

far the most important change in federal law affecting corporate governance since the 1930s. Existing

empirical work shows evidence that it made corporations more conservative (Bargeron, Lehn, and Zutter

(2010)). We use two approaches to identify firms that were the most adversely affected by SOX. First, we

use the firms that met less than four of the ten SOX key measures as recorded by Institutional Shareholder

Services. Second, we identify those firms whose common stock reacted more adversely to the passage of

                                                      25
SOX. We use the dates in Litvak (2007) as relevant dates for the passage of SOX and then identify the

firms that have cumulative abnormal returns on these dates that are at the bottom quartile of all firms. We

see that the firms that satisfied less than four of the ten SOX key measures have significantly higher

abnormal cash holdings than other firms after SOX but not before. However, these firms as well as the

other firms increase their abnormal cash holdings in the 2000s and the increase across these two types of

firms is not significantly different. When we turn to the firms that experienced the largest equity loss, we

see that these firms hold more abnormal cash holdings both before and after SOX than the other firms.

However, these firms do not increase their cash holdings significantly more from the end of the 1990s to

2004-2006 as expected if the adoption of SOX would have led them to hold more cash.



4.c. Did certain U.S. firms increase their abnormal cash holdings more than comparable foreign
firms?

    The evidence of Section 4.b. shows that large, high tech, high R&D, and multinational firms

increased their abnormal cash holdings the most from the late 1990s to after the crisis.9 We now

investigate whether the large abnormal cash holdings increases of these firms are a U.S. phenomenon or

whether similar foreign firms increased abnormal cash holdings as much. To make our comparisons, we

construct subsets of foreign firms based on the thresholds we use for U.S. firms so that, for instance, a

large foreign firm would be a large firm in the U.S. We compare U.S. firms and foreign firms directly in

Panel B of Table 9. The first comparisons are for large firms, high tech firms, and multinationals. These

are the groups that experience the greatest increase in abnormal cash holdings in the U.S. These firms do

not have higher abnormal cash holdings than foreign firms in the late 1990s except for the high tech

firms. Strikingly, U.S. multinational corporations hold less cash than comparable foreign multinational

corporate in the late 1990s. All groups of U.S. firms experience a greater increase in abnormal cash

holdings than foreign firms from the late 1990s to 2004-2006 and from the late 1990s to 2009-2010.


9
  Good governance firms increased their cash holdings sharply as well. However, we cannot find comparable firms
abroad since the GIM index is only for U.S. firms. Further, it seems more plausible that this increase is due to the
fact that high tech and high R&D firms tend to be good governance firms using the GIM index.

                                                         26
Consequently, the increase in abnormal cash holdings for these firms from the late 1990s to the 2000s is a

U.S. phenomenon. However, for these three groups of firms, abnormal cash holdings do not increase

more from before the crisis to after the crisis than for foreign firms. In other words, the change in

abnormal cash holdings from before the crisis to after the crisis for these firms is not a U.S. phenomenon

but a global phenomenon.

    We also compare abnormal cash holdings for firms in the top quartile of cash flow and top quartile of

capital expenditures. Strikingly, there is no difference in abnormal cash holdings between foreign firms

and U.S. firms among these firms. However, while U.S. and foreign firms in the top quartile of R&D

spending held similar amount of abnormal cash holdings in the late 1990s, the U.S. firms in that group

increased their cash holdings sharply compared to foreign firms from the late 1990s to 2004-2006. The

difference between the two groups increases after the crisis, but that is because of a decrease in abnormal

cash holdings for foreign firms. U.S. equity-dependent firms hold more abnormal cash than foreign firms,

but the difference between U.S. firms and foreign firms does not change over time. U.S. firms with long-

term debt increase abnormal cash holdings over time, but foreign firms only do so after the crisis.



5. An examination of the increase of cash holdings of multinationals

    We show that there is an increase in abnormal cash holdings for U.S. multinationals but not for U.S.

domestic firms. This evidence raises the question of why the cash holdings of multinationals have

increased so much. One important hypothesis is that multinationals hoard cash abroad because it is costly

for them to repatriate profits. For this hypothesis to be correct, it must be that if multinationals could

repatriate their foreign income without a tax penalty, they would do so and they would pay out the cash to

shareholders either in the form of dividends or through repurchases. If multinationals would repatriate the

cash but not pay it out, the tax penalty on repatriation would mostly affect the location of cash holdings

and not the level.

    Panel B of Table 9 shows that cash holdings of US multinationals did not increase more than the cash

holdings of comparable foreign multinationals after the crisis. Such a result might still be consistent with

                                                    27
the tax hypothesis if the most profitable US multinationals increased their cash holdings more since

taxation of profits would be most relevant for these firms. In Panel A of Table 10, we split the sample of

firms by quartile of cash flow to assets in the year before the start of each period. We then compare the

multinationals in the top quartile and the multinationals in the bottom quartile. If lack of repatriation of

profits leads to high cash holdings, we would expect firms in the top quartile to have higher abnormal

cash holdings than firms in the bottom quartile. We find that the firms with higher cash flows have

significantly lower abnormal cash holdings than the firms with lower cash flows. Further, there is no

evidence that cash flow is related to the growth of cash holdings as there is no significant difference in

cash flow changes between high cash flow and low cash flow multinationals. We also compare

multinationals in the top quartile of cash flows to domestic firms in the same quartile. We find that high

cash flow multinationals hold more cash than similar high cash flow purely domestic firms. However,

high cash flow multinationals and high cash flow purely domestic firms increase their cash holdings

similarly from before the crisis to after the crisis.

       We show in Panel A of Table 9 that high R&D multinationals experienced a higher increase in cash

holdings from the late 1990s to the 2000s than high R&D domestic firms. In Panel A of Table 10, high

R&D domestic multinationals experienced a higher increase in cash holdings during the 2000s than

comparable high R&D foreign multinationals. Multinationals without R&D do not have positive

abnormal cash holdings, but they hold more cash than comparable purely domestic firms with no R&D as

shown in Panel A of Table 10. However, no R&D multinationals only marginally increase their cash

holdings relative to no R&D domestic firms. In other words, the increase in cash holdings of

multinationals is primarily located among multinationals with R&D expenditures. We confirm this

inference by regressing abnormal cash holdings on a firm’s R&D expenditures normalized by assets, its

multinational status, and the interaction of the R&D expenditures with the multinational status.10 We find

that abnormal cash holdings increase in the interaction term, so that multinationals apparently require

higher cash holdings for a given level of R&D than comparable purely domestic firms. Moreover, the

10
     Results are not shown, but available upon request from the authors.

                                                           28
level of R&D is actually negative and significant, while the indicator variable for multinational status is

insignificantly negative.

     The number of multinational firms increases during the 2000s. Roughly 350 firms become

multinationals in the U.S. We investigate whether the firms that were already multinationals before the

start of our sample have high cash holdings during the 2000s compared to firms that were domestic at the

start of the sample. We find that multinational firms that were already multinational firms at the end of

the 1990s increase their abnormal cash holdings more than firms that were domestic firms at the end of

the 1990s, but the increase occurs prior to the crisis.

     In Panel B of Table 10, we show regression tests attempting to isolate the impact on abnormal cash

holdings of firms becoming multinationals. We use the whole sample of firms. We use indicator variables

to indicate years in which a firm is multinational and control for macroeconomic shocks through year

indicator variables. Regression (1) has no firm fixed effects. We see that abnormal cash holdings of

multinational firms are higher than those of domestic firms.

     We then add firm fixed effects in regression (2). The firm fixed effect completely absorbs firms

which are either domestic or multinational for our entire sample. Thus, the coefficient on multinational

now represents the marginal change in (abnormal) cash holdings from before a firm was multinational to

after it became multinational. The coefficient is insignificant. Based on this evidence, multinational

firms have high abnormal cash holdings before they become multinationals, and do not appear to increase

their abnormal cash holdings after they become multinationals.11 Such a result further indicates that the

tax treatment of foreign profits is at most only part of the explanation for the high cash holdings of

multinational firms.

     In Panel C of Table 10, we conduct an event study of abnormal cash holdings of U.S. multinationals

compared to foreign multinational firms around the time that U.S. multinationals were allowed to

repatriate foreign profits under advantageous conditions. Admittedly, the law required them to reinvest


11
  The same result (not reported) holds if we only consider firms that switch status to multinational until the mid-
2000s so that these firms have time to increase their cash holdings.

                                                          29
the funds, but cash is fungible so that the domestic cash they might have used instead to invest could be

paid out. The year 2003 is before the advantageous repatriation period and the year 2006 is for most firms

after that period. We see that during that period of time, abnormal cash holdings for multinational firms

do not decrease. In fact, abnormal cash holdings do not change significantly for multinational firms or for

domestic firms. When we compare the abnormal cash holdings of U.S. multinationals to foreign

multinationals during that period, we see no significant decrease in abnormal cash holdings of U.S.

multinationals. Existing empirical evidence (Blouin and Krull (2009), Dharmapala, Foley, and Forbes

(2011), and Faulhaber and Petersen (2012)) indicates that multinational firms mostly paid out the

repatriated funds. From our evidence, these payouts do not seem to have had enough of an impact on cash

holdings to lead to a decrease in abnormal cash holdings.



6. Conclusion

    In this paper, we show that American firms hold more cash after the crisis than firms with similar

characteristics in the late 1990s. The difference is 1.86% of assets. This increase is U.S. made in that

foreign firms do not experience such an increase, so that U.S. firms hold more cash now than in the late

1990s relative to similar foreign firms. The increase in abnormal cash holdings is not uniform across

firms as it takes place mostly for multinational corporations. We find no increase in abnormal cash

holdings for purely domestic corporations. The role of multinational corporations in the increase in cash

holdings of US firms is striking. Multinationals (defined as firms with more than 25% of foreign sales)

held $157 billion in cash in 1998, while in 2010 they held $835 billion. Part of the growth in cash held by

multinationals is due to their increased economic importance in the U.S., but the cash holdings of

multinationals increased by 433% while their assets increased by 205%. In contrast, cash holdings of

domestic firms increased by 66% while their assets increased by 40%. Importantly, however, U.S.

multinationals did not increase their cash holdings more after the crisis than similar foreign

multinationals.



                                                    30
    Much has been made of the tax cost of repatriation of foreign earnings for multinationals and how this

cost might explain the high cash holdings of multinationals. We find that multinationals do not decrease

their cash holdings as a result of the Homeland Investment Act of 2004 and, perhaps more importantly,

that firms that become multinationals do not appear to increase their cash holdings. Our evidence is that

the firms that become multinationals after 1998 have high cash holdings when they become

multinationals. These results suggest that the type of firms that are or become multinational firms have

unique attributes that make cash holdings particularly valuable for them. The exact reasons these firms

hold more cash require further investigation. However, a promising direction is that we know from the

literature that these firms are high R&D firms and that high R&D firms hold more cash. In our sample,

the firms with the highest abnormal cash holdings are high R&D multinationals. We find that the relation

between R&D and cash holdings is substantially stronger for multinational firms than it is for purely

domestic firms. This result is particularly interesting in light of the work of Morck and Yeung (1991).

They find that multinational firms are not valued more highly per se, but that R&D undertaken by

multinational firms is valued more highly than R&D undertaken by poorly domestic firms. Another

direction to investigate is whether firms that become multinationals accumulate cash to become

multinationals. A possible explanation for this is that firms might become multinationals through cash

acquisitions. Lastly, it does not follow from our results that the tax cost of repatriation is not relevant for

multinationals. In particular, this cost might determine where firms hold their cash. Further work on the

location of cash would be helpful to understand better the impact of the tax cost of repatriation.

       Panel A (Panel B) shows the mean of the annual cross-sectional means (medians) of cash/asset, based on
       country grouping. *, **, *** (+,++,+++) indicate the mean is significantly smaller (larger) than the US at
       the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively Using a two-tailed t-test. Advanced is whether the country is
       defined as advanced by the International Monetary Fund and Developing are all countries in the sample
       that are not designated as advanced. Euro specifies those countries that are identified as in the Euro zone
       by the IMF. For the subgroups All, Advanced excluding UK and Japan, Developing, and Euro, the
       standard error for the t-test is based on the cross-sectional distribution of country means (or medians).
       For the UK and Japan, the standard error is determined with firm level data. The results in the categories
       All and Advanced exclude the US.

                                 Table 4: Summary Statistics by Country
The table shows the time-series mean of the annual cross-sectional means, and below it the time-series
mean of the annual country medians. Advanced are the countries defined as advanced by the International
Monetary Fund (but without the UK and Japan as they are shown separately) and Developing are the
countries not designated as advanced. Euro specifies those countries that are identified as in the Euro zone
by the IMF at the end of the sample period. Compustat data items are in brackets after the variable
description. Cash/Asset [che/at] is cash to assets; Mkt/Book [((at-ceq)+( csho*prcc_f))/at] is the market
to book ratio of assets; Size [log(at/cpi)] is the logarithm of real assets, deflated to 2000 dollars using the
CPI; CF/Assets [((oibdp-xint-txt-dvc)/at)] is cash flow to assets; NWC/Assets [(wcap-che)/at] is non-cash
net working capital to assets; Capex [capx/at] is capital expenditures to assets; Leverage [(dltt+dlc)/at] is
short- and long-term debt to assets; RD/Sales [xrd/sale] is R&D expense to sales; Dividend Payer is an
indicator if the firm paid common dividends [dvc] in the year; Acquisitions [aqc/at] is acquisitions to
assets; Debt Issuance [(dltis-dltr)/at] is net debt issuance to assets; Equity Issuance [(sstk-prstkc)/at] is net
equity issuance to assets; Ind Vol is the mean, by 2 digit SIC code, of firm standard deviation of
CF/Assets for the prior 10 years. A minimum of 3 years is required to calculate firm volatility. *, **, ***
(+,++,+++) indicate the mean is significantly smaller (larger) than the U.S. at the 10, 5, and 1% levels,
respectively Using a two-tailed t-test. For the subgroups All, Advanced excluding UK and Japan,
Developing, and Euro, the standard error for the t-test is based on the cross-sectional distribution of
country means (or medians). For the UK and Japan, the standard error is determined with firm level data.
The results in the categories All and Advanced exclude the U.S.

The dependent variable is cash/assets [che/at]. Mkt/Book [((at-ceq)+(csho*prcc_f))/at] is the market to book ratio of assets; Size [log(at/cpi)] is the logarithm
of real assets, deflated to 2000 dollars using the CPI; CF/Assets [((oibdp-xint-txt-dvc)/at)] is cash flow to assets; NWC/Assets [(wcap-che)/at] is non-cash net
working capital to assets; Capex [capx/at] is capital expenditures to assets; Leverage [(dltt+dlc)/at] is short- and long-term debt to assets; RD/Sales [xrd/sale]
is R&D expense to sales; Dividend Payer is an indicator if the firm paid common dividends [dvc] in the year; Acquisitions [aqc/at] is acquisitions to assets;
Debt Issuances [(dltis-dltr)/at] is net debt issuance to assets; Equity Issuance [(sstk-prstkc)/at] is net equity issuance to assets; Ind Vol is the mean, by 2 digit
SIC code, of firm standard deviation of CF/Assets for the prior 10 years. A minimum of 3 years is required to calculate firm volatility. Country indicator
variables (Country FE) are indicators representing individual countries and are not reported here. Regressions are run by year (or year window). *, **, ***
indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively using standard errors clustered at the firm level. Robust standard errors are used (clustered at the
country level).

      Table 6: Estimated Coefficients on Country Indicator Variables in Cross-Section Regressions
The indicator variables are from regressions of Cash/assets on Mkt/Book, NWC/Assets, Capex, Leverage,
RD/Sales, Dividend Payer, Acquisitions, Debt Issuance, Equity Issuance, Ind Vol, and country indicator
variables, where Cash/Assets [che/at] is cash to assets; Mkt/Book [((at-ceq)+(csho*prcc_f))/at] is the market
to book ratio of assets; Size [log(at/cpi)] is the logarithm of real assets, deflated to 2000 dollars using the
CPI; CF/Assets [((oibdp-xint-txt-dvc)/at)] is cash flow to assets; NWC/Assets [(wcap-che)/at] is non-cash net
working capital to assets; Capex [capx/at] is capital expenditures to assets; Leverage [(dltt+dlc)/at] is short-
and long-term debt to assets; RD/Sales [xrd/sale] is R&D expense to sales; Dividend Payer is an indicator if
the firm paid common dividends [dvc] in the year; Acquisitions [aqc/at] is acquisitions to assets; Debt
Issuances [(dltis-dltr)/at] is net debt issuance to assets; Equity Issuance [(sstk-prstkc)/at] is net equity
issuance to assets; Ind Vol is the mean, by 2 digit SIC code, of firm standard deviation of CF/Assets for the
prior 10 years. A minimum of 3 years are required to calculate firm volatility. Country indicator variables are
indicators representing individual countries. Regressions are run by year (or year window). Advanced is
whether the country is defined as advanced by the International Monetary Fund (but without the UK and
Japan as they are shown separately) and Developing are all countries in the sample that are not designated as
advanced. Euro specifies those countries that are identified as in the Eurozone by the IMF. *, **, ***
indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively, using the cross-sectional standard error of the
coefficients. Numbers below the coefficient shows the percentage of country indicator variables which are
greater than the US coefficient (no percentages are shown for UK or Japan as they are the only country in
their respective regressions). ^, ^^, ^^^, indicate significant differences from 50% using a binomial test.
Robust standard errors are used (clustered at the country level).

                    Table 7: Country Characteristics and Changes in Cash Holding
  Examination of the country indicator variables from the regressions of Table 6. For the country
  characteristics that vary though time, the assignment of a country to a type is made the year before the
  start of each period we consider. Common and Civil Law is the legal tradition of the country and comes
  from La Porta, Lopes de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1998), Advanced is whether the country is defined
  as advanced by the International Monetary Fund and Developing are all countries in the sample that are
  not designated as advanced. Euro specifies those countries that are identified as in the Euro zone by the
  IMF. Country development data comes from the World Bank’s, World Development Indicators. Low
  (High) means below (above) the median for all countries in that time window. GDP growth is the growth
  in GDP per capita. Credit/GDP is domestic credit available to private sector divided by GDP, Stock
  Market /GDP is the total stock market capitalization divided by GDP, (Stock+Credit)/GDP is the stock
  market capitalization plus domestic credit to private sector to GDP, Stock/Credit is the stock market
  capitalization to GDP divided by domestic credit to private sector to GDP. Tax rate is top corporate
  marginal rate as reported by PwC. The identification of tax systems as worldwide or territorial is taken
  from Markle (2010). Our identification of tax havens is taken from the Organization for Economic
  Cooperation and Development (OECD). Only two countries in our sample are classified as tax havens,
  Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. *, **, *** indicate that the mean of the coefficients is significantly
  different from zero (i.e. from the US) at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

     A firm’s abnormal cash holding is the difference between the actual cash holding and the predict cash
     holding from a regression using the period 1998-2000 using all firms and including country indicator
     variables. Panel A (Panel B) shows the mean of the annual country means of abnormal cash/assets.
     Advanced are the countries defined as advanced by the International Monetary Fund (but without the UK and
     Japan as they are shown separately) and Developing are all countries in the sample that are not designated as
     advanced. Euro specifies those countries that are identified as in the Euro zone by the IMF. For the
     subgroups All, Advanced excluding UK and Japan, Developing, and Euro, the standard error for the t-test is
     based on the cross-sectional distribution of country means. For the UK and Japan, the standard error is
     determined with firm level data. The results in the categories All and Advanced exclude the US. *, **, ***
     (+,++,+++) indicate the mean is significantly smaller (larger) than the US at the 10, 5, and 1% levels,
     respectively Using a two-tailed t-test.

                        Table 9: Analysis of Abnormal Cash Holdings by Firm Types
A firm’s abnormal cash holding is the difference between the actual cash holding and the predicted cash
holding from a regression estimated using the period 1998-2000 using all firms and country indicator
variables. The assignment of a firm to a type is made the year before the start of each period. Large firm is
set to one if the firm’s assets are above the top quintile of assets for all NYSE firms. Young firms are those
which have been public for five or fewer years, while Old firms are those which have been public for 20
years or more. Top means in the 4th quartile. Bottom means in the 1st quartile. Top quartile CF/Asset
(Capex/Asset) means the firm is in the top quartile of all firms for that year and compared only to firms in the
bottom quartile of cash flow (capex). The GIM index is as constructed in Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick
(2003). High tech means that firms are in the high tech category based on the Fama-French 10 industry
definitions. Top quartile RD means the firm is in the top quartile of RD/sales in a given year and is
compared to firms which conduct no R&D. Multinational means that the firm reported foreign income in any
of the years t-3 to t-1. Important MNC means that the firm is in the top half of abs(foreign income)/sales for
all MNCs. Financially constrained firms are those in the top 7% of the Hadlock and Pierce (2010) Size-Age
index in a given year. Firms are equity dependent if they are in the top quartile, within country, of equity
issues to assets over the prior three year period. Had Debt is an indicator if the firm had any long-term debt
in the prior three years. Firms are Affected by SOX if they met three or fewer of ten provisions of Sarbanes-
Oxley as measured by Institutional Shareholder Services. Alternatively, firms are Affected by SOX if their
cumulative abnormal returns are in the bottom quartile of CARs Using the Litvak (2007) dates which are
dates relevant to the passage and implementation of the SOX provisions. In Panel B, US (Foreign) indicates
that the firm is incorporated inside (outside) the United States. *, **, *** indicate that the mean excess cash
(or differences between the groups) is significantly different from zero at the 10, 5, and 1% levels,
respectively.

                                Table 10: Cash Holdings of Multinational Firms
Panels A and C show abnormal cash/asset ratios. The abnormal cash/asset ratio is the difference between the
actual cash/assets ratio and the predicted cash/assets ratio from a regression estimated for the period 1998-
2000 using all firms and country dummy variables. The assignment of a firm to a type in Panels A and B is
made the year before the start of each period. In Panel B, the dependent variable is excess cash which is the
residual from regressions estimated from 1998-2000 Using all firms and country dummy variables. Pre MNC
is an indicator set to 1 in the years before a firm is classified as a multinational company. Year of MNC is an
indicator set to 1 in the year when a firm first is classified as a multinational company. Post MNC is an
indicator set to 1 in the years after a firm is classified as a multinational company. The regressions indicate
whether they include yearly dummy variables and firm fixed effects. p-values based on robust standard errors
are reported in brackets. . *, **, *** indicate that the mean excess cash (or the difference between the US and
Foreign firms) is significantly different from zero at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively, using a t-test.

       To assess holdings of cash by private firms, we use aggregate data from the flow of funds accounts

and subtract from it the holdings by the Compustat firms. We Use the data collected from the Federal

Reserve flow of funds accounts release Z.1. We Use the data from B.102 “Balance Sheet of Nonfarm

Nonfinancial Corporate Business,” data items and line numbers are shown in the Data Appendix. We collect

total assets (1) and determine cash and marketable securities as the sum of Foreign Deposits (7), Checkable

deposits and currency (8), Time and savings deposits (9), Money market fund shares (10), Security RPs (11),

Commercial Paper (12), Treasury Securities (13), Agency- and GSE-backed securities (14), Municipal

securities (15), Mortgages (16), Mutual Fund Shares (19). Total assets (cash) is assumed to be the sum of

both Corporate and Noncorporate Businesses.
