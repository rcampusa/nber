                                     ABSTRACT

        Casual observation indicates that in recent years real interest
rates in the United States appear to have risen sharply and have remained
high relative to historical standards. Many observers have claimed that
these high real rates have been transmitted abroad and have lead to high
real rates in the rest of the industrialized countries. Concern over the
level of real rates has been widespread in the analyses by economic policy
makers both in Europe and in the United States.

        In this paper we present evidence on several questions regarding the
movement in short term real interest rates in eight countries that have been
raised by the recent policy debates in Europe and the United States: Have
ex ante real rates in the United States and Europe been high during recent
years? Has there been a link between U.S. real rates and those in other
countries? Can this link be quantified?

        The basic finding in this paper is that real rates have climbed
dramatically from the 1970s to the 1980s in both the European countries and the
United States. Indeed, real interest rates in the United States are
currently at high levels unprecedented in the post war period, which rival
the levels that occurred during the Great Depression. Complaints that real
interest rates in the United States are exceedingly high seem to be well
justified. There is also strong evidence that there is a positive
association between movements in U.S. real rates and those in Europe. However,
European real rates typically do not move one—for—one with U.S. real rates,
still leaving open the possibility that European nnetary policy can
influence domestic economic activity.

     In recent years real interest rates in the United States have risen

sharply and remained high relative to historical standards.1 Pliny   ob-
servers have claimed that these high real rates have been transmitted

abroad and have lead to high real rates in the rest of the Industrial-

ized countries. Concern over the level of real rate; has been widespread

in the analyses by economic policy makers both in Europe and in the

United State;. The current focus on the high worldwide level of real

interest rate; and their effect on the economies of the world calls for

an econometric examination of the recent movements in real rates and the

degree of linkage between real rates in different countries.

      Several attempts have been made recently to test whether there is

complete international linkage of real rates by testing for the equality

of real rate; across countries (for example, Hodrick (1979), Plishkin

(1982), Mark (1982), and Cumby and Obstfeld (1984).) These tests have

generally provided evidence against the hypothesis that real short term

interest rates in the industrialized countries have been equal during

the past decade. However they have not provided any evidence concerning

the extent to which real rate; in the major industrial countries move

together over time.

      In this paper we present evidence on several questions regarding

the movement in short term real interest rates in eight countriesi Have

cx ante real rates outside of the United State; been high during recent

years? Has there been a link between U.S. e ante real rate; and those




   This widely—noted change in the level of real rates in the U.S. has
   been carefully documented by Huizinga and Mishkin (1984a).
                                   —2—


in other countries? Can this link be quantified? Have real rates within

Europe been more closely linked together than they are with real rates

in the United States? We also examine the Issue of the equality of real

rates across these countries because our sample period contains data at

least two years more recent than In previous studies. These two years

are important since they are characterized by extreme movements in real

rates and consequently including them should lead to conclusions that

are stronger and possibly different from previous work.

      Determining the extent to which real Interest rates in different

countries move independently of one another is important for issue;

involving stabilization policy in general as well as for shedding light

of the recent policy debate. If real interest rates in an economy move

one—for—one with those abroad, an important avenue for monetary policy

to influence the domestic economy emphasized in many open economy macro-

economic models is removed. In many of these models, equality of real

rate; fails due to relative price changes. Deviations      from purchasing

power parity that are due to sticky prices give rise to Independent real

interest rate movements in the model; of Dornbusch (1976), Frankel

 (1980), and Mussa (1983). Changes in the relative price   of home goods

 account for real interest rate movements in the intertamporal optimizing

 model of Dornbusch (1983) and in the Imperfect Information model of

 Stockman and Koh (1983). Ob;tfeld (1983) presents an         intertemporal

 maximizing model in which real interest rate differential; arise from

 term; of trade changes. Deviations from uncovered   interest parity are

 behind real interest rate inequality in other models. For ixample, the

 portfolio balance models of Sraneon (1979)   and Girton and Henderson

 (1977) exhibit Independent real interest rate movements arising from
                                     —3—


changes in the supply of outside assets.2

        In the next section we turn to the econometric methodology for

estimating ex ante real rates and testing the linkage between real rate;

indifferent countries. We then produce estimates of real interest rates

in the United States, Canada, and six European countries and test to

what extent real rate movements outside of the U. S. are associated with

movements in the U.S. real rate. We also test th. association of

European real rate movement; with each other. Our basic finding is that

real rates have climbed dramatically from the 1970s to the 1980s in all

countries studied and that there is a significant positive association

between movements in U.S. real rates and those abroad. However, European

real rates typically do not move one—for—one with U.S. real rates, still

leaving open the possibility that monetary policy can influence domestic

economic activity. The association of movements of European real rates

with each other is not found to be any stronger than the association of

European with U.S. real rates.



                              U. Methodology



       For each country, the cx ante real interest rate (which we will

also refer to as the real rate) on a i     period   bond which is held for .1

periods is defined from the Fisher (1930) equation as,3

      and Obstfeld and Stockman (1984).

      The methodology outlined here has been discussed more extensively in
      Mishkin (1981, 1984) and Huizinga and Mlihkin (1984a). All returns,
      inflation and interest rates in the analysis here are continuously
      compounded so that the additional second order term is not needed in
      equation (1).
                                                                     —4—

cluded in the available information set f and are correlated with the

real rate rrt.. A logical choice for an estimate of the real rate is

the best linear predictor of rrt given X, that is the linear projec-

tion of rrt into                         which we represent as

Because                      and         are observable, this equation is can be estimated
              ePPrt,
by ordinary least squares (OLS). We can then use as our estimates of cx

ante real rate; in each country,                                 the fitted values from the OLS

regression (7),

       To understand the properties of the resulting estimates,                          there   are

two important feature; of the error term of this equation,                                       that

merit discussion. The assumption of rational                    expectation;       implies that

the forecast error of inflation,                 is uncorrelated with any informa-

tion available at time t which includes             X .         Therefore,     c           is or—
                                                        t                          t,J

thogonal    to      and by construction,           Is also orthogonal to X. As is

shown in Mishkin (1981), the resulting orthogonality of the error term,

       with        then implies that estimating equation (7) by OLS produce;

consistent estimate; of the projection equation pbs. This indicates

that, although we cannot observe the cx ante real rate rrt, we can

infer information about it; relationship with variables known at time t

via ex post real rate regression;.

         The usual case in the literature, that of non—overlapping data,

has    j equal to 1, so that the holding period and the observation period

are the same. On the other hand,       in the empirical analysis in this

paper,     j     equals 3 (one month observation intervals and three month

holding periods), so that the data will be overlapping. For example,

          will be a three period return which equals the sum of the one
rr,3
period returns in t, t+1 and t+2.          rr           then overlap; rr                   because
                                                t+1,3                              t,3

both include the one period returns for t+1 and t+2.

         In order to obtain confidence intervals around our estimates of

real rates, we must have a consistent estimate of the variance—

covariance matrix of            Unfortunately, the variance—covariaflce matrix

from OLS regressions reported by standard regression packages can be

very misleading when there is serial correlation In the t,j error term.

            Consistent estimates of the QLS variance—covariance matrix are

calculated with a method outlined by Hansen (1982) and Cumby, Huiziaga

and Obstfeld (1983), which allows for serial correlation in the error

term of rational expectation;, regression equations. The estimates we

use here are similar to those used by Hansen and Hodrick (1980), but

they are more general because they allow for conditional heterosceda;—

ticity in the regression residuals. This is a particularly attractive

feature of this technique since the assumption of conditional heteros—

cedasticity Is usually rejected in financial markets.4

       Because these cx ante real rates are unobservable, this regression

 Because the cx post real rates for country in and the U.S. are observ-

 able, this equation can be estimated. However, the error term of this

 equation is not orthogonal to the explanatory variable, eprr8 because

 eprr6 is realized only at time t+i and is thus likely to be correlated
                                         —9—


with the inflation forecast error terms. McCallum (1976) pointed out

that consistent estimates of this equation could be obtained by estimat-

ing it with instrumental variables, provided the instruments are in the

available information set             so that the instruments will be uncorre—

lated with the expectation errors, E             and          Consistency   also

requires that the instruments be uncorrelated with t,j' the disturbance

in     (9).     This disturbance is, by construction, the part of movements in

the real rate in country in that is not explained by movements in the

U.S.     real     rate. Therefore, the instruments should exert no additional

influence on the real rate n country in        apart from their influence on
                              5
the real rate in the U.S.

         However, if the data are overlapping so that the c s and hence the

error term of the equation are serially correlated, then the McCallum

procedure will not lead to consistent estimates of the estimated

parameters' standard errors and misleading inference can result. The

solution to this problem is to use the two—step, two stage least squares

(2S2SLS) procedure developed by Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1983). Not

only does this procedure provide consistent estimates of the covariance

matrix of the coefficient estimates when the error is serially corre-

lated or conditionally heteroscedastic, but it produces more efficient

parameter estimates as well.6 There are two criteria for choosing the

instruments to be used in this procedure. First, the instruments must be




       The instruments in our empirical analysis are U.S. nominal interest
       rates, past U.S. inflation rates, a constant term and a time trend.
       These instruments should satisfy the criteria described above.

       In the special case where the number of parameters to be estimated
       is equal to the number of instrumental variables, two—step two stage
       least squares reduces to McCallum's instrumental variables estimator
       with the correct standard errors and hence provides no gain in
       efficiency.

in   the available information set          in order to achieve consistent

estimates. Second, the instruments should have good explanatory power

for the cx post real rate on the right—hand—side of the equation so that

the power of the test is as high as possible. A natural choice            for

instruments are then the variables in         that have been found to predict

the U.S. mx post real rate well.

        In summary: measures of real interest rates when the data are

overlapping, as in the empirical analysis of this paper, can be obtained

by estimating cx post real rate regressions with ordinary least square;

and using the fitted values as estimates of the cx ante real rates.

Correct statistical inference requires that the standard errors of these

estimates be corrected for the serial correlation due to overlapping

data using the 2S2SLS procedure outlined by Cumby, Huizinga and Dbstfeld

(19B3). Tests of the linkage between U.S. and European real rates can be

conducted by estimating a regression of the European countrys cx post

real rate on the cx post real rate in the U.S. with the 2S2SLS technique

using as instruments the same variables that were used to       estimate the

measures of the real rates.



                                III. The Data



         In this paper we study short—term real interest rates in the euro

deposit and domestic money markets using monthly data from         June 1973

until December 1983 for eight industrialized countries! the United

States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, France, West

 Germany and Switzerland. Since capital controls, both actual and poten-

 tial, may drive a wedge between onshore money market interest rates and

 the corresponding euro deposit rate, we examine both of these interest

rates in our tests here. We have chosen to examine real rates calculated

using changes in the consumer price index (CPI) as the relevant measure

of price inflation since this is the most reliable price index available

for the countries in our sample. We study three—month real interest

rates on euro deposits and domestic money market instruments because the

timing problem of the inexact dating of the monthly price indices is

somewhat lessened by looking at real interest rates of maturities longer

than one month.7 The time period is chosen to begin shortly after the

onset of generalized floating exchange rates and to include the most

recently available data.

      The dating convention is as follows. The cx post real rate at

month t is the actual real return on a three—month euro deposit or

domestic money market instrument held from the end of that month to

three months in the future: for the observation in January, it is the

real return from January 31 until April 30. For each country, the cx

post real rate is constructed by subtracting the continuously compounded

inflation rate for that country from the continuously compounded nominal

return on the euro deposit or money market instrument denominated in

that country's currency.

      The three—month eurocurrency deposit rates come from a variety of

sources. Prior to January 1976, the euro rates are taken from Data

Resources, Inc. for the United States, Germany, and Switzerland and from

the Weekly Review of the Harris Bank of Chicago for the remaining

countries. Following January 1976, all rates (except the euro lira rate)

are taken from Morgan Guaranty Trust's World Financial Markets. The

money market rates are taken from Morgan Guaranty Trust's World Finan—

cial Markets. These are representative three—month rates measured at or

near the end of the month. Interbank rates are used for France, Germany,

Italy, the Netherlands,8 Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. For Canada

three—month prime finance company paper is used and                for the United

States three month prime industrial paper is used.

       The consumer price index for each country except the United States

are obtained from the International                Financial Statistics (IFS) tape

(line 64). The U. S. consumer price index is the CPI—UXI, which use; the

new rental equivalence procedure for measuring housing costs.9

       As Huizinga and Mishkin (1984a) point out, the breakpoint of October
       1979 is somewhat arbitrary. It is entirely possible that the break-
       point occurred somewhat before or after this date.

structure for six of the other countries studied.11 Only in the Swiss

case are we unable to reject the null hypothesis of stability at stand-

ard significance levels. In the case of the United Kingdom, the sample

is split at the beginning of the Thatcher government in June 1979. For

the other european countries the beginning of the European Monetary

Sy5tem in April 1979 is chosen as the break point. The estimated real

rates for each country are thus constructed from a separate regression

for each of the two sub—periods.12

        Before looking at the estimated real rates obtained from these

regressions, we should first look at the autocorrelations of the

residuals,     reported     in Table 1.       Because there may be spurious

seasonality of the ex post real rates,13 the small but significant

autocorrelations at lag twelve are not of great concern. What is more

important is the fact that, except for the autocorrelations at the

seasonal lags, there are rarely significant autocorrelations at lags

greater than 2. Since         does not include lagged values of the mx post

real rates, this provides some indication that enough relevant informa-

tion is included in X so that the u           are small relative to   c         and

that our estimates of the real rates will be reliable.

      We have not presented the estimated real euro deposit rates in the
      interest of saving space. The estimates of the real euro rates were
      similar to the estimates of the real domestic money market rates
      except in the case of the French franc, as is noted below.

ante real rates, while the lighter, dashed lines
                                                     surrounding the es—

tirnated real rates provide 95% confidence intervals for these estimate;

under the assumption that the variances of the      forecast error term,

         are large relative to the variance of u3.15

         The estimated real rates for the U.S. in Figure 1 exhibit a sharp

change in behavior after 1979, having a substantially higher level end

increased volatility. The U.S. real rates were low from the middle of

1973 until October 1979, have a substantial rise after the change in the

Fed policy regime, a brief decline in the middle of    1980 when nominal

interest rates decline temporarily, and a sustained period of high real

rates thereafter. An important finding here is that in the 1980; real

rates in the U.S. have approached 10% at an annual rate, a level un-

precedented in the post war period, and they remain statistically sig-

nificantly different from zero continuously from 19B1 through 1983. The

only period in U.S. history where real interest rates appear to be as

high was during the contraction phase of the Great Depression.16 Com-

 plaint; that real interest rates in the United States are exceedingly

 high seem to be well justified.

         The estimated real rate for Canada seems to follow the U.S. pat-

 tern reasonably closely, although Canadian real       rates are actually

 declining from mid 1979 to mid 1980, when they begin their big rise. The

 U.K. real rates start their climb in late 1979 coincident with the rise

 in the U.S. real rate, but are significantly positive only after August

 1981.



  15   The formulae for the standard error bounds are given in Mishkin
       (1981). This assumption on the relative importance of the two com-
       ponents of the composite error term in equation (7) is supported by
       the correlogram of the residuals in Table 1.

       The Italian and Dutch real rate; do appear to be higher on average

in the 1980; than in the 1970;, but they both have a brief period in

late 1976 when they are particularly high. The timing of the real rate

movements for these countries also does not appear to be as closely tied
to real rate movements in the U.S. The increase in real rates in the

Netherlands occurs in 1978 with substantial upward and downward move-

ments thereafter. The Italian real rates have a very sharp decline and

rise in late 1979 and in early 1981 the real rates are near zero.

         The German and French real rate movement; are particularly inter-

esting. Although German real rates do rise in late 1979 as U.S. real

rates do, the rise is much smaller. The major climb in German real rates

does not begin until late 1980, several months after the U.S. increase.

The increase in the French real rates is even more delayed. French real

rates remain quite low until early 1981, hovering around zero. An in-

crease then occurs, taking the real domestic money market rate rate to

approximately ó.17

         The Swiss real rates do appear to have a somewhat different pat-

tern from the other real rates we have been looking at. Although there

is a rise in Swiss real rates which reach their highest levels in 1981,

the extent of the rise is much less than in other countries, and they

are only statistically significantly different from zero for a one year

period in 1981. The amount of variation in Swiss real rates seems to be

smaller than in other countries. In addition, the climb in real rates in

Switzerland begins in early 1979, well before the increase in U.S. real

rates.



 17
      The real rate on euro French franc deposits shows a very similar
      pattern, although we do see the effect of capital controls, The real
      euro rates rise much less than the real domestic money market rates,
      reaching a level of over iSV..
                                   —16—


       The general conclusions from these estimates of real rates in the

eight countries is that they all show a tendency to       have higher real
                                                     18
interest rates in the 1980s than in the 1970s.            However, there are

differences in the timing and extent of real rate movements        in these

countries. In light of the sometimes substantial confidence intervals

around the real rate estimates, we need to examine more closely the

degree to which real rates in different countries move together. We

conduct statistical tests on this issue in the next section.



                 V. Testing the Linkage Between Real Rates



       Table 2 contains the first set of results on the degree of interna-

tional association of real rates obtained from the regression        of the

real rates in the seven countries on the real rate in the United States.

Of particular interest in these tables is the coefficient r which

describes the amount of movement in a country's real rate for a given

movement in the U.S. real rate. We test three hypotheses about real rate

movements between the U.S. and these other countries. The first is that

real rates are fully linked internationally Cv     1); the second is that

there is no linkage between real rates in different countries        Cr        0).


The third is that real rates are equal across countries Cu       0 and     r



1).

        Panel   A contains the results on euro depo;it and Panel B the

results   on domestic money market instruments. In general the evidence is

not favorable to either the hypothesis that real rates are fully          linked



  18   Mishkin (1984) presents estimates of mx ante real rates for the
       countries studied here but his sample ends in the second quarter of
       1979. His estimates therefore do not include the widespread dramatic
       increase in real rates we find here.
                                          —17—


or to the hypothesis that no international linkage exists. For both the

euro deposit rates and the domestic money market rates, the hypothesis

of no linkage Cr = 0) can be rejected at the five percent level for all

countries except Switzerland. The hypothesis of full linkage Cr        1)   is

rejected at the five percent level for four countries for both instru-

ments studied. In all cases the r coefficients lie between 0 and            1.


Canada has the highest coefficients, which are quite close to 1, espe-

cially for the domestic money market real rate. Germany has coefficients

around .4 and Switzerland has the lowest coefficients which are below

.3.    The remainder of the countries have coefficients between .5 and .8

                                      2
        Table 2 also contains the          statistics for the hypothesis that

real rates in each country are equal to real rates in the U.S. The

hypothesis of real rate equality is rejected in all cases but France for

the three—month euro rates and in all cases but Canada for the domestic

money market rates.20

        In general then it appears that while real rates in all of the

countries studied exhibit a statistically significant association with

U.S. real rate movement;, this linkage is not complete. We then would

want to ask whether there is a close association among real rates in the

European countries? We explore this question by running regression; of

the ex post real rate in European countries on the West German ix post

real rates in the the EMS countries are no more closely related to

German real rates than are real rates outside of the EMS. The standard

 significantly in recent years and have been considerably higher since

 1980 than during the 1970s. This increase in the general level of real

 rates has occurred in Canada and several european

 in   the United States. We also find that there is a significant positive

 correlation between real rate movements in the United States and those

 in seven other industrialized countries and that the degree of interna-

 tional linkage in real rates, while          significantly positive, is also

 significantly less than complete.            In addition, the evidence suggests

       Recent claims that real interest             rates are currently at level;

that there is a significant positive association between real rates in

the United States and those in other countries is consistent with the

frequently advanced argument that high U.S. real rates have been trans-

mitted abroad. However, it should be emphasized that, while consistent

with these arguments, our estimates provide no evidence on the direction

of causation of real rate movements: they do not necessarily imply that

high U.S. real rates have caused high real rates elsewhere.

     The evidence we present also points to significant independence in

real rate movements in the countries in our sample, a point that has

received little attention in recent discussions. This finding of a less

than complete linkage in real rates has important implications for

questions concerning the ability of domestic stabilization policies to

influence the economy by affecting real interest rates. Our evidence is

consistent with models that, for example, allow monetary policy to have

real effects. However, since we do not provide evidence on the source of

these significant differences in real rates, our results cannot rule out

models in which money is neutral and real rate differences arise due to

relative price movements resulting from real shocks to the economy.
