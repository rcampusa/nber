                               ABSTRACT




     In this paper an empirical model for analyzing the behavior of nominal

interest rates in a semi—open economy is developed. The model explicitly

incorporates both the role of open economy factors (i.e., world interest

rates, expected rate of devaluation) and domestic monetary conditions in

explaining interest rates movement. The model is tested using quarterly data

for Colombia for 1968—1982. The results obtained indicate that the semi—open

characterization is adequate for the case of Colombia, and that world interest

rates, the rate of devaluation and domestic monetary conditions have affected

domestic nominal interest rates during the period under consideration. The

results also indicate that unanticipated increases in the nominal quantity of

money have exercised a negative effect on nominal interest rates in Colombia.

I. Introduction

     Most empirical studies on interest rates behavior have made extreme

assumptions regarding the degree of openness of the economy under considera-

tion. Generally, it has been assumed that the economy in question is either

completely closed to the rest of the world, or that it is fully open, and that

there are no controls to capital movements. In reality, however, most cases

—   and especially those of developing countries —— correspond to an inter-

mediate situation, where the capital account of the balance of payments is

partially open, and there exist some controls to capital movements. Under

these circumstances it would be expected that in the short—run the domestic

rate of interest will respond both to external factors (i.e.., world interest

rates) and to internal monetary conditions, (i.e., excess supply or demand for

money). The purpose of this paper is to develop an empirical model to analyze

the behavior of nominal interest rates in a small semi—open economy. The

model specifically considers the role of open economy factors —   world   rate of

interest and expected rate of devaluation, for example —, and the role of

more traditional domestic monetary conditions in explaining interest rates

behavior.

     The model is tested using quarterly data for Colombia for 1968—1982.

Colombia is a semi—open economy, with a growing domestic capital market

partially integrated to the international financial markets. In that sense,

then, the behavior of the interest rate in Colombia cannot be explained by

conventional models that assume a fully open or completely closed economy.'

     The analysis presented in this paper is useful for evaluating two key

policy issues that are of great importance in semi—open developing economies.

First, the model directly addresses the question of the relationship between

the rate of devaluation and the nominal interest rate. The importance of this
                                        2




question stems from the fact that many times the monetary authorities in semi—

open developing countries are reluctant to adjust the exchange rate because of

the possible effects that this measure will have on domestic interest rates.

Second, the model will be useful to determine the effects of changes in

monetary policy ——   both anticipated and unanticipated — on domestic interest
rates. The empirical analysis of the relation between the rate of devaluation

and the domestic interest rate is particularly important in the Colombian

case, where a crawling peg exchange rate system has been in effect since

1967.2 Recently, however, a number of observers have pointed out that the

real   exchange rate is overvalued and have recommended to accelerate the rate
of devaluation of the Colombian crawling peg. [See, for example, Fedesarrollo
(1983),   Ocampo (1983).] The analysis presented in this paper, then, will be

useful to determine the effect of a faster rate of crawling on the domestic

nominal interest rate.

       The paper is organized in the following form: Section II presents an

empirical framework for analyzing the determination of nominal interest rates

in a small semi—open economy. In Section III empirical results obtained from

estimating the model using quarterly data for 1968 through 1982 for Colombia

are presented, In Section IV the analysis of the role of monetary factors in

determining the behavior of the interest rate In Colombia is taken one step

further. In this section the role of actual vs. unanticipated changes in

nominal money is investigated. This section also includes a brief discussion

on the role of expected inflation in the semi—open economy framework used in

this paper. Finally, in Section V some concluding remarks are presented.

II. Money, the Rate of Devaluation, and Interest Rates in a Semi—Open Economy

        In a fully open economy, where economic agents are risk neutral and

foreign   and domestic bonds are perfect substitutes, the internal and external

interest rates are linked through the interest parity condition (1) (this

ignores taxation, see Levi 1977):


                        =   jW De                                             (1)
where

           = domestic nominal interest rate

        i foreign (world) nominal interest rate, on instruments that have the

              same maturity as the domestic papers

      D =    expected rate of devaluation of the domestic currency between
             period t and the period corresponding to the maturity of the

             financial instruments. The subscript t refers to the fact that

              this expectation is formed in period t. Then, if dt is the

             actual rate of devaluation in period t, and the maturity of the

              financial instruments is one period, D =    E(d+1),    where E is

             the expectations operator.

If in the economy in question there are no impediments to capital movements,

equation (1) will tend to hold both in the short— and in the long—run. The

empirical evidence available suggests that a revised version of equation (1)

—   which replaces De by the forward premium, incorporates transaction costs,
and considers off—shore interest rates —      holds closely for the case of

industrialized countries [see Frenkel and Levich, 1975 and 19771.

        In the case of semi—open economies expression (1), however, clearly does

not hold. Quite on the contrary, the recent experience of the countries of

the cone of South—America (Argenina, Chile, Uruguay) suggests that in semi—

industrialized, semi—open economies the divergences from (1) can be
                                             4




 substantial, The case of Colombia also shows important deviations from

equation (1) [see Blejer and Landau (1984), and Montes and Candelo

 (1982)].

      Equation (1) can be modified in several ways in order to incorporate the

fact that we are dealing with a semi—open economy. In particular, it is

possible to write an expression that indicates that the domestic interest rate

tends to equate the world rate of interest plus the rate of devaluation and a

risk premium in the long—run, but that it can differ from it in the short—

run. If we denote the risk premium in period t by '                  equation     (1) can

then be replaced by the following expression:


                          =              —
                              e[(i+D+)           it_li                                  (2)


where 0<0<1.
     Even though equation (2) captures an important characteristic of a semi—

open economy — the fact that it takes time for the interest parity condition

to hold —,   it   does not allow for domestic monetary conditions to play any

role in the behavior of the domestic interest rate. In a semi—open economy,

however, where capital movements are subject to a number of controls, it is

conceivable that domestic monetary policy will have some effect on the short—

run behavior of the interest rate, The possible role of the conditions

prevailing in the domestic money market on interest rate behavior in a semi—

open economy can be captured by the following expression:


                         =
                              0[(i+D+) — 1tlI            — X[log in1 —
                                                                       log   m]        (3)


where 't    is   the real quantity of money in t, and where m is the

quantity of money demanded in that period. This equation differs from equa-

tion (2) in that it explicitly allows for internal monetary disequilibria to
                                          5



 affect interest rates movements. The parameter A measures the importance of

 these disequilibria, and the negative sign reflects the hypothesis that an

 excess supply (demand) for real money will generate a decline (increase) in

 the nominal interest rate. An important property of (3) is that the extreme

 situations of fully open or completely closed economies are particular cases

of this expression. If the economy under study is fully open to the rest of

the world, we would expect that e =     1.0 and A = 0.     If, on the other hand,

the economy is completely closed to foreign influences it would be expected

that 0       0 and A > 0. In the case of a semi—open economy, however, it

would be expected that both 0 and A would be significantly different from

zero.




III. Empirical Results

        In this section results obtained from the estimation of a reduced form of

equation (3) using quarterly data for 1968—1982 for Colombia are presented.3

In the estimation it is assumed that the expected rate of devaluation of the

Colombian peso in period t+l, as formed in period t (Dr), is equal to the

actual rate Qf devaluation in period t (dt). This corresponds to the

(plausible) assumption that during 1968—1982 the rate of devaluation in

Colombia can be represented by a random walk with a zero drift term. In fact,

the time series analysis of the rate of devaluation for this period suggests

that the random walk with zero drift hypothesis cannot be rejected.4

     With respect to the risk premium ($)      it   is assumed, in order to

simplify the analysis, that it can be represented by a constant k plus a

normally distributed random term        with zero mean and variance

(   = Ic +         Regarding the demand fr money function, it is assumed that

it has a conventional form:
                                             6




                        log m = b + b1 log y — b2        i                               (4)


for y = real        income.

        Combining equations (3) and (4) and using the assumption for the risk

premium         the following reduced form is obtained:6


                =      +              + 21tl + 13 log          +                +
                            yi(i+d)                                14 log                (5)


where       is an error term, and it is expected that                > 0,       > 0, 13 < 0
and 14 > 0. The expressions for the y's in terms of the parameters of the

structural equations (3) and (4) are:            =                   12 =
                                                     e/(l+xb2);             (l—e)/(l+xb2);
13 —    XI(l+Ab2);   14 =   Ab1/(l+Ab2).
       Equation (5) was estimated using OLS and instrumental variables

methods. The reason for using instrumental variables is that                   y might not
be exogenous in a small semi—open economy like Colombia. Table 1 contains the

results obtained from the estimation of the reduced form equation (5).

       The values of Durbin's h reported in Table 1 indicate that the errors

might be negatively correlated. For this reason procedures that correct for

serially correlated disturbances were also used. For example, equation (5)

was also estimated using the two—stages procedure suggested by Fair (1970) to

deal with serial correlation in the presence of a lagged dependent variable.

The results obtained show that the estimated first—order correlation

coefficient (p) is very small, and that the estimated coefficients reported

in Table 1 are not significantly affected:

                 = —1.849        + 0.380 (i+d) + 0.374          i1 —        0.254 log m
                                                                                       t 1
                      (—2.978)    (2.043)             (2.705)            (—1.923)


                 + 0.412 log                S.E. =    0.064;
                      (3.646)
                                  y                                p = —0.06           (5.3)
                                          7




         Table 2 presents the estimated structural coefficients computed from

 equations (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3). One of the most important results reported

 in these tables refer to the estimated values of 0. This coefficient, which

 in all the estimations was statistically significant, measures the speed at

 which uncovered interest rate differentials will be corrected. As can be

 seen,     0 is fairly high, indIcating that, with other things given, In one

 quarter almost one—half of a unitary discrepancy between (i+d) and
                                                                           1t—1
will be corrected. This coefficient suggests, for example, that higher world

interest rates will be quickly translated into higher Interest rates in

Colombia. This seems to have been the case in Colombia during the early

1980's where the higher world interest rates were rapidly reflected

domestically.

     The results obtained can also be used to simulate the effect of an

increase of the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg on the nominal

interest rate. This is an important policy question that usually arises in

discussions concerning "unwanted" effects of accelerating the rate of

devaluation. Consider, for example, the case of equation (5.1), and assume

that in period 0 the domestic nominal interest rate is 40% and that the rate

of devaluation of the crawling peg is 22% per annum. Assume now that in

period 1 the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg is increased to 32%, and

maintained at this higher level. In the case where all other variables remain

constant, the evolution of the domestic interest rate, using the estimated

parameters from equation (5.1), is given in Table 3. As may be seen, these

results show a fairly fast speed of adjustment of the domestic interest rate

to the higher rate of devaluation of the crawling peg. After one year 6.1

percentage points of the devaluation have already been reflected in the

domestic   interest rate.7
                                      8



     The results reported in equations (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) also provide

information regarding the role of monetary conditions on interest rate

behavior. These estimates provide semi--elasticities, of the interest rates

with respect to real money ranging from —0.171 to —0.254. In the next section

the role of actual vs. unanticipated changes in nominal money on interest rate

behavior in Colombia is explicitly investigated.8

     The estimated equations also provide plausible estimates for the

parameters in the demand for money equation in Colombia. As may be seen from

Table 2, the estimated long—run income elasticity of the demand for money in

Colombia ranges from 1.6 to 1.9. The semi—elasticity of the demand for money

relative to the nominal interest rate, on the other hand, ranges from —0.954

to —1.231. These numbers roughly correspond to what has been previously

estimated for Colombia [see, Montes and Candelo, 1982].



IV. Unanticipated Money and Interest Rates in Colombia

     The analysis presented in the previous section uses actual real money to

investigate the relationship between monetary conditions and nominal interest

rates in Colombia. Most of the recent work in macroeconomics, however, has

emphasized the importance of unexpected monetary shocks as opposed to actual

changes in money.9 In this section the role of unanticipated and actual

changes in the nominal quantity of money in explaining the behavior of nominal

interest rates in Colombia is investigated. This is done in the following

way: First, in equation (5) log mt_i is replaced by a measure of unexpected

nominal money shocks (DMR). And second, in equation (5) log m_1 is also

replaced by the actual rate of growth of nominal money (DMN).

    The series for unexpected changes n the nominal quantity of money were

constructedas the residuals from the estimation of an autoregressive process
                                          9



of order 7 for changes in the nominal quantity of money. After running this

AR process the corresponding residuals were checked to make sure that they

were white noise.1° The results obtained from the estimation of the interest

rate equations that include unanticipated and actual nominal monetary shocks

are presented in Table 4.

     As may   be   seen the coefficients of Dt'IRt are significantly negative as

expected. Also, as expected, the coefficient of the actual rate of change of

nominal money (DMNt) are non—significantly different from zero. Generally

speaking, these results show that while unanticipated changes in the nominal

quantity of money have exercised a negative effect on nominal interest rates

in Colombia, actual changes in nominal money (with other things equal) have

tended to leave interest rates unaffected. Inother important result from

Table 4 is that the estimated coefficients of (i + d) are not affected by

the inclusion of DMRt. This provides further support to the hypothesis that

models of a semi—open economy are appropriate for explaining interest rate

behavior in Colombia.

     Up to now there has been no mention of the possible role of expected

inflation in determining interest rate behavior in Colombia. The reason for

this is that in the semi—open economy framework of this paper the traditional

role of expected inflation is captured by expected devaluation D. As long

as there is a close relationship between the rate of devaluation and infla-

tion, as it has been the case in Colombia, the expected rate of devaluation

will reflect the expectations of inflation.'1 However, in order to test for a

possible independent role for the expected rate of inflation, the equations

reported in Tables 1 and 4 were also estimated adding a proxy for expected

inflation as a possible additional expl;natory variables. However, in the

results obtained the coefficient for the expected rate of inflation were in
                                      10




all cases very small and insignificant.



V. Concluding Remarks

     In this paper an empirical model for analyzing interest rates behavior in

a semi—open economy was presented. The model was tested for the case of

Colombia using quarterly data for 1968—1982. The results obtained were

remarkably good, and indicated that: (a) differentials between domestic

nominal interest rates and world interest rates plus expected devaluation and

risk premiums will tend to be corrected quite fast. (b) In one year an

acceleration of the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg, will be trans-

lated in about 60% into a higher domestic rate of interest. (c) An excess

supply for real money will exercise significant negative pressures on the

nominal interest rate (i.e., there is a liquidity effect). (d) Unanticipated

changes in the nominal quantity of money will also exercise a negative presure

on nominal interest rates. On the other hand actual increases in the rate of

growth of nominal money will leave the rate of interest unaffected.

appropriate for Colombia, it may be Inadequate for other developing semi—open

economies. Specifically it is possible that other developing economies are

subject to the so—called "peso—problem'.

     5From a theoretical perspective the risk premium         will depend on

variables like the stocks of outside government assets. Empirical studies on

the subject, however, have generally failed to find this kind of relationship

(see, for example, Frankel 1982). For this reason in this paper a more simple

approach has been taken with respect to the representation of

     6 important property of equation (3) is that even in the long—run the

domestic rate of interest will not be necessarily equal to the world interest

rate plus the rate of devaluation. In fact, according to (3) and the assump-

tions regarding D and ,        in   the long—run the domestic interest rate will

be equal to:

                            (i + d) + [k + + w1.
         alternative exercise that can    be performed is to simulate the effect
of a higher rate of devaluation of the crawling peg under the assumption that

[log m_1 —     log m] remains constant. In this case, of course, the
adjustment of the domestic interest rate is much faster. For example, for the

numbers used in the exercise reported in Table 3, after one year the domestic

nominal interest rate will be equal to 49.2Z.

     8 important characteristic of equation (3) is that it implies that in

the long—run, for given i and d, changes in the real quantity of money

will not affect i. Since this is a fairly strong implication, regressions

that incorporated up to 12 lags of log in were also run. The results obtain-

ed show that only the contemporaneous and once lagged coefficients are

signifIcantly negative. Starting with log mt_2 the coefficients become

positive. The sum of the 12 coefficients is not significantly different from

zero (—0.171 with a standard error of 0.474.) It should be noticed, however,

that in a more complete model that allo's for a variable risk premium (),

changes in the real quantity of money could affect i in the long—run,
                                          13




through its possible effect on           As mentioned, however, at the present

time the empirical analysis of the determinants of the exchange rate risk

premium is an unresolved issue (see Frankel 1982).

     9on   the   relation between unexpected monetary shocks and real output in

Colombia see Hanson (1980) and Edwards (1983). Most previous empirical

studies have not found a clearcut relationship between unanticipated nominal

money growth and interest rates. See, for example, Darby and Stockman (1983)

for a study of the OECD countries.

           AR(7) was chosen to represent DMNt becuase it was the lower order

autoregressive process that generated white—noise residuals.

           their recent article Montes and Candelo (1982) found a coefficient

of 0.974 in an equation that relates the rate of devaluation to domestic

inflation in Colombia during 1968—1980. Besides the equations reported in

Table 4, equations that included both log mt_i and DNRt were run. In

those cases the coefficients of DMRt were also significantly negative.

                                  Data Appendix



(a) For 1968—1980 all the data, except world interest rates were taken from

    Montes and Candelo (1982).

(b) The U.S. three month treasury bill interest rates were used as a proxy

    for 'world" interest rates. The data for 1968—1982 was obtained from the

    International Financial Statistics.

(c) The data for the Colombian variables for 1981—1982 is compatible with the

    Montes and Candelo (1982)    data   and was provided by the Departamento

    Naciona]. de Planeacion.
