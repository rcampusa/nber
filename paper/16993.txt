                                              ABSTRACT

During the Industrial Revolution technological progress and innovation became the main drivers of
economic growth. But why was Britain the technological leader? We argue that one hitherto little recognized
British advantage was the supply of highly skilled, mechanically able craftsmen who were able to
adapt, implement, improve, and tweak new technologies and who provided the micro inventions necessary
to make macro inventions highly productive and remunerative. Using a sample of 759 of these mechanics
and engineers, we study the incentives and institutions that facilitated the high rate of inventive activity
during the Industrial Revolution. First, apprenticeship was the dominant form of skill formation. Formal
education played only a minor role. Second, many skilled workmen relied on secrecy and first-mover
advantages to reap the benefits of their innovations. Over 40 percent of the sample here never took
out a patent. Third, skilled workmen in Britain often published their work and engaged in debates
over contemporary technological and social questions. In short, they were affected by the Enlightenment
culture. Finally, patterns differ for the textile sector; therefore, any inferences from textiles about the
whole economy are likely to be misleading.

         Introduction.

         The Industrial Revolution was the first period in which technological progress and

innovation became major factors in economic growth. There is by now general agreement that

during the seventy years or so traditionally associated with the Industrial Revolution, there was little

economic growth as traditionally measured in Britain, but that in large part this was to be expected.1

The sectors in which technological progress occurred grew at a rapid rate, but they were small in

1760, and thus their effect on growth was limited at first (Mokyr 1998, pp. 12-14 ). Yet progress

took place in a wide range of industries and activities, not just in cotton and steam. A full description

of the range of activities in which innovation took place or was at least attempted cannot be provided

here, but inventions in some pivotal industries such as iron and mechanical engineering had

backward linkages in many more traditional industries. In the words of McCloskey (1981, p. 118),

“the Industrial Revolution was neither the age of steam, nor the age of cotton, nor the age of iron.

It was the age of progress.” A similar point has been made by Temin (1997).

         Outside the familiar tales of cotton textiles, wrought iron, and steam power, there were

improvements in many aspects of production, such as mechanical and civil engineering, food

processing, brewing, paper, glass, cement, mining, and shipbuilding. Some of the more famous

advances of the time may have had a negligible direct effect on growth rates, but improved the

quality of life in other ways; one thinks above all of smallpox inoculation and vaccination, the

mining safety lamp, hot air and hydrogen balloons, food canning, and gas lighting (Mokyr, 1990,

2009a). Britain was the world leader in innovation for a period of about a century, after which its

         The main explanations for the low level of income per capita growth during the decades of the Industrial
Revolution are the unprecedented rate of population growth in this period, as well as the incidence of bad weather and
war.

dominance slowly dissolved. Yet Britain retained a place as one of many western nations that

collaborated in a joint program to apply a rapidly growing knowledge base to economic production.

         What drove British leadership, and why was Britain the most technologically advanced

economy in the world for so long? The question has been attacked many times, and with many

different answers.2 In the spirit of this volume, it seems to make sense to make a distinction between

the rate of technological progress and its direction, which have often been confused in the literature.

In his recent influential work, Allen (2009a, 2009b) has resurrected induced innovation theory and

re-emphasized the role of factor prices in generating the inventions that formed the Industrial

Revolution. Yet the high wages that Allen emphasized may have imparted a labor-saving direction

on the innovations, but it is hard to use them to explain the “engine of growth” which is the growing

body of useful knowledge and its ever-greater accessibility in the eighteenth century. As an

alternative many scholars, led by Wrigley (2004, 2010) have emphasized the importance of the

availability of coal in Britain; this may explain a bias toward fuel-intensive and perhaps the

replacement of water- and animal-powered plants by steam-driven ones. Yet the improvements in

coal technology point to the fact that coal production itself was subject to deeper forces.3 Moreover,

the progress in water power technology in the eighteenth century indicates that even without coal,

energy-saving technological progress was feasible, and even that without coal Britain would have

had experienced an Industrial Revolution, albeit one that would have a somewhat different dynamic

(Clark and Jacks, 2007).



         2
         For a slightly dated survey, see Mokyr (1998, pp. 28-81). Recent contributions focus on institutions (North and
Weingast, 1989; Mokyr, 2008; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2010), and the roles of factor prices and coal discussed below.
         3
         Two examples should suffice: the pathbreaking work in using stratigraphic data to locate coal (Manchester,
2001) and the “miner’s friend” invented by Humphry Davy (James, 2005).
                                                            3

         In what follows, we will take a closer look at one particular aspect: the importance of

technological competence and the incentives of those people who were the practical carriers of

technological progress in this era.4 Competence is defined here as the high-quality workmanship and

materials needed to implement an innovation, that is, to follow the blueprint with a high level of

accuracy, carry out the instructions embodied in the technique, and to have the ability to install,

operate, adapt, and repair the machinery and equipment under a variety of circumstances. Beyond

those, competence often involved minor improvements and refinements of a technique, which may

not have qualified as a “microinvention” stricto sensu, but clearly enhanced the innovative effort in

economy.5 In principle, it is easy to see that there are deep complementarities between the small

group of people who actually invent things and can be identified as such, and the somewhat larger

group of skilled workmen who possessed the training and natural dexterity to actually carry out the

“instructions” contained in the new recipes and blueprints that inventors wrote with a high degree

of accuracy, build the parts on a routine basis with very low degrees of tolerance, and still could fill

in the blanks when the instructions were inevitably incomplete.6 We argue that of Britain’s industrial

precocity owed a great deal to the high level of competence of those engineers and mechanics who

provided the support for the inventors.

         But who were they? Identifying competence falls somewhere the two extremes of either



         4
         In his contribution to the 1962 Rate and Direction volume, Fritz Machlup (1962) discussed at some length the
concept of “inventive labor.” Part of our purpose is to unpack that term into those “inventive workers” who are truly
innovative, and those who fill in the gaps and improve the original insights whom we refer to as tweakers. While the
context here is historical, there is little doubt that this concept can readily be extended to our own time.
         5
          In this paper we will be little concerned with truly epochal or macroinventions.
         6
         In another paper in the original volume, John Enos (1962) distinguishes between the “alpha” stage (the original
invention) and the “beta” stage (improvement). This parallels our distinction. His finding is that most of the productivity
growth in the petroleum refining industry occurred during the beta stage (p. 319).
                                                         4

studying a handful of heroic inventors whose names are well known, and searching for variables that

measure the overall national level of some critical input such as human capital or the supply of

entrepreneurship in the population. Neither of those is satisfactory. Modern economic history has

long ago distanced itself from the heroic hagiographies in which the Industrial Revolution was

attributed to the genius of a few superstar inventors. On the other hand, it may seriously be doubted

whether the average level of education of the laboring class (say, the bottom two thirds of the

income distribution) made much difference to the outcome (Mitch, 1998).

        Moreover, did Britain have a comparative advantage in macroinventions such as steampower

and cotton spinning? While Britain did have a large number of “hall of fame” inventors, it was

equally able to adopt inventions made overseas. It may be surmised that Britain may have had an

absolute advantage in macroinventions, its comparative advantage was in smaller improvements and

competence — as illustrated by the large number of highly skilled technicians that Britain

“exported” to the Continent. At the same time a flow of substantial continental inventions found

their first applications in Britain, presumably because other factors, complementary with the

innovations, were present in larger quantities.7 But what were these complementarities? Britain

provided a freer market, and overall may have had an institutional environment that was more

conducive to innovation. But its human capital advantage in the form of skilled workmen is the one

element that has not been sufficiently stressed.

        We may distinguish between three levels of activity that drove innovation in this period. One

were the macroinventions and other major breakthroughs that solved a major bottleneck and opened


        7
         Among the better-known of these inventions were the Robert continuous paper-making machine, the Jacquard
loom, Berthollet’s bleaching process, Leblanc’s soda-making process, Lebon’s gaslighting technique, De Girard’s
spinning machine for linen yarn, Friedrich Koenig’s steam-driven printer, Appert’s invention of food canning, and the
Argand lamp.
                                                          5

a new door.8 We will refer to these inventors as major inventors, and they are, by and large, the ones

that made it into economic history textbooks. Another was the myriad of small and medium

cumulative microinventions that improved and debugged existing inventions, adapted them to new

uses, and combined them in new applications. The people engaged in those will be referred to as

tweakers in the sense that they improved and debugged an existing invention. Some of the more

important advances among those may have been worth patenting, but clearly this was not uniformly

the case. A third group, and perhaps the least recognized of Britain’s advantages, was the existence

of a substantial number of skilled workmen capable of building, installing, operating, and

maintaining new and complex equipment. The skills needed for pure implementers were substantial,

but they did not have to be creative themselves. We will refer to these as implementers. It goes

without saying that the line between tweakers and implementers is blurry, but at the very least a

patent or some prize for innovation would be a clear signal of creativity.

         Some of the greatest technical minds of the Industrial Revolution clearly were good at all

three, but the vast majority of highly skilled mechanics did not invent much that posterity

remembers.9 It has been argued that artisans alone, without the help of any “great inventors,” could

have generated much of the technological progress of the period simply by incrementally improving




         8
           We will use a somewhat wider definition for these major inventions than the one in Mokyr (1990a), which
defines macroinventions in terms of their epistemic innovativeness and effect on the marginal product of further
improvements. Here even inventions that were not dramatic new insights but had a major impact on the economy, such
as the mule and the puddling and rolling process would be classified as such.
         9
           A notable exception was the Dartmouth blacksmith Thomas Newcomen, who in the phrase of a recent author
was “the first (or very nearly) and clearly the most important member of a tribe of a very particular, and historically
original, type: the English artisan-engineer-entrepreneur” (Rosen, 2010, p. 40).
                                                         6

and adapting existing technology.10 Yet sophisticated artisanal economies had thrived in Europe

since the late middle ages, and there was no reason for them to be delayed to the second half of the

eighteenth century if they had been capable of generating an Industrial Revolution by themselves.

At the same time, “great inventors” without the support of high-quality competence, were equally

doomed to create economically meaningless curiosa (of which Leonardo’s myriad inventions are

just one example).

        The strong complementarity between the three forms of technological activity is critical to

the understanding of the question of “why Britain.” A nation that possessed a high level of technical

competence could successfully implement major inventions wherever made. The economic success

of inventors depended, among other things, on their ability to find tweakers to get the bugs out of

the invention, and implementers to construct, install and operate it. To quote a famous example,

James Watt, the paradigmatic “heroic” inventor depended for his success not only on the ability of

John Wilkinson to bore the cylinders for his machine with great accuracy, but also some of his

brilliant employees such as William Murdoch (Griffiths, 1992) as well as highly competent

engineers such as John Southern and James Lawson (Roll, 1930, pp. 260–61).11 Their ability to build

and maintain equipment embodying new technology inevitably spilled over to small adaptations and

adjustments that would have to be regarded as minor incremental innovations.



        10
          Hilaire-Pérez (2007) and Berg (2007) believe that “an economy of imitation” could lead to a self-sustaining
process of improvement, driven purely by artisans. Such sequences of microinventions, without any shifts in the
technological paradigm, were doomed to bog down into diminishing returns.
        11
           Some of the unsung heroes of the Industrial Revolution were these less-known tweakers. Thus Josias C.
Gamble (1775–1848), an Irishman trained in Glasgow, was essential to James Muspratt’s introduction of the Leblanc
process in Britain (Musson and Robinson, 1969, p. 187); a variety of mechanics, such as William Horrocks of Stockport
and many others who improved upon Cartwright’s powerloom (Marsden, 1895, pp. 70-72); William Woollat was
Jedediah Strutt’s brother in law and helped him develop a mechanized stocking frame that could make ribbed hosiery
(Fitton and Wadsworth, 1958, p. 24).
                                                7

       The emphasis on mechanical skills and dexterity has major implications for the assessment

of the role of human capital in the British Industrial Revolution. The group to focus on is not so

much the few dozens or so major inventors and scientists that can be denoted as “great

inventors”(Khan, 2006), nor should we concentrate on the human capital of the mass of factory

workers, many of whom were still poorly educated and illiterate as late as 1850. Instead the focus

ought to be the top 3-5 percent of the labor force in terms of skills: engineers, mechanics,

millwrights, chemists, clock- and instrument makers, skilled carpenters and metal workers,

wheelwrights, and similar workmen. Their numbers were in the tens of thousands, and the vast bulk

of them are impossible to trace. Many of them were independent artisans and entrepreneurs; others

were in the employ of others. A considerable number were both or switched from one to the other.

But we shall make an effort to find at least the best-known of them, although survival bias here is

impossible to avoid and we can make no presumption that those who end up in our sample are

representative.



Skills and Competence

        What evidence is there to support Britain’s advantage in tweakers and implementers? In a

famous letter to his partner, John Roebuck, James Watt wrote in 1765 that “my principal hindrance

in erecting engines is always smith-work” (Smiles, 1874, p. 92) and he had considerable difficulty

finding “workmen capable of fitting together the parts of a machine so complicated and of so novel

a construction” (id. p. 196; see also Roll, [1930], 1968, p. 61). Yet, while competence was thus a

binding constraint, Watt‘s engines, and those of many other machine-builders did get built and were
                                                             8

of high quality.12 Foreign observers, perhaps more than local writers (who took Britain’s superiority

for granted) noted the comparatively high level of competence of British skilled workmen.13 The

flows of the kind of useful knowledge associated with workmanship are quite unambiguous.

Industrial spies from the Continent converged on Britain to study the fine details of British

engineering and iron-making (Harris, 1998), and British technicians, mechanics, and skilled

workmen left the country in droves to find employment in France, Germany, Belgium, as well as

Eastern Europe, and this despite the fact that such emigration was prohibited by law until 1824 and

that a state of war existed between Britain and many of these countries for most of the years between

1780 and 1815 (Harris, 1998; Henderson, 1954). It is telling, for example that one of the best-known

eighteenth century engineering migrants to the Continent, John Holker (1719–1786), made his career

when he moved a number of highly skilled Lancashire workmen to the embryonic cotton industry

in Rouen after which he rose to the position of “inspector-general of foreign manufactures” in 1756.

His mandate in that job was, among others, to recruit more British workers.14 After 1815, the number


         12
            A typical description of a competent British worker was provided by the engineer William Fairbairn in a book
first published in 1863 “The millwright of former days was to a great extent the sole representative of mechanical art
... a kind of jack of all trades who could with equal facility work at a lathe, the anvil, or the carpenter’s bench... a fair
arithmetician who could calculate the velocities, strength and power of machines...Such was the character and condition
of the men who designed and carried out most of the mechanical work of this country up to the middle and end of the
last century” (Fairbairn, 1871, p. ix-x).
         13
           A Swiss visitor, César de Saussure noticed in 1727 that “English workmen are everywhere renowned, and
justly. They work to perfection, and though not inventive, are capable of improving and of finishing most admirably what
the French and Germans have invented" (de Saussure, [c. 1727], 1902, p. 218, letter dated May 29, 1727). Josiah Tucker,
a keen contemporary observer, pointed out in 1758 that “the Number of Workmen [in Britain] and their greater
Experience excite the higher Emulation, and cause them to excel the Mechanics of other Countries in these Sorts of
Manufactures” (Tucker, 1758, p. 26). The French political economist Jean-Baptiste Say noted in 1803 that “the enormous
wealth of Britain is less owing to her own advances in scientific acquirements, high as she ranks in that department, as
to the wonderful practical skills of her adventurers [entrepreneurs] in the useful application of knowledge and the
superiority of her workmen” (Say [1803], 1821, Vol. 1, pp. 32–33).
         14
           His colleague Michael Alcock modernized the famed St. Etienne ironworks in France in the 1760s with the
help of skilled workmen that his wife had recruited in England. A third striking case of such migration is that of William
Wilkinson, the brother of the famous Broseley ironmonger, who was charged with setting up cannon foundries and blast
furnaces, at an astronomical salary of 60,000 livres per year.
                                                            9

of British engineers and mechanics that swarmed all over the Continent increased, including

especially in such early industrializers as Belgium and Switzerland. The most famous family here

were William Cockerill and his sons, who set up the most successful machine-toll manufacturing

plant in continental Europe in Verviers in eastern Belgium (Mokyr, 1976).15 The same was true in

civil engineering. The first permanent bridge across the Danube connecting Buda and Pest was

commenced in 1839 under the engineering control of William Tierney Clark. At the same time,

highly original and creative minds from the European Continent found their way to Britain, in search

of an environment in which their inventions could be exploited and the complementary skills that

made the development of their inventions possible.16

         On the supply side, Britain’s apprenticeship system worked exceptionally well in producing

highly skilled workers that could serve as implementers, despite (or perhaps because) of the

weakness of British guilds (Humphries, 2003).17 The Statue of Artificers of 1563, which regulated

apprenticeship, did not cover many mechanical occupations and its regulations were often ignored

(Wallis, 2008). All this contributed to labor markets that on the eve of the Industrial Revolution were

more flexible and less encumbered than on the Continent.


         15
           As late as 1840, a British official informed a Parliamentary Committee that in the cotton mills in the Vienna
area “the directors and foremen are chiefly Englishmen or Scotsmen from the cotton manufactories of Glasgow and
Manchester” (Henderson, 1954, p. 196). In countries with even less supplies of local skilled workmen, the importance
of foreigners was even more important; much of the iron used to build St. Petersburg’s famed bridges came from a local
ironworks managed by Charles Baird (1766–1843), working with his son and his nephew.
         16
           The Swiss inventor Aimé Argand, designed a new oil-burning lamp but his attempts to build and sell it in Paris
failed. He went to Britain in the 1780s, where he sought and found the help of the great entrepreneur Matthew Boulton;
sadly, commercial fortune eluded him here as well. More luck had the Saxon Rudolph Ackermann (1764– 1834), who
arrived in London in 1787 to make major contributions to the technology of coachmaking and lithography and whose
firm survived until 1992.
         17
          The relative weakness of the guilds was in part the result of the declining power of their traditional ally, the
monarchy. Second, guilds were an urban phenomenon, yet some crucial mechanical occupations such as mining
engineers emerged on the countryside. Last, industry had the continuous option to produce on the countryside which also
weakened the power of the urban guilds.
                                                            10

         The fact that millwrights were entirely produced through the apprenticeship system

highlights its importance for the formation of skill and competence in Britain. In a recent paper,

Karine van der Beek (2010) has shown that in the period 1710-1772 at least, the English system

produced larger numbers of apprentices in high-skilled occupations, especially in machinery-

building and precision instruments, and that this took place in the industrializing midlands, where

the demand for such skills was highest. At the same time the relative tuition paid to masters in high

skill occupations did not increase in the long run, indicating that the apprenticeship system was

sufficiently flexible to supply enough competent craftsmen . Much of the competence of these

skilled workers still was in the nature of tacit knowledge, which could not be learned only from

books and articles but required hands-on instruction and personal experience. The degree of tacitness

varied from industry to industry, but was especially marked in the iron industry (Harris, 1988,

1992).18 Yet whether tacit or not, there can be little doubt that this strength of Britain played a

central role in its success. Its skilled workers, freed from enforceable labor market restrictions, often

moved from area to area, diversifying their human capital portfolios and at the same time enhancing

innovation by applying ideas from one field to another, a kind of technological hybridizing.19

         At the top of the pyramid emerged a small group of professional inventors, the kind of person

of whom Smith wrote his famous lines that inventions were often made by “men of speculation,

whose trade is not to do anything but to observe everything” ([1776], 1976, p. 14). Some of the great



         18
          The puddlers, an expertise that emerged quickly after Henry Cort’s pathbreaking invention in 1785 were, in
the words of one scholar trained “by doing, not by talking, and developed a taciturnity that lasted all their life” (Gale,
1961–62, p. 9).
         19
            Reflecting on the supply of the craftsmen he employed , Watt noted in 1794 that many of them had been
trained in analogous skills “such as millwrights, architects and surveyors,” with the practical skills and dexterity spilling
over from occupation to occupation (cited by Jones, 2008, p. 126–27).
                                                        11

inventors of the Industrial Revolution, such as Crompton, Cartwright, Smeaton, and Harrison should

be seen as full-time inventors, although their mechanical abilities probably exceeded their

knowledge of “experimental philosophy.” Others were educated part-timers who dabbled in

invention and engineering; some of those were scientists such as Humphry Davy and Joseph

Priestley, but gifted and obsessed amateurs also made considerable contributions.20 Smith’s

inventive philosophers would, however, have had no effect on the economy had there been no

dexterous and ingenious workmen to carry out and improve their designs.

        How were these individuals incentivized? Britain, of course, had a patent system, which has

been discussed at length in the literature (Mokyr, 2009b) and to which we will return below. But

there were other ways in which ingenuity was rewarded. One was the awarding of prizes, set either

ex ante for someone who solved a known problem, or ex post for someone whose contribution was

widely recognized but who was not able to reap the rewards. The Society of Arts (f. 1754) set clear

targets, such as machines that would encourage the manufacture of lace, to reduce both the

dependence on French imports and encourage the employment of women (Griffiths, Hunt, and

O’Brien, 1992, p. 886). These premiums were set in advance, yet the condition for their award was

that no patent was taken out. In other cases, the Society awarded medals to inventors who had little

interest in taking out patents (e.g., the engineer and educational writer Richard Lovell Edgeworth,

who won numerous medals). It clearly provided an alternative model to the patent system (Harrison,

2006). In a few notable cases, Parliament stepped in and awarded grants or pensions to inventors


        20
            Thus Patrick Miller (1731–1815), a wealthy Scottish banker, was a pioneer in the mechanical propulsion of
boats and one of the first to experiment with steam power on a vessel, yet this was obviously more of a hobby than a
serious occupation (although Miller did take out a patent on a shallow-draft vessel). Another famous amateur inventor
(at least in the sense of not being motivated by financial gain) was Charles Earl of Stanhope (1753–1816), a radical
member of the House of Lords who also made notable contributions to the technology of early steamship design and
whose improved printing press was purchased by The Times and Oxford University Press.

of considerable merit. For others, especially those who were in business for themselves, a major

form of reward was what we would call today “first-mover” advantage: by producing goods and

services that were just a little better and more reliable or cheaper than their competitors’, they could

make an excellent living.

        Many of the most successful innovators in the Industrial Revolution were thus incentivized

by multiple mechanisms: although in many cases they relied on patents or secrecy to protect the

rent-generating intellectual property rights, as often they placed their knowledge in the public

domain and relied on superior technology or competence. The reality on the ground was, however,

that it is in many cases impractical to distinguish between those who lived off their reputation as

consultants or employees and those who were in business for themselves. In the course of a career,

many mechanics and engineers switched back and forth from entrepreneurial activity and self

employment to hired employees.21

        Beyond the standard economic notions of incentives, the rate and direction of technological

progress during the Industrial Revolution were affected by a Zeitgeist that may be termed a

mechanical culture, in which science and chemistry found their way to the shopfloor where

entrepreneurs and engineers tried to apply them in their stubborn attempts to achieve

“improvements” (Jacob, 2007). Mechanical culture was part and parcel of the Industrial

Enlightenment. It implied that many of the efforts to improve machinery fed on a culture that placed

technological questions at the center of the social agenda. The second half of the eighteenth century



        21
            One well-known example is the Scottish engineer Peter Ewart (1767–1842), who worked for a time for
Boulton and Watt, then went into business with Samuel Oldknow and Samuel Greg, then opened his own mill in 1811,
and eventually ended up employed by the admiralty. His colleague, William Brunton (1777–1851) was also employed
in Boulton and Watt’s Soho work, which he left in 1808 to take another employment. Eventually he became a partner
at a iron foundry in Birmingham and then moved to London where he practiced as an independent civil engineer.

witnessed the maturing of the Baconian Program, which postulated that useful knowledge was the

key to social improvement. In that culture, technological progress could thrive. The signs of that

culture were everywhere: in which books and articles were published, in what people discussed in

coffeehouses and pubs, in the establishment of scientific clubs and societies, and through all of them

what happened in the workshops and factories. None of this is to deny that economic incentives were

central to the story, just that they were neither “everything” nor “the only thing.” The best-known

people affected by this culture were the famous enlightened industrialists such as Josiah Wedgwood,

Matthew Boulton, Benjamin Gott, Richard Crawshay, John Kennedy, and John Marshall. Their

commitment to the culture of improvement through the application of useful knowledge to issues

in manufacturing are paradigmatic examples of the Industrial Enlightenment (Jones, 2008).

Economic motives were not always central to the men who made the Industrial Revolution.22 Those

who came from science, such as Davy and Faraday were probably close to the Frenchman

Berthollet, the inventor of the chlorine bleaching process, who famously wrote that “When one loves

science, one has little need for fortune which would only risk one’s happiness” (cited by Musson

and Robinson, 1969, p. 266). But did this culture “filter down” to the layer of lesser known people

in the layer just below them?

         In what follows, we try to build a database not so much of “superstar inventors” but of the


         22
           A rather striking example of this is the case of Samuel Crompton, the inventor of the mule, arguably the most
productive invention of the Industrial Revolution. It was said of him that he was “or a retiring and unambitious
disposition,” and hence he took out no patent on his invention. His only regret was that public curiosity would “not allow
him to enjoy his little invention in his garret” and to earn undisturbed the fruits of his ingenuity and perseverance
(Baines, 1835, p. 199). Yet even Crompton had to make ends meet and in the end appealed to Parliament for a reward
for having made an invention that so palpably benefitted the realm. In 1812 Parliament awarded him £ 5,000, which he
subsequently lost in a failed business venture (Farnie, 2004). Another, much less famous, example is that of the Scottish
plowmaker James Small (1740-1793) who redesigned the all-iron plow according to formal principles and wrote the
standard text on plow design. Small insisted that this knowledge be made generally available and declined to take out
a patent. He enjoyed the patronage of the two great Scottish agricultural innovators, Lord Kames and John Sinclair. His
workshop in Berwickshire produced fine plows, though they were not universally popular.

layer of technically competent individuals just below them: the engineers, mechanics, chemists, and

skilled craftsmen who improved and implemented the inventions of the more famous men. We show

how these “tweakers” were trained, what incentives drove them (that is, how they made their living),

and how deeply they were immersed in the intellectual life of the Industrial Enlightenment.



Database

       Our main purpose is to shed light on the technological environment that bred technological

success and innovation in the British Industrial Revolution. Rather than focus primarily on “great

inventors,” our argument concentrates on “competence” — that is, we look for the persons whose

dexterity and training allowed them to tweak and implement the new techniques. To be in the

sample, they had to have made some inventions themselves (the bulk of them would be

microinventions and adaptations), but their main activity was implementation. It would be futile to

distinguish between inventors and pure non-inventors in a strict sense, simply because the process

of innovation consists of both the new technique and its implementation, and during the

implementation process inevitably problems are resolved and the technique is tweaked and adapted

to the particular needs of the user. Most inventors spent much of their lives working on existing

techniques that they or others had generated.

        It must be stressed that this kind of project inevitably runs into a “tip-of-the-iceberg”

problem. We have no illusions that the bulk of competent technicians who determined both rate and

the direction of the Industrial Revolution in Britain simply did not leave enough of a record to
                                                            15

become known to posterity.23 To leave a record, an individual had to do something more than just

be a competent and productive employee or artisan. The argument we make is one of continuity: if

we can uncover some of the layer of competent workers below the superstars, we may be able to say

something about what motivated these people and how they interacted with their institutional, and

cultural environments.

          We are interested in the “classical” Industrial Revolution and so we use primarily sources

that focus on activities before 1860. To this end we have constructed a prosopographical database

that is composed of men (there is one woman in the sample), born before 1830, of a technical ability

that was sufficient to make it into the literature (we excluded all persons whose role was purely

entrepreneurial or commercial). We are interested in tweakers, engineers and mechanics who made

minor improvements on existing inventions. Hence for them to have taken out a patent is a sufficient

condition to be included in the sample, but so would a mention of any kind of some innovation,

invention, or improvement of existing technology. However, only a small subset of persons listed

as having taken out any sort of patent before 1850 are included, because the majority of patentees

left no other record. Our sample, then, consists of what we judge to have been successful careers at

the cutting edge of technology: engineers, chemists, mechanics, clock- and instrument makers,

printers, and so on.

         One source is the collection of biographies of British engineers put together by Skempton

et al (2002). It is quite detailed, and many of the essays are written by experts, but because it is

focused on engineers, it is biased toward road- and canal builders, contractors, architects, surveyors,


         23
            Moreover, the population of known inventors consists mostly of the population of successful inventors — it
stands to reason that many of the engineers and mechanics also made additional efforts in that direction that either failed,
or for which they failed to receive credit. Some “failed” inventions, such as the Stirling engine, invented by clergyman
Robert Stirling in 1816, have become famous, but the vast bulk of such failures will remain unknown.

military engineers and similar occupations. While it covers some mechanical engineers, they clearly

were not the main interest of the editors.24 It leaves out many areas, most notably chemicals, paper,

glass, food processing, and by and large textiles. It hence needs to be complemented with other

sources. Two other biographical compendia were used. One is Day and McNeil (1996), with high-

quality essays but with fairly thin coverage for Britain, since it is international in coverage. There

are the various biographical studies carried out by Samuel Smiles (1865, 1884, 1889), which, despite

their hagiographic character, contain a lot of useful information about minor players as well. A

number of recently compiled online databases, overlapping to some extent with Skempton and Day-

McNeil were also used.25 Finally, economic historians have carried out considerably detailed studies

of a number of industries that have produced information on many relatively minor actors in the

history of technological advances in the Industrial Revolution. Among the most notable and useful

of these studies, we should mention Turner (1998) and Morrison-Low (2007) on scientific

instruments; Burnley (1889), Heaton (1965), and Jenkins and Ponting (1982) on wool; Barlow

(1878) and Chapman (1967; 1972; 1981) on textiles; Barker and Harris (1954) on paper, glass and

chemical industries; Marshall (1978) on railroad engineers.26 All entries were cross-checked and

complemented with information from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.27 To ensure the

accuracy of the number of patents, we verified the information in the bibliographies with the

“Alphabetical index of patentees of inventions” by Woodcroft (1854), which includes all patents in

Great Britain until the reform of the patent system in 1851.

       We include people born between 1660 and 1830. For each individual we have recorded

beside the name and dates of birth and death, information about their education, their occupation,

what inventions and innovation they made, what rewards and pay they received, patents they took

out, publications, whether they were managers, employees, and/or self-employed (with or without

partners), membership in societies, and a variety of other details and remarks recorded in the

respective sources. Entries with unknown birthdates contain information when the person flourished

(fl.). We subtract 30 years from this date to calculate the date of birth.

       Our database consists of 759 entries: 758 men and Elenor Coade, who invented a new

process for making artificial stone, and who is the only woman included in the database. We

assigned a sector to each individual by his main area of activity, which in some cases was difficult

because a large number of our tweakers were polymaths who applied their ability in many distinct

areas of activity and contributed materially to more than one sector. Hence 35 entries were assigned

to two different sectors with weight 1/2, hence the fractions in Table 1.

           Table 1 displays the main descriptive statistics of the sample by birth-year and sector. The

number of persons included (per annum) peaks in the 1800-14 period, but this is largely because

many of those born in the fifteen years after 1815 were active in the second half of the nineteenth

century and much of what they did would not be included in many of our sources. The table reflects

the rise to prominence of the textile industry in the eighteenth century, yet it also warns that even

at its peak this industry did not involve more than a third of all tweakers, and for the sample as a

whole they are slightly under a quarter of the “modern” (that is, technologically advanced) economy.

Transportation and “other” engineering together were larger than textiles, and many other sectors

were important areas for technological creativity.

        Training: One important question is the training and education of highly skilled artisans. If

our argument that Britain’s advantage on other European countries derived primarily from its cadres

of skilled and creative tweakers, how should we explain that? How was this human capital created

and how were these artisans incentivized? The origins of the highly skilled labor force in Britain

have been discussed elsewhere, and need only briefly stated here (Mokyr, 2009a). On the demand

side, Britain had sectors that generated a need for a high level of skills, above all coal mining which

spawned the steam engine as well as the railroad (Cardwell, 1972, p. 74).28 It had, for a variety of

reasons, a high number of clock- and instrument makers, optical craftsmen, millwrights, and workers

involved in shipbuilding and rigging. The origins of this group of high-skill workers were at least

in part due to geography; but the pre-existence of a substantial British middle class with a demand

for luxury goods meant a considerable market for consumer durables that required a high degree of

precision and skill, such as watches, telescopes, and musical instruments. Finally, Britain was the

beneficiary of the migration of Huguenots after 1685 and thus its more tolerant institutions can be

seen to have paid off. All the same, the main reason for the high levels of skills in this economy were

the effectiveness of its education system embedded in flexible labor markets. While the record of

British schools and universities was decidedly mixed, skills were produced in the personal sphere

of master-apprentice relation, where British institutions performed remarkably well (Humphries,

2003; Mokyr, 2009a).

        The 759 persons in our sample confirm, as far as can be ascertained, this interpretation. Two

thirds of those whose educational background could be established were apprenticed. This share is

        28
         Almost all the engineers who worked on the development of a locomotive from 1803 to 1830 were originally
employed in the mining sector.
                                                         20

the highest in textiles, but the share of those about whom we do not know their educational

background is highest in textiles. Clearly this is the sector in which any kind of education mattered

the least, largely because the mechanical issues, while often subtle and delicate, required little

formal learning and success was often the result of a combination of dexterity, luck, perseverance,

and focus.29 On the other hand, a quarter of our tweakers with known background had attended

University; many of these were upper class youngsters, some of whom turned into improving

landlords or the kind of amateur inventors such as Lord Stanhope mentioned above. It may be safely

surmised that little of what they learned in English universities was of much help furthering their

technical competence, although the same was probably not true for Scottish universities. Engineers,

whether in shipbuilding, railroads, canals, or mining usually apprenticed and/or attended a

university. The same can be said about instrument makers. The consistency of the high proportion

of tweakers classified as engineers or instrument makers who were apprenticed leaves no doubt that

this mode of skills-transmission was the dominant form of human capital accumulation of the age.

Interestingly enough, the famous Statute of Apprentices and Artificers that mandated such training

was repealed in 1814, but the percentages of men born after 1800 who acquired their skills in this

fashion did not change and remained at about two-thirds of the entire sample of tweakers with

known educational background. As a comparison of panels A and B of Table 2 shows, there is little

evidence that the role of formal education changed a lot in the training of the British technological

elite: the share of people with known training who attended universities fell from 27 to 24 percent

and those who only attended school only rose from 12 to 13 percent.

         29
           The two best-known inventors of the industry, Richard Arkwright and Edmund Cartwright were trained as
a wigmaker and a clergyman respectively. But many others, insofar as we know their background, came from other
sectors. Henry Houldsworth (b. 1796), the inventor of compound gear in powerlooms, was trained as a grocer. Jedediah
Strutt, one of the early partners of Richard Arkwright, was trained as a wheelwright; his son of Jedediah (a successful
tweaker in his own right) had a wide-ranging education and among others was active as a successful architect.

The apprenticeship system clearly figured highly in the creation of British competence. The modes

of cultural transmission, as so often happens, can be seen in the creation of “dynasties” in which

technical knowledge was passed on along vertical lines. Some famous father-and-son dynasties, such

as the Darby’s, the Stephensons, and the Brunels are widely known. But there were many others.30

Of the dynasties of master-apprentices, the best-known is the Bramah-Maudsley-Nasmyth one.

Especially among coal viewers, a highly skilled and specialized branch of mining engineering, such

dynasties were common: John Blenkinsop (1783-1831) was trained by Thomas Barnes (1765-1801),

who himself was trained by an (unknown) viewer.



Incentives. How were these members of Britain's technological elite incentivized? There were

essentially four different mechanisms through which these men were compensated: intellectual

property rights in their knowledge; first mover advantage by independent businesses; reputation

effects leading to permanent employment; and non-pecuniary rewards. We shall discuss those in

turn.

Intellectual Property Rights. A standard argument in the literature has been that the patent system

in Britain provided the most effective incentive toward invention. This view is not just found in the

writings of modern institutionalists such as Douglass North (1981) but also in many of contemporary

writers, many of them hugely influential such as Adam Smith and Goethe.31 But the high cost of

         30
          Among them the microscope-makers George Adams Sr. and Jr. active in the second half of the eighteenth
century; John Rastrick (1738-1826) and his son John Urpeth Rastrick (1780-1856), both civil engineers; the hugely
inventive and versatile engineer Bryan Donkin ((1768–1855) and his son and later partner John (1802–1854); the
engineers William (1762-1834) and James (1795-1862) Sims.
         31
           Goethe wrote that the British patent system's great merit was that it turned invention into a "real possession,
and thereby avoids all annoying disputes concerning the honor due" (cited in Klemm, 1964, p. 173). Some modern
economic historians have agreed with him, however ( North and Thomas, 1973, p. 156). In his Lectures on
Jurisprudence ([1757], 1978), pp. 11, 83, 472), Adam Smith argued that intellectual property rights were "actually real
rights" and admitted that the patent system was the one monopoly (or "priviledge" as he called it) he could live with,
                                                            23

patenting in Britain before the patent reform of 1851 assured that most of the smaller inventions (and

many of the larger ones) were not patented (MacLeod, 1988; Griffiths, Hunt and O'Brien, 1992;

Mokyr, 2009b). Many inventors, especially those who were trained as scientists, were averse to the

monopolistic nature of patent rights and felt that useful knowledge should be shared and that access

to it and the use of it should not be limited in any way. Others were more ambivalent and

circumspect about the patent system and patented some of their inventions while conspicuously

failing to patent others.32

         Given that complete patent records exist, we were able to to check how many of our sample

took out patents at all. As Table 3 indicates, for the entire period 40 percent of our tweakers never

took out a patent. The interpretation of this table is rather tricky: all we can tell is that a person in

our sample took out a particular patent. As Dutton (1984), MacLeod (1988) and many others have

pointed out, there were major differences in the propensities to patent between different sectors, for

a variety of reasons.33 Textiles turn out to be a high-patenting sector, in part perhaps because reverse

engineering was fairly easy. In fact, "one thing that all these textile machines have in common is that

they satisfy Bacon's criterion for a certain kind of invention: they incorporated no principles,


because it left the decision on the merit of an invention to the market rather than to officials.
         32
           For a number of inventors this is well-known. For example William Murdoch, who took out three patents for
minor advances but failed to patent more important inventions. Henry Maudslay, one the great mechanical engineers of
his age, had six patents to his name but did not patent his micrometer or any screw cutting invention for which he was
famous. Among lesser-known people, a striking example is William Froude (1810-1879), a ship designer and inventor
of the helicoidal skew arch bridge on ships, yet his only patent is a railroad valve patented in 1848; John Benjamin
MacNeill (1792-1880) a road engineer who worked for Telford, and took out three patents but failed to patent his best
invention, which was an instrument to be drawn along roads, to indicate their state of repair by monitoring the deflections
produced by irregularities in the road surface
         33
           One reason was the likely payoff. The ratio between alternative means of cashing in on an invention relative
to patenting was one consideration. The cost of issuing a patent before 1851 was very substantial and may simply have
been unaffordable or simply unlikely to be covered by the returns relative to keeping the invention details secret. The
likelihood of a patent being upheld in court also differed substantially by sector. However, in some sectors - especially
engineering - the culture of the profession was quite hostile to the patent system.
                                                            24

materials or processes that would have puzzled Archimedes" (Cardwell 1994, pp. 185-86). Even

without extensive mechanical knowledge improvements could be made and especially in cotton

small changes in the production process led to huge improvements in the product's quality.34 Hence

the payoff of inventing and patenting in textiles was perceived to be high. The propensity of

patenting in textiles was also higher because constructing and improving textiles machinery required

different but not necessarily sophisticated mechanical skills. The textiles sector therefore attracted

relatively fewer people much associated with science who had been much affected with the

"open-source" scientific culture that viewed knowledge to be a public good and objected to patenting

as a matter of principle. As a result, only 19 percent of all tweakers active primarily in textiles never

took out a single patent, compared to 40 percent for the economy as a whole.35 Most of our tweakers

are fairly minor players in the patent game, and so of the people who patented at all, 83 percent

patented fewer than 5 inventions. All the same, our sample does include 78 individuals who had six

or more patents to their name. Some of these may have been "professional inventors" but others

simply were in a position to take advantage of the patent system.

         None of this implies that patenting was a particularly successful ex post strategy. Securing

a patent even on an economic viable invention did not ensure economic success. Patents were

frequently challenged, infringed, or voided. In our data, even individuals who took out patents for

some inventions failed to do so for others, and the patents they took out, especially before 1830,

proved to provide little protection against infringers and challengers - especially if the invention
         34
            Different findings for textiles are not only observed for Britain, the technological leader, but also for
technological followers. Becker, Hornung, and Woessmann (2009), studying the impact of literacy on technology
adaption in Prussia - a technological follower, find that literacy foster industrialization in all sectors but textiles. The
authors argue that the incremental nature of technological change in textiles leads to more sector-specific knowledge that
cannot be acquired through formal education.
         35
           As a consequence, studies that see the textile industry as a typical Industrial Revolution sector in terms of its
intellectual property rights development such as Griffiths, Hunt and O'Brien (1992) are likely to be misleading.

proved profitable.36 Judges were often unsympathetic to patentees, reflecting to a large extent the

suspiciousness of the age of anything that reeked of monopoly. Tales of inventors ruined by patent

suits at this time are legion, and it is reasonable to surmise that given their cost, the mean rate of

return may have been negative.37 One might then legitimately ask why people kept applying for

patents, and a number of replies can be given, among them the “lottery effect” (a small number of

             36
            Thus the Scottish inventor George Meikle, son of the inventor of the threshing machine, took out a patent for
a "scutching machine" (with his father) but the patent was repeatedly challenged and infringed upon and eventually
abandoned. Nathaniel Worsdell (1809-1886) patented a device to sort mailbags in 1838, but the Post Office introduced
a competing device that infringed on his invention; Worsdell refused to sue because his Quaker beliefs would not permit
it (Birse, 2004).
           37
              John Kay, the inventor of the “flying shuttle” was effectively ruined trying to defend his patents. Disillusioned
he moved to France in 1747 after failing to maintain patents right in England. Similarly, Henry Fourdrinier’s continuous
papermaking machine was shamelessly copied and he could never recover the £60,000 he and his brother had spent on
the innovation. To circumvent infringement, James Beaumont Neilson (1792–1865), the inventor of the hot blast in iron
manufacture (1829), issued licenses at 1 shilling per ton. Neilson and his partners hoped to make the patent remunerative,
but sell it at a fee low enough to prevent widespread evasion or attacks on the patent's validity. Nevertheless the patent
was disputed.
                                                        26

highly visible successful patents may have created a false ex ante belief that they were more

profitable than they were in reality) and a “signaling effect” (inventors took out patents to indicate

to would-be financiers that their invention was worthwhile and secure) (Mokyr, 2009b).

Interestingly enough, British society realized how imperfect the patent was, and some of the big

inventors who, for some reason, did not patent or whose patent failed, were compensated by

Parliament or by grateful colleagues. But such grants were awarded to technological superstars, not

to tweakers who made a minor improvement.

        Secrecy was a viable alternative to patenting. Some tweakers relied on secrecy to secure a

competitive advantage and to avoid costly legal battles. There was Sir Titus Salt (1803-1876) , a

textiles manufacturer, who overcame problems in utilizing alpaca wool, who never patented his

processes but kept them as trade secrets. This strategy made him the richest citizen in Bradford. John

Braithwaite, Sr, in the business of retrieving goods from sunken shipwrecks, kept his improved

diving machine, his machinery for sawing apart ships underwater, and his underwater gunpowder

charges under lock and key and never took out a patent (which would have made him divulge his

knowledge).38 Joseph Gillot, a pen manufacturer and the Pen Maker to the Queen, also preferred

secrecy for years before taking out patents and the masticating process — a process in the

production of rubber invented by Thomas Hancock — was also never patented, but remained as a

secret in the factory. For others, of course, secrecy was a risky strategy, such as the famous case of

Benjamin Huntsman, the inventor of crucible steel whose secret eventually leaked out.39
         38
            Of course, some patentees such as the metal manufacturer William Champion, worded their patents in as
obscure a manner as possible to try to prevent infringement.
        39
           Modern entrepreneurs face the same choices. Much like their counterparts during the industrial revolution,
they rely on first mover advantage, secrecy, and patents to capture the competitive advantage. Graham et al. (2009),
examining entrepreneurs in the high-technology sector using the 2008 Berkeley Patent Survey, show at the only sector
in which entrepreneurs find patents more important than first mover advantages is Biotechnology — a sector that
arguably did not exist during the Industrial Revolution. Secrecy is rated almost as important as patents.

First-mover and reputation effects. Signaling quality to potential costumers and outshining the

competition was crucial to ensure the economic success of the woman and men in our sample. As

Table 4 shows, most of our tweakers were at least for some part of their careers self-employed: A

full 385 (51 percent of our sample and 64 percent of all those whose means of livelihood could be

established) were identifiable entrepreneurs and independent operators or consultants, owning or

establishing a company at some point. Another 82 (11 percent) were owners at least some of their

careers.40 A respectable 18 percent were hired engineers and managers. Again, it is striking how

exceptional textiles were as an industry: for a considerable number of individuals, we were unable

to establish exactly the way in which they made their living. But for the entire rest of the sample,

of those for whom we could establish these facts, we found that 68 percent were owners and

independent contractors throughout their careers, and another 16 percent were so through part of

their career. Given that only few of those had successful patents, better quality of product and

services leaning on reputation effects were central to economic success.

           Some of them were successful employees who then tried to go into business for themselves; other had the
reverse career and were failed entrepreneurs who then took a job with another firm.

                The centrality of first-mover advantage is hard to document in a systematic way, but

    examples abound. In the textile industry, first-mover advantage was common: Arkwright’s patent

    was voided, but his technological advantage was such that he died a wealthy man. Others were able

    to cash in on fairly minor advantages. An example can be seen in the hosiery industry, where

    Jedediah Strutt came up in the 1750s with a major improvement to lace made on stocking frames,

    subsequently improved further by the idea of the “point net.” The idea of this more efficient method

    was conceived by one Mr. Flint, who hired a Thomas Taylor of Nottingham to build it for him, who

    then acquired the invention and patented it. Years later, the point net was further improved by

Many of the great clock- and instrument makers of the age, a pivotal group in the realization of the

Industrial Revolution, were essentially self-employed and depended on reputation for quality and

reliability.41 John Kennedy, co-owner of M’Connel and Kennedy, one of the most successful cotton

spinners in Manchester, made a number of adjustments to the fine-spinning capabilities of the mule

which allowed a much higher count (finer) yarn to be spun. Kennedy never took out a patent. In

1826 Kennedy retired from one of the best-known and prosperous enterprises in the Industrial

Revolution. Another striking case was that of Joseph Aspdin, the inventor of Portland cement.


          41
             The great instrument makers of the age mostly seem to fall into that category. Thus John Bird (1709–76)
supplied instruments to Greenwich Observatory as well as to the one in Stockholm. Bird established in 1745 his own
workshop in London making machine tools and small mathematical instruments. He received orders to design and make
large astronomical instruments for major observatories at home and abroad. Two generations after him, Robert Bretell
Bate (1782-1847) was appointed optician to King George I, an honor that was renewed on the accessions of William IV
and Queen Victoria; he won government contracts with a number of government agencies. By 1820, his workshop
employed twenty employees (McConnell, 2004a; 2004b).
                                                        30

Although he did take out a patent in 1824, his advantage was relatively brief. His son, William

Aspdin, was the first to invent true “Portland Cement” in the early 1840s, by discovering the

necessity of clinkering (grinding the product of the cement kilns and adding gypsum) but did not

patent it. William’s early-mover advantage did last long because others such as Isaac Charles

Johnson were following his idea on his heels. After two years, Johnson was able to develop a

superior product, and yet Aspdin’s advantage in time was enough to assure him financial success

for a while, although in 1855 he went bankrupt and his works were sold to Johnson (Francis, 1977,

pp. 116–25, 151–58).42

        For many of our tweakers, being innovative and able to tweak technology in use, was part

of the job description. Innovation meant job security for employees or new commissions for the self-

employed. James Watt employed a number of highly creative engineers, most of all the ingenious

William Murdoch. Railway companies expected their locomotive pool managers to invent in order

to cut cost, improve the quality of transportation, and deal with excessive smoke emissions. Hence

for railroad engineers like Charles Markham, who adjusted fire holes in locomotives for the use of

coal, innovative activity that adapted existing techniques to specific purposes was simply taken for

granted and reflected in their comfortable salaries.

        Innovativeness was a strong signal of competence, and competence was what people hiring

consultants wanted. Self-employed engineers such as James Brindley and John Rennie, or architects

like Joseph Jopling, (who won a Society of Arts gold medal for arch construction improvements),

made their living by signaling their professional competence through coming up with improvements

in the techniques they used. This, too, was a function of the patent office: having taken out a patent

        42
            Johnson, who lived from 1811 to 1911, remained a major player in the British cement industry for much of
his life, and thus perhaps exemplifies the benefits of second-mover advantage.
                                                          31

was seen, whether correctly or not, as an official imprimatur of technological expertise.43 Reputation

for expertise resulted in new commissions for their workshops.44 Again, it is not easy to quantify

this, but professional engineers, especially civil and mechanical engineers, often worked on specific

commissions and consultancies.

         Some of these commissions came from the government, others from overseas, but most of

them were local manufacturers and colliers who needed something specific installed or built.45 The

model for this way of organizing the engineering profession was set by the great John Smeaton, after

James Watt the most influential engineer of the eighteenth century. Smeaton took out but one patent

in his life, despite a vast number of inventions and improvements, but he was in huge demand as a

consulting engineer, and in fact is often said to have established engineering consultancy as a formal

profession. As table 4-B shows, more than half of the independent contractors and self-employed

had partners (at some stage), although that proportion was especially high in textiles, iron, and

mining and a bit lower elsewhere.

         For the self-employed artisans and independent engineers who would be in the group of

tweakers and implementers, the reward was first and foremost a reputation for competence that led

to customers and commissions and in some case the patronage of a rich or powerful person. Many


         43
          Studying the motivations for patenting of present day entrepreneurs, Graham et al. (2009) find that enhancing
the company’s reputation and improving chances of securing investment or additional financing are still important
reasons for entrepreneurs to take out patents.
         44
            It is interesting to note that for modern data hiring inventive employees seems also a good strategy to
maximize the impact of innovations. Singh and Agrawal (2010) estimate (using modern US patent citation data) that
when firm recruit inventors, the citation of the new recruits’ prior inventions increases by more than 200 percent even
if these patents are held by their previous employer. They also argue that the effect is persistent even though one might
expect that the tacit knowledge of the inventor diffuses fast within a firm.
         45
           Thus Bryan Donkin, a prodigiously gifted tweaker, with 11 patents to his name and a reputation to match,
received commissions from the excise and stamp ofice, the East India office and none other than Charles Babbage (to
estimate the cost of building his calculating machine).

of the engineers and best mechanics in the Industrial Revolution were engaged in a signaling game:

in a market with imperfect information about quality, establishing a reputation for skills was a key

to economic security if not perhaps to extraordinary riches. This was true for the superstar engineers

in the Industrial Revolution such as John Rennie and John Smeaton, but it was equally true for

lesser-known people. For many of the best mechanics and engineers reputations meant well-paying

positions in good firms or tickets for commissions and contracts. Reputation and being in very high

standing among one’s professional peers could lead to cash awards from the government (who relied

on expert opinion in making these awards). Such cash prizes were also awarded by some private

societies (such as the Society of Arts, founded in 1754). These awards were often financially

significant, and with any of these rewards the reputation of an inventor grew. It was also associated

with peer recognition and social prestige associated with mechanical achievement to a degree never

before witnessed.46 Some engineers became technological authorities and their imprimatur could

make or break the career of a young engineer. Among those authorities, John Smeaton and Thomas

Telford were the towering figures during the Industrial Revolution.47

         Not all cash prizes or medals were given for meeting specified criteria such as the famed

Board of Longitude award made to John Harrison for his marine chronometer. Cash reward were


         46
           Consider the career of Edward John Dent (1790-1853), who won a first Premium Award at the Seventh
Annual Trial of Chronometers (1829) and then won the esteem of Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who
recommended him as the maker of a large clock for the tower of the new Royal Exchange. Dent later enjoyed the
patronage of Queen Victoria, the Royal Navy and the Czar of Russia. In 1852 he won the commission to make the Big
Ben for the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, but he died before completing the project.
         47
            Telford, in his design for an all-iron bridge over the Thames to replace London Bridge (which was not built),
hired a young engineer named James Douglas, whose mechanical genius earned him the epithet “the Eskdale
Archimedes. Douglas was a versatile engineer who had attracted the notice of the British Ambassador in the US, who
paid his expenses home to England “ so that his services might not be lost to his country.” In 1799 it is known that
Douglas worked for Telford, but then absconded to France in around 1802. Telford disapprovingly remarked that
Douglas was “always too impatient for distinction and wealth, in the race for which in his country he found too many
competitors.”

also given to inventors in the public service like the civil engineer and road builder John Loudon

McAdam, who received £6,000 from public funds for his improvements on the British road system;

to Edward Jenner, for his spectacular discovery of smallpox vaccination; to Sir Francis Pettit Smith

who was awarded £20,000 by the Admiralty for his screw propeller; and to William Symington who

received £100 from Parliament for the first steam boat. As noted, in few cases such awards were

regarded as a correction to an often-malfunctioning patent system. Sir Thomas Lombe the inventor

(really importer) of mechanized silk spinning technology, was awarded £14,000 as a special

dispensation in 1732 in lieu of a renewal of his patent. Of the “heroes of the Industrial Revolution,”

Samuel Crompton, Edmund Cartwright, and Henry Fourdrinier were among those who, after much

haggling, were voted an award.

       Reputation effects were often international: as noted already, many British engineers and

mechanics found positions on the Continent or received commissions and assignments from

overseas, as one would expect in an economy that was more richly endowed with competence than

its neighbors and were often honored by them. Charles Gascoigne, the manager of the Scottish

Carron ironworks in the 1760 received a lucrative commission from the Russian government in

1786; ironmaster John Wilkinson’s brother William was commissioned by the French government

to set up the ironworks at Le Creuzot. In the nineteenth century this process continued with renewed

force. Richard Roberts, perhaps the most ingenious tweaker of his generation, was invited to help

install cotton-spinning machinery in Mulhouse. William Fairbairn (1789–1874), another leading

engineer and one of the pioneers of the iron-hulled ships, consulted in Turkey, Switzerland, and the

Netherlands. Robert Whitehead, a ship designer who made major improvements to the design of the
                                                            34

torpedo, started his career as a naval designer working for the Austrian government and gathered

a great many foreign decorations including a French Legion d’honneur.



Nonpecuniary rewards Many of the cutting edge inventors and tweakers of the age professed to be

uninterested in financial rewards. Economists are trained to regard such statements with suspicion,

but that it is not to say that considerations other than money did not play a role. The distinction is

hard to make because prizes, medals, and other distinctions operated as signals of quality and thus

enhanced reputations that themselves were correlated with patronage (steady employment) or

commissions. A few “cash” prizes were also to a large extent honorary, much like book prizes today.

Such rewards took a variety of forms. Some associations appointed “fellows” (the Royal Academy

being the primary example), others such as the Society of Arts, organized competitions and awarded

medals and other distinctions for technological achievements. In Britain, of course, the highest

distinction that could be awarded to someone of a working class origin was an honorary aristocratic

title. Table 5 summarizes the awards earned by our sample.

         The data show a considerable variation in the number of medals awarded. In textiles, medals

were rare, and it seems to have been the one industry in which monetary considerations were

probably more or less the main incentive.48 The categories are overlapping, so quite a few people

received more than one reward. All the same, the data show that for tweakers in fields such as civil

engineering, instrument-making, construction, and to a lesser extent metallurgy, such prizes were

a reality, and the probability of earning such a prize was far more likely than actually cashing in on

a patent (and there was no application fee). There can be little question that, as with all such prizes,
         48
          To be sure, nine textile engineers were elevated to an aristocratic title, which, at 5 percent, is only marginally
below the overall mean of 7 percent. But these were men such as Richard Arkwright, James Oldknow, and Robert Peel,
who were rewarded for a successful career as entrepreneurs.
                                                    35

personal connections and background played a role. Indeed, in a recent paper Khan (2010) has

concluded that “In Britain the most decisive determinants for whether the inventor received a prize

were which particular university he had graduated from and membership in the Royal Society of

Arts, characteristics that seem to have been somewhat uncorrelated with technological productivity.

Thus, rather than being calibrated to the value of the inventor’s contributions, prizes to British

inventors appear to have been largely determined by noneconomic considerations.” One could, of

course quibble with how to measure “technological productivity” (to say nothing of the distinction

between economic and non-economic considerations). But what counts here is that the probability

of winning such a social recognition was non-zero and correlated with some achievement even if

the correlation was not as high as one would wish in a perfect world. It stands to reason that in such

distinctions, then as now, accomplishment and personal connections were complementary. As such,

there can be little doubt that these institutions provided a considerable incentive for technically

brilliant and industrious men. Networking counted too — but such networks by themselves held

considerable technological advantages.



Were Tweakers Enlightened?

           The Baconian program alluded to before was a product of the Enlightenment, and it

emphasized the diffusion and dissemination of useful knowledge in addition to its creation (Mokyr,

2009a). That such beliefs were held by some of the leading figures of the Industrial Revolution such
                                                        37

as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, and Benjamin Gott has long been known. But Robert Allen

(see Allen 2009a) has questioned the degree to which such beliefs were common in the wider

population of technologically relevant people. It is, of course, impossible to verify, with few

exceptions, what these people believed about what they were doing. But we can see to which extent

they tried to network by joining a variety of professional societies, or bring their knowledge to a

wide audience by publishing. Again, such actions could be explained by other factors. Publishing,

for example, served as a signal of expertise and respectability, and professional societies were social

as well as professional networks.49

        The measures are, of course, not independent. Inventions, new methods, and explanation

were published in the journals edited by professional societies, such as the Philosophical

Transactions of the Royal Society or Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Membership

and rewards in some professional societies were granted for papers read to them. Some of our

tweakers participated in public debates or provided descriptions and puzzles for the Ladies’ Diary,

an eighteenth century journal aimed at the “fair” sex explaining improvements in the Arts and

Sciences.50 Beyond articles, many of our tweakers published treatises and books on matters of new

technology.51

        All the same, the fact that engineers and mechanics were networked and interacted in this


        49
           The perhaps most striking example is the instrument maker Edward Troughton (1753-1835). Having kept one
crucial method of his dividing machine secret, he later wrote a description for the Astronomer Royal as a “valuable
present to young craftsmen.” The paper was read to the Royal Society, which earned him a Copley medal and opened
all doors to him.
        50
         The Ladies Diary was edited between 1714 and 1743 by the surveyor, engineer, mathematician, and
paradigmatic tweaker, Henry Beighton (1683-1743).
        51
           For instance, Edmund Beckett Grimthorpe, who used gravity escapes in public watches, published his
knowledge on watch making in A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks and Watchmaking and William Jones shared the
insights he gained with his improved solar telescope in The Description and Use of a New Portable Orrery.

fashion, if sufficiently widespread, indicates that the Industrial Revolution took place in a different

cultural environment than the one that prevailed at the time of the Glorious Revolution. It should

be added that the estimates presented in Table 6 are lower bounds; the absence of evidence is not

evidence of absence, and especially for some of our more obscure tweakers it has been hard to

unearth all the evidence of their exploits. Many may have been members of small provincial

intellectual societies and published in obscure provincial journals or anonymously. At the same time,

we acknowledge that because of the way the sample was constructed, it may suffer from selection

bias in the sense that engineers and inventors of the second and third tier may have been in the sample

because either publication or membership left a record and thus ended up in our sample.

          Again, the data show that of all sectors, textiles on which Allen relies heavily were the
                                                        39

exception. It was the “least enlightened” and thus any inferences about the Industrial Revolution

based primarily on the technological history of textiles may be misleading. Only about 10 percent of

the individuals in textiles either published, belonged to a professional society, or both. For the

sample as a whole, however, 52 percent of all tweakers were enlightened in the sense defined above.

Indeed, roughly speaking, around two-thirds of all engineers in our sample either published or

belonged to scientific or technical societies. The shortcoming of our sources notwithstanding,

therefore, it is fair to say that an Enlightenment culture was rooted deeply in the top 3-5 percentile

of the skill distribution – the highly competent craftsmen and engineers.

       Not only did our tweakers place their knowledge in the public sphere and participated in

discussions in formal societies, but although like most engineers anywhere they had limited interest

in politics, quite a few were involved in liberal or progressive politics of one kind or another.52 Some

of our engineers such as Richard Reynolds, an ironmonger, can be shown to have been active in the

anti-slavery movement. To be sure, the Enlightenment meant different things to different people, and

its influence on wider British society was limited before the 1830s. However, it was an elite ideology,

and our tweaker sample was drawn from an elite population. The technological momentum in the

Industrial Revolution was supplied by a small, elite group of highly skilled engineers, artisans, and

workmen. Our sample represents the right tail of this group, the most successful and highly skilled

members of an elite, yet their characteristics tell us a lot about the sources of British success.

       To what extent were our tweakers different from the better-known “superstars” of the

          John Mercer (1791-1866), like many other leading figures in the technological elite, was a member of the
Anti-Corn Law League. Others spent their time and money on the improvement of society, like the garden architect John
Claudius Loudon, who supported a scheme for decent housing for the poor or toolmaker and engineer Joseph Whitworth
who devoted various sums, amounting in all to £594,416, to educational and charitable purposes. Sir George Cayley
(1773–1857), the famous aeronautic pioneer, was a Whig Member of Parliament for Scarborough, and strongly
supported Parliamentary reform and abolition.

Industrial Revolution? The issue is relevant because of the assumption of “continuity” in the

distribution we are making (since we are observing a highly selective sample). To test for this, we

selected 72 members of our sample who are mentioned in two recent books on the Industrial

Revolution by one of us, namely Mokyr (1990 and 2002). That yielded 72 names of such

technological luminaries as Arkwright, Watt, Smeaton, Wedgwood and Trevithick. We checked to

what extent they resembled the rest of the sample. As they were obvious the very top of the

competence distribution, more is known of them. Yet they appear to be, on the whole, much like the

rest of our sample, if naturally more distinguished and more likely to be owners-entrepreneurs (see

Table 7). It is worth noting that while superstars hold, on average, more patents, a full 25 percent of

the superstars did not patent all of their inventions.

Conclusions: The Rate and Direction of Technological Progress during the British Industrial

Revolution

       What determined the rate and direction of technological change during the Industrial

Revolution? Explanations can be, very crudely, be classified into demand and supply based

explanations. In his recent book, Allen (2009a) has argued that high wages drove a search for labor-

saving innovation. While we do not propose here an explanation of the macro-inventions that form

the backbone of usual accounts of the Industrial Revolution, we argue that a key ingredient that

complemented these inventions and made them work came from human capital: it was the technical

competence of the British mechanical elite that was able to tweak and implement the great ideas and

turn them into economic realities. The story presented here is entirely supply-based. There is a global

question, “why Europe?”, and a local question, “why British leadership?” The answer is based on an

unusually felicitous combination of Enlightenment culture, which characterized much of Western

Europe, and technical competence, where Britain had a comparative advantage. Had it had only one

of those two, it seems unlikely that its economic performance would have been as spectacular.

       The story, however, was not a national but by and large a local one: innovations in textiles,

iron, mining, hardware, and instruments, to pick a few examples, were all local phenomena, relying

largely on local resources including talent. To be sure, our tweakers were mobile even in the pre-

railroad age. Moreover, there were at least two national institutions that gave a certain unity to these

local developments. One was the patent office; despite the consensus view of the literature that

patenting was a fairly minor source of progress, it remained in some ways a national technological

institution whose presence was felt even if it was decided not to use it or if it let its users down. The

other was the Royal Society and similar national institutions such as the Society of Arts, the Royal
                                                   43

Institution, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science (f. in 1831).

       Are there any policy lessons from this for our age? The one obvious conclusion one can draw

from this is that a few thousand individuals may have played a crucial role in the technological

transformation of the British economy and carried the Industrial Revolution. The average level of

human capital in Britain, as measured by mean literacy rates, school attendance, and even the number

of people attending institutes of higher education are often regarded as surprising low for an industrial

leader. But the useful knowledge that may have mattered was obviously transmitted primarily through

apprentice-master relations, and among those, what counted most were the characteristics of the top

few percentiles of highly skilled and dexterous mechanics and instrument-makers, mill-wrights,

hardware makers, and similar artisans. This may be a more general characteristic of the impact of

human capital on technological creativity: we should focus neither on the mean properties of the

population at large nor on the experiences of the “superstars” but on the group in between. Those who

had the dexterity and competence to tweak, adapt, combine, improve, and debug existing ideas, build

them according to specifications, but with the knowledge to add in what the blueprints left out were

critical to the story. The policy implications of this insight are far from obvious, but clearly if the

source of technological success was a small percentage of the labor force, this is something that an

educational policy would have to take into account.

       Finally, the supply of competence reminds us of something rather central about the direction

of innovation, which seems very generally relevant. The direction is dependent on those supply factors

that reflect what engineers and skilled workers actually can do regardless of what they would like to

do. The drive toward improvement was quite general in the eighteenth century, but the results were

highly uneven, with major productivity improvements in textiles, iron, civil engineering, and power
                                                  44

technology, but few in farming, medicine, steel, chemicals, and communications. These reflected the

difficulties on the supply side rather than any obvious demand-side bias. Competence as defined here

was an integral part of the supply side, as inventors would not be able to carry out their ideas without

the trained workers they employed.
