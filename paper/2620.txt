                                  ABSTRACT




     By any standard, Bolivia's economic crisis in the 1980's has
been extraordinary.   Like its neighbors. Bolivia suffered from
major external shocks, but the extent of economic collapse in the
face of these shocks (including a hyperinflation during 1984-85)
suggests that internal factors as well as external shocks have
been critical to Bolivia's poor economic performance. One major
theme of our work is that the recent economic crisis in Bolivia
is a reflection of political and economic conflicts in Bolivian
society that have undermined the development process throughout
this century. While major reforms have been begun by the present
government, many of the deepest problems in Bolivian society that
contributed to the crisis remain unresolved.

1.   Introduction

     By any standard. Bolivia's economic crisis in the 1980's has been

extraordinary. As seen in Table 1, Bolivia's economic debacle of recent years

is striking even in comparison with the poor performance of Bolivia's

neighbors. Like its neighbors, Bolivia suffered from major external shocks.

including the rise in world interest rates in the early 19805. the cutoff in

lending from the international capital markets, and the decline in world

prices of Bolivia's commodity exports. But the extent of economic collapse in

the face of these shocks suggests that internal factors as well as the

external shocks have been critical to Bolivia's economic performance. The

Bolivian hyperinflation of 1984—85. for example, which was one of the most

dramatic inflations in world history, is the only 20th century hyperinflation

that did not result from the dislocations of war or revolution. One major

theme of our work is that the recent economic crisis in Bolivia is a

reflection of political and economic conflicts in Bolivian society that have

undermined the development process throughout this century,

    Table 2 gives a brief political chronology of Bolivia since tne
Revolution of 1352. The most striking aspect of the chronology is the

instability of constitutional rule in the country. The Revolution of 1952 was

led by of the National Revolutionary Movement, the MNR, which governed     Bolivia

for 12 years, winning elections in .1958 and 1960. The military toppled the

civilian reçime in 1964. and ruled without interruption until 1978.      A period

of political chaos followed during 1978—82, with a rapid alternation of

rnilitar'j and civilian rule. Civilian rule was restored   in 1982, with the

accession to power of Siles Suazo.

     As in other Latin American nations, the alternation of power asc

reflected an alternation between populist and anti-populist politics.      En


Bolivia, however, this alternation has been particularly sharp. Generally,

the military rule was anti-populist, and especially anti—labor. There was,

however, a orief populist phase of military rule under General Torres in

1970—71, which coincided with the leftist military government in Peru under

Velasco. The civilian governments have all drawn their leaders from the MNR,

though the civilian governments have varied widely in their policies,     with

 populist phases during 1952—56 and 1962—85, and conservative phases during

 1958—64 and 1985 to the present.

      The chronic political instability, and more specifically the swings

 between populist and anti—populist politics, reflect the deeper divisions in

 the Bolivian economy and society. Not only is Boliviats distribution of

 income and wealth highly unequal, but the various sectors in Bolivian society

 are highly mobilized to do battle over their shares of income and wealth.

 Since the Revolution, all of the social factions have looked to the central

government to satisfy their particular distributional agenda, and the battle

for political power has also been a battle for a share of the national pie.

the battle over shares has been particularly damaging since it has occurred in

the context of a secular decline in the earnings of Bolivia's key mining

sector. That decline not only made the need for a coherent development

strategy particularly urgent, but also heightened the sense of desperation in

the distributional battle.

     The result, not surprisingly, has been a government stretched far beyond

its fiscal capacity; an economic environment inimical to long-term investment;

and an inability of the key political actors to settle on a sustained strategy

for national economic development. The failure of economic development has

taken its toll. Bolivia is the poorest country in South America, with a per

capita income of about $500, and the second poorest in the Western Hemisphere,

behind Haiti. Between 1952 and 1985. GNP grew at the meagre annual rate of
                                           -
2.4 percent.                 .




     In the next section of this paper, we extend this analysis as to why

Bolivia has failed to develop a workable strategy of long-term development.

We then turn to an analytical chronology of the recent economic crisis, and

highlight how the crisis has emerged from the longer—term failures that we

have stressed. to understand the proximate economic determinants of the

crisis, we highlight the critical linkages between foreign borrowing, the

exchange rate, and inflation, that are key to understanding both the onset of

the hyperinflation and debt crisis, and the progress that has been made since

1985 In overcoming the crisis. While major reforms have been begun by the

present government, many of the deepest problems in Bolivian society that
contributed to the crisis remain unresolved. We underline these areas of

remaining difficulty, and discuss various pal icy options for addressing them.



2.   the Long-Term Problems of Bolivian Economic Growth

     Bolivia's problems begin with the inherent difficulties of growth in a

landlocked mining economy centered in breathtaking, yet forbidding, terrain

more than 14,000 feet above sea level. Bolivia is a very large and sparsely

populated country. Its area is greater than the combined areas of the United

Kingdom. West Germany, and France, with a population of on)y 6 million. The

country is divided geographically between the Andean highlands, where the

mining industry is located, and the lowlands to the east, where petroleum

products and commercial agriculture are situated. From the beginning of

colonial development, Bolivia's poHtical and economic center of gravity has

been in the highlands. The secular decline of the mining sector has led in

recent decades to a shift in economic and political activity to the East.

This shift, which is the cause of significant political conflict, has been

accelerated by the recent sharp crash of tin prices in October 1585.

     Bolivia's economy since the colonial period has been based on mining,

first silver from the colonial period until the late 19th century, and then

tin in the 20th century. With population centered in the highlands and

neighboring valleys, transport costs are extremely high. Therefore, while it

has been profitable for Bolivia to export minerals such as silver and tin that

have a high value added per unit weight, and therefore a low shar. of

transport costs per unit value, Bolivia has been unable to overcome the

transport costs for almost any kind of manufactured product. The problem of
transport costs was greatly exacerbated by Bolivia's loss of its littoral on

the Pacific Coast, in the traumatic war of the Sea against Chile and Peru in

1879.

        The requirement of high value added per unit weight in Bolivian exports

helps to explain Bolivia's only real diversification of exports in recent

years: coca leaf derivatives (the precursors of cocaine) and petroleum

products. Petroleum products, particularly natural gas exported to Argentina,

can be carried out of the country by pipeline, while coca leaf can be

profitably transported even if carried on a peasant's bacx. Table 3 snows

Bolivia's concentration of non—coca exports in recent years. Among Bolivia's

measured exports (i.e., excluding coca), tin and petroleum products usually

accounted for much more than half of total exports during the 1960s, 1970$,

and 1980s. Coca exports in the 1980s are generally estimated to equal the sum

of tin and natural gas exports.

        Many of Bolivia's problems can be seen as the tragic playing out of the

secular decline in the mining sector, a process that has been underway for at

least half a century. (See Malloy (1970] for an authoritative account of 20th

century Bolivian history before the Revolution, with an emphasis on the

secular decline of the tin sector starting in the late 1920s.) Actually,

Bolivia's first deep crisis came with the depletion of sHyer deposits and the

fall of world silver prices at the end of the last century. Good fortune.

however, pulled Bolivia out of crisis when a boom in world demand for tin

followed the development of the modern canning process. The apogee of modern

Bolivian economic development relative to the neighboring countries was

reached in the first two decades of the 20th century, when tin was intensively

developed, and when export earnings provided the basis for a major extension

of the country's infrastructure, including roads and the railway system.

        Tin lodes were increasingly exhausted in the 1920s, and Bolivia began to

lose export competitiveness with other producers. When tin prices collapsed

at the start of the Great Depression, Bolivia became the first country in that

crisis to default on its sovereign foreign debt, in January 1931. Bolivia was

also the last country in Latin America to settle these defaulted debts after

World-War It.

        The collapse of tin undermined both the economy and the political system,

known as the Rosca, which was managed heavily in favor of the three tin

magnates, Patino, Hochschild, and Aramayo. The public finances, which relied

heavily on tin exports and international -trade generally, were gravely

weakened, and the financial problems generally undermined the central

government. Thus, the period between 1931 and the Revolution of 1952 was an

era of political uncertainty and unrest. Bolivia lost the bloody and costly

Chaco War to Paraguay in the mid—1930s, an experience which heightened the

political mobilization of workers and the middle classes unhappy with the

leadership of the oligarchy. A military government with a mixed fascist and

revolutionary orientation came to power in 1943, but was deposed in 1946. The

oligarchy regained control in 1946. but was swept aside by the Revolution of

1952.

        The leaders of the Bolivian Revolution of 1952 drew inspiration from the

Mexican Revolution, and from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party (the

PRI), In the formation and policies of the Bolivian National Revolutionary

l4oveent (the MP4R). The experience under the Rosca had thoroughly discredited
                                           —11—


private wealthholders as a class capable of leading national development. The

Revolutionary leaders looked to the public sector as an engine of growth that

would be more broadly based and equitable. They put in place an economic

system, which can broadly be called state capitalism, which assigned the bulk

of capital formation to the public sector, both for infrastructure and for

were COMIBOL, the national tin company, and YPFB, the state petroleum company.

       It should be stressed that the reliance on the state sector was guided by

political considerations as well as by an ideology of economic development.

The revolutionary movement, after toppling the oligarchy, was hardly

interested in returning power to a small class of wealthholders. Indeed,

given Bolivia's highly unequal income distribution, the problems of

establishing a political equilibrium together with ma!s participation (indeed

mass political mobilization) were evident. A large state sector was viewed as

providing a political answer to the distributional bind. As seen in Table 4,

Bolivia's income distribution remains, despite the Revolution, highly unequal.

The Revolution did succeed, particularly through land reform, in raising the

income share of the poorest 20 percent of households above the shares found in

several    other Latin American countries.
       Qespite the great variation of governments after 1952, one aspect Of the
model of state capitalism remained fairly constant. Whether the government

was of the populist left, as under the military leader General lorres in

1910—it,   or   of the right, as under the military regime       of General Hugo Banzer
during 1971-78, the     state was   looked to as the   guiding   force of development.

more than half in the 1960s and 1910s. was invested directly by the public

sector. This predominant role of the state is, of course, not unusual for

late developers, as was elegantly demonstrated by Gerschenkron many years ago

in the case of the European latecomers. And as stressed in Sachs 119871 the

state has played a very large, and apparently successful, role in spurring

economic development in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. What has been distinctive

in the Bolivian case, however, has been the fundamental disjunction between

the weak capacity of the state on the one hand, and the responsibilities

invested in the state on the other.

     The whole concept of more equitable growth througn a large state sector

collapsed in a mass of inconsistencies over the thirty years between the

revolution and the onset of the Bolivian hyperinflation. During the

post-Revolution period, leftist leaders were always too weak politically to

satisfy their redistributional aims. To the extent for instance that they

aimed to raise public sector salaries or to increase public sector investment

and employment, they lacked the capacity to tax income and wealth necessary to

finance the larger state sector. If necessary, the Bolivian army was prepared

to intervene to forestall populist or redistributionist actions, as it did in

1971. For these reasons, leftist or populist leaders have been constantly

forced to rely on inflationary finance or foreign aid and foreign borrowing to

carry out their distributional and developmental goals. The first high

Inflation in Bolivia came in the wake of the Revolution, and the second came

with the left-wing government of Siles Suazo in 1982.

     Leaders on the   right,   such as Barrientos and Banzer, were not interested

to limit the power   of   the state, but rather to use the state to satisfy a
                                       —15—


different agenda. While governments on the left sought redistribution through

higher wages and a larger role for public-sector workers, governments on the

right sought instead to bolster favored segments of the private sector through

generous government subsidies. Governments of the left have generally paid

for higher public salaries through printing money (i.e. the inflation tax) or

through foreign borrowing, since they have been forestalled from raising

taxes. Governments on the right, on the other hand, have rejected higher

taxes outright, and have instead sought to finance the government through a

reduction of public sector wages (often with overt repression of labor), and

also through foreign borrowing. Note one common theme of both types of

governments: let the foreigners pay!

     The conflict over income distribution continues to have a number of

profound effects on economic policy and economic performance. The first

effect that we have noted is fiscal indiscipline, since powerful high-income

groups veto the income and wealth taxes that would be needed to finance a

large public sector. A second effect is the deep politicization of almost all

instruments of economic policy. There are few economic policy tools in

Bolivia that are judged mainly on the basis of efficiency rather than

distribution. Exchange rate changes, for example, have been typically avoided

in Bolivia until currency overvaluations reach absurd proportions, for fear of

a resulting distributional battle. Similarly, public sector prices have often

been stuck at levels far below market clearing rates, for the same reason,

despite the often devastating fiscal consequences. A third effect of the

continuing battle over income distribution is the uncertainty for private

investment spending that is created by the alternation between   leftist   and
                                     —16—


rightist regimes with widely varying agendas. A fourth effect has been the

degeneration of politics into a fierce battles of the 'ins' versus the "outs."

with the state viewed as an instrument of redistribution, succeeding

governments came to view the public purse and the public enterprises as

private slush funds, to be used for personal gain or political patronage.

Malloy (t981) has termed this condition "neopatrimonialism."



3.   Origins of the Debt Crisis

     As shown in Table 6, Bolivia's external debt rose dramaticall, in the

1970$, mostly during the Banzer era. Bolivia's rapid accumulation of external

debt in the t9lOs reflected three forces at work. Part of the foreign

borrowing financed a plausible attempt to generate a more diversified export

base through various investment projects. Some of th!se projects, such as

natural gas exports to Argentina. proved successful. Others, such as

investment in crude petroleum production, proved to be failures. Less

benignly, the foreign borrowing also reflected an attempt to finesse the

internal distributional conflict on borrowed money and borrowed time. The

government did not attempt to raise taxes (and indeed rejected a detailed tax

reform proposal of the Musgrave Commission). Third, and most perniciously,

some of the foreign borrowing had the purpose and effect of enriching a narrow

set of private interests via the public sector's access to foreign loans.

Similarly, an overvalued exchange rate, maintained through foreign borrowing,

became a channel for capital flight for the wealthier individuals.

     The economic record of the Banzer years look quite good when taken in

isolation. Bolivian GOP growth averaged 5.4 -percent per year, which was far

above the average of 2.4 percent during the whole period 1952—1985. Prices

were rather stable except in 1974, following a major devaluation of the

Bolivian Peso. Investment as a share of GNP reached historical highs, as did

government revenues relative to GNP, though the gap between government

expenditures and government revenues widened. In an era of easy foreign

finance, however, the gap was readily filled by eager foreign bankers. Few

observers at the time realized the precariousness of the Banzer boom, built as

it was on a temporary commodity boom, easy access to foreign finance, and a
                                                                              -

narrow political base.

     Banzer's rule lasted for seven years, an extraordinary stretch by
Bolivian standards. For three years. Sanzer ruled with the support of both

leftist and rightist political parties. As Malloy [1987, p.103] indicates,

Banzer jettisoned these parties in 1974 when he recognized that "they were

rump factions who represented little more than cliques whose primary purpose

was to lay claim to public-sector jobs." From 1914 to •i978, Banzer ruled with

the support of private—sector business, the military, and some technocrats.

Because of the booming economy, Banzer enjoyed the support of the urban middle

classes, and even some favored labor groups such as the railway workers, but

faced continued strong opposition from most of organized labor, and the

leftist parties.

     Another important dimension of support and opposition to Banzer was

regional. The eastern part of the country, and especially 8anzer's home

province of Santa Cruz, provided strong support and were major beneficiaries

of Banzer's policies. Groups In this region were favored with grants of

property rights over public lands, and with generous subsidized credits. An
                                      —19—


important illustration of how the government distributed public revenues to

private supporters is the case of loans for large—scale cotton production in

the Santa Cruz region, made by the government Agricultural Bank (Banco        -




Agricola   Boliviano) between 1972 and 1975. Tens of millions of dollars were

loaned to a small number of large landowners during an incipient cotton boom.

The Bolivian producers sold their crops forward on world markets, but then

tried to renegotiate when the spot market prices rose above the forward

contract price. They failed in the renegotiations, and in the end, much of

the cotton remained undelivered. The growers quietly defaulted on the

Agricultural Bank loans and the government absorbed the losses with no attempt

to collect or to foreclose on any property. To this day, the bad cotton loans

have undermined the solvency of the Agricultural Bank.

     In 1915. the Banzer regime announced a five—year development plan which      -




encapsulated the governing philosophy. The plan aimed at export promotion led
by state investment. The public sector was targetted with 71. percent of total

investment over the period, focussed heavily on hydrocarbons, mainly in the

Santa Cruz region. Financing of the plan was to rely on the profits from

petroleum exports, which in the event never materialized, and on foreign

borrowing, which did. Most of the plan however was never implemented.

     In 1977 and 1978, General Banzer faced growing pressure from the Carter

Administration for a return to democracy. An election was called, but was

annulled after charges of massive fraud. When Banzer then tried to remain in

office, he was ousted in a coup. There ensued a four year period of intense

political instability, with several interim presidents, coups, and deadlocked

elections, producing in all nine different heads of state between Banzer and

Silas.
                                        —20—


      Bolivia reached its political nadir in 1980 and 1981, when General Garcia

Meza deposed the interim president Lydia Guiler. The Garcia Men regime was

deeply implicated in the burgeoning cocaine industry, and therefore never

received international support, except for the backing from the similarly

corrupt and violent military regime in Argentina. Capital flight reached new

highs in the period, with errors and omissions in the balance of payments in

1980 and 1981 totalling $590 million, or about 10 percent of 1980 GNP. The

commercial banks stopped all lending, and negotiated an emergency rescheduling

agreement which was soon defaulted upon. The rest of the international

community also ceased new lending, except for two important loans from the

Argentine regime.

      Not one of the heads of state during this chaotic period had the

political backing to address the acute economic problems racing the country.

Banzer's strategy of foreign borrowing had run its course, with insufficient

export earnings and government revenues to show for it. The various

governments following Banzer during 1978—82 were in no position to raise taxes

or enforce economic austerity, and so they resorted to printing money when the

flow of foreign money changed from net inflow to net outflow. On top of the

problem of obtaining fresh credits, commodity prices started to slide in 1981,

and   interest   rates on the existing international loans soared. By October

1982, when the Silts Suazo government came     to   power,   the   economy was in a

sharp downward    slide.   Real GNP had declined by an estimated 0.9 percent in

1981 and by 8.7 percent in 1982. The price level had risen by 308 percent in

the twelve months preceding Silts' accession to power.
                                     —21—


4.   The March to Hyperinflation

     it is important to appreciate the political implications of Sues'

accession to power in 1982. The new administration represented the first

elected government in 18 years, so that pent-up social and economic

aspirations were sure to boil over early in the term. Siles represented the

left wing of the MNR, and governed in a coalition with various leftist

parties, including the Communist Party of Bolivia. In the early phase of the

administration, organized labor gave support to the new government, but only

in return for significant wage increases. ultimately, ihen the financially

strapped government was unable and unwilling to grant wage increases to keep

ahead of the accelerating inflation, organized labor turned bitterly against

the government. General strikes by organized labor in 1984 and 1985 killed

the final two stabilization attempts of the Siles administration.

     The hyperinflation under Siles was not so much a result of an explosion

of new spending as the inability to restrain spending in the face of falling

foreign loans, falling tax revenues, and higher debt service payments abroad.

The coalition members were never able to agree on policies to restrain

spending, while the government's right—wing opponents in the Bolivian Congress

rejected all proposals to broaden or even stabilize the tax base. At a

fundamental level, moreover, the coalition government failed to realize that

the deepening crisis was an indictment of the system of state capitalism

itself, and especially of the financial limitations of that system. To the

end, the Siles administration defended the logic of a large state enterprise

sector, even as It tried to squeeze key state enterprises in order to support

the finances of the rest of the government.
                                     —22—


    The hyperinflatiOn and debt crisis developed as Bolivia's net resource

transfers from the rest of the world turned negative in 1982. Seignorage

financing (i.e. printing money) substituted for the decline in foreign

resource flows. Table 7 demonstrates this shift in foreign resources for a

subset of loans, the medium and long—term public or publicly guaranteed    loans.

We see that for 199 through 1981, new net borrowing by the public sector

exceeded the interest payments on the public debt. In 1982, however, net new

lending plummetted, so that the transfer of resources to Bolivia (net new

loans minus interest payments) turned sharply negative. As a percent of GNP,

net resource transfers on the loans in table 4 shifted from 6.2 percent of GNP

in 1980, to 3.1 percent of 6NP in 1981. to —3.4 percent of GNP in 1982. and to

-6.9 percent of ONP in 1983.

     The jump in seignorage. which fueled the hyperinflation. is the mirror

image of the declining net resource transfer from abroad. As the government

devoted an increasing share of resource to foreign debt servicing, it resorted

to printing money to finance the balance of its domestic spending.    igure 1

shows this pattern clearly. Seignorage jumped in mid—1982, several months

before Siles' term began. Aside from seasonal spikes in seignorage in the

fourth quarter of most years (associated with a Christmas wage bonus f or

public—sector worker), seignorage remained at a high plateau of about 12

percent of GNP annually until stabilization was achieved in late 1985. Note

that the decline in net resource transfers (a shift of about 10 percent of

GNP), and the rise in seigr.orage, are of about the same magnitude.

      the relative constancy of government seignorage does not reflect a stable

 level of government spending, taxes, and monetary emission. Rather, the

constancy of the seignorage collection hides a process of fiscal collapse in

which tax revenue collections all but disappeared, while government spending

(particularly on public investment projects) was cut back sharply in a vain

attempt to catch up with the moving target of falling tax collections.

Meanwhile, the monetary emission prompted repeated and accelerating

depreciations of the exchange rate, which then fed    into   inflation. As

inflation accelerated, the demand for real money balances fell, so that a

constant rate of seignorage collection as a percent of GNP was associated with

an accelerating inflation and a falling level of real money balances.

      Government revenues in Bolivia in the early 1980s relied heavily on three

main forms of taxes: internal taxes (mainly sales, property, and income

taxes); taxes on trade (mainly tariff collections); and taxes on hydrocarbons

and minerals (mainly paid by COMIBOL and YPFB). As shown in Figure 2. each of

these taxes plummeted as a percent of GNP. Overall, revenues of the central

administration (the rGN) fell from more than 9 percent of GNP in 1980 to just

1.3 percent of GNP in the first nine months of 1985. The proportion of TON

expenditures backed by IGN revenues fell from 55.5 percent in 1979 to just 6.9

percent in the first nine months of 1985.

      As is well known from the studies of Oliviera (1967] and Tanzi (1977],

inflation itself can be a major factor in undermining the government revenue

collections. In Bolivia, several particular institutional factors were at

work. With income taxes, simple lags in collection reduced the real value of

collections almost to nothing by 1985. Similarly, property taxes and several

excise taxes were stated In specific, rather than ad valoree, terms. Thus, as

the   price   level rose, the real value of the tax collections fell. Tariff

revenues declined for several reasons. The downturn in economic activity

reduced imports, and therefore tax collections. Equally important, the

official exchange rate was persistently overvalued relative to the black

market rate. This had the effect of encouraging smuggling, on which tariffs

are typically not collected. Even when goods were imported legally, however,

the tariff in pesos was collected on the basis of the official exchange rate,

and therefore the real value of the tariff collections was substantially

reduced. The taxes on mining and hydrocarbons were similarly squeezed, The

overvalued exchange rate reduced the profitability of the state enterprses in

these sectors, and they therefore paid their taxes to the central government

on a sporadic basis only. Indeed, the central bank made large transfers to

the state enterprises to keep them functioning despite the squeeze on their

operating revenues.                                    -




     It   is more difficult to offer an account of spending patterns by the

central government during the hyperinflation period, because of serious data

limitations. The following major points seem clear, however. There was a

sharp squeeze on public investment spending rather than wages and salaries as

the Sues government attempted to copewith the growing fiscal crisis. Union

opposition successfully forestalled any serious attempts to reduce public

sector real wages or public employment, until the end of the hyperinflation.

Until the spring of 1984, the government squeezed internal spending and relied

on monetary emission to make room for interest servicing on the foreign debt.

In the spring of 1984, the government finally quit debt service payments on

the government debt to the commercial banks. By this time, ironically, the

rising inflation had so ravaged the tax system that even with the suspension
                                            -28—


-   of   interest payments, the deficit on a cash—basis remained enormous, so that

    the resort to seignorage finance was hardly slowed.

          There are many particular features of public finance in this period that

    help to give a deeper insight into the dynamics of the hyperinflation. In a

    foolhardy attempt to restrain inflation, the government resorted continually

    to ineffectual price controls, overvalued and multiple exchange rates, and

    other forms of intervention. These policies had no effect on the general

    price level, but they frequently threatened the solvency of private and public

    firms. In response, the government would typically find sone indirect way to

    compensate the firms for the intervention measures, and thus the direct price

    control measure would show up as an indirect fiscal subsidy, adding to the

    government's need for inflation finance.

          while the hyperinflation was a disaster for the economy and Bolivian

    society as a whole, many well—connected rent-seeking individuals made

    considerable fortunes in the course of the hyperinflation. Anybody with

    access to official foreign exchange from the central bank could become wealthy

    almost instantly during the period. by purchasing cheap dollars at the central

    bank and selling them at a several hundred percent profit in the black market.

    Similarly, commercial bankers, who took deposits at zero interest and lent

    money at high nominal interest rates, shared in the government's seignorage

    gains. Moreover, the government extended large amounts of low interest loans

    during the period, often to politically powerful landowners, which effectively

    became   grants   as a result of the inflation.- Price controls on public sector

    goods, Including flour and petroleum products, generated opportunities for

    lucrative smuggling operations. All of these opportunities for gain provided
                                     —29—


a powerful constituency of those who wanted to see the hyperinflation

continue.



5.   The Stabilization Process

     The inflation under Sues went from annual rates of several hundred

percent in 1982 and 1983 to several thousand percent in 1984 and 1985.

According to Cagan's classic definition of hyperinflation (price increases

exceeding 50 percent per month), the true hyperinflation began in May 1984 and

ended in September 1985. upon the accession to power of the Paz Estenssoro

government.   tt should be noted that Sues tried several times to implement a

comprehensive stabilization program (during November 1982, November 1983,

April 1984, August 1984, November 1964, and February 1985), but in each of

these cases, some combination of Siles' political opponents in Congress, and

his ostensible "allies" in organized labor, torpedoed the adjustment efforts.

     The successful stabilization program was carried out by the newly elected

center-right government of Paz Estenssoro. The government came to power in

rather inauspicious circumstances, after another election which failed to

produce a clear majority for one of the candidates. The program of the Paz

administration was unveiled only three weeks after the government came to

power. The program was remarkably wide ranging, and indeed radical,

encompassing not only plans for macroeconomic stabilization, but also for

trade liberalization, administrative and tax reform, and deregulation and

privatisation in the domestic market. The so-called "New Economic Policy" was

nothing less than a call to dismantle the system of state capitalism that had

prevailed over the previous thirty years.
                                     —30—


    The fiscal part of the program was to operate on five fundamental bases:

    • a stable unified exchange rate backed by tight fiscal anc monetary

    policies;

    • increased public sector revenues, via tax reform and improved public

    sector prices;           -



    •   a reduced public sector wage bill, through reductions of employment    in

    state enterprise (particularly COMtBOL) and reduced rates of real com-

                                                  -
    pensation;

    •   an effective elimination of debt servicing, through a combination of

    rescheduling with official creditors, and a unilateral suspension of

    payments to private creditors until a more fundamental debt settlement

    could be arranged;

    • a resumption of concessional foreign financial assistance, from

    foreign governments and the multilateral institutions.

    The leading trade union organization, which had opposed and mobilized

against similar, indeed far less dramatic, policy packages under Siles, called

for a general strike in opposition to the program. But after three years of

accelerating inflation, and the sense of chaos in erly 1985, the new

government clearly had the upper hand. A temporary state of siege under the

constitution was declared, and the strike-was quickly broken.

     The fiscal measures, combined with a buildup of internal arrears by the

central government, were sufficient to obviate the need for fiscal credit from

th, central bank to support government spending       The exchange rate stabilized

almost lmmediately, and with a stable exchange rate, the price level stopped

rising. As shown in Figure 3, the remarkable break in the hyperinflation

began no more than one week after the inception of the program! Inflation

fell from a rate of more than 50 percent per month to price stability almost

immediately. The key to price stability proved to be a stable unified

exchange rate, protected by tight fiscal and monetary policies. When the

government deviated from that policy temporarily at the end of 1985, the high

inflation quickly surged again, but this time it was stopped by a reassertion

of fiscal discipline. From February 1986 to July 1987, the inflation rate has

averaged only 10-15 percent at an annual rate, one of the lowest inflation

rates in Latin America.

     One key aspect of the stabilization should be highlighted, to contrast

the case of Bolivia with those of Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. he Bolivian

stabilization was highly orthodox with respect to monetary, fiscal, and

pricing policies C though it was "heterodox" in its continued suspension of

foreign debt payments). The stabilization program eschewed all wage and price

controls as part of the anti-inflation effort, and indeed freed many controls

at the inception of the program. Et is likely that the hyperinflation had

obviated any need for price controls as part of the anti—inflation effort,

since the high inflation rates had eliminated all vestiges of long—term

contracts, and therefore all vestiges of inertial inflation. Peso prices were

basically being set at the end of the hyperinflation by converting dollar

prices of goods into pesos at the spot market exchange rate. Pius, by

stabilizing the exchange rate, the inflation rate was immediately stabilized

to the prevailing rate of dollar inflation in world markets.

     In reality, stabilization is a cumulative process, not an event. While

prices quickly stopped rising, fiscal reform has been underway for two years,
                                      —33—


and the results are still unsatisfactory in major areas. The government has

had to proceed gradually along three major dimensions: (1 a rebuilding of the

national tax system, which had virtually collapsed by the end of the

hyperinflation; (2) a reestablishment of normal relations with the

government's various creditors, both internal and external; and (3) a

restructuring of the public sector, to provide for a 'nore durable so.jt4•:r to

the fiscal crisis. Let us consider each of these in turn.

     The restoration of a stable revenue base has proceeded in   stages.   The

immediate and crucial actions of the Paz government were the raising of public

sector prices and the unification of the exchange rate.     In addition, some

back taxes on hydrocarbons and tin were also collected at the outset of the

stabilization program, to give the government some fiscal breathing space.

Eight months later, the Bolivian Congress approved th! government's tax reform

measures, .ihich most importantly instituted a national value added tax of 10

percent.   (Characteristically, the Congress postponed a tax on land wealth

until 1968.) Implementation of the tax measures has been slow and uneven

however, despite the formation of a new Ministry of Taxation. Administrative

difficulties and political pressures from powerful groups have slowed the

introduction of the new taxes.

     Even more difficult, perhaps, has been the process of extricating the

government from an enormous overhang of national debt. The Banzer government

bequeathed a highly indebted public sector to Sues, and the Siles

administration bequeathed a truly bankrupt public sector to Paz. Not only

were payments to all international creditors, both public and private, deeply

in arrears by 1985, but payments internally to various creditors were also in

default.                         .                                               -
                                        -34-


      with respect to the international creditors, the government has sought

substantial debt relief. For foreign governments tnat are creditors of

Bolivia, the government has rescheduled payments via the Paris Club. For

multilateral creditors, including the World Bank and the IMF, the government

has become current on payments, partly on the view that it stands to receive

net resource inflows from the multilateral agencies. or private foreign

creditors, mainly the commercial banks, the government has naintained a

suspension of interest payments, and has been negotiating with the creditcrs

for a "fundamental" solution to that part of the debt, via ;ome mechanism of

debt repurchase and cancellation.

      The indebtedness problems are also severe internally, though measured

internal debt is rather low. The Sues administration failed to honor many

internal obligations, to private suppliers as well asto regional corporations

and other quasi-official entities. In many cases, promises for transfer

payments were made by the Siles government as a way to buy time or support, in

full knowledge that the obligations could not be met. Thus, as revenues under

the current government have increased, the pressures for renewed payments on

various outstanding commitments have also risen. The government ha.s been

forced into negotiations on many of these ostensible claims, and each

negotiation has generated a domestic political battle that threatens the

fragile fiscal equilibrium.

      Since the Bolivian government does not have the benefit of a bankruptcy

proceeding that would partinlly cancel its outstanding debts once and for all,

it   will   continue for many years to be buffeted by various claimants. Each

creditor has the incentive to fight bitterly for full ptyment on its claims,
                                     —35—


and thereby to beat the other claimants, even though all creditors well

recognize the impossibility that the total sum of claims can be met. This

"grab race" among the various creditors, which is precisely what is blocked by

formal bankruptcy proceedings, leads to a constant and bruising politica1

battle between the government and its various creditors, a battle which

continues to put the government at political jeopardy.

     The third part of the stabilization process cited earlier is the reform

of state administration, Under Banzer and Siles, the central government had

grown to extravagant proportions, since much of the government had degenerated

into a patronage machine. This bloated and unwieldy state mechanism was

already on the verge of collapse before the end of 1985, when suddenly tin and

petroleum prices plummeted on world markets. To preserve fiscal balance, the

government had to launch a bruising, indeed brutal, battle to reduce the

employment in COMIBOL and YPFB. Although fiscally necessary, the results are

stunning, and indeed reflect a social tragedy. COMIBOL has reduced its

employment from about 30,000 workers in 1985 to just 7,000 as of 1981. Many

of these workers are unemployed, or marginally employed, or have gone to the

coca growing region to find work. The,mining towns themselves have been

decimated. Employment in VPFB has also been reduced, though not as

dramatically, from 9,000 workers in 1985 to about 5,000 in 1987.



6.   Beyond Stabilization to Economic Growth and Development

     The stabilization has eliminated much of the panic conditions that

surrounded the hyperinflatlon in 1984 and 1985. virtually complete price

stability has been reestabilished in Bolivia during 1966 and 1967. It is
                                     —36—


evident, however, that many of the deeper problems in the Bolivian economy and

society that helped to cause the hyperinflation remain in place, and in some

cases have deepened. We now mention some of the challenges that remain in

converting the current stabilization period into the first phase of sustained

economic development.

     There are three sociopolitical cleavages that are serious obstacles to

economic stability and long-term growth: the cleavages of income distribution,

ideology, and region.

     The income distributional cleavage remains profound, and is the source of

considerable political conflict. The key political problem is to moderate the

nearly continuous confrontation between powerful social groups, such as

organized labor and private capital, and the various regional forces.     The

state capitalist model attempted to finesse the income distribution problem

through a combination the inflation tax, heavy foreign borrowing, or internal

repression of the lower classes. None of these alternatives is effective for

a long-term development strategy.

     A key to a more equitable distribution of income in Bolivia is an

increased tax burden on the higher income individuals. Rather than balancing

the budget by eliminating the basic services of the state, such as health and

education, equity and stability can only be achieved if the government makes

increased efforts to secure an adequate tax base on the higher incomes. This

might include a tax on land holdings, and higher taxes on luxury consumption

goods. A second key to a more equitable distribution of income would be

greater public spending on education in the rural sector, where most of

Bolivia's poorest citizens live. Investment in the human capital of the rural

peasantry is essential for long—term economic development.
                                       —37—


     The second division to overcome is ideological, involving competing
                                                                                -

conceptions of the role of government. With the evident failures of state

capitalism   in the past two decades, there is a temptation on one side for a

strict laissez-faire economic approach, and on the other side, for a fortified

socialism. A more modulated approach is more likely to succeed. Such an

approach would recognize the Governments responsibilities for infrastructure,

and social investments in health and education, but also recognizes the

limitations to the role of the state in the productive sector. Part of the

push toward laissez—faire in Bolivia is a frank acknowledgement of the limited

capacity for honest, capable public administration in the country. But this

limitation could be lessened by a concerted effort to raise the standards and

capacity of the state bureaucracy. A determined effort at improved training

of civil servants is vital in this regard.

     The third division is 3ectoral and regional. Mining and petroleum

products can no longer be the basis of a vibrant Bolivian economy. Nor can

coca production. Export diversification will require a turn to agriculture

and light manufacturing, which in turn will surely entail some geographical

shift in the locus of economic activity from the highlands to the lowlands.

This kind of shift can be politically bruising and destructive if not handled

with foresight and planning. To accomplish this restructuring the government

will have to tread carefully between goals of allocating investment

expenditures heavily towards the new sectors and regions, and the need to

distribute the burdens and benefits of public spending in an equitable

manner.
