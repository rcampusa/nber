       Our study shows that the household production theory illuminates the behavior of

households in the allocation of time and consumption expenditures. Among the noteworthy

findings derived fiom our data, the various household non-market time allocations (consequently,

market labor supply) cannot be separated from consumption expenditures. An increase in market

wage rates for both young and elderly households reduces their time spent on household non-

market activities, such as child care, medical care, and listening to the radio and watching TV.

The high opportunity costs of waiting at the hospital clearly discourage working people from

visiting the hospital. These results show not a few similarities between the household non-market

time allocation in Japan and that to be found in the U.S.

    I. Introduction
    Human time is one of the most scarce resources. For understanding

    the way this scarce resource is allocated to satisfy competing
    human desires, we should look at the household's time allocation on

    labor supply as merely one of various activities in conjunction

    with household production (Becker 1965).'
         Allowing for the fact that the traditional consumer demand

    analysis puts great emphasis on the behavior of household
    consumption expenditures, some recent empirical studiss are
•   successful in bridging the gap between the consumption expenditure

    studies and the household production studies (Barnett 1979,
    Kooreman and Kapteyn 1987, and Biddle and Hamermesh 1990). Although

    these studies provide useful observations about household tine
    allocation,2 when the various household consumption expenditures
    are analyzed, the household non-market tins activities are dealt

    with as a single entity, i.e., leisure. On the other hand, when the

    different non-market tine activities are studied, the consumption

    expenditures are treated as an aggregate commodity.

         To be more consistent with theory and consequently to
    understand household economic activities more deeply than the
    traditional demand study, household non-market time activities,


         1 See Juster and Stafford (1991) for an excellent survey of
    literature on the allocation of tine.

         2 The results ares Barnett (1979) rejects the separability
    between consumer's labor supply and consumption of market goods;
    Kooreman and Kapteyn (1987) verify variations in the tine
    allocation of household non-market activities in response to
    changes in the real wage rate; and Huddle and Hamermesh (1990)
    focus on a major household tine allocation, i.e., sleep, and
    identify wage effects on sleeping and waking non-market tine for
    men and on market and waking non-market time for women.
                                —2—

rather than being aggregated as a single entity of leisure, need to

be simultaneously analyzed with household consumption expenditures
in a system of demand functions. This approach allows consistency

with standard economic hypotheses such as integrability,
separability,   and homogeneity. With appropriate parameter
restrictions in the system, we are able to test for separability in

household non-market time activitiee.

     Furthermore, the aforementioned empirical findings on
household time allocation should be verified for different
cultures. For example, in a country like Japan, people of different

ages and different gender seem to have distinct roles in the
household and are likely to behave differently in response to
changes in available econonic incentives.4 In addition to our
concern with international comparisons regarding the household
allocation of time, we focus epecifically on some of the social
issues currently being debated in Japan.

     First, the rate of reproduction among young couples has
declined sharply in recent years; the total fertility rate, which

is the number of live births by a woman during her reproductive
period, was 4.40 in 1948, and 1.75 in 1980. The most recent
available figure is 1.53 in l990.     How, then, do young Japanese


       The excellent and comprehensive literature on a system of
consumer demand functions to review is Brown and Ljeaton (1972),
Diewert (1974, ch.3), Earten (1977, ch.2a), tat (1977, ch.2b),
Deaton and Muellbauer (1983), lDeaton (1986), and Blundell (1988).

       The labor market in Japan still keeps the traditional
employment system although the Equal Employment Opportunity Law
went into effect in 1986 (Edwards 1988).

       The Current Conditions of Women's Labor, Ministry of Labor,
1991, p. a87: "Fujin Roudou no Jitsujyo" in Japanese.

households use their time after having chosen a smaller family size

ever than before? Second, it is often said, somewhat cynically,
that people must wait in a "3-hour" queue at the hospital to
receive a "3-minute" medical treatment. A long queue at the
hospital reflects a high shadow price of receiving medical care.
The high opportunity costs of waiting at the hospital will
discourage working people from visiting the hospital. We
consequently pose the following question- How responsive is
hospital visiting tine to changing economic incentives?
     The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows: we

report the evidence from the survey of the allocation of tine over

the period from 1976     to 1986 in section II; our analytical
framework is presented in Section III; Section IV reports the
empirical findings; and finally Section V draws our conclusion of

this study.

 XI. Evidence from the Survey on Allocation of Tine
 The cross-sectional data for cities with prefectural government on

 tine spent on daily activities by males and females at different
 age groups in 1976, 1981, and 1986 are to be found in Basic Survey

 on Social Life, published by tbe Bureau of Statistics, Office of
 the Prime Minister of Japan,

           Of "Hours and Minutes per Day spent on Activities" in Tables
I-Cl) and (2), the reported time allocations are weekly averages of

time per day. Table I-Cl) shows the young households' (males and

females aged 25-39) allocation of time spent on work, sleep, child

care, medical care1 and Radio & TV (listening to the radio and
watching TV). The time activities of elderly households (males aged

65 and over, and females aged 60 and over) are listed in Table I-
 (2)

       The reasons for choosing these different age groups for
analysis in our study are that the former young age group has two

distinct characteristics: the members of this group are in the
middle of determining the size of their families; and most of the

males in that age group are very likely to be in the labor market.

On the other hand, the latter elderly group at the age of 65 years

old is likely to be retired from the labor market and to have
started receiving social security retirement benefits. Furthermore,

the payments for medical care of members of thie group at the
hospital are mostly covered by the public medical insurance for
elderly people.' Hence, we consider that these different age groups


       '
       To be more specific, elderly people aged 65 through 69, who
are confined to bed, and those aged 70 or more are covered by this
health care program.
                                      —5-

    are most likely to behave differently in response to changes in
•   economic opportunities.

            Since the figures reported in the Tables are self-
•   explanatory, we mainly discuss the time allocations of males and
    females aged 25-39 in Table     I-Cl).   The male market daily working
    hours rose from 7 hours 22 minutes a day in 1976 to 7 hours 49
    minutes in 198G.' Since these reported figures are weekly averages

    of 7 days, if Japanese people hypothetically work the same amount

    of   hours for 5 days a week similar to the western standard, their

    working hours are nearly 10 hours a day on average.t

          As regards sleeping hours, males      "with   a job" sleep shorter
    hours than males "without a job", roughly by 30 minute a day.9 Such

    a large difference, however, vanishes in the case of females. Males

    sleep longer hours a day than females in Japan. As is to be
•
    expected in Japan, males, regardless of their attachment to the
    labor markat, spend little time on child care, while females spend

    a substantial amount   of   their tine on providing this care. Those

    females "without a job" spend twice as much time or more each day


           The most recent figures on the average monthly working hours
    per worker in the manufacturing industry in 1990 are 178.2 hours
    in firms with 30-99 workers; 174.8 hours in those with 100-499
    workers; and 177.0 hours in those with 500 workers or more (White
    Paper on Labor, Ministry of Labor, 1991, p. 287: "Roudou Hakueyo"
    in Japanese). Note that the average monthly working hours are not
    age and male specific, but induetry specific values. Hence, these
    average monthly working hours are somewhat different from the
    male's average daily working hours reported in the text.
             9.6 percent of the firms with 30 or more workers have a
    regular weekly 2-day off schedule in 1989, which cover 36.9 percent
    of total employment in industries (The Current Conditions of
    Women's Labor, Ministry of Labor, 1990, p. 594).
           Middle and Hamermeeh (1990) report that "Time spent sleeping
    is inversely related to both the wage and time spent in the labor
    market (p. 941)."
                                  -6-

on child care than working females, who spend three hours or so on

average.
     Concerning medical care, males "with a job" have much less
tins spent on medical care than males "without a job", while this

is not so for females.'1 To account for this difference in medical

care for males, two testable hypotheses may be offered: the first
one, for which we actually make a test in this study, is that males

in the labor market face high opportunity costs in visiting the
hospital and hence they visit less often as their economic
opportunities rise, while the income effects work toward more
medical care; end the second one is that males who are not in the

labor market are more likely to he ill, and the "not in the labor

force" nay be an indicator of poor health status. Hence those out

of the labor force spend more hours on medical care than those in

the market. In this second case, economic opportunities, e.g.,
their potential market wage rates, will exert little influence on
their choice of visiting the hospital. Finally, both males and
females "without a job" do spend much more time on Radio & TV
(i.e.,    listening to the radio and watching TV) than those "with   a
job". This phenomenon again seems to be indicative of the
difference in their economic opportunities. In sum, there exist
marked behavioral differences in the allocation of time between
young persons "with a job" and those "without a job" and also
between males and females of the sane age group. These obser-catione

hand, when the time of the female and that of the male are perfect

substitutes such as t3 +            t,,, =      Z,, the qualitative signs of female

wage effects on the female               and male time     spent on Z2 are ambiguous.

In terms of their labor supply to the market, the male wage effect

on the female labor supply is negative, while it is positive for

the male labor supply.14
          To make the above household production model empirically
operational, we take an approach of the household cost function in

Deaton and Nuellbauer (1980) and estimate a system of demand
functions, in which a typical i-th cost share function is defined

as follows:



     =   a     +    r1 log p +      b1   log   y ,             (8)



where      S = jXj/ QJ•fl PX        +    wT +   WfT1),   in which p is the unit price
of market good x;3 and y a       PX + waT + w1T,)/ CPI, in which
CP1 is the consumer price index.
    The parameter restrictions in equation (8) are                       a 1,

to       the data on      time allocations and consumption expenditures of
young and elderly households in Japan.

  IV. Empirical     Findings
  In the estimation of our system of demand functions,   we use pooled
  time series data for cities with prefectural
                                                 government in 1976,
 1981, and 1986 on the allocation of time for young males and
 females both aged 25-39 as well as for elderly males aged 65 or

 more and those females aged 60 or more.16 We focus on their      tine
 allocations on sleep, child care, medical care, radio & TV, and all

 other non-market time activities. These time data are collected
 from the Basic Survey on Social Life. In the system, we also
 include five categories of household market     goods and services
 consumption: food, housing, clothing, medical       care, and all
 others.1' Among the total fifteen demand functions in the system,
 we delete the equation of the household consumption expenditure on

 "All Others" to avoid the simgularity in the estimation.1!

      Firet, in order to clarify whether the young (and elderly)
households behave or not as the traditional         consumer demand
approach assumes such that the household consumption
                                                         expenditures
are separable in their time allocations, we test for
                                                         separability
in the household non-market time activities
                                               (Blackorby, Primont,
and Russell 1977). We estimate the parameters of the system of

     ' Each
            year has 47 prefectural observations.
     "
         Strictlyspeaking, in grouping numerous household goode and
services consumptions into different but appropriate categories, we
have to verify whether separability condition is met or not for
each item. This is, however, beyond our scope in the present study.
Therefore, we follow the conventional classifications in Annual
Report on the Family Income and Expendjture Survey by Statistics
Bureau, Management and Coordination Agency in Japan.

       Each share equation in the system has two yearly dummies and
seven regional dummies in addition to a vector of the         price
variables including the wage rates of males and females and income
variables.
                                 -13-

unconstrained demand functions and those of the system subject to

the separability restrictions. From the chi-square distribution
with se degrees of freedom, i.e., x3    (d.f.=58),    we cannot accept
the separability restrictions at the significance level          0.01,

as reported in Table II.' Therefore, we consider that household
decisions on time allocation is jointly determined with household

decisions on consumption expenditures. To put it differently, the
household labor supply is not the result of a simple labor-leisure

choice, but the result of tine activities in conjunction with
household production. Hence, we support the findings of Barnett
(1979) with our own Japanese data.

        Tables III-(l) and (2) report the estimates of the wage and
income elasticities of the time activities for the young
households.2° In order to have a general view of the wage and
income effects on their time activities, we begin with the
estimates of "All Households' of young males and females, as shown

under (A) in Table Ill-Cl) .
     With respect to the male wage effect,               on his time
allocations, as his market wags rate rises, a        typical Japanese
working male aged between 25 and 39 years old tends to increase his

hours spent sleeping (i.e., "Sleep" in Table) and working in the

     ' For data on "Both (male and female) in the Labor Market" in
Table II, we use the data of working males of a given age group
with those of working females of the same age group as a working
couple. Similarly, we use data for those of "Only Male in the Labor
Market" and "Neither in the Labor Market."

elasticities and standard errors.

          Here, for the purpose of our present study we report only
the empirical results of the household allocation of time. Those on
the consumption expenditures are available on request.

labor market (i.e., "Labor Supply" in Table) but to reduce his
hours spent on the other household non-market activities including

"Medical Care".22 The male wage effects on female time activities

are positive regarding the hours of her sleeping and listening to

the radio and watching TV (i.e., "Radio & TV" in Table) but
negative regarding all her other time activities including her
labor supply." As regards the effects of Wtmj.p as the wage rate

rises, the male enjoys more hours of sleeping, medical care, and

listening to the radio and watching TV, while the female works more

in the labor market. Another point concerning young households is

that wage effects on "Child Care" for both males and females are

negative, so we can conclude that they tend to choose to have less

number of children as their market opportunities improve. With
respect to income effects, as the household income rises, the young

households spend more hours on household non-market time
activities, i.e., producing more household non-market cocwnodities,

but reduces their hours of work in the market.

     Now we will highlight and discuss in a little more detail the

important results concerning young working households, as reported
in Tables III- (1) and (2) .' As regards "Both in the Labor Market"

under (B) in Table III- (1), the male (or female) wage effect on his

     " Although not   reported in Table III- Cl), the estimate of wage
elasticity of "male's all other non-market time activities" is
negative, -0.746.
     " The wage elasticity on "female's all other non-market time
activities" is -0.188.
     24
        Since there are only a few qualitative differences in the
empirical results between "Both in the Labor Market" as reported
under (B) in Table III-(l) and "Only Male in the Labor Market"
under (C) in Table flI-(2), we focus only on those results of the
former.
                                    -15-

     (or her) sleeping is positive and statistically significant in
    contrast to the U.S. experience, where the effects are negative
     (Biddle and Hamermesh 1990) 2S The positive estimates for Japanese

    working males and females are, however, not a puzzling result.
    Since our data on tine allocation are weekly averages of tine per

    day, a working couple may make up for a lack of weekdays' sleeping
    hours by sleeping more over the weekend."

         Also, as the market wage rates increase, both males and
    females increase their working hours: the estimated labor eupply

    elasticity for males is 0.369 and that for females is O.63l.'
    These values are comparable with those reported by the previous

    studies (Shinada and Higtchi 1985 and Yamada, et al, 1987). The
    cross wage effects are negative for both males and females. That

    is, a rise in the partner's market wage encourages his (or her)
    withdrawal from the labor market. The estimated owii   wage and income
    elasticities of female labor supply are nearly twice as large as

         ' The estimated own wage elasticity of sleeping for males is
    0.153, while the value is 0.147 for females: a ten-percent rise in
    male wage rate increases his average sleeping time by about I
    minutes a day (10 x 0.00153 x 463 minutes (see, in Table I-Cl),
    that a typical male aged 25-39 9flth a Job sleeps 7:43, i.e., 463
    minutes a day, in 1966))

         " In Japanese cartoons, it is very coon to have a character
    of a prime age working male who has no energy left with himself on
    a weekend due to his exceseive work during weekdays, e.g., daily
    overtime work till nearly midnight. He in the cartoon loves
    sleeping at home on the weekend, although his wife and children are
    expecting that he would take his family out such as a driving,
    shopping, and so forth. They always wait a long timel This cynicism
    is not totally false.
1
         27 These labor supply elasticities are not directly obtained
    from the estimated coefficients in the system of demand functions,
    since the share equations of male and female labor supply are
    excluded from the system by theory. The elasticities are simply a
    weighted average of the own wage elasticities of non-market
    activities.
                                -16-

those for males. This is probably because the female has more
alternatives in allocating her tine than does her husband, since a

married woman in Japan normally specializes in household production

and is consequently less attached to the labor market than her

spouse.

     Increases in hours of sleeping and labor supply for both males

and females due to an increase in their market wage rates reduce

their household non-market activities such as "Child Care",
"Medical Care", and "Radio & TV". These findings are congruent with

those drawn in the case of two-earner U.S. households by Koorenan

and Kapteyn (1987). With respect to the "Child Care", the higher
the opportunity cost to raise children for a typical working young

couple the smaller will be the size of family members chosen by the

household. Contrary to the negative wage effects on child care, a

rise in household income encourages them to spare more time for
child care. That is, an increase in household income raises the
number of children (and/or mayhe the quality of children too) in
the household.2"

     With our study of the wage effect on the tine allocation on

medical care, the result is negative (as is to be expected for both




     21 The total amount of parents' time, T, spent on children in
a typical household is t x N, where t is the average time spent on
each child by the parents and N is the number of children in the
household. Then, ôln T,/öln Income = ôln tJOln Income .'.    N/8ln
Income. From our empirical result, we know öln T/8ln Income > .
Therefore, if t is fixed, the number of children rises as the
household income increases. On the other hand, if N is fixed, the
"quality (given the condition that the parents' time is superior to
any other substitutes)" of child will increase as the income rises.
In realty, a mixture of the positive income effects seem to be held
on both t and N.
                               -17-

working males and fenales), but statistically insignificant." A
one-percent rise in male wage rate reduces his time spent on

medical care, e.g., waiting at the hospital, by about 3 percent
(i.e., -3.009 for male "Medical Care" under W1 and -2.963 for
female "Medical Care" under W±mi.) Putting it differently, a
typical working male reducee his time spent on hospital visite by

about 6 minutes a week in reeponee to a ten-percent increase in his

wage rate [7 days a week x 10 x -0.03009 x 3 minutes spent on
"Medical Care" by males "with a job" in 1986 in Table I-Cl)].
Although the value itself is small, this seems to be indicative of

one of the reasone why prime age working males and     females   are

rarely to be found waiting their turns in the busy lobbies of

hospitals all day long.
     Now we will discuss the empirical results on elderly
households, as reported in Tables IV-(l) and (2). About the "All

Households" under (A) in Table IV-(l), the W,_1 effect is positive

on male "labor supply" and a rise in the wage rate encourages his

spouse to take more "Sleep' and "Child Care" of, presumably, their

grand-children. But, for the W_,_1. effect which is positive on her

market labor supply, the male is not so helpful for caring grand-

children. In other words, when elderly people are not responsible

for taking care of their grand-children, as their market economic
opportunities rise, they seem not to retire early from the labor

market.
     The most striking findings for working elderly males, as shown


     " This wage effect on males is negative and statistically
significant for the case of "All Households" reported under (A) in
Table XII- (1).
                                -18-

under (B) in Table IV-{l) and under (C) in Table IV-(2), are that

the wage effects on their time spent on "Sleep", "Child Care",
"Medical Care", and "Radio & IV" are all negative and statistically

significant)C The negative wage effect on "Medical Care" and the

positive effect on "Labor Supply" for working elderly males clearly
indicates that their condition of good health postpones their
retirement from the labor market, in sharp contrast to the positive

wage effect on "Medical Care" for the "Neither one in the Labor
Market" household as reported under CD) in Table IV-(2).3' As for

the Wf,• effects on her household non-market time activities, a

general impression is that the negative wage effects dominate, but

that they are statistically much weaker in significance than with
the male counterparts,

     In sum, our empirical findings show that household decisions
on the allocation of time is not independent of household decisions

on consumption expenditures. An increase in wage rates stimulates

the market labor supply for both young and elderly people, but
generally reduces their non-market time activities. On the other
hand, household income has dominant positive effects on the time

allocations on sleeping, child care, medical care, and listening to
the radio and watching TV.



       These qualitative results are similar to those for working
young males except for the effect on "Sleep", but the statistical
results for working young males are much weaker than those with
working elderly males,
     ' As often done in the literature of labor economics, A wage
equation for non-participants in the labor market should be
estimated in an appropriate manner. Since we are not successful in
collecting the relevant variables for the equation, we instead use
the industry average wage rates for the non-participants.
Therefore, our results for them are only suggestive.

V. Conclusions and Implications

In this study, by using the pooled time series data in 1976, 1981,

and 1986, we analyze the allocation of time of young (aged 25-39)

and elderly (aged 65 or more) households in Japan. We estimate a
system of demand functions, in which the equations of household
non-market time activities are simultaneously estimated with those

of household consumption expenditures.

     Among the noteworthy findings derived from our data, first of
all, in our test for separability in the household time allocation,

we cannot accept the separability restrictions. Hance, as has
already been suggested by some U.S. data, our Japanese data show
that household non-market time l1ocations (consequently, its
market labor supply)      are not separable from consumption
expenditures.
     Secondly, an increase in ths market wage rates for both young

and elderly households reduces their time spent on the household
non-market activities such as child care, medical care, and
listening to the radio and watching TV. We consider one reason why

young working couples have smaller families in recent years to be
bound up with the improvements in their economic opportunities in

the labor market. Since fewer children are born and fewer working

people are now supporting currently retired people than in the
past, and since these trends will continue in the near future,

raising the retirement age reconmiendsd by the Japanese government
would encourage people to work longer and thus would reduce the
ratio of retired to working ags people.

     Thirdly, as hypothesized, the high opportunity costs of
waiting at the hospital clearly discourage working people from
                               -20-

visiting the hospital. Requiring firms   to have   their own   clinics
and encouraging hospitals to make appointments for patients would

reduce waiting time.

     As a concluding remark, our study shows that the household
production theory iliwninates the behavior of households in the
allocation of time and consumption expenditures. The results of our

empirical model based on the theory show not a few similarities
between the forms of household behavior in different cultures,
e.g., the U.S. and Japan.
