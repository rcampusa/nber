                                           ABSTRACT

       In Israel, as in many other countries, a high school matriculation certificate is required by
universities and some jobs. In spite of the certificate's value, Israeli society is marked by vast
differences in matriculation rates by region and socioeconomic status. We attempted to increase the
likelihood of matriculation among low-achieving students by offering substantial cash incentives
in two demonstration programs. As a theoretical matter, cash incentives may be helpful if low-
achieving students reduce investment in schooling because of high discount rates, part-time work,
or face peer pressure not to study. A small pilot program selected individual students within schools
for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and a partially randomized
cutoff for low socioeconomic status. In a larger follow-up program, entire schools were randomly
selected for treatment and the program operated with the cooperation of principals and teachers. The
results suggest the Achievement Awards program that randomized treatment at the school level
raised matriculation rates, while the student-based program did not.

        One of the most economically important education milestones in many countries and in some

American states is a high-school matriculation exam. Examples include the French Baccalaureate, the New

York State Regents examinations, and the recently instituted Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment

System. In Israel, a national high school matriculation exam -- known as the Bagrut – is a pre-requisite for

admission to universities and arguably marks the dividing line between the working class and the middle

class. In spite of the Bagrut’s economic and social value, Israeli society is marked by vast differences in

Bagrut completion rates across regions and by socioeconomic status. These disparities have led Israeli

educators and administrators to try remedial programs in an attempt to increase high school matriculation

rates. But most of these programs appear to have had little effect. Similarly, an array of service-oriented

anti-dropout demonstrations for American teens appears to have had little effect on graduation rates

(Dynarski and Gleason, 1998).

        The discouraging results from previous anti-dropout interventions stimulated our interest in a simpler

approach that focuses on immediate financial incentives for student effort. As a theoretical matter, cash

incentives may be helpful if low-achieving students have high discount rates, reduce investment in schooling

by going to work, or face peer pressure not to study. The promise of more immediate financial rewards may

tip the scales in favor of schoolwork. In this paper, we report on two demonstration projects that provided

financial awards for low-achieving high school students in Israel. The interventions discussed here rewarded

Bagrut completion and performance on Bagrut subject tests with direct payments to students. We also

discuss some of the methodological issues arising in evaluations of this type.

        The task of evaluating educational incentives presents a number of practical and research-design

challenges. How should the incentives be structured? Are incentives that target entire schools more likely

to be effective than those that target individual students? What is an appropriate experimental design? To

shed light on these questions, we explored two alternatives. The first was a small pilot study that randomized

students within schools. Because simple random assignment within schools was seen as inequitable by

administrators, we used a hybrid within-school experimental design. Eligibility for treatment was first
determined by forecasting the probability of Bagrut completion as a function of socioeconomic

characteristics and previous test scores. Only students with performance in a certain range were offered

treatment. Random assignment was introduced by lowering the selection threshold with probability one-half,

a modification justified to school administrators on the grounds that the program budget had insufficient

funds to treat everyone below the original threshold.

        A second larger intervention involved 40 schools with a very low percentage of high school seniors

obtaining Bagrut certification. This program differed from the pilot program primarily in that treatment

assignment was determined by random assignment of entire schools and not students within schools. The

school-level awards program was also implemented with the cooperation of principals and administrators

in treated schools. Another difference is that intermediate awards were offered for completion of individual

subject tests and for continued school enrollment, though the highest awards were offered to seniors who

ultimately obtained a Bagrut.

        Random assignment of schools rather than students generates a group-randomized trial (GRT) of the

type widely used to study interventions in naturally clustered units such as schools, hospitals, and

communities (see, e.g., Donner, Brown, and Brasher, 1990). GRTs offer practical and cost-saving

advantages, but may not balance treatment and control characteristics when, as is typical, a small number

of units are randomized. Under some circumstances, balance can be improved by using matched pairs, as

in our experimental design. Another important disadvantage of clustered designs is that, because outcomes

within clusters are correlated, GRTs usually have much lower statistical power than simple randomized trials

with the same sample size (see, e.g., Feng, Diehr, Peterson, and McLerran, 2001). Conclusions may also

depend on the statistical framework used to interpret GRT data; in particular, whether to treat the group or

the individual as the basis for inference. We therefore explore a number of approaches to the analysis of data

from the schools GRT.

        Section I provides background on the Israeli school system and describes the school-based


                                                      2
achievement awards program in detail. This section also outlines the theoretical context for programs of this

type. Other interventions in this spirit include the Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP; Hahn, Leavitt,

and Aaron, 1994); the Learning, Earning, and Parenting (LEAP) demonstration project in Ohio (Long,

Gueron, Wood, Fisher, and Fellerath, 1996); the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in Britain

(Deardon, et al, 2001); Progresa in Mexico (Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd, 2000; Schultz, 2001); and the

Programa de Ampliación de Cobertura de la Educación Secundaria (PACES), which provided private school

vouchers in Colombia (Angrist, Bettinger, Bloom, King, and Kremer, 2002).1 The Achievement Awards

experiment also has elements in common with the college tuition subsidy programs run by the I Have a

Dream Foundation, and Robert Reich’s (1998) proposal to pay targeted bonuses of $25,000 to high school

graduates from low-income families.

        Section II discusses the pilot experiment and Section III presents background for the school-based

demonstration. Section IV discusses results from the schools demonstration, which, while not entirely clear-

cut, suggest the probability of Bagrut certification increased by 6-8 percentage points in Award schools.

Consistent with a causal interpretation of these results, analyses conditional on previous test results show

treatment effects only for students with achievement levels that put them in a position to benefit from

additional effort.   In contrast, randomization within schools clearly failed to generate a change in

achievement. Together these results support the hypothesis that the participation of school administrators

and teachers is important for the success of individual incentive programs like those tested here. Section V

concludes and outlines directions for further work.



        1
           QOP combined services for children in AFDC families with modest financial incentives for enrollment in a
small randomized pilot. LEAP used financial incentives along with case management and support services to
increase the school enrollment of welfare mothers in a randomized demonstration. EMA pays children or mothers of
children in low-income families based on enrollment and achievement, and is currently being evaluated in a non-
randomized study. Progresa offered payments based on the enrollment status of primary and secondary school
children in randomly selected towns in Mexico. The PACES program awarded vouchers for private school in a
lottery for 6th graders in Colombia. This had an achievement component because vouchers were lost if students
failed to keep up with schoolwork. As far as we know, however, ours are the first demonstrations to combine
substantial achievement-based payments to students with a randomized experimental design.

I. Background

A. Theoretical Context

        Why do young men and women fail to complete high school? Why don’t more people go to college?

These questions present something of a puzzle since the economic returns to schooling appear to be very

large, and almost certainly exceed the costs of additional schooling for most non-college graduates. Research

on education choices suggests possible explanations for low schooling levels, mostly related to heterogeneity

in costs (or perceived costs) and heterogeneity in returns (or expected returns). Using data from the NLSY,

for example, Eckstein and Wolpin (1999) link the drop-out decision to lack of ability and motivation, low

expectations about the rewards from graduation, disutility from schooling, and a comparative advantage in

the jobs available to non-graduates. Another consideration raised in the literature on college attendance is

liquidity constraints and the role of financial aid (see, e.g., Fuller, Manski, and Wise, 1982; Card and

Lemieux, 2000). Since capital markets are imperfect and human capital is hard to collateralize, some poor

students may chose not to go school in the absence of subsidies.

        A number of features of the Israeli economic environment dovetail with the issues raised in previous

research on low educational attainment. First, while high school is free, there is an opportunity cost to

schooling since students can work, perhaps at the expense of remedial programs that might make Bagrut

success more likely. A related concern is that some teenagers act as if they have very high discount rates

(see, e.g., Gruber, 2000). Israeli requirements for compulsory military service (at least 3 years for boys and

2 years for girls) probably exacerbate the impact of discounting since working life for a male college

graduate does not begin until 6-7 years after high school. Uncertainty about returns may also be greater for

poor Israelis, who are disproportionately likely to live in small towns with few educated adult role models.

Finally, peer effects may be a negative influence in some of the relatively isolated communities where

education is lowest.

        Bagrut status in Israel is not directly comparable to an American student’s drop-out status since most


                                                      4
of the students who fail to complete a Bagrut still finish their secondary schooling. Nevertheless, as for

American high school dropouts, post-secondary schooling options for Israeli graduates without a Bagrut are

limited; very few non-Bagrut holders will obtain further schooling. Of course, many students may not be

able to complete a Bagrut no matter how hard they try. But the substantial cross-sectional and time series

variation in Bagrut rates suggests that some students attending schools with low completion rates could,

under some circumstances, do better. This possibility is highlighted by the Ministry of Education’s practice

of reporting the proportion of high school seniors who are “close” but fail to obtain a Bagrut, on the order

of 22 percent.2

         The Achievement Awards demonstrations were motivated by a desire to tip the scales towards

current investment in schooling and away from market work or leisure, especially for students close to the

margin for Bagrut success. The concrete and relatively immediate awards offered by the programs should

have increased the present value of studying for exams and reduced uncertainty about returns. The programs

may also have provided a cover story that students could use to justify schoolwork in the face of ridicule by

non-studying peers. Our intervention is in the spirit of Reich’s (1998) proposal to offer students from low-

income families in the US a $25,000 cash bonus for graduating high school. Keane and Wolpin (2000)

simulated the impact of this policy in the context of a structural model of education choice. They estimated

that the Reich program would have a large impact on high school graduation rates and college attendance,

especially for Blacks.



B. The Israeli School System

         Israeli education consists of elementary school (grades 1-6), middle school (grades 7-9) and high

school (grades 10-12). High school students are enrolled in an academic track leading to a Bagrut, or in a



         2
        Bagrut statistics for the 2000 school year are available at http//www.netvision.net.il/bagrut/
netunim2000.htm#1.4.

                                                          5
vocational track leading to a diploma. The Bagrut is completed by passing a series of national exams in core

and elective subjects beginning in 10th grade, with more tests taken in 11th grade and most taken in 12th grade.

Students choose to be tested at various proficiency levels, with each test awarding 1 to 5 credit units per

subject, depending on difficulty. Some subjects are mandatory and many must be taken for at least 3 units.3

A minimum of 20 credit units is required to qualify for a matriculation certificate. About 52 percent of all

high-school seniors received a matriculation certificate in the 1999 and 2000 cohorts (Israel Ministry of

Education, 2001). Roughly 60 percent of those who took at least one Bagrut subject test end up receiving

a Bagrut certificate. In our samples, however, Bagrut rates are much lower.



II. The Pilot Experiment

         Our investigation of financial incentives for students began with a pilot evaluation in the 1999-2000

school year involving approximately 500 students in low-achieving schools in Southern Israel. We hoped

to increase the number of students taking the various Bagrut subject tests, to encourage students in trouble

to take advantage of remedial services, and to increase study effort at school and at home. Students in the

treatment group were told that Bagrut achievers would have their choice of $800 in cash, a $1,000 voucher

to be used towards a trip of educational value, or a $1,200 voucher to be used towards the cost of higher

education. Students who were offered the opportunity to earn an award were notified in writing in March

2000. The time lines for both the pilot and follow-up programs appear in the Appendix.

         Treated students in the pilot were notified of the intervention later than originally planned, a fact that

reduced the scope for changes in behavior that could have increased the likelihood of obtaining a Bagrut in

June. On the other hand, students have the opportunity to boost their efforts towards the Bagrut at any time,




          3
            Bagrut subject requirements change from year to year and are described in the appendix. Some Bagrut
tests are graded internally, but internal grades that deviate substantially from external scores are disqualified. The
Achievement Awards program, which neither awarded nor sanctioned teachers, would seem to have offered little
incentive to lower standards and risk disqualification.

and have access to remedial instruction through schools and outside of school. Moreover, Israeli seniors

have the opportunity to try some Bagrut subject tests again the following winter, provided they have not

already been drafted. The pilot data analyzed here include the winter retests.

        The pilot experiment differed from the larger school-based experiment which followed in that we

used a design that randomized students within schools. Randomization within schools should have provided

a more powerful design with less data. In practice, however, simple randomization was seen by school

administrators as hard to justify to participants and outside observers. We therefore used a hybrid

instrumental variables design that selected students for treatment on the basis of their socioeconomic

characteristics and a partially randomized threshold, described in more detail below.4



A. Sample Selection, Experimental Design and Descriptive Statistics

        The sample was selected by dividing the population of 1302 seniors enrolled in the 1999-2000 school

year into three groups on the basis of the number of Bagrut subject tests they had taken previously and their

maximum score on these tests (recall that the Bagrut is determined by a series of tests, some of which are

usually taken in 10th and 11th grade). We estimated Logit regressions with information from the previous

cohort of students to predict the probability of Bagrut certification as a function of these two variables,

denoted here by p1i for student i. All students with a very low probability of Bagrut attainment (p1i<.053)

were offered the opportunity to earn a bonus. It was inexpensive and politically expedient to offer bonuses

to this group, about 15 percent of enrolled seniors in the Southern cohort.

        At the other end, students with a very high probability of success were excluded, in particular, we

did not offer bonuses to 612 students with p1i>.66, about half of seniors. The remaining 491 students were

                                                       7
potentially eligible for an award.5 Treatment was assigned to these students as a function of family size and

father’s education, with students of lower socioeconomic status more likely to be in the treatment group. We

chose this mechanism because the Israeli Ministry of Education commonly allocates education resources in

this way (see, e.g., Angrist and Lavy, 1999). Again, we used the previous cohort of seniors to estimate the

probability a student would obtain a Bagrut certificate as a function of family size and father’s schooling,

denoted p2i. To introduce an element of random assignment, we used a threshold that varied by student and

school, so that roughly half of the eligible students from each school were offered treatment. The rule for

treatment assignment for student i in school j was

        Tij = 1[p2i < q.22(j)(1!Zi) + q.7(j)Zi]

where q.22(j) and q.7(j) are the .22 and .7 quantiles of the p2i distribution in school j.

        The hybrid experimental designed is sketched in Table 1, which reports the number of students in

the all-treated, no-treated, and eligible samples. For the eligible sample, the table shows the number of

students exposed to a high (Zi=1) and low (Zi=0) threshold and the number offered the opportunity to earn

an award. The design is such that about half of eligible students were exposed to a high threshold and about

half of eligibles had the opportunity to earn an award. Exposure to the high threshold instead of the low

increased the probability of treatment by about 50 percentage points since the probability of treatment

increased from about one-quarter to about three-quarters.

        Descriptive statistics for the eligible, all-treated, and non-treated samples are presented in Table 2.

About one-third of eligible students received a Bagrut. By construction, the probability of receiving a

Bagrut is very low (%2.7 ) in the all-treated sample, and relatively high (%77.3) in the no-treated samples.

Other covariates in the table are the test-history variables used to construct the index determining eligibility

status (i.e., the regressors used to construct p1i) and the socioeconomic regressors used to construct p2i. The

          The analysis sample includes 489 eligible students because of missing demographic data not used for
treatment assignment but used in the analysis.

bottom panel provides information on some additional characteristics that can be used to assess the success

of the random assignment of the threshold shifter, Zi. There is no significant association between Zi and any

covariate. There is also no significant association between Zi and Bagrut status, although those exposed to

a high threshold were much more likely to have been given the opportunity to earn an award.

         The experimental design detailed in Tables 1 and 2 amounts to simple random assignment for those

with p2i in the interval [q.22(j), q.7(j)]. Alternately, we can think of this as random assignment conditional on

the covariates p2i and school effects. Finally, the design can be seen as generating an instrument, Zi, for the

endogenous regressor, Tij (endogenous in this case means correlated with family background). We focus on

the instrumental variables interpretation, reporting reduced form estimates of the effects of exposure to the

high threshold on the likelihood of obtaining a Bagrut certificate.



B. Results

         Table 3 reports the reduced form estimates for models including a range of covariates. Data are from

the eligible sample of 489 and a subsample of 439 that excludes students attending the single Bedouin school

in the sample. Some of the models include school fixed effects. Although exposure to a high threshold is

associated with a precisely estimated 50-53 percentage point first stage, there is no association between Zi

and Bagrut attainment. Note that because the first-stage effect was .5, standard errors for the effect of

treatment are approximately double those for the reduced form effects shown in the table.6

         In exploratory analyses, we found some evidence of a positive effect on Bagrut rates for girls, though

also puzzling negative effects for boys. Both results are significantly different from zero. The positive effect

for girls seems plausible, but the negative effect for boys is puzzling, especially since it indicates a

remarkably large decline in Bagrut rates for boys in the treatment group. A possible explanation is that this


         6
          The hybrid design was powerful enough to detect a treatment effect of about .12. Because the control
group Bagrut rate was higher in the pilot sample, this is roughly the same proportional treatment effect found in the
clustered design.

                                                          9
particular analysis by subgroup, one of many possible analyses of this type, uncovered this pattern by chance.

As a specification check, we therefore repeated the analysis by sex in two further subgroups. The first is

the “random assignment sample”, i.e., those students with p2i in the interval [q.22(j), q.7(j)]. For this group

Tij=Zi, and the effect of Zi should be strongest. In contrast, for those with p2i outside this interval, the “no-

first-stage sample”, treatment status is orthogonal to Zi and determined solely by whether p2i is below q.22(j)

or above q.7(j).

         The results of this specification check, reported in Table 4, suggest the negative effect for boys and

positive effect for girls is just a chance occurrence. Estimates using the no-first-stage sample show no

relationship between Zi and treatment status for either sex, yet the association between Zi and Bagrut rates

is even larger than in the random assignment sample where Zi=Tij. We therefore conclude that the pilot

experiment had no effect on achievement, though a null hypothesis of modest effects cannot be rejected

either. This built-in specification check is a useful feature of the hybrid design. Another useful finding is

that of the 80 awards given out in the pilot, only 2 were to students from the low-scoring all-treated sample.

No award recipients chose the travel option, and only 5 chose the $1,200 tuition voucher. We therefore

switched to an all-cash scheme in the larger school-based experiment.



III. Background for the Schools Experiment

         To kick off the school-based demonstration, we conducted an orientation with principals and

administrators from treatment schools in January 2001. Some principals chose not to participate, though

most were enthusiastic, and informed their students shortly thereafter, usually in a school assembly or a

classroom announcement. Many schools also distributed written materials describing the program to students

and/or their parents.7 The award schedule is detailed in the appendix. The program was meant to last 3


         7
          We interviewed principals at each treatment school to verify this. Unlike in the pilot, treated students in
this case were notified early enough to request a deferment for military service if they wanted to retake Bagrut tests.
In practice, this option seems unlikely to have been a major contributor towards program effects.

                                                          10
years, with awards given to high school students in every grade. Two awards were offered to students who

progressed from 10th to 11th grade and from 11th to 12th grade. Small awards of NIS500 were also given for

test-taking regardless of the outcome, with NIS1500 given for actually passing tests before senior year. The

largest award was NIS6,000 (almost $1,500) for any senior who received a Bagrut.

        The total amount at stake for a student who passed all achievement milestones was NIS10,000 or just

under $2,400. This is about one-third of the after-tax earnings a student could expect from working full-time

as a high-school drop-out, and about twice as much as a student might earn working full-time in two summer

months. Due to adverse publicity, however, the awards program was suspended after the first year. The

suspension was announced in May of 2001, about a month before the Bagrut tests. As a consequence, awards

were given for only one year of achievement and the maximum amount awarded was NIS6,000. The

suspension and associated public controversy should have reduced the program impact least for seniors, since

they would have been in the program for only one year anyway.8

        Given this unanticipated deviation from the intended scenario, it seems worth asking how likely the

program is to have affected student behavior. As part of the follow-up effort, the Ministry of Education’s

evaluation division surveyed students in October 2001 to determine whether they remembered the program

and whether behavior changed as a result. The response rate among seniors was low since many had already

been drafted or were hard to locate for other reasons. Low-achieving students are probably over-represented

so the survey results are suggestive at best. Nevertheless, almost 53 percent of the students interviewed

recalled specific program features, and over 80 percent of these recalled attending a school assembly where

program information was distributed. Among those who remembered the program, 87 percent said the

bonus was large enough to induce extra effort and about half reported they did indeed work harder. We also




        8
          In May 2000, when 2000 Bagrut results were announced, Education Ministry officials referred reporters to
the Achievement Awards program as an attempt to increase scores. This led to extensive and mostly critical media
coverage. The program was then suspended, though the Ministry issued a press release indicating the program
would run as planned for the first year and then be assessed.

found that students in treated schools reported studying 2.7 hours per week between January and June, 11

percent more than the 2.4 average hours of study in control schools. This is consistent with the program

having caused 25% of students to study an extra 2 hours per week for 3 months. The academic value of this

extra effort is a separate question, however, and the subject of our impact evaluation.9



A. Experimental Design and Descriptive Statistics

         In December 2000, we selected 40 high schools with low 1999 Bagrut rates, but above a minimum

threshold rate of 3 percent. Some schools with low completion rates were ineligible to participate in the

experiment for technical or administrative reasons. The list of participating schools included 10 Arab and

10 Jewish religious schools.10 Treatment was randomly assigned to 20 of the 40 participating schools. The

total number of treated schools was determined by the program budget constraint, which allowed about

750,000 dollars for award payments.

         Random assignment of entire schools does not balance treatment and control characteristics as

effectively as random assignment of students within schools. Nevertheless, while not large enough to ensure

treatment-control balance, the number of clusters used here is typical (see, e.g., Feng, et al, 2001). To

improve treatment-control balance we used a matching strategy that paired treatment and control schools

based on lagged values of the primary outcome of interest, the average 1999 Bagrut rate.11 Treatment was

assigned randomly within pairs, as is common in GRTs (see, e.g., Gail, et al, 1996). Such pre-treatment

matching is typically worthwhile provided that (a) matching effectively balances pre-treatment outcomes;

and (b) lagged outcomes are a reasonably good predictor of future outcomes.



         9
          In June of 2001, around the time of the Bagrut tests, an Israeli television station ran a special program that
included interviews with pilot participants, as well as with one of us (Lavy) and program critics. The participants’
comments suggested the program was of considerable interest to students.
         10
            Israel runs semi-autonomous school systems for Secular Jews, Religious Jews, and Arabs. Rules for
Bagrut are similar in all three systems.
         11
            We used 1999 Bagrut rates to select and match schools because the 2000 data were incomplete when
treatment was assigned.

                                                           12
        Table 5 presents descriptive statistics for each of the 39 schools that were initially involved in the

experiment. There are 39 schools instead of 40 because the control school in pair 6 had closed by the time

treatment were assigned. In follow-up contacts in March 2001, we verified the level of program participation

by contacting principals and school administrators. School administrators in two non-compliant schools (in

pairs 14 and 15) hoped to participate but submitted student rosters shortly after the deadline. The principals

of three schools had taken no concrete actions to inform students or teachers about the program and/or

indicated that they did not wish to participate.

        The enrollment figures in Table 5 show the number of high school seniors in each school year from

1999-2001. Religious schools tend to be smaller than secular schools. Schools range in size from 10 to 242

seniors in 1999, and some schools show marked changes in size from year to year. These changes reflect

the unstable environment that characterizes Israel’s weakest schools. Many absorb large cohorts of new

immigrants and are in small towns with substantial population movements.

        Bagrut rates in 1999 ranged from 3.6-28.6 percent. As noted above, this is much lower than the

national average of 52 percent for high school seniors. It is important to note, however, that Bagrut rates in

2000 and 2001 were much more variable than those in 1999. This partly reflects our sample design since

rates for 1999 were selected to be within a certain range. The variability in Bagrut rates in later years also

results from small school size, changes in school populations due to immigration and internal migration, and

measurement error in the Bagrut data. In practice, the 1999 Bagrut rate is not as powerful a predictor of the

2000 and 2001 Bagrut rates as we had hoped. The R2 from a weighted regression of the 2001 rate on the

1999 rate is .15. On the other hand, the overall Bagrut rate in the sample was reasonably stable, ranging

from 20-22 percent.

        Although the variability documented in Table 1 is clearly undesirable, it bears emphasizing that

substantial variability in year-to-year performance measures for individual schools is not unique to our

sample. Using data on North Carolina schools, for example, Kane and Staiger (2001) similarly found that


                                                     13
much of the year-to-year variation in performance is due to school-level random shocks that come from

sources other than sampling variance and permanent differences in school characteristics.

        Table 5 also reports the probability of being on the Bagrut track for seniors at each school. Most of

the students in the sample were registered as being on the Bagrut track in spite of the low probability of

ultimately receiving a Bagrut. In the analysis that follows, we focus on samples that include all students

since reported track-status may be endogenous. This endogeneity is a consequence of the fact that track

status is reported with error, and errors are more likely to be corrected for those students who ultimately

received a Bagrut.



B. Econometric Framework

        Because treatment was randomly assigned in the schools experiment, unbiased estimates of treatment

effects can be obtained from simple treatment-control comparisons. In practice, however, a number of

complications are worth special attention. First, as noted above, randomization by cluster is less likely than

individual-level randomization to balance confounding factors, even after matching. This is especially

relevant in view of the unstable Bagrut rates in Table 5. We attempted to improve treatment-control balance

by discarding 4 pairs with the largest (as measured by t-statistics) differences in 2000 Bagrut rates. Other

econometric issues are discussed below.



Adjusting for Non-Compliance

        Schools’ compliance status may be endogenous in the sense that it was partly determined by

anticipated Bagrut rates. If so, estimates in a sample limited to schools that complied will be biased. A

simple approach to the compliance problem is to estimate “intention-to-treat effects”, i.e., the reduced-form

impact of the randomized offer of program participation in the full sample. Such estimates are reported

below. Intention-to-treat effects provide a lower bound on the effect of actual program participation and can


                                                     14
be re-scaled into effects on students in treated schools by using the randomized opportunity to participate

in the program as an instrumental variable for actual participation. Because no control schools received

treatment, this approach estimates the effect of treatment on the treated (Imbens and Angrist, 1994).

        A second adjustment for compliance is suggested by Table 5. Note that if we could identify

compliant schools ex ante, i.e. before treatment was assigned, efficient estimation procedures would limit

the analysis to treatment/control pairs where the treatment school is compliant. Restricting the sample to

compliant schools generates efficiency gains because this restriction exploits prior knowledge about the link

between assignment and treatment. Compliance status is only known ex post, however, and is therefore

endogenous. On the other hand, Table 5 shows that non-compliant schools are concentrated at the upper end

of the distribution of 1999 Bagrut rates. Limiting the analysis to schools with 1999 rates less than .25

eliminates 3 out of 5 non-compliant schools and 2/3 of non-compliant students. We therefore report results

for a “low-rate sample” of schools with 1999 Bagrut rates less than .25, as well as for the full sample and the

balanced sample noted above. As it turns out, treatment and control schools are also more comparable (as

measured by 2000 Bagrut rates) in the low-rate sample.



Inference in Group Randomized Trials

        Randomized trials that assign treatment status to entire schools may be more attractive than within-

school randomization for both programmatic and logistical reasons. First, school randomization reduces the

perception of unfairness associated with randomization. Second, students not offered treatment may

nevertheless be affected by treatments received by others in the same school, diluting within-school treatment

effects. Finally, education interventions may be more effective when introduced at the school level.

Incentive programs for students depend partly on the cooperation of teachers and school administrators, and

may get additional leverage from peer effects when those nearby participate.12


        12
          A recent experiment in financial education illustrates this point (Duflo and Saez, 2002).

                                                         15
        The most important statistical issue in school-level GRTs is whether to treat groups (schools) or

students as the unit of observation, and, if the latter, how best to adjust inferential procedures for clustering

at the group level. As Cornfeld (1978) notes, analyses of GRTs that ignore clustering are “an exercise in

self-deception.” The traditional cluster adjustment relies on a linear model with random effects, an approach

known to economists primarily through the work of Moulton (1986). When the clusters are all of size n, this

amounts to multiplying standard errors by a “design effect,” [1+(n!1)D]1/2, where D measures the intra-cluster

residual correlation. A problem with random effects models in this context is that the equi-correlated error

structure they impose is implausible for binary outcomes like Bagrut status. Another problem is that

estimates of D tend to be too low.

        A modern variation on random effects models is the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE)

framework developed by Liang and Zeger (1986). GEE allows for an unrestricted correlation structure and

can be used for binary outcomes and nonlinear models such as Logit and Poisson regression. An advantage

of GEE is that it is very flexible and increasingly available in proprietary software.13 The primary

disadvantage is that the validity of GEE inference turns on an asymptotic argument based on the number of

clusters (as do parametric random effects models). GRTs often have too few clusters for asymptotic formulas

to provide an acceptably accurate approximation to the finite-sample sampling distribution.14

        A simple alternative to micro-level analyses is to work with grouped data, in this case, school means.

Average Bagrut rates are approximately Normally distributed so t-tests may be valid even with a moderate

number of groups. On the other hand, grouped analyses are conservative in the sense that they treat

additional observations within schools as if they were uninformative beyond their impact on the dispersion

of the averages. Statistical tests based on grouped data may therefore be less powerful than those based on

micro data.



        13
          GEE standard errors are produced by the Stata “Cluster” option and SAS GENMOD procedure.
        14
          See, e.g., Thornquist and Anderson (1992).

                                                       16
        We present regression estimates of treatment effects using both micro and grouped data. The model

used to construct estimates using student data can be written:

        yijt = "j + xjtN$ + 3q dqi:q + *Zjt + ,ijt,                                                          (1)

where i indexes students; j=1, . . ., 20 indexes pairs; t=0,1 indexes treatment status within pairs, and Zjt is

assigned treatment status. Grouped covariates includes pair effects, "j, and two school-level covariates

denoted xjt, which consist of dummies for Arab and religious schools. The student-level covariates are three

dummies (dqi; q=2, 3, 4) indicating the quartile of a student’s average test score on Bagrut and diploma tests

taken as of January 2001, when the program was implemented. It turns out that this lagged score variable,

described in more detail below, is the single best predictor we have of students’ Bagrut status.

        Grouped estimates were constructed similarly. The typical grouped equation can be written:

        Gyjt = "j + xjtN$ + *Zjt + 0
                                   Gjt,                                                                      (2)

where yGjt is the school average Bagrut rate and 0Gjt is a grouped error term. Some of these estimates are

weighted by the school size, njt. As suggested by classical results on regression efficiency, it seems natural

to weight, and weighted estimation using groups produces the same estimates as micro data when there are

no covariates. On the other hand, in models with group random effects (implicit in this case since we worry

about clustering), weighted estimation need not be more efficient. Moreover, when treatment effects are

heterogeneous, weighted and unweighted procedures estimate different average effects.

        We also experimented with a two-step procedure discussed by Baker and Fortin (2001) and Donald

and Lang (2001). In our case, this amounts to adjusting school means for micro covariates by estimating

school fixed effects in an equation like (1), and then regressing the estimated fixed effects on treatment status

and other school-level covariates in an equation like (2). In particular, we first estimate

        yijt = :jt + 3q dqi:q + ,ijt,                                                                        (3)

and then regress :^ jt, the estimated :jt, on the same covariates as in equation (2). This procedure uses the

micro-data to reduce the dispersion in means, while inference is conservative in the sense that no credit is


                                                       17
taken for within-cluster variability in the second step.

        Donald and Lang (2001) present Monte Carlo evidence suggesting the two-step estimator has good

finite sample properties for some designs and always improves on cluster-adjustments, though Baker and

Fortin (2001) report second-step estimates that are sensitive to weighting. To address this point, we report

weighted and unweighted second step estimates. Finally, in a direct attack on the problem of downward-

biased GEE standard errors, we estimated standard errors using Bell and McCaffrey’s (2002) Biased

Reduced Linearization (BRL) estimator for micro data. BRL implements a correction for GEE standard

errors similar to MacKinnon and White’s (1985) bias-corrected heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance

matrix. Bell and McCaffrey present Monte Carlo evidence suggesting BRL generates tests of the correct size

in traditional random effects models.

        A final statistical issue worth noting is that some of the regression estimates are from models that

omit pair effects. In principle, pair effects can be dropped without biasing the estimates of treatment effects

since intention to treat is assigned with equal probability across pairs. Ignoring stratification variables may

also lead to more precise estimates in paired experiments since the inclusion of pair effects uses up degrees

of freedom (Diehr, et al, 1995; Angrist and Hahn, 1999). On the other hand, with few pairs, a chance

association between pair characteristics and treatment status is possible.



IV. Results from the Schools Experiment

        Post-treatment Bagrut rates in treated schools are higher on average than those in control schools,

conditional on baseline (2000) Bagrut rates. This can be seen in Figure 1, which plots 2001 Bagrut rates

against 2000 Bagrut rates, with solid dots representing treated schools, and separate regression lines drawn

through treatment and control observations. The plot incorporates Bagrut data from all 39 schools involved

in the experiment and shows residuals from regressions on Arab and religious school dummies. Although

the figure indicates that average Bagrut rates in 2001 were somewhat unevenly dispersed, the regression line


                                                      18
running through the averages for treated schools is almost everywhere above the regression line running

through the averages for control schools.

        Figure 2 plots the relationship between 2001 and 2000 Bagrut rates by treatment status, after

regression-adjusting for pair effects as well as dummies for Arab and religious schools. Here the dispersion

in 2001 rates is more uniform. The regression lines are necessarily parallel for this specification since the

residuals for each pair sum to zero. But Figure 2 suggests that conditional on 2000 Bagrut rates, treated

schools were likely to have higher 2001 Bagrut rates than control schools. The difference between the two

lines in Figure 2 is about 8.5 percentage points.



A. Estimates Using School Means

        As suggested by the figures, unweighted contrasts in school means show higher 2001 Bagrut rates

in treated than control schools, with no corresponding difference in 2000. This can be seen in the first three

columns of Table 6, which report estimates of equation (2) with no controls, adding school covariates

(dummies for religious and Arab schools), and including school covariates and pair effects. For example,

the uncontrolled difference in 2001 Bagrut rates is .075 in the full sample, though the standard error is almost

as large at .063. Adding controls for school and pair effects increases the difference to .082, with a standard

error of .059. At the same time, treatment-control differences in 2000 are all negative, a specification check

that reinforces the causal interpretation of the 2001 results.15

        The standard errors quoted above (and reported in Table 6 directly below the coefficient estimates)

are conventional least-squares estimates, while those in brackets are heteroscedasticity-corrected. The fact

that the corrected standard errors are substantially below the unadjusted standard errors, with the gap

increasing in the number of covariates, suggests downward bias in the corrected estimates (see, e.g., Chesher

and Jewitt, 1987). We therefore take the unadjusted standard errors as a more reliable measure of precision


        15
          Results for 1999 Bagrut rates are not shown since these are balanced by the experimental design.

                                                        19
for the grouped estimates.

        The balanced and low-rate subsamples generate larger treatment effects than the full sample, again

with no evidence of a treatment-control difference in 2000 data. On the other hand, results from weighted

contrasts in means, reported in columns 4-6, are less clear cut. With no controls, the weighted estimates are

the same in the 2001 and 2000 full sample, a finding that clearly raises questions about the 2001 results. The

picture is somewhat clearer, however, with additional controls and in the balanced and low-rate samples.

For example, the weighted estimate with school covariates and pair effects in the balanced sample is .061

(s.e.=.043) in 2001 and .021 (s.e.=.03) in 2000. The weighted estimate for the balanced sample with school

covariates only, reported in column 5, is .089 (s.e.=.047) in 2001 and .053 in 2000 (.045).

        Note that the generally larger estimated effects (weighted or unweighted) in the balanced and low-

rate samples are consistent with the fact that the compliance rate is 75 percent in the full sample, but 86-87

percent in the balanced and low-rate samples. Thus, we would expect intention-to-treat effects to be about

15 percent larger in the latter two samples, a factor that does not seem too far off the mark. Finally, note that

while the estimates for 2001 increase as we move to the balanced and low-rate samples, this is not typically

the case using 2000 data, providing an encouraging specification check.



B. Estimates Using Student Data

        In an attempt to check robustness and increase the precision of the estimated treatment effects, we

used micro data to control for students’ performance on tests taken as of the baseline date, January 2001.

In particular, we divided the credit-unit-weighted average score on all Bagrut and Diploma tests (coding

zeros for those with no tests), and then coded dummies for each quartile of the score distribution. We used

quartile dummies instead of, say, linear control for lagged scores, to facilitate the analysis conditional on

lagged scores discussed below. The quartile dummies are a powerful predictor of students’ ultimate Bagrut

status. For example, the probability of being awarded a Bagrut 2001 was about 1% in the lowest quartile,


                                                       20
9% in the second quartile, 29% in the third quartile, and 49% in the upper quartile.

         Adjusting for baseline scores using the two-step procedure described above generates more precise

and mostly larger treatment effects than the analysis of group means. For example, the unweighted estimate

from a model with pair effects and school covariates, reported in column 3 of Table 7, is .12 (s.e.=.051). The

weighted estimate falls to .068 (s.e.=.041), but this now contrasts with an estimate for 2000 of only .039

(s.e.=.047). Moreover, the weighted estimates from this specification in the balanced and low-rate samples

show significant treatment effects for 2001 on the order of .07-.08, with no corresponding effect in 2000.

The weighted estimates in the balanced sample also point to a treatment effect when estimated in models with

no controls and school covariates only.16

         The last two columns in Table 7 report estimates of treatment effects in micro data. The standard

errors reported in parentheses use a conventional GEE cluster-adjustment, while BRL standard errors are

shown in brackets. The estimates in column 8 are all significant, even when precision is measured using the

larger BRL standard errors. Estimates in column 7 for the balanced sample are also significant, and again

on the order of 8%. Moreover, none of the micro-data estimates show evidence of a (spurious) treatment

effect in 2000. Interestingly, the BRL standard errors are often close to the unadjusted two-step standard

errors, typically slightly lower, though occasionally slightly higher.

         On balance, the results in Tables 6 and 7 support the notion that the Achievement Awards program

increased Bagrut rates in 2001 by something on the order of 6-8 percentage points (using the smaller

weighted or micro-data estimates). As an additional check on the causal interpretation of these results, we

estimated models allowing treatment effects to vary with lagged score quartiles. That is, we estimated

         yijt = "j + xjtN$ + 3q dqi:q+ 3q*qZjt + ,ijt,                                                                   (4)

         16
           The decline in standard errors when going from grouped to two-step estimates is consistent with fact that
the standard deviation of the estimated :^ jt is about 82 percent of the standard deviation of Gyjt. Note that the ratio of
two-step to grouped standard errors for the weighted full sample is .041/.05 =.82 for the model in column 6. When
constructing standard errors for the two-step estimator we ignore the fact that the micro coefficients, :q, are
estimated using the full sample and therefore the estimated fixed effects are correlated. Since about 1000 students
are available to estimate each quartile effect, this seems likely to be of minor importance.

                                                             21
where *q is a quartile-specific treatment effect and :q is a quartile main effect. Students with very low scores

were unlikely to be able to obtain a Bagrut no matter how hard they tried in the treatment year. On the other

hand, some relatively high-scoring students had scores in a range where extra effort may have made a

difference. We therefore look for significant estimates of *3 and *4 in 2001, but not in 2000.

`       As noted earlier, about half of students in the upper quartile ended up obtaining a Bagrut while

almost no one in the lower quartile did. This can be seen in the pattern of control group means by quartile,

which are reported along with quartile-specific treatment effects in Table 8. The model used for all of the

estimates in this table included school covariates and pair effects, corresponding to the estimates in column

8 of Table 7. Small and insignificant treatment effects were estimated in the first two quartiles, with much

larger and statistically significant estimates in the third and fourth quartiles. Results for 2000 show no

significant effects for any quartile, though the coefficient estimates for 2000 are mostly larger in the third

and fourth quartiles than in the first and second. The absence of a significant effect for any quartile in 2000

and the large positive and significant effects for the upper quartiles in 2001 support the view that the

Achievement Awards program increased Bagrut rates.

        The data used for Tables 6 and 7 and the first 4 columns of Table 8 come from the June 2001 round

of Bagrut tests, i.e., before the Winter retests. We focused on the initial round of test results in the schools

experiment because, as discussed above, the program was disrupted in early summer by adverse publicity.

This seems likely to have reduced the scope for a treatment effect in the retests. A second consideration is

that there was a unexpected round of second-chance Bagrut tests offered in math and English in late

summer/early Fall 2001, between the first round and the traditional Winter round. We are not sure how this

might have affected the Achievement Awards program, but some observers noted that the purpose here

seemed to be to get Bagrut rates up by easing standards. In any case, the last 4 columns of Table 8, which

report estimated treatment effects by quartile using data that incorporates results from the unexpected second

chance and the Winter retests, show results broadly similar to the June results. The largest treatment control


                                                      22
differences appear in the third and fourth quartile, while there are no significant effects in 2000.17 Estimates

for the fourth quartile are somewhat smaller and no longer significant in the full sample, but remain

significant in the balanced and low-rate samples. Estimates for the third quartile are somewhat larger.



V. Conclusions and Further Work

        Although the evidence is not seamless, the school-based randomized trial suggests worthwhile gains

in matriculation rates can be obtained by offering cash awards in low-achieving schools. The value of the

awards was substantial from the point of view of high school seniors, but pales in comparison with the likely

economic benefits of a matriculation certificate. To see this, note that the bonus offer of NIS6,000 shekels

was worth about $1429 at the time the treated cohort finished school. About 27 percent of the treatment

group received bonuses, so the cost was about $385 per treated student. To provide a rough assessments of

the benefits, note that earnings of workers with 11-12 years of schooling in 2000 were about $16,100 (Israel

central Bureau of Statistics, 2002). Those with some college earned 53 percent more. Suppose the causal

effect of a Bagrut is less than half of this, say 25 percent, and that the effect of the program was to raise

Bagrut rates by 7 percentage points. Then the program should increase annual earnings in the treated group

by 16,100 × .25 × .07 = $282 per person per year, so the cost of the bonus will be quickly recovered.

        Another way to benchmark costs and benefits is by comparison with other Bagrut-enhancement

strategies. In the introduction we noted that most service-oriented strategies appear to have been ineffective.

Not long after the Achievement Awards demonstration, however, the Ministry of Education piloted a

relatively expensive service-oriented strategy offering intensive after-school instruction to small groups of

under-performing students in several matriculation subjects. The results of an evaluation point to an 11

percent increase in Bagrut rates for students in the group offered treatment, at an average cost of $1,100 per

student (Israel Ministry of Education, 2002). The after-school program therefore cost almost 3 times as


        17
          The estimates for 2000 in columns 5-8 differ from those in columns 1-4 because, for comparability, the
2000 results used to construct these estimates also include Winter re-tests.

                                                        23
much, while producing an effect only about 50 percent larger.

        In contrast with the school-based bonuses intervention, a smaller pilot program that selected

individual students within schools for treatment, with treatment status determined by previous test scores and

a randomized cutoff for low socioeconomic status, had no effect. This suggests that school-wide

mobilization may be an important part of the incentive structure in programs of this type. On the other hand,

delays and a relatively small sample may also account for the lack of a finding in the pilot.

        On the methodological side, the paper compares alternative strategies for inference in a GRT. A

graphical analysis suggests the program had an effect, albeit heterogeneous and variable across schools.

Statistical analyses of school means generates results with a clear pattern of effects when unweighted, but

more mixed results when weighted. A two-step method that uses micro data to reduce the dispersion of

group averages generates somewhat sharper weighted results than a straight grouped analysis, while bias-

corrected standard errors for micro-data estimates also leave an impression of significant effects. Finally,

conditioning on lagged test scores generates a pattern of estimates consistent with the notion that the program

raised matriculation rates.

        The analysis here covers the immediate short-run impact on the Achievement Awards programs’

target objective, high school matriculation status. In work in progress, we are looking at additional mediating

outcomes, such as whether treated students took more tests or changed subjects, and whether they

participated in remedial instruction. In future work, we hope to assess the long-run effects of the

Achievement Awards program by collecting information on university attendance and possibly earnings.

Finally, we are conducting a detailed Monte Carlo study of alternate modes of inference with school-based

randomized trials.

2. Tests are considered to have been passed if the external component is passed.

3. Only tests in required subjects are eligible for intermediate awards. At the time this program was
introduced (January 2001), the required subjects were Bible (2 units), literature (2 units), history (2 units),
civics (2 units), composition (2 units), english (3 units), mathematics (3 units). The remaining 5 units can
be in any Bagrut-eligible elective subject. Many students, e.g. those competing for admission to selective
universities, obtain more than the minimum number of credit units.

4. Awards for achievement in a given year are to be paid in the following school year.

5. All students in treatment schools are eligible.

6. Students with at least 14 units have two chances to take Bagrut exams in 12th grade. Awards will be given
to those who pass on the first, second, or any subsequent try.

Note: The table describes the experimental design used in the pilot demonstration. The sample of 1247
described in the table is reduced from the full sample of 1302 because of missing covariates. The notation
qx refers to the x -quantile of the distribution of fitted values, p1i or p2i. Quantiles are school specific, so that
about half of the eligible students in each school where offered a bonus.

Notes: The table reports descriptive statistics for three subsamples from the pilot experiment conducted in
Southern Israel. All 146 students with a very low predicted probability of obtaining a Bagrut (p1i) were
offered awards (all-treated sample). None of the 612 students with a high predicted probability of
obtaining a Bagrut were offered awards (no-treated sample). Offers in the middle group, referred to as the
eligible sample, were determined by whether an index of students’ socioeconomic background (p2i) fell
below a randomly assigned threshold determined by Zi. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses in
columns of means. Standard errors are reported in parentheses in column 2.

             Notes: The table reports coefficients on Zi (high/low threshold) in regressions with the
             covariates indicated. The sample size is 489. Columns 4 and 6 report results from models with
             school fixed effects. School clustering is ignored in columns 1,2, & 5. School covariates consist
             of a dummy for religious schools and a dummy for the single Bedouin School.

Notes: The table reports coefficients on Zi (high/low threshold) in regressions using the samples indicated. All models
contain p2ii and school fixed effects, as in column 3 in the previous table. The random-assignment sample consists of
eligible students with p2i in the interval [q.22, q.7], where the offer of a bonus equals the randomly assigned threshold.
The no-first-stage sample has p2ii outside this range, where the offer of a bonus is unrelated to the randomly assigned

  Notes: Columns 1-6 report estimates using school fixed effects from a student-level regression included lagged score quartiles. Conventional
  standard errors are shown in parentheses. Standard errors in brackets are robust (heteroscedasticity-consistent). Columns 7 and 8 report
  regression results using micro data, with controls for lagged score quartiles. Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for school clustering
  using the formulas in Liang and Zeger (1986). Standard errors in braces use MacCaffrey and Bell’s (2002) BRL estimator.

Notes: The table reports estimated treatment effects for early and late Bagrut outcomes. Treatment effects vary by quartile of summary Bagrut scores through
January 2001 or January 2000. Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering using formulas in Liang and Zeger (1986) and in braces using
MacCaffrey and Bell’s (2002) BRL estimator. The models correspond to those in column 8 of Table 7 (control for school covariates and pair effects).
