       The rapid aging of the population creates substantial financing problems for existing
pay-as-you-go Social Security programs. Governments around the world are therefore
considering shifting completely or partially to investment-based defined contribution plans in
which employees contribute a fraction of their wages to individual accounts, invest the funds
in a combination of stocks and bonds, and use the accumulated assets to finance a retirement
annuity. Some governments have already made this shift. Such prefunded programs offer the
prospect of financing future retirement benefits with substantially smaller sacrifices during
working years than the taxes that would be required in traditional unfunded pay-as-you-go
(“paygo”) programs. They have the potential disadvantage, however, of exposing retirees to
the uncertainty associated with the variable returns on stocks and bonds. Despite the
importance of this issue, there has been no analysis of the magnitude of the risk to which
retirees would be exposed in a system of individual defined contribution accounts.
       The analysis in this paper takes the pay-as-you-go benefits promised in current law
(essentially a continuation of current replacement rates) as the benchmark and shows that
the risk that future retirees would receive less than this “benchmark” level of benefits in a
pure defined contribution system would be relatively small at saving rates that are
substantially less than the future paygo tax rate required to fund that benchmark level of
benefits. This pure investment-based plan is an extreme case; the investment risk can be
reduced by using a mixed system that combines pay-as-you-go and investment based
components or that makes intergenerational transfers conditional on the performance of stock
and bond prices (Feldstein and Ranguelova, 1998).

1      Defined Contributions vs. Defined Benefits
Samuelson (1958) established the well known result that individuals in a paygo system earn
an implicit rate of return in a steady state equilibrium equal to the real rate of growth of the
social security tax base, i.e., the sum of the growth rates of the labor force and real wages.
The introduction of a new paygo plan provides an immediate windfall to those who are
already retired or who will soon retire because they receive benefits with little or no previous

                                              -1-
contributions. Subsequent increases in benefits financed by higher tax rates provide similar
windfalls to those who are then retired or soon to be retired. When program expansions can
no longer provide such windfall gains, the implicit return of a paygo program eventually
decreases to the Samuelsonian rate of aggregate wage growth. For the United States, this
has averaged 2.5 percent over the past 30 years.
       The return earned by any particular birth cohort will vary from the steady state rate
in response to changes in the ratio of retirees to workers caused by changes in labor force
participation, birth rates and death rates, and in the ratio of taxable wages to total
compensation including fringe benefits. Caldwell et. al. (1998) estimate that current Social
Security rules imply that the real rate of return on Social Security contributions will be 2.4
percent for the generation born right after World War II but only about 1 percent for those
born in the 1970s and essentially zero for those born at the end of the 1990s. Because of the
aging of the population, the Social Security actuaries (Board of Trustees, 1998) estimate that
the current 12.4 percent tax rate will have to increase to more than 18 percent by the year
2035 to maintain the current benefit-wage replacement rates.
       This combination of the low implied rate of return for current and future taxpayers
and the prospect of a substantial increase in future Social Security tax rates has stimulated
interest in investment-based alternatives to the current pay-as-you-go system. The
fundamental economic difference between the two approaches is that the investment based
system involves an initial reduction of national consumption and a concurrent increase in the
national capital stock. The rate of return in an investment-based plan is therefore the
marginal product of capital, a number substantially greater than the rate of growth of
aggregate wages. Note that the relative advantage of an investment based plan depends on
the marginal product of capital relative to the growth rate of wages and not on the return on
equity investments relative to the return on government bonds, as some have suggested.
       A simplified calculation indicates the large effect of this difference in rates of return on
the cost of funding retirement benefits. Assume an overlapping generations framework in


                                               -2-
which there are T years between generations. In the paygo system, individuals receive
benefits T years after they pay tax; in the investment-based system, individuals spend their
accumulated assets T years after they make the savings deposit. If the implicit rate of return
in a paygo system is denoted γ = n + g here n is the growth rate of the labor force and g is

the rate of growth of average wages, the Samuelson (1958) analysis implies that each dollar of
retirement income at time T requires a tax payment of exp(− γT ) dollars at the earlier

contribution date. Similarly, if ✣ is the marginal product of capital, each dollar of retirement
income at T requires a contribution to the personal retirement account (PRA) of exp(− ρT )

at the contribution date. The ratio of the PRA contribution to the paygo tax payment to
finance the same benefit T years later is exp(γ − ρ )T . With ✏ = 0.025, ✣ = 0.085 and T = 30

years, exp(γ − ρ )T = 0.165, i.e., each dollar of tax payment required in a paygo system can be

replaced by just 16.5 cents in a funded program with an 8.5 percent rate of return. The 18
percent future payroll tax rate projected by the Social Security Administration could in
principle be replaced by a funded program with mandatory contributions equal to 3.0 percent
of earnings.
        This comparison of the potential long-run gains from switching to an investment-based
      1
system ignores not only the risk issues that are the subject of this paper but also questions
about (1) how the paygo benefits are financed during the transition to an investment based
system, (2) the administrative costs of an investment based plan, and (3) the distributional
consequences of substituting an investment based plan for the existing paygo system. These
issues are discussed extensively elsewhere (Diamond (1997), Feldstein (1996), Feldstein and
Samwick (1997, 1998a,1998b), Kotlikoff (1998), Shoven (1999), and Feldstein and Liebman
(1999)) and will not be considered here.

 There is a present value gain at the time of the switch if corporate and personal capital income taxes cause the
net-of-tax rate at which individuals discount future consumption to be less than the marginal product of capital.
 There is no present value gain if this tax wedge is ignored and the rate of discount is assumed equal to the
marginal product of capital; see Murphy and Welch (1998) and Geanakoplos, Mitchell and Zeldes (1998).

2      An Investment-Based Defined Contribution Plan with
Variable Annuity Benefits
       This section describes the system of Personal Retirement Accounts in which a
representative individual accumulates assets that are converted to a variable rate annuity at
the time of retirement. Individuals who die before retirement remain in the annuity pool
(although alternative bequest rules are possible, as explained in Feldstein and Ranguelova
(1999).) The representative individual enters the labor force at age 21 and retires at age 67 (if
he or she is still alive). For the sake of concreteness, we use the economic and demographic
projections of the Social Security Administration (Board of Trustees, 1998) for the cohort
reaching age 21 in 1998. We assume that the representative individual has his birth cohort’s
average earnings at each age and experiences the cohort’s age-specific mortality rates.
       In the defined benefit plan specified in the current Social Security law, an individual
with such average earnings experience would receive a benefit at age 67 for himself equal to
40 percent of his immediate preretirement wage. The full defined benefit benchmark in our
simulations is a multiple of this amount that reflects benefits for a spouse or other
dependants as well as disability benefits. Instead of modeling such additional benefits
explicitly, we use a multiple of the individual benefit such that the implied aggregate Social
Security benefits in each year beginning in 2030 is equal to the aggregate benefit projected by
the Social Security Administration. The aggregate benefits projected in this way together
with the aggregate wage income projected by the Social Security Administration (Board of
Trustees, 1998) imply that the paygo tax rate required to pay benefits will be 18.4 percent
when the cohort that we study retires (in contrast to the current tax rate of 12.4 percent).
These assumptions about future defined benefits do not affect the projected behavior of the
defined contribution annuities but provide a benchmark for comparing the relative costs of
defined benefit and defined contribution programs.



                                               -4-
       With a defined contribution plan, the individual contributes a fixed percentage of
wages in each year to a Personal Retirement Account (PRA); we will examine the
implications of different saving rates from 4 percent to 9 percent (i.e., up to half of the long-
run paygo tax rate of 18.4 percent). The individual invests these savings in a portfolio that is
continually rebalanced to maintain 60 percent equities and 40 percent debt, a ratio that
corresponds approximately to the debt-equity ratio of U.S. corporations so that the portfolio
rate of return corresponds to the return on corporate capital without considerations of the
relative yields on debt and equity. At retirement, these accumulated assets are used to
finance a variable annuity in which annual benefits vary with portfolio performance in a way
described below.
       We use the S&P500 index and a Salomon Brothers corporate bond index as proxies for
the stock and bond investments. Both indices are assumed to follow a geometric random walk
with drift. his implies that the log returns for each type of asset are serially independent and
identically distributed with given mean and variance. Thus if pe (s) and pb (s) are the log
levels of the equity and bond indices at time s, we assume pe (s) = pe (s-1) + ✙e+ ue (s) and
pb (s) = pb (s-1) + ✙b+ ub (s) where ue ~ iid N (0, ✤ e) and ub ~ iid N (0, ✤ b). The covariance
                                                     2                       2



between the stock and bond returns is ✤e b .
       With a continuously compounded 60:40 equity-debt portfolio, the log level of the
overall portfolio would, if there were no additions or payments, satisfy p (s) = p (s-1) + ✙ +
u (s) with u ~ iid N (0, ✤ ). (In practice, the value of the PRA portfolio is also increased by
                          2



the annual savings of a fraction of the individual’s wage plus the distributed share of the
PRA balances of all those members of the age cohort who die during the previous year; the
explicit evolution is shown below.) To derive the values of ✙ and ✤.2 we use the lognormal
property of the returns. More specifically, if ✙*i, is the mean return on asset i in level form,
the mean return on the 60:40 portfolio is the weighted average ✙* = 0.6 ✙e + 0.4 ✙b* .
Because we assume the log returns to be normally distributed,
✙i = ✙i + 0.5 ✤ i . This implies that ✙ + 0.5 ✤ = 0.6 (✙e + 0.5 ✤ e) + 0.4 (✙b + 0.5 ✤ b) where
                2                              2                   2                   2




                                               -5-
✤ = 0.36 ✤ e + 0.16 ✤ b + 0.48 ✤e b. From these two equations and the measured mean and
    2         2            2



variance of the log returns on stocks and bonds we can derive the log return on the portfolio
and the variance of that return.
          The CRSP data for the postwar period from 1946 through 1995 imply that for stocks
and bonds the mean real log rates of return were 7.0 percent and 3.3 percent.2 The
corresponding standard deviations are 16.6 percent for stocks and 10.4 percent for bonds.
The covariance of the stock and bond returns is ✤eb = 0.0081.                       Taken together, these
parameters imply a logarithmic rate of return on the 60:40 portfolio of 5.9 percent with a
standard deviation of 12.5 percent. We reduce the mean return from 5.9 percent to 5.5
percent to reflect potential administrative costs, more than the 0.2 percent charged now by
major index funds or the 37 basis point fee for the combined saving and variable annuity
product recently introduced by TIAA-CREF.
          In the analysis that follows, we recognize that the adjusted mean real log return of 5.5
percent for the portfolio during the period from 1946 through 1995 is only an estimate of the
relevant mean for future years. Our stochastic simulation therefore uses a two step procedure
    to simulate the uncertain future annual returns. For each of 10,000 simulations, we begin by
generating a mean real log return on the portfolio from a normal distribution with a mean of
0.055 and a standard deviation of 0.0175 which is equal to the standard error of the

2
  The mean portfolio return is essentially unchanged if we use a longer time period from 1926 to 1997. The
annual bond rates of return are based on the Salomon Brothers AAA bond returns adjusted to a more typical
corporate bond yield by adding two percentage points. Although there are no comparable data on the annual
holding period return of lower grade bonds, the variance of such bond yields would presumably be higher and
the correlation with equity yields would also differ. We do not attempt to take these into account. The effect of
ignoring this would almost certainly be small relative to the understatement of the mean return that results
from ignoring the additional corporate tax revenue that the government receives because of the increased capital
stock. Estimates by Poterba (1997) imply that the corporate taxes on capital and capital income collected by
federal, state and local governments is equivalent to 3.4 percent of the incremental capital. The federal
corporate tax alone is equivalent to an additional 2.2 percent per cent return. Although a specific mechanism for
crediting these taxes is not considered in this paper, they should be recognized as part of the return of an
investment based system. See Feldstein and Ranguelova (1998) for a more complete analysis of this corporate
tax revenue.

estimated mean based on the number of years in the sample. We then use this estimated
realization of the mean and the standard deviation of 0.125 to generate a 71 year sequence of
portfolio returns from the year 2000 to 2070. We repeat this 10,000 times.
         Although the equation for p(s) describes the way that the logarithmic value of the
PRA account would evolve during the accumulation years if there were no external additions,
in practice the actual individual PRA account is also augmented by the fraction ..of the
individual’s wage and by the distributed share of the PRA balances of those members of the
cohort who die during the year. We simulate this evolution at the level of the birth cohort
(rather than of the individual) by: M(s) = [ 1 + R (s-1) ] M(s-1) + ✍ w(s) N(s) where M(s) is
the aggregate PRA balance for the cohort as a whole, R(s) is the rate of return in period s,
N(s) is the number of living members of the cohort, w(s) is average wage and ✍ is the share
of wages that is saved and contributed to the PRA accounts. Since this equation is in level
rather than logarithmic form, the value of 1 + R(s) = exp [r(s)] where r(s) is the logarithmic
rate of return in period s implied by r(s) = p(s) - p (s-1) = ✙ + u(s). Note that E[r(s)] =
0.055 and the standard deviation of r(s) = 0.125 imply that E[1+R(s)] = E[er(s)] = eE[r(s)]+0.5✤2 =
1.065.



2.1 The Variable Annuity
         We assume that this same stock-bond portfolio is used to finance the variable annuity
during retirement. A variable annuity adjusts the annual benefit according to the changes in
the value of the accumulation account. More specifically, the initial annuity benefit that is
paid at age 67 (on an annuity purchased at age 66) reflects the PRA assets at the beginning
                         th
of the individual’s 66        year, the expected mortality rates at all future ages, and the
assumption that the future return will be equal to the expected log return of 5.5 percent. No
adjustment in the rate        of return is needed to compensate for the uncertainty because the
individual retirees bear the risk of fluctuations in the rate of return.
         One year later, the size of the variable annuity payment is increased or decreased from


                                                -7-
the initial value in proportion to the change in the market value of the PRA assets relative to
the market value that would have prevailed if the expected 5.5 percent log return had
actually occurred. A similar revision of the annual annuity payment occurs in each
subsequent year.
       To derive the explicit value of the variable annuity, consider the individuals in a
particular birth cohort. Let the time index coincide with the age of the cohort so that Nt is
the number of individuals alive at age t. Let A66 be the be the value of the PRA assets at the
                   th
beginning of the 66 year and let R be the expected annual real rate of return on the
portfolio of assets used to finance the retirement annuity. The first annuity benefit is paid at
the beginning of the individual’s 67th year and annually thereafter. The cost at age 66 of a
fixed real annuity of $1 for life (i.e., an annuity that starts with $1 and grows in proportion
to the level of consumer prices) is the actuarial present value (APV) of that dollar with the
discount rate equal to the expected real rate of return on the investment portfolio:
                                      100
                                               Nt
                              APV =   ∑N
                                      t = 67
                                                     (1 + R) −(t −66 )
                                                66

                                                                              th
where we assume that all individuals alive at age 99 die at the end of the 100 year.
       Since the PRA account has assets equal to A66 when the annuity is established, the
                                                                                          A66
annual annuity payment that the individual would receive in the 67th year is a 67 =
                                                                                         APV
if the expected return of R is actually realized in the 66th year. More generally, if the expected
return R is realized in every future year, the individual would continue to receive that same
annuity payment and the accumulated assets at age 66 of all members of that birth cohort
would be exhausted when the last member of the cohort dies at age 100.
       In practice, of course, the actual rate of return varies from year to year. The annuity
payments are adjusted in proportion to the annual changes in the asset value in such a way
that the birth cohort’s accumulated fund is still exhausted over the 34 year retirement period.
If Rt is the actual rate of increase of the asset value during year t, the asset value at the
beginning of the cohort’s 67th year is A67 = A(1 + R66 ) . The annuity paid in that year is

                                                       -8-
                   A66 1 + R66
therefore a67 =        ×       . Similarly the annuity at age 68 reflects the changes in the
                  APV 1 + R
market value of the assets during the 66th and 67th years:
                                         1 + R67   A    1 + R67 1 + R66
                           a 67 = a 66           = 66 ×        ×        .
                                          1+ R    APV 1 + R      1+ R
                                                                   1 + R99
The last payment to those who are 100 years old is a100 = a 99             . Note that if the rate of
                                                                    1+ R
return in each period is equal to the expected rate of return the annuity remains constant at
a 67 .

3        Individual Risk in a Defined Contribution Plan
         In this section we assess the risk that an individual will receive an unacceptably low
retirement annuity in an investment-based defined contribution plan. More specifically, we
estimate the distribution of annuity values associated with different PRA saving rates and
relate those annuity levels to the benefits currently promised in the Social Security defined
benefit paygo system. We refer to this level of future benefits promised in current law as the
“benchmark” Social Security benefits, mindful of the fact that these benefits could only be
provided in a paygo system by increasing taxes substantially and that there are many
proposals to reduce actual future benefits. We use these calculations to assess the extent to
which individuals can reduce the risk of receiving a low annuity by using a higher saving rate
while still saving less than the amount that would be paid in taxes in a pure paygo system.
         Before examining the implications of the uncertain portfolio returns, it is useful to
note the saving rate that would be required to fund the future benchmark Social Security
benefits if the representative individual received the mean log return of 5.5 percent during
both the preretirement accumulation and the retirement annuity. The annuity is calibrated to
correspond not only to the benefit of the individual retiree but also to include dependents’
benefits and disability benefits in a way that matches the projected aggregate OASDI
benefits (as described above). The payroll tax required to finance these benefits in a pure
paygo program is projected to rise to 18.4 percent of earnings as the ratio of retirees to

                                                   -9-
employees increases. In contrast, a 3.1 percent saving rate (as a percentage of the same total
earnings) would provide the same benefits in a defined contribution plan with a 5.5 percent
rate of return.
       The variability of portfolio returns implies that saving this amount will produce a
retirement annuity that may either exceed or fall short of the benchmark Social Security
benefit. To assess the probability distribution of the annuities, we generate the 10,000
simulations described above of the 80 year sequence of portfolio returns corresponding to the
years when the members of the birth cohort are aged 21 through 100. For each of these
10,000 time series, we generate the path of PRA assets and variable annuity payments
corresponding to different saving rates from 4 percent of earnings to 9 percent of earnings.
       With a saving rate of 4 percent of earnings the median annuity at age 67 (in the
10,000 simulations) is 41 percent more than the benchmark Social Security benefit; see
column 1of Table 1. In 66 percent of the simulations the annuity at age 67 (a 67 ) exceeds the

benchmark Social Security benefit. But in the worst 10 percent of the simulations, the
annuity is less than 52 percent of the benchmark Social Security benefit. Because of this risk
of a low annuity, it would be prudent for individuals to save a higher fraction of earnings.
       Before looking at the implication of increasing the saving rate, consider the
corresponding annuity distributions for older retirees. The median ratio of the defined
contribution annuity to the benchmark Social Security benefit declines gradually as the
cohort ages (1.41 at age 67, 1.30 at age 77, and 1.22 at age 87) but remains substantially
greater than 100 percent of the benchmark. Similarly, the fraction of times that the annuity
would exceed the benchmark Social Security benefit decreases monotonically with age: from
66 percent at age 67 to 56 percent at age 87. The annuity level at the tenth percentile also
becomes lower as the cohort ages, declining from 52 percent of the benchmark Social Security
benefit at age 67 to 37 percent of benefits at age 77, 27 percent at age 87. It is clear from
these figures that it would be desirable to consider a higher saving rate during working years.
       Increasing the saving rate to 6 percent achieves a very substantial reduction in the


                                             -10-
risk of low benefits as well as an increase in the size of the annuity associated with average
portfolio performance. The median annuity at age 67 is now 2.12 times the benchmark Social
Security benefit; see column 2 of Table 1. Since the benchmark benefit for an individual
retiree is about 40 percent of preretirement earnings, this corresponds to a replacement rate
of 85 percent of preretirement earnings.
       The six percent saving rate reduces the probability that the annuity at age 67 is less
than the benchmark Social Security benefit to 17 percent. There is only a 5 percent chance
that the age 67 annuity is less than 61 percent of the benchmark Social Security benefit.
       Increasing the saving rate to 9 percent (still less than half of the projected pay-as-you-
go tax rate) raises the distribution of benefits substantially. There is less than a 10 percent
chance that the benefit is less than 1.1 times the benchmark level and less than a 5 percent
chance that it is less than 92 percent of the benchmark benefit.
       This favorable performance continues at older ages. The median annuity is nearly
twice the benchmark Social Security benefit at age 77, and 1.83 times the benchmark at age
87. The probability of receiving an annuity that is less than the benchmark benefit remains
low, rising from 17 percent at age 67 to less than 31 percent at 87.
       In considering these favorable distributions, it is worth emphasizing that the paygo tax
required to finance the benchmark Social Security benefits that are used as the standard of
comparison will rise to more than 18 percent during the next 40 years. Individuals could
instead achieve much higher expected benefits and face only very little risk of lower benefits
while saving substantially less than the long-run paygo tax rate.



3.1 A CRRA Expected Utility Evaluation
       Although we believe that displaying the probability distributions of possible outcomes,
as we do in Table 1, is the best way to indicate the risks and rewards of the alternative
investment-based options, we now present explicit summary calculations based on expected
values of constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility functions. To evaluate the PRA

                                              -11-
options presented in Table 1, we consider a representative individual with expected utility
function

                                                     C t1−γ − 1
where Ε is the expectation operator, u (C t ) =                 with ✏ here being the coefficient of

relative risk aversion, p t is the probability of surviving to age t from age 21, ✎ is the time

discount factor at which utility is discounted, and ✏ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
We do the analysis with a time discount factor of 0.98; alternative calculations with a greater
time discount (✎ = 0.96) and with no time discount factor (✎ = 1) have very little effect on
the results that we report below. We recognize the restrictive nature of this specification.

                                                                                     u '' c
The function is additively separable and the relative risk aversion in each period, − ' = γ ,
                                                                                      u
is a constant and is independent of age. Despite these limitations, these calculations may be
useful to some readers as a supplement to the direct information of Table 1.
       We evaluate this function for a representative agent who is age 21 in 1998. The
individual earns the age specific wage for this cohort projected by the Social Security
actuaries and pays a proportional income tax equal to 20 percent of that wage. With a 6
percent rate of PRA saving, the net income during the working years from age 21 to age 66 is
74 percent of the gross wage. (Although we are looking at officially projected wages beginning
in 1998l, to avoid the complexities of modeling the transition we compare a fully phased in
PRA system with the paygo system that would exist in the more distant future.) The
individual is assumed to do no other saving, making the consumption in each preretirement
year the same 74 percent of pretax wages, a feature that makes the individual’s utility more
sensitive to fluctuations in the return to PRA saving. During retirement the individual’s
consumption is the variable annuity that is generated by the PRA savings, as described in
section 2.1 above. Similar simulations are done also for PRA plans with saving rates of 4


                                                  -12-
percent and 9 percent. We contrast each of these to a paygo system in which the tax rate is
18 percent, making the net consumption during the preretirement years equal to 62 percent
of preretirement income. This paygo system is assumed to provide the benchmark level of
benefits prescribed in current law during each retirement year with no uncertainty.
        The coefficient of relative risk aversion is the key parameter in this expected utility
evaluation. The values of inferred in the finance literature from the difference between the
yields on stocks and on “risk free” treasury bills are implausibly high, giving rise to the label
                        3
“equity premium puzzle.” Instead of using these implausibly high values, we use the following
mental experiment to help decide on appropriate CRRA values.
        The representative individual in our example will reach age 67 in the year 2044 and
will be retired during the decades that follow. The level of retirement consumption that the
PRA will provide at that time might be conservatively approximated to be $40,000 in today’s
prices; the precise level does not matter for our example. Consider two equally probable
states of nature. In the good state the retiree has income and consumption of $40,000. In the
bad state, it is only $20,000. In the mental experiment, we give the individual the
opportunity to increase consumption in the bad state by one dollar by agreeing to reduce
consumption if the good state occurs. We can infer the individual’s CRRA ✏ coefficient by
observing how much the individual would be willing to give up in the good state to increase
consumption in the bad state by one dollar.
        Any risk averse individual (✏ > 0) would be willing to give up more than a dollar in
the good state for a dollar in the bad state. If the individual would give up two dollars in the
good state, but no more, to increase consumption in the bad state by one dollar, we infer that
u ' = (20,000) = 2 u ' =(40,000). Since the CRRA form noted above implies u ' (c ) = C 1−γ , the
                                                                                                             .

  See for example Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Kocherlakota (1996). The difference between the equity yield
and the yield on Treasury bills has of course declined in recent years, implying a lower measure of risk aversion.
If the “riskless” security is taken to be an asset with no credit risk and with a guaranteed long-term real return,
the comparison should be the recently created Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. These TIPS now have a
yield of about 4 percent, not that different from the earnings-price ratio on equities.

condition that u ' = (20,000) = 2 u ' =(40,000) implies that 2✏ = 2 or ✏ = 1.
        Similarly, we can infer that if the representative individual is willing to give up four
dollars of consumption in the good state (when consumption would otherwise be $40,000) to
have an additional dollar of consumption in the bad state when consumption would otherwise
be $20,000, the coefficient of CRRA becomes ✏ = 2. And a representative individual who
would give up eight dollars in the good state for one extra dollar in the bad state has a
CRRA value of ✏ = 3.
        Readers can decide how much is reasonable to assume that someone would give up
when income is $40,000 for a dollar when the income would otherwise be $20,000. Without
choosing a specific value, we believe that the plausible sacrifice amount would be less than
eight dollars and probably less than four dollars, i.e.,✏ < 3 and probably ✏ < 2.
                                                                                                    4



        We drew 10,000 independent histories of the 80-year sequence (from age 21 in 1998 to
age 100 in 2077) of returns on the PRA savings of the representative individual and
calculated the expected utility value associate with each value of ✏. Our calculations show
that the PRA with a 6 percent mandatory saving rate is preferable to the paygo for the
relative risk aversion coefficient up to ✏ = 3.4. With a 4 percent saving rate the critical value
of ✏ is 2.95 while with a 9 percent saving rate the PRA system is preferred to paygo for all
values of ✏ less than 3.85.
        The comparison of the expected lifetime utilities of the PRA and the paygo systems
reflects time preference as well as risk preference. During the individuals’ working years, the
paygo requires an 18 percent tax while the PRA only involves a saving rate of between 4
percent and 9 percent. Differences in time preference (in our analysis) therefore influence the
relative desirability of the two options. To abstract from this and focus just on the difference

  These values of gamma do not imply enough risk aversion to explain why some households do not invest in
equities. However, many individuals may not because the cost of learning how to invest in equities exceeds the
extra return on their very small amount of financial assets. Half of U.S. households approach retirement age
with less than $12,000 in financial assets. With $10,000 of investable funds, the extra real return from investing
in equities might be about $400 a year.

between the presumed-certain paygo benefit and the stochastic PRA annuity, we apply the
expected utility calculation just to the incomes in the retirement years. In other words, we
disregard the PRA system’s advantage of requiring much lower contributions during working
years than the 18 percent paygo tax. With a saving rate of 6 percent, the median PRA
annuity is substantially greater than the benchmark benefit; table 1 shows that the median
PRA annuity at age 67 is 2.12 times the benchmark benefit. Although there is a 17 percent
chance that the PRA annuity will fall below the benchmark benefit at age 67 (and a greater
chance at higher ages), the explicit utility evaluation starting at age 67 shows that the
stochastic PRA annuity is preferred to the “certain” paygo benefit for all CRRA coefficients
up to 2.4. With a four percent saving rate this critical value of becomes 1.6 while with a
saving rate of 9 percent the PRA option is preferred for all values of up to 3.1. In short, for
plausible CRRA risk aversion parameters, the preference for the PRA option does not depend
on the lower contribution during the working years.



4      Concluding Remarks
       This paper examines the risk aspects of an investment-based defined contribution
Social Security plan. We focus on the risks after the plan is fully phased in so that all
employees and retirees are participants in the plan. To be concrete, we base our calculations
on the detailed projections of economic and demographic variables by the Social Security
Administration and the Census Bureau for the 80 year period beginning in 1998. We assume
that the new defined contribution program begins with the birth cohort that is 21 in 1998.
       In this plan, individuals are required to deposit a specified fraction of wages to a
Personal Retirement Account, invest these funds in a 60:40 equity-debt mix, and in a
similarly invested variable annuity at age 67. The value of the assets in the Personal
Retirement Accounts follows a random walk with the mean and variance of a 60:40 equity-
debt portfolio over the period from 1946 to 1995, a mean log return of 5.5 percent (net of
administrative costs of 0.4 percent) and a standard deviation of 12.5 percent. We study

                                             -15-
stochastic distributions of this process by doing 10,000 simulations of the 80 year experience
from 1998 to 2077.
       The resulting annuities are compared to the future defined benefits promised in the
current Social Security law, a level that we refer to as the “benchmark” Social Security
benefits. The Social Security actuaries calculate that the aging of the population and
increased longevity imply that the future Social Security payroll tax required to finance the
benchmark benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis would be greater than 18 percent.
       If the 5.5 percent mean log rate of return were known with certainty, individuals could
purchase the benchmark level of benefits by saving 3.1 percent of earnings, just one-sixth of
the required tax in the pay-as-you-go plan. But the uncertain nature of the rate of return
implies that saving 3.1 percent of wages could produce an annuity that is unacceptably less
than the benchmark benefits.
       Saving a higher share of wages provides a “cushion” that protects the individual from
the risk of an unacceptably low level of benefits. For example, an individual who saves 6
percent of his earnings during his working years from 21 to 66 (with a 5.5 percent mean log
return) has a 50 percent chance of receiving an annuity at age 67 that is at least 2.1 times
the benchmark level of Social Security benefits (and therefore about 70 percent of
preretirement pretax wages) and only a 17 percent chance that that annuity is less than the
benchmark Social Security benefit. In 95 percent of the investment experience the annuity
exceeds 61 percent of the benchmark benefit. A pure defined contribution plan with a 6
percent saving rate invested in a 60:40 equity-debt Personal Retirement Account can cut the
individual’s cost of providing a retirement annuity to one-third of the projected 18 percent
pay-as-you go tax while leaving the retiree exposed to relatively little risk that the resulting
annuity will be less than the benchmark level of Social Security benefits projected in current
