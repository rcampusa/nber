I examine academic performance and college going for public school students affected by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita. Students who are forced to switch schools due to the hurricanes experience sharp
declines in test scores in the first year following the hurricane. However, by the second and third years
after the disaster, Katrina evacuees displaced from Orleans Parish appear to benefit from the displacement,
experiencing a .15 standard deviation improvement in scores. The test score gains are concentrated
among students whose initial schools were in the lowest quintile of the test score distribution and among
students who leave the New Orleans MSA. Katrina evacuees from suburban areas and Rita evacuees
(from the Lake Charles area) eventually recover most of the ground lost during 05-06 but do not experience
long term gains relative to their pre-Katrina test scores. High school age Orleans evacuees have higher
college enrollment rates than their predecessors from the same high schools. Meanwhile, Katrina
evacuees from the suburbs experience a 3.5 percentage point drop in their rate of enrollment in four
year colleges. Those evacuees do not to make up for the decline in the subsequent two years. Later
cohorts of suburban New Orleans evacuees are unaffected. The results suggest that for students in
the lowest performing schools, the long term gains to achievement from switching schools can more
than offset even substantial costs of disruption.

I.         Introduction


           One of the many effects of Hurricane Katrina was to close temporarily and later to force the

reconstitution of schools in one of the nation's worst performing urban school districts. Many have

speculated that there may be a silver lining to the disaster in that adults were forced to exit a poor

labor market and students were forced to exit a poor performing school system. 1 A central question

in today's debate over the future of public education is whether failing schools should be shuttered

and their students enrolled elsewhere. But as of the time of this writing, few states and school

districts have taken such extreme measures. Hurricane Katrina may provide some insight into how

student outcomes evolve when schools are shut down and students are sent to different and in most

cases better performing schools.                Obviously the analogy is not a perfect one since Katrina

evacuees faced more sources of disruption than a simple school change. But in a sense, the

estimates provided here may be a lower bound on the positive effects that would be observed if

Orleans students were merely moved to different schools without all the other associated shocks.

Additionally, one of the motivations for the Moving to Opportunity experiments (Katz Kling and

Liebman [2001] and Ludwig, Duncan and Hirschfield [2001]) is that students may benefit from a

change in neighborhood and schools. And the experience of Katrina provides another shock that

we can contrast and compare to the experience of MTO movers.



           Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters in United States history. Roughly

1900 deaths are blamed on Katrina and estimates of the damage to homes and infrastructure are

roughly $80 billion. In addition, as of 2008, roughly $60 billion in Federal money has been

                                                                                                      2
allocated for disaster relief and recovery 2. Because Katrina destroyed so many homes and flooded

80% of New Orleans, nearly 1 million people were displaced from their homes. Thirty five

thousand Katrina evacuees relocated to Houston, Texas while 24,000 relocated to Mobile, Alabama

and 15,000 people moved to Baton Rouge. Rand Corporation estimates that of Louisiana's 760,000

public school students (pre-Katrina and Rita), 196,000 were displaced from their schools (Pane et

al. 2006).



         This paper is a first attempt at analyzing the long term effects of dislocation from Katrina

and Rita on student achievement and college going. 3 The data are provided by the Louisiana

Department of Education and include reading and math test scores, basic student demographics,

school and school district for each student in each year and whether or not the student was

displaced by Hurricane Katrina or Rita. Data from the National Student Clearinghouse are used to

track four cohorts of high school students who reached high school graduation age pre-and post

Katrina.



         The existing literature suggests at least two different effects that may be at work. First, the

literature on the disruptive effects of moving schools (e.g. Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin [2004],

Alexander Norc and Entwistle [1996]) would suggest modest sized negative effects from switching

schools.     Having one's family displaced by a hurricane is likely far more disruptive than a

conventional move between schools. Vigdor [2007] estimates that evacuees on average lost three

weeks of work and that evacuees who do not return home lost closer to ten weeks of work. Pane et

  After starting this research, I learned of Pane at al [2008], part of which looks at the effects on test scores in the first
year following the hurricanes. Results on peer effects on non-movers in Lousiana and Houston, Texas will be
forthcoming in joint work by Scott Imberman , Adriana Kugler and me.


                                                                                                                            3
al [2006] finds that the median student evacuee missed five weeks of school. Second, the literature

on school quality and teacher quality (for example Rivkin Kain and Hanushek [2005], Kane,

Staiger Rockoff [2006]) would suggest that some New Orleans natives could actually benefit from

being forced to move out of their low performing schools. The motivating question for this paper

is whether the severe costs imposed by moving students from low performing to different schools

can be offset by any gains. 4



         I attempt to look this question by using disruption by Katrina and Rita as the key source of

variation.     On average, Katrina evacuees from Orleans Parish experience many sources of

disruption and a large increase in school quality as measured by average test scores. Rita evacuees

and Katrina from New Orleans suburbs (Jefferson, Saint Bernard, Saint Tammany, Plaquemines

Parishes) experience similar disruptions without large changes in average school quality.



         In the spring of 2006, following the hurricanes, I find reasonably large (.10 to .25 standard

deviation) declines in test scores for all students who are displaced by the hurricanes. 5 These

declines are relative to all other Louisiana students in the same grade and are consistent with Pane

at al [2008]. For students from suburban New Orleans (Jefferson Parish) and Lake Charles (in

Calcasieu Parish), the negative effect moderates gradually during 2007 and 2008.



         In contrast, students from Orleans Parish see the negative effect of the hurricane disappear

fully by 2007. And by 2008 these students are experiencing gains of .10-.20 standard deviations

4
  Of course these hurricanes were such massive events that studying the impacts may be interesting in its own right
whether or not we can use the impacts from the hurricanes to inform the educational literature more broadly.
5
  This effect is roughly 1-2x the size of being assigned a teach with test score value added that is one standard deviation
below the mean of all teachers in a state. (Kane, Staiger Rockoff [2008] and Hanushek Kain O'Brien and Rivkin
[2005]).


                                                                                                                         4
relative to their pre-Hurricane test score. This suggests that long run academic achievement for

Orleans students might have been improved by the closing of their schools and the forced move

that this implied. Presumably any improvement in achievement comes on top of all the challenges

that evacuees and their families faced.



           College enrollment was disrupted for evacuees in graduating classes just prior and just after

the hurricanes, i.e. the classes of 2005 and 2006. Evacuees from suburban New Orleans see a

reduction of 3.5 percentage points in their rate of college going. 6 And the negative effect for these

cohorts appears to be permanent rather than temporary in nature. But the subsequent cohort, ie the

class of 2007, does not show signs of the same effect. Evacuees from Orleans parish (i.e. the City

of New Orleans) see very small negative effects, and when measured relative to other Lousiana

students, the Orleans evacuees actually have statistically significant gains in college enrollment.




           The Existing Literature on Hurricane Katrina



           Several papers have examined labor market effects from Hurricane Katrina. One of the

most in depth of these is Vigdor [2007] which asks whether evacuees benefit in the medium run

from being forced out of New Orleans which was high in poverty and unemployment and had

lower income than other cities in the South. This hypothesis is similar in spirit to the investigations

of the Moving to Opportunity Program (Katz Kling and Liebman [2001]) and the demolitions of

public housing in Chicago (Jacob [2004]).           Vigdor [2007] finds that evacuees are hurt by the

                                                                                                      5
dislocation, both in terms of income and weeks worked.         McIntosh [2007] finds that the in

migration of evacuees hurt native wages and employment in Houston, Texas.



        Several studies including Paxson and Rouse [2008], Groen and Polivka [2008], and Sastry

[2007] investigate patterns of population movement caused by Katrina. Katrina has reduced the

size of New Orleans proper from roughly 480,000 to about 255,000 (as of the 2006 American

Community Survey). Paxson and Rouse find that whites and homeowners were the most likely to

return. Those whose homes faced the worst flooding were the least likely to return.



        Most relevant for this paper are Rand Corporation studies by Pane at al (2006 and 2008)

that document the number of displaced students, where they went, and how many days of schools

were lost. The first study finds that 196,000 public school students in Louisiana were displaced.

This represents roughly one quarter of Louisiana's total enrollment. About 81 percent of the

evacuees came from just three parishes (Orleans, Jefferson and Calcasieu.). Orleans is coterminous

with the city of New Orleans. Jefferson contains much of the suburban portion of the New Orleans

metro area and includes 21 cities, towns and unincorporated areas. Calcasieu contains the city of

Lake Charles and is in the southwest corner of New Orleans which was devastated by Hurricane

Rita.



               Pane et al [2006] shows that the median evacuee missed five weeks of school.

Thirty eight percent of evacuees were out of school and then returned to their original school.

Thirty one percent relocated to another Louisiana school while another 31 percent disappeared

from the data set. The second paper studies one year effects on attendance, mental health and test

scores. They find one year effects from disruption similar to the effects I find and they find that

those negative effects are smaller for those evacuees who enter better schools.




II.    Data Description



       The main data set consists of student level test scores and demographics for Louisiana

public school students during 2004-2007. Under Louisiana's accountability program, students in

grades 4, 8, and 10 are tested in March of each year. These tests are known as the LEAP or

Louisiana Educational Assessment Program (grades 4 and 8) and the GEE or Graduation Exit

Examination. The subjects tested include math and english language arts (ELA) for grades 4, 8 and

10. Science and social studies are tested in grades 4,8 and 11. For brevity I do not report results

for science and social studies tests below.



       The LEAP and GEE tests are high stakes tests with the following set of rules: To be

promoted to the next grade, students in grades 4 and 8 must score "Basic" on at least one of the

math and ELA tests and at least "Approaching Basic" on the other exam. In order to be eligible for

a standard high school diploma, high school students must receive "Approaching Basic" or better

on both the ELA and math exams and "Approaching Basic" or better on either of the science or

social studies exams. High stakes testing policies were suspended for all 4th and 8th grade students

during the 05-06 school year due to the hurricanes.




                                                                                                  7
         In spring 2006 tests known as the ILEAP (Integrated Louisiana Educational Assessment of

Progress) were added for grades 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. (The Iowa Test of Basic Skills was previously

used for these students. I do not have the Iowa test scores.) Students in these five grades are tested

in both math and english language arts. Students in grades 3,5,6, and 7 are tested in science and

social studies. The tests in the ILEAP grades do not have a high stakes component at the student

level.



         Appendix Table I shows the number of student level observations I have for each year. I

only observe students if they take a LEAP, ILEAP or GEE exam. Thus in 2005, I observe most

students in grades 4, 8, 10 and 11. I observe a small number of students in grade 12 who re-took

various exams. I observe a total of 210,755 students for all of Louisiana for 2004. If I inflate this

number by 13/4 to account for the fact that I am only observing 4 grades of the possible 13 grades

in the k-12 system, I infer that there were roughly 685,000 public school students Louisiana in

2004. Starting in 2006, the data add students in grades 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 (because of the ILEAP

testing) making the dataset much more complete.



         Since I do not observe all students in all years, one of the challenges of the data analysis is

making the tradeoff between running specifications that control for a student's lagged test score and

running specifications that make use of all of the observations. Below I try several different

approaches. But my most robust specification is one in which I follow two separate cohorts that I

observe both pre-Katrina (2004 or 2005) and in each of the post Katrina years (2006-2008).




                                                                                                      8
       I have a randomly generated ID number which allows me to link a given student across

years in the data set. For the spring of 2006, I also have a field which tells me which students are

evacuees and whether they were displaced from a public school or private school and whether they

were displaced by Katrina or Rita. This was collected by teachers and principals and then reported

to the state at the time the exams were taken. For each year, I know a student's school and district,

race, gender, and free lunch status.



       My analysis sample is constructed by taking all students in Appendix Table I and then

limiting the data to students observed in 2006 since that is the year during which the Louisiana

required schools to provide information on a student's evacuee status.        Student evacuees are

classified as displaced by Katrina or Rita and also as displaced from a public or private school or

out of state school. This reduces the number of observations from 1.3 million to 1.0 million. My

results are robust to other approaches including inferring a student's evacuee status from her 2004

or 2005 location. Fundamentally I can only study test score outcomes for students who remain in

Louisiana, meaning that there is unobserved selection that creates the sample. My analysis of

college going outcomes does not suffer from this bias since I follow entire cohorts of students who

were in 10th grade prior to Katrina.



       In all cases in the tables and text, when I refer to a single year, I mean March of that year.

Hence "2005" refers to March 2005 which is the spring of the 04-05 school year. Thus any

references to 2005 test score data are pre-hurricanes.




                                                                                                   9
       The parishes most affected by Hurricane Katrina are Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines, and

Saint Bernard. These parishes comprise most of the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan Statistical

Area. Appendix Table II shows a frequency tabulation of students in grades 4, 8 and 10 in 2005

tabulated by their eventual (2006) evacuee status. There are 135,316 students in these three grades

in the analysis sample, 14,400 of whom were in one of the affected parishes in 2005. Ninety

percent of the students in the affected parishes become evacuees. And, of the Katrina evacuees,

ninety-three percent come from the most affected parishes.



       Even after the hurricanes, the bulk of Katrina evacuees who remain in Louisiana remain in a

school in one of the four most affected parishes.        Appendix Table III shows, by year, the

percentage of eventual evacuees who attend school in one of the affected parishes. This percentage

is 93 percent in 2004 and 2005 (again the spring of these years which is pre-hurricane). This dips

to 68% in the spring following Katrina but rises back to 76% by 2007. Many of the evacuees move

from Orleans Parish to Jefferson.



       Appendix Tables IV and V document the fact that Katrina evacuees are more likely to

disappear from the Louisiana public school sample relative to non-evacuees. In Appendix Table

IV I take the set of evacuees from Orleans Parish who were in the 8th grade in 2005. I ask whether

they are still in the sample in 2007. Roughly 50% of the evacuees remain in the sample versus

roughly 80% for all other students. Obviously selection out of the sample makes it more difficult

to estimate the effect of the hurricanes on student achievement.




                                                                                                10
        Appendix Table VI shows which school districts are sending and receiving evacuees after

Katrina. 7 I show the number of eventual evacuees located in each parish by year. (In other words I

classify students by their eventual (2006) evacuee status.) I limit the table to students in grades 4,

8, and 10 since those three grades are tested consistently throughout 2004-2007.                   Pre-hurricane,

the vast majority of these evacuees are located in Jefferson and Orleans Parishes, with an additional

700-800 evacuees in each of St. Tammany, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard in 2005.



        Post-hurricane, the count of evacuees (in grades 4,8,10) in Jefferson Parish grows by about

1200 evacuees and East Baton Rouge School District gains about 1,000 of these evacuees. Since I

am counting only three grades, this implies that East Baton Rouge gained roughly 3300 student

evacuees in all grades. The remaining school districts in the state each gain 0-150 evacuees. The

number of evacuees in Orleans itself shrinks dramatically post-Katrina. The Recovery School

District (RSD) in Orleans was set up to administer most of the schools in the former Orleans Parish

School District. The RSD has roughly 1100 4th ,8th ,and 10th graders by 2007.



        In Table I, I show the summary statistics at the student level for the year 2006 (as opposed

to the student*year level). And I show summary statistics separately for the Katrina and Rita

evacuees. Ten and one half percent or roughly 45,400 of the students are Katrina evacuees. Thirty

percent of those evacuees are originally from Orleans Parish. Five point four percent or roughly

23,000 students are Rita evacuees. Since I only observe students in grades 3-11 and since I only

observe students who remain in Louisiana public schools, the actual number of evacuees is higher.




7
 For many parishes the school district and the parish coincide, but this is not always the case. Orleans now has the
Orleans Parish School District and the Recovery School District and several academy and charter districts.


                                                                                                                 11
       Forty four percent of all students are black, while 56 percent of the Katrina evacuees are

black and 31 percent of the Rita evacuees are black.



       I standardized math and ELA scores to be mean zero standard deviation one within each

year and grade level (for the entire state). This standardization is apparent in the average math and

ELA scores for all observations in Table I. Overall, the Katrina evacuees have math scores that are

.268 standard deviations below the state average and ELA scores that are .222 standard deviations

below. The Rita evacuees have math scores that are .108 standard deviations above and ELA

scores that are .140 standard deviations above the state average.     Appendix Table VI has more

detail about how average test scores vary by school district over time. Pre-Katrina the Orleans

Parish School district is among the worst performing in the state with the average student scoring

a half standard deviation below the state average.          Pre-hurricane, Jefferson is.18 standard

deviations below while Plaquemines and St. Tammany are substantially above the state averages.

Figure I shows the estimated 2005 (pre-Hurricane) math test score distribution for Orleans

evacuees versus all of the non-evacuees in 2005.




       As mentioned above, I also have data on college enrollments and degrees for a sample of

32,000 Louisiana students. The data are from the Student Loan Clearinghouse database and were

created in an a collaboration between myself, the State of Louisiana's Department of Education's

Office of Assessment and Accountability, Data Recognition Corp which organizes and warehouses

certain portions of the student level data, and the Clearinghouse.




                                                                                                  12
           Thus far we have pulled Clearinghouse data for a random sample of 8,000 students from the

parishes of Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson, Plaquemines, East Baton Rouge, and Iberia. The first

four parishes are the Katrina affected ones and the latter two are intended to serve as controls. Our

sample is roughly a 50% sample of all students who took GEE exams in 2002-2005. Most students

take the exams in their 10th grade. The first two cohorts graduated prior to the hurricanes and the

second two were entering 11th and 12th grade at the time the hurricanes struck. One advantage of

the Clearinghouse data is that it allows me to track students across state lines and to obtain fairly

clean measures of college going for an entire sample, whether or not a student moves or fails to

graduate from high school.



           For the analysis, I consider whether or not a given student enrolled in a college or a four

year college.         (In the long run there exists the potential to study college retention, college

selectivity, and graduation rates.) Appendix Table X shows a breakdown of the raw data by cohort

and by 2,4, less than 2 year college or no enrollment. Technically the "no-enrollment" students are

the ones that cannot be found in the Clearinghouse database using various combinations of social

security number, date of birth, and last name. Appendix Table X implies that more recent cohorts

have fewer enrollments. Most of this difference appears to an age effect: as the cohort ages,

additional students enroll for the first time each year. To control for the age effect, I look at college

enrollments within the first twelve months from the implied year of high school graduation. 8



           Using this measure, the mean enrollment rate for any college is 41 percent and the mean

enrollment rate for a four year college is 30 percent. Prior to the hurricanes, Orleans had a four

year college enrollment rate of 26 percent versus 36 percent and 37 percent for East Baton Rouge

    I infer high school class year by assuming that students are taking the GEE exam in their 10th grade.


                                                                                                            13
and Iberia respectively. Interesting, despite having significantly lower test scores, Orleans and all

of the greater New Orleans parishes had an overall college going rate higher than that of Iberia or

East Baton Rouge. Orleans was at 44 percent and Jefferson at 51 percent relative to Iberia's 41

percent. This may reflect the greater supply of two year colleges in the New Orleans metro area.



III.   Empirical Framework

       My main interest is estimating the effect of the hurricanes on the academic performance of

the evacuees. And I ask how this effect varied for different types of evacuees and by the average

achievement of the school the evacuee left.        The structure of the data set presents several

challenges. First, because I do not observe every student both before and after the hurricanes, I do

not necessarily want to limit myself to models in which I control for a student's lagged test score on

the right hand side. Thus in addition to test score growth regressions, I also run simpler models in

which I simply ask how test score levels change for the eventual evacuees over time.



       Second, large numbers of students leave the State as a result of the hurricanes. In theory I

could bring in Houston test score data for the students who go to Houston, but it is not clear how I

would scale the Texas scores before merging them with Louisiana scores in a regression. My

preferred solution is to also use college going as the outcome rather than just test scores. As noted

above, the Clearinghouse data allow me to track students who leave Louisiana both before and after

the hurricanes.



       Third, the hurricanes did not hit a random set of students but instead Katrina affected a

group of students who were disproportionately poor and low scoring while Rita affected a group of




                                                                                                   14
students who were disproportionately richer and higher scoring. In most specifications my control

for this selection into evacuee status is to follow a fixed cohort of evacuees both before and after

the hurricanes.   Thus the evacuees provide their own control group by using their relative

performance before the hurricane. Any grade effects or year effects are estimated including all the

non-evacuees.



       My preferred specification is a difference in difference approach in which I examine how

performance for the evacuees changed from a base year (2004 or 2005) to each post-Hurricane year

(2006, 2007,2008) all relative to the performance change for non-evacuees.       For most students I

have only a single year of pre-hurricane data. For this reason, I can run a difference in difference

or I can include lagged (pre-hurricane) test score on the right hand side but I can not combine these

two strategies.



       My simplest OLS specification asks how the test scores of the eventual evacuees varies

over time. I run the following regression for each year in the dataset:



(1) Math Scoreit = α + β1*Katrina Evacuee Statusi + β2*Rita Evacuee Statusi + γ*Xi + λ*Grade
Effects + εit


This is for student i in year t. Standard errors are clustered at the level of the current school, but

my results are robust to clustering at the level of the pre-hurricane school.    I also include grade

effects and dummies for race, gender, and free lunch status with the latter three effects represented

by γ*Xi .




                                                                                                   15
β1 and β2 tell me the relative position of the Katrina and Rita evacuees within the test score

distribution in a given year. I then look across the four regressions and examine the pattern in

coefficients. One advantage of this approach is that I can use every observation in the analysis

sample, rather than limiting myself to observations with both pre- and post hurricane test scores. I

use this same specification when considering the college enrollment rate as the outcome.



         A more sophisticated version of the above specification is to pool all five years and

introduce a dummy for post-hurricane and the interaction of evacuee status and each post-hurricane

year. This is the difference in difference approach in which I ask how the relative position of the

evacuees in the test score distribution has changed from before the hurricanes to each year after.



(2) Math Scoreit = α + β3*Year is 2006*Katrina Evacuee Statusi + β4*Year is 2007*Katrina
              Evacuee Statusi + β5*Year is 2008*Katrina Evacuee Statusi + β6*Year is 2006*Rita
              Evacuee Statusi + β7*Year is 2007*Rita Evacuee Statusi + β8*Year is 2008*Rita
              Evacuee Statusi + β1*Katrina Evacuee Statusi + β2*Rita Evacuee Statusi + ξ* initial
              school effects+ ρ*Year Effects+ γ*Xi + λ*Grade Effects + εit



This estimates the effect of being an evacuee (β3) as the difference in evacuee test scores from pre-

hurricane to 2006 relative to the difference in test scores for non evacuees for the same two years. 9

The inclusion of initial school effects adds precision to the estimates and has only a small effect on

the point estimates.




9
  The inclusion of year effects and grade effects is not essential since the data are already demeaned at this level. But I
demeaned at the level of the whole data set while I run the regression for a specific cohort within the data set. In the
tables below I also split the Katrina evacuees into those from Orleans Parish (City of New Orleans) and all others
which refers mostly to those from the New Orleans suburbs.


                                                                                                                       16
         For ease of interpretation, I run equation (2) for a fixed cohort of students over time. My

three cohorts are 1.) the students who were fourth graders in 2004, 2.) the students who were fourth

graders in 2005 and 3.) the students who were eighth graders in 2005. The latter group can only be

followed reliably for two years post-hurricane, namely their ninth and tenth grade years in 2007

and 2008. Some fraction of the eighth grade cohort is still taking the Graduate Exit Exam in their

11th grade, but this is a non-random subset and I exclude the coefficients based on this group. 10



         I include fixed effects for initial school. In the case of the Orleans Parish schools, there is

perfect collinearity between evacuee status and the school effect and so I drop the evacuee status

dummy for those schools. This is fine because the object of interest is not the level effect of

evacuee status (or of individual schools) but rather the interaction of evacuee status and the post-

hurricane years (i.e. . β3-β7).



         A third approach is to run a more standard growth in test scores regression in which I

control for the student's pre-Katrina test score.



(3) Math Scoreit = α + β6*Pre-Katrina Math Scorei + β3*Year is 2006*Katrina Evacuee Statusi +
                  β4*Year is 2007*Katrina Evacuee Statusi + β5*Year is 2008*Katrina Evacuee
              Statusi + β6*Year is 2006*Rita Evacuee Statusi + β7*Year is 2007*Rita Evacuee
              Statusi + β8*Year is 2008*Rita Evacuee Statusi + ρ*Year Effects + γ*Xi + λ*Grade
              Effects+ εit




10
  For the sake of brevity I calculated but did not report in tables the results for students who were in 8th grade in 2004.
Most students who were in 10th grade in 2004 and 2005 have aged out of test taking post-hurricane. The above list is
the full set of students for whom I have pre-hurricane scores.


                                                                                                                       17
I estimate equation (3) for the same three cohorts as above.            I include only post-Katrina

observations since the one pre-Katrina observation for each student is needed as the pre-Katrina

score on the right hand side. This eliminates my ability to include fixed effects for initial school.



       My final technique to estimate the effect of the hurricanes on the evacuees is to use

propensity score matching (Rosenbaum and Rubin). I estimate the propensity to be treated (an

evacuee) using demographics and pre-hurricane test scores. I then match each evacuee observation

to the non-evacuee observation with the closest estimated propensity score.            I estimate the

treatment effect as the difference in outcomes between the treatment (evacuee) group and the

matched control group.



IV.    Results

       Table II displays the results from estimating equation (1) for math test scores, i.e. the

repeated cross sections with Katrina and Rita evacuee status on the right hand side. I separate out

Katrina evacuees who are initially from the City of New Orleans (i.e. Orleans Parish) from all other

evacuees. In 2004 and 2005, controlling for demographics, eventual Orleans evacuees have math

test scores that are .18 to .20 standard deviations below the math scores of other Louisiana students.

After the hurricanes this gap widens to -.30 standard deviations in 2006. The gap then narrows

dramatically by 2007 to -.13 and to -.10 by 2008. This suggests that the Orleans evacuees saw an

initial decline of .13 standard deviations immediately following the hurricane. However, these

same students then made gains so that they ended the period only -.10 standard deviations behind

other Louisiana students and thereby cut their pre-hurricane disadvantage (of -.20) in half.




                                                                                                    18
         The Rita evacuees and the Katrina evacuees from the suburbs see a different pattern.

Controlling for demographics, the suburban Katrina evacuees have pre-hurricane test scores that

are roughly in line with the rest of Louisiana students. Much like the Orleans evacuees, they

experience a drop of -.12 standard deviations in the year immediately following the hurricane. 11

This decline persists into 2007 and then largely disappears by 2008. The Rita evacuees begin the

period at .09 standard deviations above the state average. They then experience the same initial

(2006) drop as the other two groups of evacuees and then do not recover much of the loss by 2007

or 2008.



         Table III repeats this exercise using the English Language Arts scores. The pattern is quite

similar to that observed for Math scores. Before the hurricane, the Orleans evacuees are about -.25

standard deviations below the state average and experience a drop of .10 standard deviations in

2006. By 2007, the Orleans evacuees are already ahead of where they started and they make

further gains in 2008. The Orleans evacuees end the period -.15 standard deviations below the state

average which means they have made up about half of the pre-hurricane gap. The Rita evacuees

again start the period significantly above the state average and lose a portion of their advantage.

And they do no appear to make it back. Pre-hurricane the Rita evacuees are .09-.10 standard

deviations above the state average and fall to being .05 standard deviations below by 2008. The

non-Orleans Katrina evacuees have ELA test scores that are in line with the state average. They

experience a decline of -.09 standard deviations in 2006. 2007 brings a further decline, but by 2008

the non-Orleans Katrina evacuees are nearly back to where they started.




11
  The size of the 2006 decline for all three groups of evacuees is consistent with Pane et al's [2008] finding of a decline
of -.09 to -.20 standard deviations.


                                                                                                                       19
       The effects over time are graphed for both groups of evacuees in Figures II-V. Figures II

and III compare the Rita evacuees to all Katrina Evacuees (coefficients for the latter combination

not shown in the tables) while Figures IV and V graph the effects for Orleans versus non-Orleans

Katrina evacuees.



       Certainly one possible interpretation of these facts is that the new schools for the New

Orleans evacuees have such higher value added relative to the old schools that within two years the

evacuees have more than made up for the large costs of the dislocation imposed by the hurricane.

The Jefferson students do not see an increase possibly because they receive no benefits from the

disruption and possibly because there are negative externalities from the large numbers of Orleans

students who arrive at their schools.



       Table IV proceeds to the estimation of equation (2) in which I limit the sample to a specific

cohort and identify the effects of evacuee status for each of the three post-hurricane years. Table

IV is for math scores. These effects are estimated relative to the base year of 2004 or 2005. All

regressions include initial school, year and grade effects. (The non-evacuees in the sample are

included to identify these latter effects as well as to identify the coefficients on the demographic

variables.) Column (1) contains results for students who were fourth graders in 2004. In 2006, i.e.

immediately following the hurricane, the Orleans evacuees from this cohort are -.174 standard

deviations behind where they started. By 2007, the Orleans evacuees are back to their original

position in the test score distribution and by 2008 the Orleans evacuees are .11 standard deviations

above where they started.




                                                                                                 20
       Column (2) repeats this for the cohort of fourth graders in 2005. Orleans evacuees in the

2005 cohort lose .25 standard deviations in 2006 relative to their initial position in the test score

distribution. Like the earlier cohort, these evacuees then catch back up in 2007 and move ahead of

their initial position by 2008. Finally in column (3) I examine math scores for students who were

eighth graders in 2005. The Orleans students among them experience a drop of .114 standard

deviations in 2006 but gain enough in 2007 to be .14 standard deviations above their initial

position. I do not follow the eighth grade cohort into 2008 since most of the students are 11

graders by that year and have placed out of the testing requirements.



       Table IV also contains separate coefficients for each post-hurricane year for the Rita

evacuees and the non-Orleans Katrina evacuees within the three cohorts. The message is quite

similar to the simple cross sections in Tables II and III. The fourth grade non-Orleans evacuees

experience a big decline in scores in 2006. This decline is -.18 for the 2004 cohort and -.11 for the

2005 cohort. The 2004 cohort then gains back about half the decline by 2007 and makes further

progress by 2008 to end the period with a statistically insignificant loss of -.032 standard

deviations. The 2005 fourth grade cohort of non-Orleans evacuees fares a bit worse. They

experience further declines in 2007 but then rally in 2008 to end the period about -.07 standard

deviations lower than when they started.      The eighth graders from 2005 who are non-Orleans

evacuees are a bit different. The eighth graders experience a small initial decline in 2006 of -.03

which increases to a decline of -.052 by 2007.



       All three cohorts of Rita evacuees have initial declines in 2006 which become gradually

smaller over the subsequent years. For example, the Rita evacuees who are fourth graders in 2004




                                                                                                  21
have a decline of .12 standard deviations in the first year after the hurricane. This falls to -.09 in

2007 and a statistically insignificant -.04 by 2008.



       Table V performs the exact same analysis but using ELA scores as the outcome. The

pattern in coefficients is nearly identical to that of Table IV. Orleans evacuees experience large test

score declines in 2006. For the fourth graders of 2004, these amount to -.21. This disadvantage is

whittled to -.05 by 2007 and by 2008 the Orleans evacuees in this cohort have ELA scores that are

.11 standard deviations above their pre-hurricane scores. Non-Orleans Katrina evacuees from the

same cohort (2004 fourth graders) have a 2006 decline of -.10 standard deviations. They do not

make much progress on this gap in 2007 but they eliminate the gap (between their current and their

2004 relative performance) by 2008. Rita evacuees among the 2004 fourth graders see an initial

decline of .11 standard deviations. This decline persists into both 2007 and 2008.



       A slightly different way to estimate the effects of the hurricanes over time is to use equation

(3) which uses initial/ baseline test score on the right hand side. The disadvantage of this strategy

is that due to the limited length of my panel, adding initial test score eliminates my ability to

include pre-treatment observations and school effects.     Table VI is for math scores and contains

the estimates from equation (3) for the same three cohorts, namely fourth graders in 2004, fourth

graders in 2005 and eighth graders in 2005. The coefficient on baseline (pre-hurricane) test score is

.76-.84 which is consistent with test score growth regressions such as those in Kane, Staiger,

Rockoff [forthcoming]. The pattern of coefficients for the Orleans evacuees is the same as that

found in the earlier tables: In 2006, the fourth graders from Orleans experience a large negative

effect from the hurricane equal to -.20 to -.25 standard deviations. By 2007 they have eliminated




                                                                                                    22
much of this disadvantage and by 2008 the estimated effects of displacement by the hurricane are

positive. The positive effects of the hurricane are smaller than the effects estimate with equation

(2) and are not statistically significant. However, the eighth grade cohort from 2005 does show

statistically significant positive effects of the hurricane by 2007.    The effect of displacement for

the Orleans evacuees in that cohort is estimated to be +.13 standard deviations.



       Effects on math scores for Rita and non-Orleans evacuees from Katrina generally show an

initial negative effect in 2006 followed by recovery back to the baseline level of performance by

2008. In column (1) the non-Orleans evacuees have an effect of -.15 standard deviations in 2007

which lessens to -.07 in 2007 and becomes a statistically insignificant -.02 by 2008. For the non-

Orleans evacuees who were in fourth grade in 2005, the effect of the hurricanes becomes more

negative from 2006 to 2007, but again becomes small, negative and insignificant by 2008.



       Table VII shows coefficients from equation (3) for English Language Arts scores. The

results are much the same as with the math scores. The Orleans from the fourth grade cohorts start

out with a large decline in 2006 followed by rapid growth in 2007 and 2008. The net increase by

2008 from the baseline is positive but not statistically significant. The eighth graders from Orleans

have an effect of +.16 standard deviations in 2007 and this effect is statistically significant.



       My final strategy for estimating the effects of the hurricane is using propensity score

matching. I take the sample of fourth graders from 2005. I estimate the propensity to be an

Orleans evacuee and the propensity to be a non-Orleans Katrina evacuee (relative to non-evacuees).

Coefficients are in Appendix Table VIII. The only observables on which I can match are 2005 test




                                                                                                   23
scores, race, and free lunch status. I can't include school effects since the treatment generally

occurs at the school level. 12 I use the Becker and Ichino matching algorithm to perform nearest

neighbor matching on the propensity score and to calculate the estimate treatment effects of being

and evacuee on math scores in 2006-2008.



           The results (shown in Appendix Table IX) are quite similar to those found using the test

score growth regression of equation (3).                      Specifically, the fourth grade Orleans evacuees

experience a large negative effect in 2006 of -.12 standard deviations. They then recover in 2007

and show positive but statistically insignificant effects by 2008. The non-Orleans evacuees have a

negative effect of -.08 standard deviations in 2006. They then recover slowly over the next two

years and finish 2008 with an effect of -.016.



           In Table VIII, I attempt to provide more detailed results on which evacuees showed the

largest effects from the hurricanes. In columns (1) and (2) I re-run equation (2) for math scores. I

divide the sample by schools that are initially in the bottom quintile of average math scores in 2005

(column 1) versus all other schools (column 2). I show this for the students who were fourth

graders in 2005, but results are similar for the 2004 cohort of fourth graders. The Orleans evacuees

from schools in the bottom quintile of Louisiana schools (based on average math scores) have a

negative impact from the hurricane on math scores of -.19 in 2006.                       And by 2008 these students

(Orleans evacuees from the worst schools) show strong growth of .14 standard deviations relative

to their baseline. In contrast, Orleans evacuees from all other schools (schools in the upper 4

quintiles) show larger negative effects in 2006 and show no positive effects stemming from the

hurricanes. Non-orleans Katrina evacuees from the worst quintile of schools have no negative
12
     For this reason, I actually prefer the within school estimates from equation (2).


                                                                                                                24
effects by 2008. In contrast, the non-Orleans Katrina evacuees from the other quintiles show

statistically significantly negative effects in 2008.



       In column (3), I control directly for the average test score in the student's current school. I

cluster at the level of the current school (by means of the initial school fixed effects which are

always included). The goal is to ask whether students who move to higher scoring schools show

better performance, controlling for the student's initial school. I include both current school's

average 2005 math score and this variable interacted with Orleans evacuee status. For the whole

sample, there is a very strong association between the current school's average 2005 score and the

student's score.    The coefficient is .48. The interaction of current school average and Orleans

evacuee status is small, positive and insignificant. This indicates that the association between

current school performance and own performance is just as strong for the Orleans evacuees as for

non-evacuees.      That means either that current school "quality" helps the evacuees as much as

everyone, or evacuees sort as strongly based on school quality as everyone else, or both.

Furthermore, the addition of current school's 2005 math average reduces the large positive

coefficient usually found for Orleans evacuees in 2008 (e.g. Table IV). This suggests that current

school quality can in some sense account for the positive effects on achievement that Orleans

evacuees experience.



Effects on College Going



       In addition to test scores, I also consider whether college enrollment rates for the evacuees

are affected. Table IX shows the enrollment rate in four year colleges by school district and cohort.




                                                                                                   25
As mentioned above, I limit enrollments to those that take place within one year following implied

high school graduation year, i.e. within three years after taking the GEE exam. I do this to make

enrollment rates for all four cohorts comparable to the enrollment rate for the most recent (2007)

cohort.



          East Baton Rouge and Iberia are intended to be my "control" districts since students in these

districts experience the statewide effects of the hurricanes but are not themselves displaced. In

2004, 2006, and 2007 East Baton Rouge students had a .351 to .358 four year college enrollment

rate. Those numbers imply a fair amount of stability across the hurricane years. However, 2005

East Baton Rouge students had what looks like an anomalously high enrollment rate of .390.



          In contrast, students in Jefferson experience drops in enrollment rates for the 2005 and 2006

cohorts followed by recovery by the 2007 cohort. Jefferson has a four year enrollment rate of .304.

This falls to .262 for both the 2005 and 2006 cohorts and then the enrollment rate rises back to

.304. This is shown graphically in Figure VI. 13



          This suggests two hypotheses. First, the hurricane affected college enrollment both for

students entering their senior year of high school AND for students who had recently graduated.

There are significant effects in Jefferson for the 2005 cohort. While some students in that group

may be misclassified in my data they all were scheduled to graduate prior to the hurricane. They

are either from the 2005 or 2004 high school classes (not the 2006 or 2007 high school class.)



13
  While Orleans students appear to experience a drop in enrollment rates (in the raw data) this turns out to be a
compositional effect driven by the changing weighting of high schools within my random sample of Orleans students.
This "drop" disappears when I add school fixed effects.


                                                                                                               26
       Second, while the hurricane impacted both the 2005 and 2006 graduating classes, there are

no effects observed for the 2007 class. In Jefferson, Plaquemines, and Orleans, the four year

college enrollment rates for the class of 2007 all achieved the same level as the 2004 class.



       Neither of these conjectures can be accepted with absolute certainty. There are significant

difficulties in deciding upon an appropriate control group against which the Katrina evacuees

should be measured. Certainly having a longer time series and students from more districts would

be useful.



       It does appear that the negative effects experienced by the Jefferson cohorts right around the

hurricanes are permanent rather than temporary effects. I say this because I have also investigated

the time path of cumulative enrollment as the cohorts age.        In Figure VII, I display cumulative

four year college enrollment over time for four cohorts from suburban New Orleans. The 2004 and

2007 cohorts appear to be on similar paths. Immediately after graduation, the college enrollment

rate is roughly 28 percent and this rises to roughly 30 percent one year after graduation. (These

effects are cumulative so that this is the percent ever enrolled). In contrast the time paths for

suburban New Orleans students from the classes of 2005 and 2006 start from a lower base of less

than 26 percent enrolled and the cumulative enrollment rate stays low.



       Table X shows the effects in a regression setting. I run a panel at the individual student

level and I include initial high school fixed effects in each regression. I identify the coefficients on

the interactions between the parishes directly affected by Katrina and the graduation years of 2005,

2006 and 2007. In columns (1) and (2) the outcome of interest is a dummy for enrolling in a four




                                                                                                     27
year college. In column (3) the outcomes is enrollment in a four year college ranked by US News

and in column (4) the outcomes is the 75th percentile of SAT scores for the student's college. 14



         In column (1), inclusion of school fixed effects shows the strong negative effects among the

students who attended tenth grade in Jefferson, St. Bernard and Plaquemines. The 2005 cohort

from these parishes has an enrollment rate in four year colleges that is 3.2 percentage points behind

the rate for the 2004 cohort. The 2006 cohort for these parishes is 3.5 percentage points lower.

The negative effect disappears by the 2007 cohort.                  In column (2), I add year effects and the

negative effects of Katrina remain for the students originating in Jefferson/St. Bernard/

Plaquemines. The effect for the class of 2005 becomes -5.7 percentage points and the effect for

the class of 2006 becomes a statistically insignificant -1.4 percentage points. For the class of 2007,

the effect turns positive and statistically significant.



         In contrast, once I control for the initial high school and year effects, the Orleans students

show positive effects from the hurricanes. Among students who originated in Orleans, the class of

2006 has a college enrollment rate that is 4.2 percentage points higher than the base year class of

2004. And the class of 2007 has a college enrollment rate that is 4.5 percentage points higher.



         In column (3), I switch the outcome from attending any four year college to attending a four

year college that is ranked by US News in 2008. This variable has a mean of about 17 percent in



14
   In column (1) I am not including year effects. Thus the effect on college going rate for students is being identified
from the within school differences in outcomes between the classes of 2005-2007 relative to the base year of 2004.
Columns (2)-(4) add year effects and thus identify the coefficients of interest as the difference in outcomes within
schools in the hurricane affected districts relative to the difference in outcomes for the unaffected (or at least not
directly affected) districts. The year effects pick up the negative time trend in college going in the "control" parishes.
There is also a strong negative time trend in enrollment in US News ranked colleges in all parishes (column 4).


                                                                                                                      28
the sample. Controlling for initial school effects and year effects, the hurricane has a strong

positive effect on the likelihood of attending a US News ranked school for students in Orleans.

Students who were in 10th grade in Orleans in 2004 (labeled as the class of 2006) are 2.8

percentage points more likely to attend a US News ranked college relative to their peers in the

classes of 2004. Again students from the other Katrina affected parishes show negative effects for

the class of 2005 and these negative effects disappear.



       To summarize the results, there is a negative effect on college going for students the

suburban parishes among the cohorts who graduate immediately before the hurricanes. There is

actually a large and statistically significant positive effect for the students from Orleans parish who

graduate in 2006 and 2007. The size and timing of the positive effect for Orleans Parish students

depends on whether or not I include year dummies, which are themselves estimated from the

inclusion of data from two relatively unaffected parishes. One reasonable interpretation of the

results are that Orleans evacuees are greatly helped in their college going decision by their

relocation to schools with a different set of peers, guidance counselors, and teachers than they

would have in the absence of the hurricane. But given the large magnitude of the effect sizes and

the sensitivity to year effects/ choice of controls, I am somewhat cautious in pushing this

interpretation.



         Effects on Crime in Receiving Communities

       During 2005 and 2006, the US media gave a great deal of attention to the alleged increases

in crime in the communities where the evacuees relocated.           Both the New York Times and

Washington Post ran stories about evacuee related crime increases in Houston. One Washington




                                                                                                    29
Post story was titled, "After Welcoming Evacuees, Houston Handles Spike in Crime Population

Swell Fills Apartments and Strains Police Force." One of the key statistics cited in several stories

was that in the six months following Katrina, evacuees were involved in 17% of Houston's 153

murders during that period. This figure is not as shocking when one realizes that evacuees

comprised nearly 10 percent of Houston's population at the time. And evacuees were likely a

larger fraction of Houston's lowest income citizens.



       My objective is to ask whether crime and crime per capita in Houston actually spiked

following the hurricanes. I perform two sets of analysis. First, I compare monthly crime rates in

Houston to monthly crime rates in Texas' other large cities. Second, I look at crime rates within 65

Houston zip codes and ask whether zip codes with more Katrina evacuees experienced greater

increases in crime.



       The first data set consists of monthly data from the Uniform Crime Reports Return A

Master File. I use monthly data from January 2004 through December 2006. (A longer time series

is probably desirable but it was necessary to read in and reshape the data for each year separately.)

My comparison cities in Texas are Arlington, Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Harris,

Montgomery, and San Antonio. These are all of the cities with more than 300,000 people in 2000.

The mean monthly crime rates per 10,000 people are shown in Table Ib.



       Figures Ib, IIb, and IIIb plot the time series of the monthly numbers of burglaries, murders

and robberies. The most striking fact is shown in Figure Ib. There is a large increase in the

number of burglaries in Houston in the month that the evacuees arrive (September 2005).




                                                                                                  30
Burglaries jump from 2400 per month to 2900 per month. However, that increase disappears by

October 2005 and does not return. One story is that a number of evacuees arrived in Houston and

either temporarily became professional burglars or temporarily continued their former profession in

Louisiana. But these evacuee burglars either quickly were caught or found other employment.

Note that 30-50 productive burglars could produce an extra 500 burglaries in a month.



          In Figure IIb, murders do appear to experience a level shift up that lasts through September

2006. The number of murders falls by October 2006. (Looking separately at the block level data

from the Houston Police, I found that the decline in murders in October 2006 was temporary and

murders again hit 37 per month in April 2007.) The picture for robberies is muddled (Figure IIIb).

Robberies appear to trend up before the hurricanes and remain high throughout the post-hurricane

period.



          Table IIIb shows two different specifications using monthly UCR data across large Texas

cities. In all cases the dependent variable is monthly crimes per 10,000 people. In columns (1),

(3), (5) and (7) the right hand side includes a dummy for "After August 2005" and the interaction of

that dummy with a dummy for Houston. In the even numbered columns I include a dummy for

"Month Equals September 2005" and interact that dummy with the Houston dummy. In all cases I

include city effects and month effects.



          The evidence is mixed.      Murders and robberies per 10,000 people are statistically

significantly higher following September 2005.         The coefficient for murders is .039 which

represents a 40 percent increase relative to the mean for the whole period. The coefficient for




                                                                                                   31
robberies is roughly 17% of the mean value. But violent crime appeared to be trending upwards in

Houston (both absolutely and relative to the rest of Texas) before the hurricanes. Burglaries show

no evidence of a long run increase following the hurricanes.



           To learn more about this issue, I also obtained the monthly block level crime data from the

Houston Police Department. 15 I know the location of student evacuees, or at least the location of

their schools from the Houston Independent School District Data. I aggregated both data sets to the

zip code level since that appeared to be the smallest common geographic unit across the two data

sets. The means for my zip code level data set are shown in Table IVb. For each zip code, I

calculate percentage of students who are evacuees. The mean "percent katrina" is 7 percent, with a

range from 0 percent to 50 percent. There are 65 zip codes and the data cover January 2005-

September 2007.



           In Table Vb, I report regressions of monthly crimes per 10,000 people on the "percent

katrina" among students in the zip code. I include zip code fixed effects and a dummy for

September 2005 or later.              This enables me to identify the coefficient on "After August

2005"*"Percent Katrina." Looking across five different types of crimes, I found no evidence that

crime was differentially higher in zip codes with a higher fraction of Katrina evacuees.



V.         Discussion and Conclusion



           Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had significant impacts on the academic performance of

evacuees. In the first year following the hurricanes, evacuee math scores dropped between .10 and
15
     http://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/stats2.htm


                                                                                                   32
.25 standard deviations relative to other Louisiana students. This is not terribly surprising given the

massive disruptions caused by the hurricanes and the fact that the median student lost around five

weeks of school.



       Perhaps what is more surprising is how quickly the Orleans Parish evacuees recovered from

the experience and actually began to experience gains. In most of my specifications, by 2007, the

Orleans evacuees are doing as well academically as they were in 2004 and 2005. And by 2008 the

Orleans evacuees were about .10 standard deviations ahead of their 2004 position in the test score

distribution. While not every specification shows statistically significant gains for every single

cohort, my preferred specification which uses school fixed effects and has the most precision

always shows large and significant gains. And in results not reported, I obtain the same finding if I

included student fixed effects in the panel rather than initial school fixed effects. Conversely Rita

evacuees from Lake Charles and Katrina evacuees from Jefferson experience test score drops that

persist into 2007 and show signs of recovery by 2008. For example, looking at fourth graders from

2005, Katrina evacuees not from Orleans scored .11 standard deviations worse in math in 2006

relative to baseline.   They scored .17 standard deviations worse in 2007, and .07 standard

deviations worse in 2008.



       One natural explanation is that the New Orleans schools were so deficient, that in the

medium run the New Orleans evacuees have seen increased academic achievement as a result of

being kicked out of their original schools. The averages for the New Orleans evacuees actually

include those evacuees who have enrolled in the Recovery School District in New Orleans which

by many accounts has struggled and which according to the data has low levels of average




                                                                                                    33
achievement. In contrast, Jefferson and Lake Charles evacuees experienced only the massive

disruption of the hurricanes without any benefit. In particular the increased presence of the Orleans

evacuees in the Jefferson schools could provide negative class size externalities and negative peer

effects.



           The Katrina evacuees from Orleans also appear to benefit in terms of college enrollment

rates. The 2006 and 2007 graduating classes experience a 4 percentage point increase in four year

enrollments. The evacuees from suburban New Orleans Parishes show a negative effect on college

enrollments for the class of 2005, but this negative effect disappears by the class of 2006 or 2007

depending on the specification.



           One frequently repeated fact about the evacuees is that they brought crime to the receiving

cities and towns. I investigated this using both city level UCR data and zip code level data within

Houston. Its clear that robberies and murders are higher in Houston 2006 than in 2004 and early

2005. But is not clear how much of this trend predates the hurricanes. The big spike in burglaries

in Houston in September 2005 faded within one month, leaving the number of burglaries per capita

lower (since population rose by 10 percent.)



           Overall these results provide one of the first looks at how students were affected by one of

the largest relocations in recent US history. The test score and college enrollment results suggest

that for students in particular poor performing schools, the cost to achievement from relocating can

be fairly quickly be made up for by the benefits from being in a different school.

I regress test scores on dummies for ever being a Rita or a Katrina evacuee in a public school. Standard errors are clustered at the school level. Test scores are standardized to be
mean zero variance 1 at the year*grade level. Exams are taken in March of each year. In March 2004 and March 2005, tests were administered to 4th, 8th, and 10th graders. In
2006 through 2008 the exams were administered to all grades 3-10. Students labeled as "New Orleans" Evacuees are from Orleans Parish while the Non-New Orleans Evacuees are
mainly from the suburban part of the New Orleans MSA including Jefferson, St Bernard, Plaquemines Parishes.

I follow a fixed cohort of students over time from 2004 or 2005 through 2008. I distinguish between Katrina evacuees from Orleans Parish
School District and Katrina evacuees from all other districts. I include fixed effects for initial school, year effects and grade effects in each

students who were fourth graders in 2004. Column (2) is for students who were fourth graders in 2005 and Column (3) is for eighth graders
in 2005. The final group can only be followed reliably through 2007 since many students pass out of the math and ELA testing requirements
during 10th grade.

                           Effects of Katrina or Rita Displacement on Math scores
                        Growth from 04/05 Baseline: Orleans vs Non-Orleans Evacuees
I follow a fixed cohort of students over time from 2006 through 2008. I distinguish between Katrina evacuees from Orleans Parish School
District and evacuees from all other districts. I include pre-Katrina test score, year effects and grade effects in each regression. (I cannot
include school fixed effects due to the perfect collinearity between initial school being in Orleans and the school effects combined with the
fact that I am only including post Katrina observations.) I identify the coefficients on evacuee status for each of the post-Katrina years. In
each column I follow a different cohort of students. Column (1) is for students who were fourth graders in 2004. Column (2) is for fourth
graders in 2005 and Column (3) is for eigth graders in 2005. The final group can only be followed reliably through 2007 since many students
pass out of the math and ELA testing requirements during 10th grade. Standard errors are clustered at the level of the initial school.

and Column (3) is for eigth graders in 2005. The final group can only be followed reliably through 2007 since many students pass out of the
math and ELA testing requirements during 10th grade. Standard errors are clustered at the level of the initial school.

                               Split By Initial Schools Quintile of 2005 Math Scores
I follow a fixed cohort of students over time from 2006 through 2008, specifically those who were in 4th grade in 2005. I distinguish
between Katrina evacuees from Orleans Parish School District and evacuees from all other districts. I include fixed effects for initial school,
year effects and grade effects in each regression. I identify the coefficients on the interaction terms between evacuee status and each of the
post-Katrina years. Column (1) is for students whose initial (2005) school was in the bottom quintile of the distribution of average math
scores. Column (2) is for all other schools. Column (3) is for all schools and adds controls for the current school's average math scores and
that variable interacted with Orleans evacuee status.

Four Year College Going Rate By Graduation Cohort and School District

I take a random sample (roughly 50%) of 10th graders who take LEAP exams during 2002-2005 in six different districts. (I infer their senior
based on the year the student takes the LEAP exam). I use Student Clearinghouse data matched to the students (regardless of post-Katrina
location) to determine whether or not the student enrolled in a 4 year college within 3 years after taking the LEAP exam. The table shows the
percent enrolled in a four year college and the number of students.

The data set includes four cohorts of 10th graders including two that were scheduled to graduate before the hurricane and two scheduled to graduate after. (2004 and 2005). I regress
three different college going outcomes on a full set of school effects and the interaction between dummies for hurricane affected parishes and post-hurricane years. In columns (1), (2),
and (4) the coefficients are identified strictly off within school changes in the outcomes, before and after the hurricanes. In column (2) I also include year effects and thus am
identifying the difference in outcomes for students originating in hurricane affected schools relative to the difference in outcomes for students in East Baton Rouge and Iberia Parishes.

The data contain four years worth of test scores (2004-2007). In 2004-2005 for Math and English Language Arts,
students are tested in grades 4,8,10 under the LEAP (Louisiana Education Assessment Program). These are all high
stakes test. Grade 4 and 8 students need to score "Approaching Basic" in both reading and math in order to progress to
the next grade level. Grade 10 students need to score "Approaching Basic" in order to be eligible for a regular high
school diploma. The high stakes policies were suspended for one year during 05-06 due to the Hurricanes.
(Additionally Students are tested in Social Science and Science in grade 11. In 2006 and 2007, ILEAP tests are added
for grades 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

These are the raw data. The analysis sample limits the data to those students I observe in 2006 since that is the year for
which I have an indicator of evacuee status. Note that for 2006-2007 I have 9 grades of students, adding up to about
450,000. I am missing grades 1,2, 12. If we multiply the 450k*12/9 we get 600,000 which is roughly the total number
of public school students in Louisiana.

 By Their Future Evacuee Status And Whether They Attend School In One of

I take pre-Hurricane data in Spring 2005. This is observed for students in grades 4,8,10. I then limit the data to those
students I observe in 2006 (grades 3-11) since 2006 is the year in which I have an accurate indicator of evacuee status.
I cut the data by being in one of the most affected parishes and being an evacuee in 2006. The most affected parishes
are Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard. Ninety three percent of Katrina evacuees come from these
parishes. And 90 percent of the students in these affected parishes are evacuees.

I classify students by their eventual status as an evacuee. I count only the 4th, 8th, 10th graders since these are the only grades tested in all years of the dataset (2004-2007). I limit the
sample to students observed in 2006 which is the year for which I know evacuee status. I only show districts with 30 or more evacuees in some year. Districts are sorted by the
number of evacuees in 2006, except for the Recover School District in New Orleans.

Estimates of Propensity Score For Being an Orleans Parish or other Katrina Evacuee
I use the 2005 data to estimate the propensity to be an evacuee. The right hand side variables include test scores and demographics but not school dummies since in many cases the
treatment occurs at the school level. I run probit regressions and report dy/dx.

I take monthly block level crime data from the Houston Police Department and aggregate to the zip code level. Below are the means for the month of September 2005. The data set
runs from January 2005 through September of 2007. The percent of students who are Katrina evacuees is calculated using data from the Houston Independent School District. I
aggregate the data to the zip code level using the zip code of the school that the student attends. The percent Katrina evacuees is measured in the Spring of 2006.

                                             Regression of Zip Code Level Crime Rates on Percent Katrina
I take monthly block level crime data from the Houston Police Department and aggregate to the zip code level. The number of crimes is divided by the population in the zip
code*10000. The data set runs from January 2005 through September of 2007. The percent of students who are Katrina evacuees is calculated using data from the Houston
Independent School District. I aggregate the data to the zip code level using the zip code of the school that the student attends. The percent Katrina evacuees is measured in the
Spring of 2006.

The percent of students who are evacuees is held constant for a given zip code throughout the time series. All regressions include zip code fixed effects and I identify the coefficient
on "after Sept 2005"*"percent Katrina students" in the zip code.
