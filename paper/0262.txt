rtract—The growth in single-person households is a pervasive behavioral phe-
 nomenon in the United States in the post-war period. In this paper we inves-
 tigate determinants of the propensity to live alone, using 1970 data across
 states for single men and women ages 25 to 34 and for elderly widows. In-
 come level appears to be a major determinant of the propensity to live alone.
 The estimated cross-state equations track about three-quarters of the in-
 crease in the propensity to live alone between 1950—1976 and suggest that m-
 come growth has been the principal identified influence. Other variables
 found to affect (jxsitively) the propensity to live alone include mobility,
 schooling level, and for young people a measure of social climate; non-
 whites appear to have a somewhat lower propensity to live alone.

a——These regressions are estimated by weighted least squares on the
      dependent variable ln(P/l—P) where P is the value of SINGLES ALONE
      expressed as a decimal. The constant reported is from these regressions
      The coefficients for the independent variables reported here are
      estimated slope coefficients b multiplied by P(l—P) and by 100 to
      put them in units comparable with the other reressions. The t—values
      apply to the estimated coefficients b; the R    applies to the dependen
      variable ln(p/l-P).
