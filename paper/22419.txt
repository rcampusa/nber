Disability Benefit Generosity and Labor Force Withdrawal

                                         ABSTRACT

A key component for estimating the optimal size and structure of disability insurance (DI)
programs is the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benefit generosity. Yet, in many
countries, including the United States, all workers face identical benefit schedules, which are a
function of one’s labor market history, making it difficult to separate the effect of the benefit
level from the effect of unobserved preferences for work on individuals’ claiming decisions. To
circumvent this problem, we exploit exogenous variation in DI benefits in Austria arising from
several reforms to its DI and old age pension system in the 1990s and 2000s. We use
comprehensive administrative social security records data on the universe of Austrian workers to
compute benefit levels under six different regimes, allowing us to identify and precisely estimate
the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benefit generosity. We find that, over this time
period, a one percent increase in potential DI benefits was associated with a 1.2 percent increase
in DI claiming.

1. Introduction

        Leaving the work force before the statutory retirement age has become the norm in many

industrialized countries. Since the 1960s the labor force participation rate of males aged 55-64 in

the OECD countries has decreased from 80 to 65 percent despite considerable improvements in

aggregate health. 1 At the same time, disability insurance participation has grown substantially,

especially among older workers who are not yet eligible for public pensions. The negative effects

of this trend on economic growth and public expenditure are exacerbated by falling fertility rates

and significant increases in average life expectancy. While retirement incentives arising

explicitly from public old age pension systems (i.e., Social Security) have been well explored

(see, e.g., Burtless 1986, Gustman and Steinmeier 1986, Stock and Wise 1990, Berkovec and

Stern 1991, Blau 1994, Phelan and Rust 1997, Gruber and Wise 2004, French 2005), the impact

of financial incentives arising from alternative retirement channels, most notably disability

insurance (DI), still lacks a careful analysis. Although recent studies (e.g., Maestas, Mullen and

Strand, 2013) have demonstrated convincingly that substantial work capacity exists among

marginal DI program entrants, credible estimates of the effect of DI benefit levels on individuals’

labor force participation and claiming decisions have remained elusive due to lack of exogenous

variation in DI benefits, which in most countries are determined by a single function of past

earnings and work experience.

        In this paper we employ a novel identification strategy that exploits a series of reforms to

the Austrian old age and disability insurance public pension system between 1987 and 2010. We

make use of individual administrative data containing detailed information regarding earnings

and employment histories and pension claiming, covering all of Austria in the period 1972 to

  The labor force participation rate of males aged 55-64 in OECD countries reached a minimum of 59 percent in the
late 1990s and has increased since then to 65 percent.

2010. The combination of detailed administrative data and policy variation from a series of

national pension reforms presents us with a unique opportunity to learn about individuals’ labor

force withdrawal decisions in ways that are impossible in the U.S. and other settings. Given the

similarity in characteristics of the social security system and the aging population structure, and

because many of the Austrian reforms mimic policy changes that are currently debated by

policymakers around the world, studying their effects can yield important insights to guide social

security and disability insurance reforms in other industrialized countries, including the U.S.

         We find that generally Austrians in this period are sensitive to the level of DI benefits in

determining their labor force participation. Over our sample period, 1.6 percent of labor force

participants ages 35-59 withdraw from the labor force to claim DI benefits each year. We find

that the DI inflow rate increases by 0.02 percentage points, or 1.2 percent, for every 1 percent

increase in DI benefit levels over our entire sample period, 1987-2010. That is, we estimate an

elasticity of DI claiming with respect to DI benefit generosity of 1.2.

         We estimate a smaller elasticity of 0.7 in the later years of the sample, 2004-2010, which

experienced the lowest replacement rates over our observation period. During the same time

period, we estimate that DI application rates increased by 1.6 percent per 1 percent increase in

DI benefits, more than twice the percent increase in new DI beneficiaries. This implies that the

allowance rate for the marginal DI applicant induced by a 1 percent increase in DI benefits is less

than half the overall DI allowance rate. We are unaware of any studies that examine the role of

application screening in mediating the effect of DI benefit levels on new DI beneficiaries. 2

         There exist a wide range of estimates of the elasticities of DI application, award and labor

force non-participation rates, respectively, with respect to DI benefit levels. Bound and

2
 Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2015) examine the effect of local unemployment rates on DI applications and initial
allowances during the Great Recession; they find that virtually all of applications induced by the Great Recession
were denied at the initial level, although it is not clear how the additional applications fared in the appeal process.

                                                           2
Burkhauser (1999) reviewed the literature and found estimates in the range of 0.2-1.3

(applications), 0.3-0.4 (awards) and 0.2-1 (nonparticipation). Virtually all of these studies use

observational data on older workers (ages 45 and older) in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s. 3 Of

these, Kreider’s (1999) study using data from the 1978 Survey of Disability and Work is

generally considered the most credible (e.g., see Bound et al., 2004). Kreider estimates a

structural model of SSDI applications, awards and lifetime income inflows, and simulates the

effect of a 10 percent increase in DI benefit levels, finding an estimated 8.6 percent decline in DI

applications, for an elasticity of DI applications with respect to benefit levels of just under 0.9. 4

It is not clear how many of these induced applications would be allowed, but applying our

estimate of half the average allowance rate this translates to an elasticity of DI claiming with

respect to benefit generosity of 0.43—about three times lower than our estimated elasticity.

         An exception to the previous studies using observational data in the U.S. is a study by

Gruber (2000) that exploits quasi-experimental variation in DI benefit levels arising from a 1987

Canadian reform in all provinces except Quebec. 5 Using a difference-in-differences framework,

Gruber estimates that the 36 percent increase in DI benefit levels was associated with an 11.5

percent increase in the nonemployment rate among men ages 45-59 in the first two years after

the reform. These estimates imply a short run elasticity of nonemployment with respect to DI

benefit levels of around 0.3. To obtain the long run elasticity of nonemployment

(nonparticipation) we need to scale this estimate by the inverse of the fraction of the stock of DI

participants who are new entrants, approximately 20 percent in Austria. Thus, Gruber’s estimate


3
  Haveman and Wolfe (1984) attempt to instrument the DI replacement rate, recognizing it is endogenous, but they
have difficulty finding credible exclusion restrictions.
4
  Intriguingly, Kreider finds that when time (i.e., the waiting period) is eliminated from the model, the estimated
decline in applications is 1.3 times as large, or 11.1 percent.
5
  Campioleti (2004) examines the effect of a smaller ($50) increase in DI benefits in Quebec compared to other
provinces in 1973. His estimates of the effect of the reform on nonemployment are very small but extremely
imprecise, with standard errors on the order of five times larger than the estimated effects.

                                                         3
implies a long run elasticity of nonparticipation with respect to benefits of around 1.5, slightly

higher than our estimate of 1.2.

       Our large sample also allows us to examine heterogeneity in responsiveness to benefit

generosity on several different margins. We find that the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to

benefit generosity is highest for prime-age workers (ages 45-49) and increases with skill level

and prior earnings, consistent with the idea that very young or very old, low skilled and poorer

workers tend to have fewer labor market opportunities and thus less discretion in whether to

apply for DI benefits vs. continuing to work. Notably, we find that individuals experiencing a

current involuntary unemployment spell are much more responsive to DI benefit levels than

employed individuals. This is consistent with Autor and Duggan’s (2003) finding that

“conditional applicants,” or those applicants who apply for DI benefits only after losing their job,

are more responsive to DI incentives than non-conditional applicants in the U.S.

       The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and

institutional background on the Austrian DI system including a detailed description of the policy

reforms enacted between 1987 and 2010. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy for isolating

the effect of DI benefit level on labor force withdrawal, separating out the effect of unobserved

preferences for work that are correlated with both DI benefits. Section 4 presents the results of

our estimation models. Finally, Section 5 concludes.



2. Data and Institutional Background

2.1. The Austrian Social Security Database

       We use administrative data from the Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD), provided

by Hauptverband der Österreichischen Sozialversicherungsträger (the Austrian Social Security



                                                  4
Administration). The ASSD covers the universe of workers in Austria and contains detailed

information on the labor market and earnings histories of individuals beginning in 1972.

Specifically, all employment, unemployment, disability, sick leave, and retirement spells are

recorded. 6 Summaries of spells before 1972 (e.g., number of years employed, unemployed, etc.)

are available for individuals who have claimed a public pension by the end of 2008. At the

individual level, the ASSD contains information on gender, age, work experience, job tenure,

and blue- or white-collar status. 7 The ASSD also contains some firm-specific information such

as geographic region and industry affiliation. See Zweimüller et al. (2009) for a detailed

description of the data. Although the ASSD does not contain information on DI applications

(only claiming), we are able to merge to administrative application records starting in 2004.

        A key feature of the data set is that it provides all of the information necessary to

compute individuals’ hypothetical disability insurance (DI) benefits at any given point in time

and, with some minor assumptions, individuals’ hypothetical DI benefits under different policy

regimes, which is critical to our identification strategy (see Section 3). We verify the accuracy of

our calculations by comparing our predicted DI benefit levels with actual DI benefit payments

for the subsample of beneficiaries who received benefits in 2001 or who began receiving benefits

after 2001, using matched data obtained from the Austrian Social Security Administration.

Figure A1 in the appendix plots mean matched DI benefits against mean predicted DI benefits

(in 1,000-Euro bins), pooling all years together. Figure A2 presents matched vs. predicted DI

benefits by claiming year. In all years actual benefits track our predicted benefits very closely.

        Our main sample includes all male private sectors workers ages 35-59 during the time

period 1987-2010 who have not already claimed a disability pension. Although we can

  Individuals do not have to be receiving unemployment insurance benefits to be registered unemployed. Individuals
who have exhausted their UI benefits may still register as unemployed and receive General Assistance.
7
  Unfortunately, it is not possible to link individuals’ and their spouses’ earnings records.

                                                        5
confidently say that we are able to calculate potential DI benefits for men, unfortunately this is

not the case for women, since maternity leave spells are known to be observed with error in the

ASSD data. 8 Therefore, we focus our analysis on men only. We chose 1987 as the beginning of

our sample period in order to observe at least 180 months (15 years) of earnings for everyone in

our sample. We chose age 59 as the upper age limit because the early retirement age (ERA) in

Austria is age 60 for men and those who satisfy the eligibility requirements for early retirement

are not eligible for a disability pension. We limit the sample to private sector employees, who are

covered by the same pension system and hence face the same eligibility restrictions and financial

incentives. That is, we exclude self-employed and civil service workers who are covered by a

different pension system. 9 Our sample covers more than three quarters of all active labor market

participants in Austria.

         We construct the sample by defining a reference date, January 1, and obtaining

individuals’ information on factors that might affect DI application (i.e., previous earnings, and

demographic characteristics such as employed or registered unemployed) as of that date for each

year they are in the labor market. The main outcome of interest is whether they were observed to

receive disability insurance benefits within a year (i.e., by December 31). 10 For a subset of years

(2004-2010) we are able to observe applications in addition to claiming.

         Table 1 presents descriptive statistics, overall and grouped by observation period roughly

corresponding to the different policy regimes (see Section 2.3 for more details). During the


8
  Women also have different early and full retirement ages (55 and 60, respectively, for most of the sample period),
although these are shifting to become equal to those of men by 2033.
9
  One potential concern is that different policy regimes may induce individuals to switch from the private sector to
self-employment or the public sector or vice versa. However, transitions between sectors are rare—generally less
than 0.2-0.4 percent per year. Furthermore, we find no evidence of discontinuous changes in switching rates around
any of the pension reforms, suggesting that such strategic responses are not very common.
10
   Disability insurance spells are back-dated in the ASSD to the date the claim was filed, so an individual who
applied for disability benefits late in the calendar year and was awarded benefits in the next calendar year is
observed to “receive” disability benefits in the original calendar year.

                                                         6
twenty-three year sample period between 1987 and 2010, we observe just over 1.5 million

individuals, each for an average of 10.5 years between ages 35 and 59. At any given point in

time, the average individual in our sample is 45 years old. Approximately 10 percent of private

sector labor market participants are unemployed on any given January 1 and 54 percent are blue

collar workers. Thirteen percent claimed sick leave at some point in the last two years and the

average sick leave spell among claimants was 51 days (beyond the first 6-12 weeks, which are

covered by the individuals’ health insurance plan and not recorded in the ASSD). The average

worker was employed 13 out of the last 15 years.

        On average workers in our sample have accumulated 26 insurance years, which include

both contribution years (i.e., periods of employment, including sick leave) and non-contributory

periods of labor force participation (e.g., unemployment) over their working lives. The average

number of insurance years accumulated declined over the sample period, from 27.6 in 1987 to

25.1 in 2010. The average annual earnings in the year prior to observation is 33,364 Euros (in

2010 Euros), or $38,035 (1 Euro=$1.14), and increasing in real terms over the sample period. 11

Since wages in Austria are generally monotonically increasing over time, last year’s wage

generally exceeds average previous earnings calculated over the best 180 months of one’s career.

We calculated individuals’ hypothetical DI benefits if they were to claim disability in that year;

the average disability pension would be 17,845 Euros, or about 57 percent of the average wage

over the best 15 years. The inflow rate into DI from employment is 0.9 percent on average

throughout our sample period, starting at 1.35 percent in the mid-80s to mid-90s and declining

by more than 75 percent to 0.33 percent by the late-2000s. The inflow rate into DI from




11
  Following Austrian pension system rules, we calculate monthly earnings in all months in which we observe
positive earnings and then take the average.

                                                       7
unemployment is considerably larger, 4.7 percent on average over the sample period, and

correlates positively with national unemployment levels.

           To examine DI inflow rates among unemployed individuals, we constructed a second

sample of all involuntary UI spells occurring between 1987 and 2010. We identify involuntary

spells by limiting the sample to UI claims occurring within 28 days of the end date of the prior

employment spell since voluntary quitters must wait at least 28 days to start drawing UI benefits.

The last column of Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the UI sample. Compared to the

overall population, the average individual experiencing a UI spell in our sample period is much

more likely to be a blue collar worker (80.5%), much more likely to have drawn from sick leave

in the past two years (40.3%), and has on average two fewer years of work experience and three

and half fewer insurance years. His prior year’s earnings are about 30% lower than the average

over the entire population and his replacement rate (defined as the ratio of DI benefit to the

average wage over best 180 months) is about 5% lower. The DI inflow rate from unemployment

spells is 5.25 percent. 12



2.2. The Austrian Disability Insurance Program

           Like the United States and other countries, the Austrian disability insurance (DI) program

is part of a larger Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance system that is financed by a

payroll tax on earned income and provides pension benefits to qualifying workers who have

accumulated enough labor market experience (insurance years). Generally, a disabled worker in

Austria must have accumulated at least 5 insurance years within the last 10 years to be eligible

for DI benefits; the insurance years requirement increases month for month after age 50 up to a



12
     For the UI spell sample, we measure DI receipt from within one year of the UI spell end date.

                                                            8
maximum of 15 insurance years. 13 The insurance years requirement does not apply if the

disability is job-related; for each occupation there exists an explicit list of qualifying

impairments. To apply for benefits, individuals must submit an application to the local DI office.

Employees at the DI office first check whether applicants meet the insurance years criteria. In a

second stage, a team of disability examiners and physicians assesses the medical severity of the

disability and the applicant’s ability to work. Disability pensions are awarded to individuals

whose earnings capacity, due to a physical or mental health impairment, has been reduced to less

than half of the earnings capacity of a healthy person with comparable education in any

“reasonable” occupation the individual could be expected to hold. 14 The standard is relaxed at

age 57 by changing the comparison from a healthy worker performing any type of work in the

economy to a healthy worker in a similar occupation. 15

         Unlike DI applicants in the U.S., DI applicants in Austria are not required to reduce their

earnings below a given threshold (or separate from their employers) in order to apply for

benefits. 16 Like many European countries, employed individuals may draw sickness benefits

from their employers—up to 52 weeks (assuming they have worked at least 6 months in the

previous 12 months before onset) —while applying for DI (Social Security Administration,

2012). In addition, individuals who are or become disabled while unemployed can apply for DI

benefits while continuing to receive unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. Applying for DI

13
   Note the work history requirement in the U.S. is similar to that in Austria: 20 covered quarters (or 5 years) earned
in the last 10 years, with fewer credits required before age 31 and more required after age 42 up to a maximum of 40
quarters (or 10 years).
14
   Practically, eligibility standards are less strict for white collar workers, whose set of reasonable occupations is
more limited.
15
   Prior to 1997, the age at which disability screening is relaxed was 55 for both men and women (see Staubli, 2011).
In 1997 (2000), the age was raised to 57 for men (women). Practically, access to disability insurance in the U.S. is
also relaxed at older ages (50 and 55, depending on impairment severity) for workers with limited education and
skill level (see Chen and van der Klaauw, 2008).
16
   However, it is the case that DI beneficiaries earning more than 380 Euros per month (approx. $484) would lose up
to 50 percent of their benefits, depending on their earnings. (In the U.S. DI beneficiaries earning more than approx.
$1,000 per month would lose their entire benefit.)

                                                          9
benefits while unemployed does not stop the clock on individuals’ maximum UI benefit

durations but it does suspend the requirement that individuals must actively search for work.

The acceptance rate for initial DI applications in 2010 was just over 40 percent according to

official statistics; about 60 percent of rejected applicants appeal, of whom 20 percent are

ultimately awarded benefits, implying an ultimate award rate of 47 percent. In our sample, the

ultimate allowance rate is slightly higher (55 percent) since we exclude younger workers below

age 35. We are not aware of any changes to DI screening policy over our time period with the

exception of a change in the age of relaxed screening discussed above. 17 Once receiving DI

benefits, very few claimants (fewer than 4 percent) ever leave the DI rolls because of medical

improvements and return to work.

         The formula for computing DI benefits is the same one used to compute old age (Social

Security) pensions. 18 Generally it consists of a pension coefficient (PC), which varies by age and

insurance years, multiplied by an assessment basis (AB), which is average indexed capped

earnings over a given period of time (e.g., the last 120 months (10 years) in 1987 at the

beginning of our observation period). Younger DI beneficiaries with limited work experience are

eligible for a “special increment” to supplement their accumulated insurance years up to a certain

amount to compensate for their limited ability to establish long work histories. For example, in

1987, individuals younger than age 50 who had accumulated less than 26.3 insurance years could

add one additional “insurance year” for each year less than age 50 up to a maximum of 26.3 total

insurance years (i.e., up to a maximum pension coefficient of 50).




17
   Unfortunately we cannot directly test this since any observed changes to award rates over time are partially due to
changes in the applicant pool induced by the reforms.
18
   We include controls for old age pension levels in a robustness check.

                                                         10
         The rules governing eligibility and calculation of benefits have been publicly available at

www.sozdok.at since 2001 and are also published (with examples) in a series of books (see

Marek (1987-2001; 2002-2005; 2006-2010) for the years covering our sample period).



2.3. Policy Reforms

         To identify the effect of benefit levels on DI pension claiming, we exploit exogenous

variation in DI benefits between 1987 and 2010 stemming from a number of changes to the DI

benefit formula in 1988, 1993, 1996, 2000 and 2004. Starting in 1988, Austria enacted a series of

reforms designed to decrease pension levels and introduce bonuses (penalties) for delayed (early)

claiming. 19 However, not all reforms were detrimental to all potential DI recipients; as a result,

we observe both increases and decreases in DI pension levels during our sample period that are

independent of changes in work histories and preferences over time. The reforms were

immediately implemented (or in some cases phased in) without grandfathering any cohorts into

the previous regime. 20

         Table 2 summarizes the rules used to compute DI pensions between 1987 and 2010. The

first two columns describe changes to the assessment basis (AB) and pension coefficient (PC)

formulas respectively and the third column describes other important changes such as the age of

relaxed screening for DI benefits or changes to the old age (OA) pension program, which could

affect DI participation for older individuals on the margin of claiming DI and waiting until

eligible for (early) retirement benefits. 21 We are not aware of any changes in screening policy


19
   While initially the reforms aimed to encourage delayed retirement/claiming of old age pensions, they also affected
DI pensions since the programs were connected through the shared benefit formula. Later reforms broke apart this
relationship and added penalties specific to claiming DI pensions.
20
   With the exception of the 1993 and 1996 reforms, which were implemented in July and September respectively,
the new DI benefit rules went into effect on January 1. Current beneficiaries were not affected by the reforms.
21
   Disability benefits are subject to regular income taxes and over the course of our study period the income tax
system was changed in 1989, 1994, 2000, 2005, and 2009. These reforms generally lowered the income tax liability

                                                         11
around the time of the reforms other than a change in policy affecting older workers ages 55-57

occurring in 1997 (discussed below).

         Figures 1A and 1B illustrate the effect of the reforms on the average AB and PC,

respectively, by age group and observation year for three different fixed cohorts of individuals

(those observed in 1990, 2000 and 2010). 22 For example, panel A tracks on the y-axis the AB

(PC) calculated under different pension rules (x-axis) for a fixed cohort of individuals observed

in 1990. The increase in AB across panels is due to real earnings growth over time. Figure 2

combines the effects of the reforms on the individual components of the pension formulas and

shows the distribution of year-to-year changes in the overall hypothetical DI pension

immediately following each reform for a fixed (1997) cohort. Below we discuss the main

features of each reform.

         Initially, in 1987, an individual’s DI pension was based on an AB of the last 120 months

(10 years) of earnings and a PC increasing by 1.9 percentage points for each insurance year up to

30, and by 1.5 percentage points thereafter, up to a maximum PC of 80. A special increment was

added to IY for DI beneficiaries under age 50 with insufficient IY (see Section 2.2). 23 The 1988

reform gradually increased the length of the AB by 12 months each year between 1988 and 1992,

to the last 180 months (15 years) of earnings in 1992, while holding the pension coefficient

formula fixed. As Figure 1A shows, because earnings are generally monotonically increasing in

Austria, these changes had the effect of decreasing the average benefit level for all age groups

by cutting tax rates and increasing deductions. We estimate a version of the model using after-tax benefits to account
for these changes and find that it lowers the estimated elasticity (see Section 4).
22
   Figures A3-A5 illustrate the PC formula as a function of insurance years (IY) for individuals aged 47, 55 and 59,
respectively, under the different pension regimes, including any penalties for early claiming applied in later years.
Since the changes to the PC under the 2000 and 2004 reforms were phased in, we illustrate the PC formulas in 2003
and 2010, at the end of each regime. Note the AB does not depend on age or IY but varies primarily by the number
of months over which earnings are averaged.
23
   The solid line in Figure A3 illustrates the effect of the special increment on PC for an individual at age 47.
Individuals with fewer than 26.3 (=50/1.9) IY received three “bonus” IY in the calculation of their PC up to a
maximum PC of 50.

and cohorts. As can be seen in Figure 2, the 1988-1992 reform to the AB had a detrimental effect

on DI benefits for about 80 percent of potential claimants, a negligible effect for 10 percent of

potential claimants, and a slightly positive effect for the remaining potential claimants.

        The 1993 reform, in contrast, made DI benefits more generous by increasing the age

before which the special increment applied, from 50 to 56, and at the same time increasing the

maximum supplemented PC from 50 to 60. 24 For many relatively younger individuals the

effective minimum PC set by the “special increment” rules was binding both before and after the

1993 change; as a result the reform increased DI pensions by 20 percent almost exactly for

almost one quarter of the sample (see Figure 2). Figure 1B illustrates the effect of the reforms on

the mean PC by age group and observation year. As can be seen in the figure, the 1993 reform

leads to a large increase in the PC for all age groups, with the largest increase coming from the

youngest individuals. The 1993 reform also affected the assessment basis by changing it from the

last 180 months of earnings to the best 180 months of earnings, which could only increase

benefit levels. As a result, no one was adversely affected by the 1993 reform (Figure 2).

         The 1996 reform reduced the return to IY before 30 IY, from 1.9 percent to 1.83 percent,

and increased the return to IY thereafter, from 1.5 percent to 1.675 percent. Combined with the

introduction of a penalty for “early” claiming (before age 60) for those individuals with 33 to 40

IY (see Table 2), this had the effect of decreasing pensions for about 40 percent of potential

claimants (see Figure 2). 25 It did not affect pensions for those at the maximum PC under the

special increment rules or for older individuals with very high insurance years (see Figures A3-

A5). Notably, the 1996 reform also changed the age of relaxed screening for DI benefits from 55

24
   For example, a 47-year old could now receive nine “bonus” IY (from three) up to a maximum PC of 60 (from 50)
(see Figure A3). A 55-year old could now receive one bonus IY up to a maximum PC of 60, increasing PCs for all
those with fewer than 32 (=(60-1.9*30)/1.5+30) IY (see Figure A4).
25
   The reform reduced pensions by exactly 3.683 (=(1.9-1.83)/1.9) percent for a small group of potential claimants
with fewer than 30 insurance years who were not eligible for the special increment.

                                                        13
to 57 for men, which led to large reductions in DI claimants among older men independent of the

reform’s effect on benefit levels (Staubli, 2011).

       The 2000 reform broke apart the connection between the DI and OA pension formulas,

introduced a plateau in the PC at 60 and further (gradually) reduced the return to IY before the

plateau and increased the return to IY after the plateau. (See Table 2, and Figures A4 and A5.)

Similar to the 1996 reform, this had the effect of decreasing DI benefits for any potential

claimants whose PC was not at the maximum PC under the special increment rules. The reform

also increased the early retirement age from 60 to 61.5 for men (Staubli and Zweimüller, 2013).

       Finally, the 2004 reform reversed some of the changes of the 2000 reform. The reform

reunified the DI and old age pension formulas and linearized the (gradually decreasing) return to

IY (in line with the OA pension formula since 2000). It phased in a new age of special increment

from age 56 to age 60. However, at the same time it increased the penalty for early claiming and

raised the early retirement age from 61.5 to 62 for men. In addition, the reform gradually

increased the length of the AB from 180 months to 480 months by 2028, thereby decreasing the

generosity of benefits. As a result, the reform resulted in a large scale curtailment of benefits

(especially for old age pension claimants) which was met with intense public criticism.

Responding to the backlash, the Austrian government passed legislation in 2005 that reduced the

maximum penalty for early retirement from 15 percent to 5-6.5 percent of the projected pension

from the 2000 reform (with higher penalties phased in over time) and enlarged the group of

people who were not affected by the raise in the early retirement age. Thus, the effect of the

2004/05 reform was to increase pension levels for some (mostly workers with very low IY) and

decrease pension levels for almost everyone else (see Figure 2).




                                                 14
        Figure 3 gives us a first look at how the reforms affected DI inflow rates (panel B) as DI

replacement rates (panel A) rose and fell over the same time period. While we see some evidence

that changes in DI inflows generally track changes in replacement rates the time series are

generally noisy and seem to indicate that other factors may have largely influenced overall

patterns in DI inflows over time. In the next section we discuss our strategy to isolate changes in

DI inflows stemming from changes in benefit levels due to the policy reforms vs. changes in

other factors that may have influenced DI receipt over time.



3. Empirical Strategy

        To estimate the elasticity of labor force withdrawal with respect to benefit generosity, we

are interested in estimating regressions of the form:

                                     yit= X it b + γ bt ( Z it ) + φt + ε it ,                          (1)

where yit is a labor supply outcome such as DI claiming for individual i observed at time t who

has not already claimed DI benefits, X it is a vector of demographic and labor market

characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status, experience, earnings in the previous year), bt ( Z it ) are

(lagged) log potential DI benefits which are a function (potentially varying with t) of a subset of

labor market characteristics Z it ∈ X it (e.g., age, insurance years, and assessment basis), φt are

year fixed effects, and ε it are any unobserved factors affecting DI claiming such as tastes for

work. The parameter of interest is γ , the effect of log DI benefits on DI claiming, which, when

scaled by the DI inflow rate, directly gives the claiming elasticity.

        A problem may arise if the benefit formula b does not vary across individuals. In this

case, if b is a linear function of Z it then, even if all of the components of Z it are orthogonal to



                                                       15
unobserved tastes ε it , we cannot separately identify the effect of the benefit level from the

effects of the individual components of Z it . For example, if benefits are a linear function of past

wages, then benefits are perfectly collinear with past wages and we cannot independently vary

them; thus we cannot identify γ .

            If, on the other hand, b is a non-linear function of Z it and E[ε it | Z it ] = 0 then we can

independently vary b and Z it and identify both γ and β . Even if E[ε it | Z it ] = kZ it (where Z it

may contain polynomials or other transformations of one or more of its elements) we can

identify γ , if not β , in the case of a single benefit formula that applies to all individuals. In this

case, Z it serves as a control function such that, conditional on Z it , b is orthogonal to ε it and the

estimated coefficient on b obtained by OLS regression of equation (1) is unbiased as long as the

components of Z it are correctly specified. The problem with this identification strategy is that it

relies heavily on functional form. For example, if benefits are a nonlinear function of past wages

where the replacement rate falls as wage rises (as is the case in most countries), a problem could

arise if preferences for work also vary with earnings history in a concave fashion that cannot be

captured by a polynomial function or other transformation of earnings that could serve as a

control function. 26

             A way around this impasse occurs if another policy regime (i.e., different benefit

formula) were observed. Then observing individuals’ behavior under the different policy regimes

would enable one to break apart even a nonlinear relationship between benefits and unobserved

factors. Intuitively, one can use the second policy regime to implement a “difference in


26
     This approach is identified based on residual variation in benefit levels after netting out the effect of   Z it on b. In
our case regressing benefits on age, insurance years and assessment basis produces an R of 0.903. If the R2 is too
                                                                                               2

high, and hence the residual variation too low, then this will inflate the standard error of the coefficient on log
benefits in equation (1).

                                                              16
differences” (DID) type estimation strategy, where identification is obtained by relating

individuals’ differential responses to the reform to their differential exposure in terms of change

in benefits. To do this, we implement a control function approach that calculates hypothetical

benefits under each policy regime for each individual and includes them as controls in the

regression:

                                                                   R
                                   yit= X it b + γ bt ( Z it ) + ∑ κ r br ( Z it ) + φt + υit ,         (2)
                                                                 r =2


where br ( Z it ) represents hypothetical benefits under policy regime r=2,…,R, where R is the total

number of policy regimes observed. Conditioning on the hypothetical benefit variables ensures

the actual benefit is uncorrelated with unobservable factors and an OLS regression of equation

(2) gives an unbiased estimate of the effect of DI benefit levels on labor force withdrawal. This

approach has been used by Nielsen et al. (2010) to study the response of college enrollment to

changes in student aid arising from a Danish reform and by Fevang et al. (forthcoming) to study

the effect of temporary disability insurance (TDI) benefits on the duration and outcome of TDI

spells using policy variation in Norway.

           A simple example illustrates the intuition of our approach. 27 Let Z it be a scalar binary

variable that takes on one of two values, Z LOW or Z HIGH . Then benefits under policy regime r

take on two values, brLOW and brHIGH corresponding to the respective values of Z it . Assume that

there are two policy regimes r=1,2. Then, suppressing conditioning on X,

                                             E[ yi1 | Z=
                                                       d] γ b1d + κ b2d , and                           (3)

                                                             (γ + κ ) b2d + φ ,
                                             E[ yi 2 | Z d ] =                                          (4)




27
     This example was inspired by Nielsen et al. (2010).

                                                              17
where d=LOW,HIGH. Then the difference between pre- and post-reform outcomes for an

individual with Z it = Z d is:

                                    E[ yi1 | Z d ] − E[ yi 2 | Z d ]= γ ( b1d − b2d ) − φ .                         (5)

Subtracting this difference for d=HIGH vs. d=LOW and rearranging yields the following:

                      [ E[ yi1 | Z HIGH ] − E[ yi 2 | Z HIGH ]] − [ E[ yi1 | Z LOW ] − E[ yi 2 | Z LOW ]]
                 γ=                                                                                             .   (6)
                                            (b1
                                               HIGH
                                                      − b2HIGH ) − ( b1LOW − b2LOW )

Thus, γ is identified by the ratio of the average difference in differences of the outcome y to the

difference in differences of the benefit b. In a regular DID framework in which a treatment group

is compared to a control group, the difference in benefits for the control group (say those with

Z = Z LOW ) would be zero and (6) gives the DID estimate scaled by the “first stage” estimate of

the effect of the reform on benefit levels for the treatment group. In the example above, even

though both groups are treated by the reform, the fact that they are treated differentially allows us

to identify γ . In the case of the disability insurance reforms observed in this paper, every cluster

of individuals with a unique set of characteristics Z it that affect disability benefits (i.e., age,

insurance years and average prior earnings) serves as a comparison group, so our estimate is

based on approximately 2,334 differential responses to potential benefits under six different

policy regimes with 19 different benefit formulas (due to the phased-in nature of many of the

reforms). 28

        To test the appropriateness of our identification strategy, we estimate a series of placebo

regressions in which we randomly assign individuals’ potential benefits from a different year,

with and without hypothetical benefits in the control variables. If conditioning on hypothetical

DI benefits indeed isolates the policy-induced variation in DI benefits, then we expect the

28
 We cluster observations by the individual’s age in years, number of insurance years (twenty-three two-year
categories) and assessment basis (five quintiles).

                                                             18
coefficient on randomized benefits in this regression to be insignificant and close to zero when

hypothetical benefits are included as controls but not necessarily otherwise. Table A1 presents

the results of these placebo regressions. The first column presents estimates with base controls,

which include age dummies, two-year insurance year group dummies and assessment basis. This

is equivalent to estimating a placebo version of equation (1) with X it = Z it , so that all control

variables are variables that affect the DI benefit level directly. The second column presents

estimates with saturated controls, that is, including in addition to the base controls a number of

variables capturing job tenure, prior sick leave, maximum UI benefit duration, industry, region

(of the firm), blue collar status, Austrian national status and 4th order polynomials in last year’s

wage and average wage in the best 180 months ( Z it ∈ X it ). The last column presents estimates

adding controls for hypothetical benefits. We find a positive and statistically significant effect of

random DI benefits on DI claiming in the models without controls for hypothetical benefits;

however, once we control for hypothetical benefits, we estimate a very small, precise and

statistically insignificant effect of random DI benefits on DI claiming.

        An implicit assumption of our preferred methodology is that individuals with the same

Z it , and hence the same potential benefits, at different points in time are comparable to one

another. That is, we assume someone with the same age, insurance years and average past

earnings has the same unobservable factors affecting DI claiming (e.g., preferences for work) in

1987 as they do in 2010. There is reason to be skeptical of this assumption. For example, earlier

we noted that real earnings increased and insurance years decreased over our 23-year time period

(see Table 1). These changes could be driven by changes in another factor (e.g., education) that

also affects unobservable tastes or they could reflect changes in unobservable tastes over time.

Furthermore, as Figure A6 (Panel A) illustrates, the distribution of potential benefits calculated


                                                  19
under any given year’s rules (1997 in the figure) is observed to shift upward with each later

cohort, so that an individual in the 1990s who is in the upper tail of the potential benefits

distribution would find himself compared to an individual in the 2000s who is closer to the

middle of the same base year’s potential benefits distribution.

       One way to indirectly test the plausibility of this assumption is to see whether there are

changes in observable characteristics over time conditional on potential benefits in a given base

year (1997). To do this we ran a series of regressions of various observable characteristics (years

of tenure, number of sick days in the last two years, etc.) on indicators for quartile of 1997

benefits, year dummies and the interaction of benefit quartile and year dummies. Figure 4 plots

the estimated coefficients on the interaction terms with 95 percent confidence intervals. As can

be seen in the figure, the interaction terms are all closely centered around zero; that is, consistent

with our identifying assumption, observable characteristics tend to evolve in parallel over time

conditional on potential benefits.


4. Results

       We apply each approach discussed above in turn to estimate the effect of DI benefit

generosity on DI claiming (i.e., separate regressions by year, and pooled regression without and

with hypothetical benefits as controls). Since we analyze decisions over the course of a calendar

year, yet two of the changes (1993 and 1996) were implemented at a point other than January 1,

we measure benefits as the weighted average of benefits over the year in those cases. (For

example, since the 1996 reform was implemented in September, we calculate benefits in 1996 as

two-thirds of the 1995 benefit plus one-third of the 1996 benefit.) Similarly, we include a

variable indicating eligibility for relaxed screening that weights eligibility over the year (e.g., an

individual who turns 57 in September is eligible for relaxed screening one-third of the year).

                                                  20
Finally, we assume a one-year lag to learn the new DI benefit level after a policy reform. We

also estimate the model using current-year benefits as a robustness check. To account for cross-

sectional correlation within groups and serial correlation across time, we cluster standard errors

by cells according to an individual’s age in years, number of insurance years (twenty-three two-

year categories), and assessment basis (five quintiles) because these three variables determine the

policy-induced variation in benefits. 29 The total number of clusters is 2,334.



4.1. The Effect of Disability Insurance Benefit Generosity on Claiming

        In this section we present estimates of the effect of disability insurance (DI) benefit levels

on DI pension receipt in Austria. First, we estimate separate regressions of equation (1) for each

year 1987-2010. Next, we pool individuals from all years to estimate the same regression with

and without hypothetical benefits calculated under each of the policy regimes as a control

function. We estimate several robustness checks to examine the sensitivity of our estimates to

different samples and specifications. In the next section, we examine heterogeneity in the

estimated claiming elasticities for different observable characteristics such as age, blue vs. white

collar status, lifetime earnings and employment status. Finally, we present estimates of the effect

of DI benefit levels on applications and awards for 2004-2010, the years in which we observe

application records.

        Table 3 presents cross sectional estimates separately for each year between 1987 and

2010. The first set of estimates presents models with base controls ( X it = Z it ) and the second set

of estimates presents models with saturated controls ( Z it ∈ X it ), defined above. As Table 3

shows, the estimated effects of benefit levels on DI claiming in Austria are generally between

29
   We experimented with different levels of clustering including clustering on individual, Z*year and year alone. We
find that statistical inference is not sensitive to the level of clustering.

                                                        21
0.01 and 0.03, implying that a one percent increase in benefits is associated with a 0.01-0.03

percentage point increase in DI inflow. The estimates are not very sensitive to whether the base

or saturated controls are included; sometimes the estimates are smaller with saturated controls,

sometimes larger. Since DI inflow rates are on average 0.016 over this time period, the estimates

imply a claiming elasticity with respect to DI benefit generosity in the range of 0.6 to 2.

       Table 4 presents estimates of the DI benefit elasticity pooling individuals over the entire

sample period. Columns 1 and 2 present pooled versions of the models presented in Table 3,

respectively, and column 3 presents estimates adding hypothetical benefits calculated under each

of the policy regimes in order to control flexibly for nonlinear variation in unobservable tastes

for work that may also vary across cohorts. As expected, the estimates without the hypothetical

benefits center around 0.02, roughly the center of the year-by-year estimates. Including

hypothetical benefits to the pooled model does not change the estimate substantially. In this case

we fail to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the hypothetical benefits are jointly zero

(p=0.141). Scaling the estimated coefficient on log benefits by the DI inflow rate, we estimate an

elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benefit generosity of 1.2. (See Table 4 for the implied

elasticity and standard error, estimated via delta method.) That is, we estimate for every one

percent increase in DI benefit levels, an additional 1.2 percent of labor force participants will

withdraw from the labor market and become a DI beneficiary.

       Table 5 presents several robustness checks to examine the sensitivity of our estimates to

different subsamples and specifications. First, we add into our sample those individuals ages 60-

64 (below the full retirement age) who are not eligible for early retirement because they lack

sufficient insurance years. Including these individuals does not have a significant impact on the

estimated elasticity. Even if we exclude those who may qualify for old age retirement benefits, it



                                                 22
may be the case that forward-looking individuals are influenced by changes in the old age

pension system coinciding with the DI reforms. Therefore we estimate a version of the model

where we include one’s potential old age pension in the controls. As can be seen in Table 5, this

also has a negligible impact on the estimated elasticity.

       As discussed in Section 2, the insurance years restriction on DI benefits does not apply if

the disability is job-related. In our baseline specification, we included all labor market

participants under age 60, but we also estimate a version of the model where we exclude those

with insufficient insurance years to qualify for DI benefits for non-job-related impairments. We

estimate a larger labor supply elasticity with respect to DI benefits close to 2 for this restricted

group, which is likely because individuals who qualify based on job-related disabilities have a

job by construction and are therefore more likely to be able to retain their attachment to the labor

force and use discretion when applying for DI benefits.

       Also as discussed in Section 2, DI benefits are taxed and there were several changes to

the tax system during our time period, some of which coincide with the DI reforms. We

estimated a version of the model using after-tax benefits and found a smaller elasticity of one.

This may be due to potential DI claimants having a harder time calculating after-tax vs. pre-tax

benefit levels. The lower after-tax elasticity also likely reflects attenuation bias due to

measurement error in post-tax benefits since we estimate individuals’ tax liabilities using their

earned income vs. total income which contains several income categories (most notably capital

and rental income) that we do not observe. We also estimated a version of the model on current

log benefits instead of lagged benefits and again found a smaller response to changes in current

benefits, which likely reflects a lag in learning the details of the reforms. Note in these last two

cases including the control function of hypothetical benefits to isolate the policy-induced (and



                                                  23
therefore exogenous) variation in benefits is vital to estimating an unbiased elasticity of claiming

with respect to benefits; the hypothetical benefit control variables are jointly statistically

significant (p<0.05).

       We explore the sensitivity of our estimates to model specification by estimating a discrete

time Cox proportional hazard model using logistic regression. An advantage of the proportional

hazard specification is that the coefficient on log benefits gives the elasticity directly. When we

estimate the model using a proportional hazard specification, we estimate an elasticity of 1.4,

slightly higher than our baseline estimate of 1.2 but not statistically different.

       Finally, as discussed in Section 3, we explore the sensitivity of our estimates to the

identifying assumption that individuals with the same age, insurance years and average past

earnings are comparable to one another over time. First, we reweight the sample to hold the

distribution of age, insurance years and earnings fixed at their 1997 levels throughout the 1987-

2010 time period and re-estimate the model on the reweighted sample. Reweighting the sample

has little impact on the estimated elasticity (1.20 vs. 1.23). Next, we control for percentile-

ranked hypothetical benefits instead of actual hypothetical benefits in the control function (see

Figure A6). In this specification we are leveraging changes in DI claiming behavior across

individuals in the same quantile of the benefits distribution over time. For example, we compare

someone in the 1990s in the 90th percentile of the potential benefits distribution with all other

individuals in the same percentile of the potential benefits distribution in any given year. The

estimated elasticity is slightly higher, 1.35; note that the percentile-ranked hypothetical benefits

are jointly highly statistically significant (p<0.001).




                                                  24
4.2. Heterogeneity in the Effect of DI Benefit Generosity on Claiming

           To examine heterogeneity in claiming responses, Table 6 presents estimates of our

preferred specification (with hypothetical DI benefits as controls) separately by different groups.

Some interesting patterns emerge. Most notably, despite the fact that DI inflow rates increase

sharply with age, especially at ages 50 and 55, the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to

benefit generosity is actually highest for prime-age workers (ages 45-49). (The estimated effects

for younger workers are small and imprecise.) This contradicts conventional wisdom that older

individuals tend to use the DI system as an alternative pathway to early retirement whereas

prime-age individuals are unlikely to exit the labor force unless they are facing very serious

health conditions. We also find that white collar workers are more sensitive to changes in DI

benefit levels than blue collar workers and richer individuals (in terms of lifetime earnings) are

more sensitive than poorer individuals; in both cases the former group is likely to have more

labor market opportunities than the latter group. Moreover, eligibility criteria for white collar

workers in Austria are generally less strict than that for blue collar workers (see Section 2.2).

           Next we divide individuals into quartiles based on (1997) potential benefits and

regressing DI inflow on DI benefits within each quartile. We find that the estimated elasticity is

increasing in the benefit level, more than five-fold between the bottom and top quartiles of DI

benefits, from 0.35 to 2.0. 30 This suggests that DI benefits may be higher than optimal for those

who receive higher benefits.

            Finally, the estimated elasticity for DI claiming is three times higher for individuals

currently experiencing an involuntary unemployment spell compared with the overall labor force

(largely made up of employed workers). We find that a one percent increase in DI benefits leads

to a nearly 0.2 percentage point increase in DI claiming among this group. Since 5.25 percent of
30
     The average DI benefits in each quartile are: 1) 10,217; 2) 15,502; 3) 19,718; and 4) 25,944.

                                                            25
UI spells transition to DI, this amounts to a nearly 3.8 percent increase in DI inflow rates from

UI. Thus, laid off workers are much more influenced by financial incentives than employed

workers when making decisions about withdrawing from remaining in the labor force, although

this may be specific to Austria’s institutional environment which allows unemployed workers to

simultaneously search for work and seek disability benefits.



4.3. The Effect of DI Benefit Generosity on Applications and Awards

         Finally, we investigate the role of the application screening process by examining the

effect of DI benefits on applications, compared with DI inflow, for the years in which we are

able to match application records, 2004-2010. Although the elasticity of DI claiming with respect

to benefits is important for fiscal solvency, the elasticity of DI applications with respect to

benefits is presumably a better measure of the level of moral hazard occurring in the DI system.

The ratio of the two elasticities is also informative about the effectiveness of the application

screening process, since an effective screening process should be more likely to reject applicants

induced by an increase in DI benefits, who are on the margin of applying for DI and continuing

to remain in the labor force.

         Table 7 presents the results of these analyses. The first column presents estimates of the

effect of log lagged DI benefits on DI applications and the second column presents estimates of

the effect of log lagged DI benefit on DI inflow (=awards) restricted to the years 2004-2010

using our preferred specification controlling for potential DI benefits in all years. Note that we

estimate a lower claiming elasticity, 0.7, over this time period compared with the entire 1987-

2010 sample period. 31 This is likely because the 2004-2010 period experienced the lowest


31
  This estimate is much lower than the average implied elasticity from Table 3 because it includes potential benefits
as controls, which are highly statistically significant (p<0.001) in the 2004-2010 period.

                                                         26
replacement rates observed over our sample period. We also observe a slightly lower percentage

of potential claimants, 1.2 percent, receiving DI benefits in any given year in the 2004-2010

period compared with the overall sample period.

       In 2004-2010 2.35 percent of potential claimants applied for benefits in any given year

and 1.2 percent were awarded benefits, implying an award rate of 51 percent (= 1.2/1.25) for the

average applicant. We find that DI benefit levels have a strong influence on the probability of

filing a DI application. A one percent increase in DI benefits increases the application rate by

0.032 percentage points, or 1.4 percent. This implies that the award rate for the marginal

applicant, induced to apply for DI benefits by a 1 percent increase in the benefit level, is 26

percent (=0.0085/0.032)—approximately half the award rate for the average applicant in this

time period.



5. Discussion and Conclusion

       While disability insurance (DI) programs are generally intended to insure against the risk

of acquiring a career-ending health impairment, often individuals who would qualify for DI

choose to work, at least for a time, instead. Understanding what drives these decisions is

important for designing effective reforms, which are necessary to guarantee the financial stability

of public pension systems. If individuals are relatively elastic in their labor supply responses to

DI benefit levels, then cutting DI benefits will induce many potential DI entrants to remain in the

labor force and significantly decrease program participation. On the other hand, if individuals are

relatively inelastic, then cutting DI benefits is only likely to harm disabled workers who would

not otherwise choose to work or try to find work after the onset of a disabling health condition.




                                                 27
          Using detailed administrative data and policy variation in DI benefits stemming from a

series of national pension reforms in Austria between 1987 and 2010, we find convincing

evidence that the labor supply of Austrian workers is responsive to DI benefit levels. We find

that the DI claiming rate increased by 1.2 percent per 1 percent increase in DI benefits over the

entire sample period, and by 0.7 percent per 1 percent increase in DI benefits between 2004 and

2010, when average replacement rates were at their lowest. Our findings are fairly robust to

sample selection and model specification. Because Austrian DI applicants are not required to quit

their jobs or refrain from receiving unemployment insurance benefits during the disability

determination period (unlike in some other systems, e.g., the U.S.), in this setting the elasticity of

DI claiming with respect to DI benefit generosity is equivalent to the elasticity of labor force

withdrawal. 32

          The elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benefit generosity is highest for prime-age

workers (ages 45-49) and increases with skill level and prior earnings, consistent with the idea

that very young or very old, low skilled and poorer workers tend to have fewer labor market

opportunities and thus less discretion in whether to apply for DI benefits vs. continuing to work.

We also find that (involuntarily) unemployed individuals are extremely responsive to benefit

levels.

          Note that the application screening process—particularly at the appeals level—dampens

but does not eliminate the responsiveness of DI claiming to benefit levels. We find the elasticity

of DI applications with respect to benefit generosity is more than twice as high as the elasticity

of DI claiming in 2004-2010. This implies the marginal applicant induced to apply for DI

benefits due to a 1 percent increase in benefit levels is half as likely to be allowed as the average

32
  In the U.S., where withdrawing from the labor market to apply for DI benefits can adversely affect subsequent
reemployment, the effect of DI benefits on labor force withdrawal is likely larger than the effect of benefits on DI
claiming (see, e.g., Autor et al., 2015).

                                                         28
applicant. Thus, it is important to account for a lower allowance rate among marginal applicants

when linking estimates of the elasticity of DI applications to changes in the number of DI

beneficiaries.

       One caveat in interpreting our estimates as applicable to other settings is that under

Austria’s rules DI applicants do not have to withdraw from the labor market in order to apply for

benefits but only do so if they are awarded benefits. It is not clear how this difference would

affect the magnitude of the elasticity, since on the one hand the lower cost of application may

encourage more individuals to try their luck but on the other hand rejected applicants do not face

significant barriers to work since they do not have to re-enter the labor market after a potentially

lengthy absence. Additionally, Austria’s universal health insurance system and strong public

safety net may also encourage applications to a greater extent than in other countries such as the

U.S. (although recent changes in the availability of health insurance outside the employment

relationship and DI participation in the U.S. as a result of the Affordable Care Act may make the

two countries more comparable in recent years).
