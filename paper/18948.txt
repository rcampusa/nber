                                              ABSTRACT

Informal care is the largest source of long-term care for elderly, surpassing home health care and nursing
home care. By definition, informal care is unpaid. It remains a puzzle why so many adult children
give freely of their time. Transfers of time to the older generation may be balanced by financial transfers
going to the younger generation. This leads to the question of whether informal care and inter-vivos
transfers are causally related. We analyze data from the 1999 and 2003 waves of National Longitudinal
Survey of Mature Women. We examine whether the elderly parents give more inter-vivos monetary
transfers to adult children who provide informal care, by examining both the extensive and intensive
margins of financial transfers and of informal care. We find statistically significant results that a child
who provides informal care is more likely to receive inter-vivos transfers than a sibling who does not.
If a child does provide care, there is no statistically significant effect on the amount of the transfer.

Introduction

        Informal care is the largest source of long-term care for elderly, surpassing home health

care and nursing home care (Norton 2000). By definition, informal care is unpaid. Yet

providing informal care takes time away from other activities, may require loss of income, and

even can worsen the health of the caregiver (Coe and Van Houtven 2009). Given these costs and

the many alternatives to informal care, it remains a puzzle why so many adult children give

freely of their time.

        Informal care is not the only transfer between the generations, however. Transfers of

time to the older generation may be balanced by financial transfers going to the younger

generation. Each year billions of dollars are transferred from the older to the younger generation

in the form of bequests and inter-vivos transfers. There is a long economic literature on the

motivations for such transfers, including altruism and exchange (Bernheim, Shleifer and

Summers, 1985; Altonji, Hayashi, Kotlikoff, 1997; Norton 2000; Norton and Van Houtven

2006). Of course, the latter explanation, exchange, belies the idea of unpaid care. However,

putting aside the name, the idea of exchange makes sense for those extended families where an

older person has money and needs help, and a younger person has time and needs money. This

leads to the question of whether informal care and inter-vivos transfers are causally related.

Understanding better how inter-vivos transfers are related to informal care could help explain the

puzzle of why informal care is so prevalent.

        Economists have found some evidence that inter-vivos transfers are larger for those

children who provide informal care (Norton and Van Houtven, 2006). However, this

relationship is difficult to quantify. First, informal care is endogenous to financial transfers.

Informal care is not given randomly with respect to financial transfers. If financial transfers are



                                                  1
given in response to informal care, then the decision to provide informal care will depend in part

on expectations of future transfers. The main empirical challenge is to control for endogeneity to

get causal estimates.

       Second, measurement of both informal care and financial transfers is difficult precisely

because of the informal nature of informal care—there is no invoice to keep track of either time

or money. In part because of these problems, past studies have not been able to address the

intensive margins—the relationship between the quantity of informal care and inter-vivos

transfers. Instead, they have focused on the extensive margin of just whether any informal care

has been provided and whether any monetary transfers have changed hands. The intensive

margins are also of great interest; does the marginal value of time spent on informal care rise?

       To better answer these questions, researchers need longitudinal data on elderly parents

and their children, with detailed information on financial transfers and the time spent on informal

care. We use a data set with such detailed information to answer whether informal care givers

receive more money than their siblings who do not provide care. This longitudinal study uses

the 1999 and 2003 waves of National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women. This data set

contains extensive information on elderly mothers and their children. It also provides continuous

measures of hours of care giving and the dollar value of transfers between each parent-child pair.

The amount of informal care includes personal care, household chores, and running errands. The

monetary transfers include lending and giving money, gifts, and other financial support. These

measurements enable us to examine whether a child receives a larger amount of monetary

transfers by giving more hours of care. We examine whether the elderly parents give more inter-

vivos monetary transfers to adult children who provide informal care, by examining both the

extensive and intensive margins of financial transfers and of informal care.



                                                 2
       The longitudinal data is also useful to control for endogeneity. Forward-looking children

may strategically provide informal care to receive monetary transfers from their parents.

Therefore, informal care is endogenous in a simple regression to predict inter-vivos transfers

because of this reverse causality. We use both a mother fixed-effect model and instrumental

variables (IV) to account for such endogeneity. The mother fixed-effect model enables us

observe within-family variations of care giving and monetary transfers. We also use indicators

for birth order and gender as instrumental variables, following others in the literature. Two-stage

least squares and two-stage residual inclusion estimations are used separately for linear and

nonlinear specifications.

       We find consistent and statistically significant results (p < 0.01) that a child who provides

informal care is more likely to receive inter-vivos transfers than a sibling who does not. Our

preferred specifications suggest that informal caregivers are 20 percentage points more likely to

receive any transfer and 9 percentage points more likely to receive a financial transfer. If a child

does provide care, there is no statistically significant effect on the amount of the transfer.

       This paper makes several contributions to the literature. In terms of understanding

informal care, it attempts to measure both extensive and intensive margins of both financial

transfers and of informal care. The information in the NLS data set on both gift transfers and

financial transfers to each child and informal care from each child is more detailed than what has

been available in other studies. This allows us to model the intensive margins of both financial

transfers and of informal care. On the methodological side, we take advantage of both panel data

and instrumental variables to try to control for endogeneity.



Theoretical Framework



                                                  3
       This section provides a conceptual framework for why elderly provide financial transfers

and why their adult children provide informal care. This section builds on work of others (for

summary see Van Houtven and Norton, 2006 and Grabowski, Norton, and Van Houtven, 2012).

The conceptual framework leads to testable hypotheses and informs the empirical work.

       The primary focus of this paper is on exchange, the idea that elderly parents will

exchange money for informal care from their children (or other relatives or neighbors). When

viewed as paying for a service, the basic prediction is that more informal care services will lead

to more inter-vivos transfers. More informal care should lead to both a higher probability of any

transfers and a larger amount of transfer conditional on any transfers. However, there are a

variety of ways in which the payment (if any) may not be proportional as one would expect in a

regular market. The market for informal care is not a normal market because the supply is

typically limited to one’s children, and perhaps children in-law. With a severely constricted

supply, market rates may not apply and non-market factors may play an important role in

determining the extent of informal care provided. Despite the unusual market, economic theory

gives clear predictions.

       The economic theory also argues that informal care is endogenous in a model predicting

transfers. For example, one way to understand why informal care is endogenous is to consider

the omitted variable of how generous the mother is in terms of financial transfers. A mother who

is financially generous will transfer more for a given amount of informal care than a mother who

is less generous. If the child takes this generosity into account when deciding whether to provide

informal care, then the mother’s generosity is omitted from both equations leading to omitted

variable bias on a simple regression of informal care. Generosity is positively correlated with

both informal caregiving and transfers, leading to positive bias. Similarly, the mother’s wealth is



                                                 4
not observed and is related to both informal caregiving and financial transfers. Under exchange,

where informal care is explicitly traded for cash transfers, we expect that informal care providers

will be aware of this and adjust their amount of informal care in anticipation of some transfers.

Because of the lack of a formal market, the relationship may be lumpy, without a market clearing

price for time. But there still should be a positive relationship on the intensive margins of

financial transfers and informal care. Informal care is not provided randomly, but instead is

endogenous.

       On the demand side, we expect there to be a wealth effect, with wealthier parents able to

pay more. Opportunity costs matter for the demand side. When there are no close substitutes for

informal care (e.g., the elderly person is not Medicaid eligible so the cost of a nursing home is

relatively high) then the elderly person should be willing to pay more. On the supply side,

opportunity costs also matter. A child with a higher income should receive more as

compensation for her time. To the extent that quality of informal care can be observed, we

expect people to be willing to pay more for high quality informal care. This will not be

observable in the data, however.

       There are other well-known alternatives to exchange as explanations for financial

transfers. Altruism argues that parents care about their children’s utility. They can use money to

enhance their children’s utility. According to the altruism model, parents should give money in a

way that equalizes marginal utility. With declining marginal utility of income and wealth, this

argues for giving more to poor children. One-sided altruism with care giving, though,

complicates the predictions. If caregivers reduce hours of work (and hence income, raising their

marginal utility of income) to provide informal care, then an altruistic parent may give more to

the caregiver. Altruism can extend to grandchildren as well. When grandchildren are young and



                                                 5
live with their parents, future income is unknown, so it would be hard to use transfers to adjust

for differences in future earnings. Instead, if money is given to parents of the grandchildren,

money may be proportional to the number of grandchildren.

       There are two different views of financial transfers and Medicaid. One view is that

elderly persons will use transfers to gain Medicaid eligibility. This is one reason that most states

have multi-year look back periods for financial transfers when determining eligibility for

Medicaid for nursing home care. The opposing view is that people typically do not want to enter

a nursing home, so will use the money to remain independent (Pauly 1990; Norton 1995). These

theories argue that empirical work should control carefully for the adult children’s income, the

number of grandchildren, and financial proximity to Medicaid.

       On the other side of the market, the suppliers of informal care may also have several

other reasons for providing care besides the motivation to earn money. There may be a strong

sense of filial duty. This will presumably be stronger if there are no substitutes, that is, no

siblings, or siblings who live far away or who cannot adjust their hours to provide care. Another

motivation could be to be an example to your children, in other words, to pay it forward. Those

with children would then be more likely to provide informal care to their own parents.

       We do not consider bequests further because research has shown that bequests are

typically divided equally among children (Menchik, 1980; Tomes, 1981). Even when children

provide unequal amounts of informal care, bequests tend to be divided equally (Norton and

Taylor, 2005). There are theoretical reasons for why the between inter-vivos transfers is stronger

with informal care than with bequests, including that transfers can be adjusted quickly to the

amount of care, are less costly than writing a will, and can be kept secret from other family

members and the public (Norton and Van Houtven, 2006).



                                                  6
Hypotheses

        In summary, we expect that more informal care will increase both the extensive and

intensive margins of financial transfers. Within a family, children who provide informal care are

more likely to receive inter-vivos transfers than their siblings who do not provide informal care.

Those who provide more care will receive more transfers. Informal care is endogenous in a

model of financial transfers. Therefore we expect a positive relationship between transfers and

informal care giving, in both extensive and intensive margins of both variables, but that the

amount of informal caregiving is endogenous.

        Other hypotheses are that step children are less likely to receive transfers, the income of

children matters (although opportunity costs and altruism suggest opposite effects). This implies

that it is important to control for child-level characteristics.

        A further complication is that income and wealth effects of the elderly person are likely

to be strong, and will go in the opposite direction (wealthier families give more in transfers but

are less likely to receive informal care). Therefore, we want to look within an extended family,

both over time and across children, for variation in informal care and transfers, holding lifecycle

wealth constant. We will run some models with mother fixed effects, and other models with

instruments related to gender and birth order of the potential caregivers, as has been done in the

literature transfers (Van Houtven and Norton, 2004 and 2008; Bolin, Lindgren, Lundborg, 2008).



Empirical Approach




                                                    7
       The conceptual framework leads to a model where financial transfers from elderly

parents to their adult children are the main outcome, and those transfers are a function of

informal care provision, which is endogenous. In addition to informal care, predictors of

financial transfers include wealth, income and marital status of the parent, and measures of the

health. Child characteristics including gender, marital status, number of children, and distance

from the adult parent (a proxy for contact) can also influence inter-vivo transfers.

       There are three main empirical challenges. One is that transfers have a distribution with a

large mass at zero and a skewed right positive tail. Therefore, following the health economics

literature, we estimate both extensive and intensive margins of financial transfers. We address

this by estimating regressions of the probability and amount of financial transfer a child receives

on an indicator of whether the adult child provides any care to parents and hours of care

conditional on any informal care.

       A second empirical challenge is that wealth effects of the elderly parent are likely to be

large. Poor elderly may have no money to give, regardless of the amount of informal care.

Wealthy elderly may want to disperse their wealth while alive for a variety of tax and personal

reasons, even if they receive no informal care. At the same time, wealthier parents are able to

purchase formal care, and have lower demand for informal care even at higher levels of illness

and disability. So controlling for the wealth effect is important. The NLS data has some

information about wealth and income. However, wealth information is notoriously incomplete.

       We control for permanent wealth of parents by including mother fixed effects in some

specifications. These address the time-invariant components of parental wealth that determine

the likelihood of both time and financial transfers. In the mother fixed effects models, we




                                                 8
compare children to their siblings, testing whether children who provide more care to a parent

than other siblings do receive larger transfers holding parent characteristics constant.

        Finally, there remains the problem of dealing with the endogeneity of informal care. This

can occur because children provide informal care in anticipation of compensation from parents in

the form of inter-vivos transfer, or if unmeasured factors such as relationship quality determine

transfers in both directions. We will use several methods to deal with endogeneity. Besides

running models with no controls for endogeneity, as comparisons, we use mother fixed effect

regressions and instrumental variables.

       The basic model describes the relationship between parental transfers to children, Tc, as a

function of whether the child provides any informal care, ICc, hours of care, HCc, characteristics

of the mother, Mm and adult child Cc described previously. We first estimate

               Tct = α ICct + β HCct + γ Mmt + δ Cct + εct                                   (1)

where Tc is either the probability of the parent providing any monetary transfer (including gifts)

and any financial transfer (cash transfers such as loans and other support excluding gifts) to

child c at time t estimated using logistic regression, or Tc is the natural logarithm of the amount

given (for the subset of those who give any) estimated using ordinary least squares.

       However, the α and β coefficients estimated in Equation (1) are likely biased by

endogeneity as previously discussed. The estimates will be too large (biased upward) if financial

transfers and informal caregiving are more likely to occur when the child anticipates being repaid

for time caring for the parent or where family dynamics promote transfers of time and money

across generations.

       Our preferred specification uses mother fixed effects to difference out time-invariant

mother’s characteristics such as wealth, generosity of financial giving, and the extent to which



                                                  9
the mother cares about her children’s well-being. In these regressions, we identify the effects of

informal caregiving using the variation within families both across siblings and over time:

               Tct = α ICct + β HCct + γ Mmt + δ Cct + Mm + εct                              (2)

       The NLS data also include a number of potential instruments for informal care provision

including birth order and sibling gender (older children and daughters are more likely to provide

informal care) that affect the probability of providing informal care. These characteristics are

predetermined by the time an older parent needs care and cannot be easily manipulated by the

adult child. Prior research has shown that variables such as number of siblings, birth order, and

gender do not directly influence parental decisions about inter-vivos transfers (Van Houtven and

Norton, 2004 and 2008; Bolin, Lindgren, Lundborg, 2008).

       We use these variables to estimate instrumental variables regressions that yield causal

estimates of the effect of caregiving on inter-vivos transfer receipt for those whose caregiving

decisions are driven by genetic lottery underlying birth order and sibling gender composition. In

the first stage, we predict caregiving as a function of these family composition variables FCc and

previously included control variables.

               ICct = ρ FCct + β HCct + γ Mmt + δ Cct + ξct                                  (3)

When the main equation is linear, we used two-stage least squares (essentially replace the

endogenous variable with its predicted value).

                       ෢ ct + β HCct + γ Mmt + δ Cct + εct
               Tct = λ ‫ܥܫ‬                                                                    (4)

When the main equation has a dichotomous dependent variable, we used two-stage residual

inclusion (essentially add the residual from the first-stage regression to the main equation). This

approach can produce consistent estimates (Terza, Basu, and Rathouz, 2007).




                                                 10
Data

       We use both the 1999 and 2003 waves of National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Mature

Women data set, conducted by the Ohio State University on behalf of the Bureau of Labor

Statistics. This survey includes women who were ages 30-44 when first interviewed in 1967.

Originally, the Department of Labor selected this cohort to study how women balanced roles in

labor markets and households. Since then, this survey has included a variety of topics. In the

1999 and 2003 waves, respondents were asked sets of questions about intergenerational transfers

between them and their adult children. The NLS was discontinued after 2003 due to budget

constraints. We both merged the 1999 and 2003 waves to construct pooled cross-sectional and

longitudinal data to examine within-family and within-child variation and account for the

unobservable time-invariant variables. The amount of informal care includes personal care,

household chores, and running errands. The money transfers include lending and giving money,

gifts, and other financial support.

     The original sample comprises 5,083 women in 1967. Because of attrition due to death,

loss to follow up, and institutionalization, there are only 2,467 women who completed the survey

in 1999 and 2,237 women who completed it in 2003. For these women, only their children who

are at least age 19 were eligible for the transfer questions. We first exclude the elderly women

who lived with any child because informal caregiving is extremely hard to measure when there is

co-residence (for reviews of literature about family bargaining over living arrangements, see

Pezzin, Pollak, and Schone, 2007 and Byrne et al., 2009). This reduces the number of

households to 1,704 and 1,457 in the 1999 and 2003 waves. We further limit the sample to the

households with between two and five children because it requires at least two children per

household for with-in family fixed effect estimation and because the transfer questions were



                                                11
answered collectively for the respondent with more than five children. This results in 1,202 and

1,059 households in 1999 and 2003. We further exclude adult children have any missing values

on one of seven transfer questions. The analytical sample comprises 1,111 households and 3,476

child-parent paired observations in 1999 and 976 households and 3,054 children in 2003.

Overall, the pooled cross-sectional sample has 6,530 children and the matched panel sample has

5,249 children (see Table 1).

       It is instructive to compare the NLS with the well-known Health and Retirement Survey

(HRS). The HRS has about twice as many women in this age group. The demographics match

on age, ADLs, and education, but the NLS women have significantly lower average household

income ($26,000 vs. $39,000). The NLS has more detailed information on transfers of time and

money in those two waves.



Dependent variables

     The dependent variables are whether or not the child received monetary transfers from the

elderly mother during the past 12 months, and, if the child did receive a transfer, what are the

dollar values of those transfers? We created aggregated variables to add up four types of

monetary transfers asked about in NLS data set (lending, giving, gifts, and other support). About

50.8% and 43.7% of the adult children received any type of transfers from their elderly mother in

the past 12 months (see Table 2). Among the children who received any transfers, the average

amount was $1,750. We also created a financial transfer variable that excludes gifts giving. Only

about 12% and 11% of the adult children received any non-gift financial transfers. The average

financial transfer was about $4,670. Compared to transfer in 1999, the probability of receiving




                                                12
any transfer decreased by 7 percentage points in 2003. The amount of transfers is similar in the

two waves.



Independent variables

     The primary explanatory variables of interest are the provision of informal care and the

hours of care giving. We created informal care variables to aggregate the information on three

types of informal care (personal care, household chores, and running errand). In 1999, about

13.4% adult children provided informal care to their elderly mother. Conditional on providing

any care, the average hours of care giving was 284 hours per year. In 2003, 14.8% of the adult

children provided informal care and the average hours increased to 395 hours per year. The

higher probability and the longer hours of care probably reflect the increasing needs as the

elderly women were four years older. To control for the needs of informal care, we also

included a set of physical functioning indicators. The average number of ADLs was 0.14 in

1999 and increased to 0.21 in 2003. In 2003, 10% of the elderly women have ever been

diagnosed with cancer, 60% of them have been diagnosed with hypertension, and 23% of them

have heart problems.

     We also care about the child’s absolute income. By examining the relationship between

transfers and relative income levels, it helps to answer whether altruism is an important motive

of inter-vivos transfers. The original NLS data set has four child income categories: below 22K,

between 22K and 55K, between 55K and 70K, and above 70K.

     Our regressions also include important demographic, financial, and health variables at both

the household level and child level. On average, the elderly mothers were 69.1 and 72.8 years

old in 1999 and 2003. On average, the elderly woman had 3.2 transfer eligible children

(conditional on having between two and five children). More than 60 percent were married in

1999 but only 52.5 percent remained married in 2003. The average annual family income of the

elderly mothers was $25,331 and $24,522 in 1999 and 2003. We also construct a set of variables

to measure the elderly mother’s wealth. In 2003, 87% owned their home and 37.7% have IRA

account. Only 9.1% of them had saving accounts more than $40,000. In our analysis sample, on

average the adult children were age 42.6 and 45.9 in 1999 and 2003. About 70% of the adult

children were married and 76.9% of them had at least one child. Because transportation time and

expenditures are significant cost of care giving, a dummy variable is created to indicate whether

the child lived 10 or more miles away from their elderly mother. Almost two-thirds of the

sample children lived more than 10 miles away from the elderly mother. We also carefully

defined the child-parent relationship. 91.7% of the sample children are biological children.



Instrumental variables

        We use whether the child is the eldest child and the number of sisters as the instrumental

variables in the two-stage least squares and two-stage residuals inclusion estimations. Because

in many cultures the burden of caregiving falls to the eldest child and to daughters, both birth

order and the number of daughters are highly correlated with informal care provision. The more

sisters the adult child has, the less likely this adult child will provide informal care to the elderly

mother because the burden of care provision is spread across more potential caregivers. We also

use being the eldest child to measure birth order. As previous studies have found, the eldest



                                                  14
child is much more likely to provide informal care. Both instruments are statistically significant

in the first-stage regressions. Our instrumental variables also theoretically satisfy the exclusion

restriction because the child’s birth order and gender were determined genetically and the size of

family was determined long before the need of informal care. We use both the instruments for

two potential endogenous variables (whether the child provides any informal care and the log

hours of care conditional on providing any).

       We run specification tests for the instruments (see Table 7). When using the number of

sisters and being the eldest child as the instruments (for any informal care), the F-statistic was

11.8, the over-id test rejected at the 5-percent level (p=0.018), and the test of exogeneity rejected

at the 1-percent level (this test is conditional on having valid instruments). Therefore, we have

some concerns about the validity of the instruments in this data set. We also attempted to use the

two instruments for the two endogenous variables, but the partial R-squared was low and we

could not test over-identification. For these reasons, we tend to prefer the mother fixed effects

results, but include the IV results for completeness.



Results

       We start by presenting the single-equation results. These assume that the informal care

variables are exogenous, an assumption that we test. Children who provide any care are 35.8

percentage points more likely to receive any transfer and 9.9 percentage points more likely to

receive financial transfers than children who are not currently providing care (Table 3). These

are large effects; fewer than half of all sample children receive any transfer and 11 percent

receive financial transfers. However, providing more care is associated with a lower probability

of any transfer at the margin. Mothers who require more assistance may have been sicker for a



                                                 15
longer time or have higher out-of-pocket health care spending, reducing their ability to make

transfers. The results are similar qualitatively when the same model is run with a logit instead of

a linear probability model; we report results from logistic regressions to account for the

dichotomous dependent variable.

       The last two columns of Table 3 consider the association between caregiving and the

amount of financial transfers in the subset of children who receive transfers. We find no

relationship between informal caregiving and all transfers, many of which are gifts for birthdays

and holidays. Mothers with more income and wealth (proxied by home ownership) are more

likely to provide transfers; eldest, biological, and unmarried children are more likely to receive

transfers. We found a negative and statistically significant relationship between the amount of

financial transfers given to children who provide care counterbalanced by a positive and

significant relationship between annual hours of care and amount of money transferred. These

seemingly contradictory results may reflect the actions of persistently generous mothers, who

provide transfers regardless of care and another set of mothers compensating children for

informal care provision, particularly children providing larger amounts of care.

       The results from mother fixed effect regressions control for time-invariant characteristics

of the mother including wealth and generosity (see Table 4). Within families, children who

provide informal care are much more likely to receive any transfers or any financial transfers

(see Table 4). Interpretation of the conditional logistic regression coefficients is difficult because

the constant term is not estimated in a conditional fixed effects model, making it impossible to

compute probabilities. The coefficients have the interpretation of log odds conditional on the

mother fixed effects and other covariates, and conditional on having at least one child receive a

transfer and one not (Norton 2012).



                                                 16
        Results from the corresponding linear probability models with mother fixed effects

showed that the point estimates imply magnitudes that the probability of receiving any transfer is

about 20 percentage points higher for those who provide any care (roughly half the size of the

effect reported in Table 3), and the probability of receiving financial transfers is about 9

percentage points higher (unchanged from the pooled cross-sectional models). These models

compare siblings who do or do not provide informal care, suggesting that family characteristics

are an important omitted variable for understanding the decision to provide any transfer, but not

financial transfers. Unlike in the cross-sectional data, we find no significant effect of the number

of hours of informal care on the probability or amount of any transfers or of financial transfers,

again pointing to the importance of controlling for family preferences and other maternal

characteristics.

        We also find evidence of maternal altruism in inter-vivos giving. Parents are

considerably more likely to provide financial transfers to children with incomes below $20,000

(13.3 percentage points, p < 0.01), and incomes between $20 and $50,000 (5.5 percentage points,

p < 0.01) than to those with incomes above $70,000. Conditional on making any transfers,

mothers also provide more resources to children in the lowest income groups. Mothers are more

likely to make transfers to their eldest child and biological children. They are less likely to make

financial transfers to married children and older children; married children are 4.1 percentage

points less likely to receive financial transfers and each year of child age is associated with a 0.2

percentage point decline in his probability of receiving a transfer. These results all suggest that

mothers make inter-vivos financial transfers to children most likely to need financial help rather

than give equally to all children. We also remind readers that caregivers being more likely to

receive transfers is consistent with one-sided altruism.



                                                 17
        One other hypothesis that we can test is whether step children are less likely to receive

transfers than biological children. The mother’s fixed effects model shows that biological

children are significantly more likely to receive transfers, but that the size of the transfers is

unrelated to whether the child is a step child. The magnitude of the difference is more than 10

percentage points.

        We hypothesized that mothers use inter-vivos transfers to compensate adult children for

providing informal care. However, it is possible that transfers are provided in anticipation of

future care needs instead. The panel nature of our data allow us to test the temporal precedence

of caregiving and informal transfers. Mothers were 6.9 percentage points more likely to make

transfers in 2003 to children who reported caregiving in 1999 in models that control for mother

fixed effects. In contrast, the relationship between transfer receipt in 1999 and caregiving in

2003 was smaller in magnitude and only statistically significant in the logit FE models. We find

no relationship between financial transfers and caregiving in either period, however.

        A stronger test of our causal pathway is to instrument for child’s caregiver status. We

tested two instruments commonly used in the literature; whether a child was the oldest and

whether female. In the mother fixed effect regressions, we found no differences in transfers to

daughters versus sons, though older children were somewhat more likely to receive any but not

financial transfers than children; we would be more confident with this identification strategy if

there was no relationship between birth order and transfer receipt. Regressions using only child

gender as an instrument generated a weak first stage, so we report the specification used by other

papers for comparison. Table 5 presents first-stage estimates; being the eldest child and having

sisters are both strong predictors of informal caregiving. Results are in the expected directions;

children with more sisters provide less care and oldest children are more likely to provide care.



                                                  18
The individual t-statistics are always greater than 1.96 in absolute value. The F-statistic on the

instruments is about 12 for any informal care but less than 10 for the number of hours.

Therefore, we acknowledge that the instruments are somewhat weak for the number of hours.

       In the instrumental variables estimation we faced several challenges. As is often the case,

the point estimates and standard errors are quite large (see Table 6), to the point of being

implausibly large. For the two-stage least squares models we used both instruments for two

endogenous variables. For the two-stage residual inclusion model, models with two endogenous

variables did not converge, so we report only the models that control for the endogeneity of any

care, and leave out the amount of care.



Conclusion

       Consistent with prior literature, we found statistically significant results that a child who

provides informal care is more likely to receive inter-vivos transfers than a sibling who does not.

Contrary to what we expected, there is no evidence for an intensive margin of informal care on

either the extensive or intensive margins of financial transfers. Providing more informal care

does not significantly affect the probability of any transfers or the amount of transfer (total or

financial). Because the theoretical hypothesis is only partially confirmed, there must be other

motives for providing informal care that are strong at the intensive margin. These could include

altruism, providing an example for the grandchildren, and receiving other utility from providing

care (positive benefits of time with parents).

       The analysis on continuous measurements, hours and dollar amounts, provides new

evidence of the exchange motive that the elderly use inter-vivos transfers to compensate the care

givers. About 15% of older mothers received informal care from at least one child in 2003, on



                                                 19
average these women received 395 hours of care, the equivalent of a full day of work each week.

Both the large need for care observed and the evidence of an exchange motive support public

policy efforts to expand programs like Cash and Counseling (Carlson et al., 2007), which enable

patients to compensate friends and family members for informal care provision.

(2)Indicators of missing values are included in the regression but not reported in the table to save
space.
(3) Reported values are the average marginal effects.
(4) Both 2SLS and 2SRI models use two instruments – number of sisters and eldest child; However, in
2SLS model we instrument for two both anycare and log hours of care. In 2SRI, we only instrument for
anycare because the likelihood ‐function dose not converge when we instrument for two endogenous
variables

(1)*, **, and *** represent significance at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels
(2)Indicators of missing values are included in the regression but not reported in the table to save
space.
(3) Reported values are the average marginal effects.
(4) Both 2SLS and 2SRI models use two instruments – number of sisters and eldest child; However, in
2SLS model we instrument for two both anycare and log hours of care. In 2SRI, we only instrument for
anycare because the likelihood ‐function dose not converge when we instrument for two endogenous
variables
