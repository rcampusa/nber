                                           ABSTRACT


Price controls create opportunities for international arbitrage. Many have argued that such arbitrage,
if tolerated, will undermine intellectual property rights and dull the incentives for investment in
research-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals. We challenge this orthodox view and show,
to the contrary, that the pace of innovation often is faster in a world with international exhaustion
of intellectual property rights than in one with national exhaustion. The key to our conclusion is to
recognize that governments will make different choices of price controls when parallel imports are
allowed by their trade partners than they will when they are not.

1        Introduction
Parallel trade occurs when a good protected by a patent, copyright, or trademark, having
been legally purchased in one country, is exported to another without the authorization of the
local owner of the intellectual property rights in the importing market (see Maskus, 2000b).
Parallel trade represents a form of arbitrage whereby a legitimate product is shipped from
the market intended by the intellectual property rights holder to another where it commands
a higher price. Like other forms of arbitrage, parallel imports (also known as “grey-market
imports” or “reimports”) respond to international price di¤erences that result from retailer
price discrimination, vertical pricing restraints, or national di¤erences in government price
controls.
        The propriety of parallel trade is a matter of intense policy debate in a number of countries
and in the World Trade Organization (WTO). At present, WTO provisions allow member
countries to establish their own rules for the “exhaustion” of intellectual property rights
(IPR).1 If a country opts for national exhaustion of IPR, a rights holder there may exclude
parallel imports, because intellectual property rights continue until such a time as a protected
product is …rst sold in that market. If a country instead chooses international exhaustion
of IPR, parallel imports cannot be blocked, because the rights of the patent, copyright or
trademark holder expire when a protected product is sold anywhere in the world. The United
States practices national exhaustion for patents and copyrights, but permits parallel imports
of trademarked goods unless the trademark owner can show that the imports are of di¤erent
quality from goods sold locally or otherwise might cause confusion for consumers. The Eu-
ropean Union provides for regional exhaustion of IPR whereby goods circulate freely within
the trading bloc but parallel imports are banned from non-member countries.                             Japanese
commercial law permits parallel imports except when such trade is explicitly excluded by
contract provisions or when the original sale is made subject to foreign price controls.2
        Public debate about parallel imports has been especially heated in the area of prescription
drugs. In the United States, where consumers, public health o¢ cials, and politicians have
become increasingly concerned about the high and rising cost of medicine, bills that would
introduce international exhaustion of patent rights for prescription drugs have been intro-
duced in one or both houses of Congress in each of the last three sessions. In fact, in 2000,
Congress passed a bill to permit reimportation of medicines.                    Although President Clinton
    1
        Article 6 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) states that:

          For the purposes of dispute settlement under this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Articles
          3 and 4, nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of
          intellectual property rights.

    2
    Di¤erent national regimes of IPR exhaustion are described in more detail in Maskus (2000a, 2000b) and
Arfwedson (2004).

signed the bill into law, his administration ultimately declined to implement it, citing con-
cerns about consumer safety. New legislation was introduced to Congress in 2004 that would
have forced deregulation of parallel imports of pharmaceuticals. In each case, the impetus
for Congressional action came from public pressures to step up imports from Canada, where
regulations and price controls have generated prices for prescription drugs signi…cantly lower
than those across the border.3 Despite the continuing legal impediments to parallel imports,
reimportation has been a growing source of pharmaceuticals supply in the United States due
to increased personal tra¢ cking and the proliferation of Internet purchases. By one estimate,
parallel imports of prescription drugs from Canada amounted to $1.1 billion in 2004, or about
0.5% of the U.S. market (Cambridge Pharma Consultancy, 2004).
       Parallel trade in pharmaceuticals features prominently in Europe as well, where it is
the source of ongoing controversy. Di¤erences in price regulations have resulted in signi…-
cant variation in pharmaceutical prices across member countries of the European Union and
the European Free Trade Association (Arfwedson, 2004; Kanavos and Costa-Font, 2005).
Kanavos and Costa-Font, for example, report price di¤erences for many products and coun-
try pairs of between 100% and 300%. Prices are highest in the countries with free or relatively
free prices, which are Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Den-
mark.      These countries all have witnessed substantial growth in parallel importing, with
reimports accounting for between seven and twenty percent of their national expenditures on
prescription drugs in 2002. The parallel exporters include Spain, France, Greece, Italy, and
Portugal, all of which are countries with controlled prices or explicit price caps (Ganslandt
and Maskus, 2004).
       Opponents of parallel trade— of which there are many— are concerned that such trade
undermines manufacturers’ intellectual property rights.4 The prevailing wisdom, expressed
for example by Bar…eld and Groombridge (1998,1999), Chard and Mellor (1989), Danzon
(1997, 1998), and Danzon and Towse (2003), is that parallel trade impedes the ability of
research-intensive …rms such as those in the pharmaceuticals industry to reap an adequate
return on their investments in new technologies. Their arguments seem to …nd support in
more formal analyses, which o¤er only a few minor caveats. For example, Li and Maskus
(2006) develop a model in which parallel trade creates competition in the home market
between a manufacturer and its own distributor in a foreign market.                    They …nd that the
distortions associated with parallel imports reduce the manufacturer’s incentive to invest in
cost reducing innovation at a prior stage. Szymanski and Valletti (2005) model an industry
   3
     Maskus (2001) compares prices for similar doses of 18 drugs and …nds lower prices in Canada than in the
United States in 17 cases. The average price for these drugs in Canada was 63 percent of that in the United
States.
   4
     Aside from any potential dynamic e¤ects, parallel trade that undermines third-degree price discrimination
can reduce world welfare by reallocating sales from markets with low demand elasticities to markets with high
demand elasticities; see Malueg and Schwartz (1994).



                                                      2
with vertical product di¤erentiation and examine how parallel trade a¤ects a …rm’s decision of
whether to supply high quality products. They conclude that such trade diminishes the …rm’s
incentive to invest in quality and may reduce welfare in both countries. In a related model,
Valletti (2006) shows that parallel trade reduces investment when di¤erential pricing is based
purely on di¤erences in price elasticities, but increases investment when di¤erential pricing
results from idiosyncratic costs of serving the two markets (that the manufacturer must bear,
but an arbitrager can avoid). Finally, Rey (2003) examines parallel importing that may
result from di¤erential price regulation, as is most germane in the case of pharmaceuticals.
He argues that such trade impedes a country’s ability to accept high local prices in order to
promote R&D when its trade partner prefers to set lower prices. As a result, world investment
in technology is lower in his model when parallel trade is allowed than when it is banned.
   In this paper, we challenge the prevailing wisdom for the case (such as in pharmaceuticals)
in which parallel trade is induced by di¤erent national price controls. We argue that the
existing policy discussions and formal modeling overlook an important e¤ect of national
policy regarding the exhaustion of IPR. Whereas the papers in the literature that discuss
parallel imports of pharmaceuticals in the presence of price regulation compare incentives for
R&D in scenarios with and without parallel imports for given levels of controlled prices, we
emphasize that a government will face di¤erent incentives in regulating prices in the presence
or absence of arbitrage possibilities. This is so for two reasons. First, the admissibility of
parallel trade introduces the possibility that a manufacturer will eschew low-price sales in the
foreign market in order to mitigate or avoid re-importation. When arbitrage is impossible,
the manufacturer is willing to export at any price above marginal production cost. But
when the potential for arbitrage exists, the manufacturer may earn higher pro…ts by selling
only in the unregulated (or high-price) market than by serving both markets at the lower,
foreign-controlled price. Accordingly, a switch from a regime of national exhaustion to one
of international exhaustion can induce an increase in the controlled price as the foreign
government seeks to ensure that its consumers are adequately served.
   Second, the admissibility of parallel trade mitigates the opportunity for one government
to free-ride on the protection of IPR granted by another. As we have shown in Grossman and
Lai (2004), national policies to protect IPR often are strategic substitutes in a two-country
(or many-country) policy-setting game; the greater is the protection a¤orded by one country,
the less will be the optimal level of protection perceived by the other. In a world without
parallel trade in which one government allows manufacturers to price freely in its market (or
enforces a price ceiling at a relatively high level), the other government can hold the line
on prices so as to bene…t its local consumers and nonetheless enjoy the fruits of relatively
high rates of innovation. But when arbitrage can occur, a low price cap in one country
dulls incentives for investment worldwide. The government of a less-innovative country faces
a di¤erent trade-o¤ in setting its regulated prices in the presence or absence of arbitrage.

                                               3
As we will show, the deregulation of parallel imports in a highly-innovative economy always
induces the government of its less-innovative trade partner to loosen its price controls.5 In our
analysis, the presumptive outcome is one in which deregulation of parallel imports generates
both an increase in consumer surplus in the innovative country and an increase in the world
pace of innovation. Thus, the more innovative country may face no trade-o¤ at all between
static and dynamic gains in its choice of regime for exhaustion of IPR. We …nd that typically
the more innovative country gains from parallel trade, while the less innovative country loses.6
       The starting point for our analysis is the two-country model of ongoing innovation and
trade that we developed in Grossman and Lai (2004) to study incentives that governments
have to protect IPR in an open, world economy. In this model, …rms devote resources to
inventing horizontally di¤erentiated goods with …nite product lives. The greater is the global
protection of IPR, as re‡ected in the duration of patents and the enforcement rate for live
patents, the greater is the incentive for product development. The model yields a steady-
state equilibrium in which the measure of di¤erentiated products is constant. This measure
responds to the policy regime. Here, we take the global regime for protection of patent
rights as given, but introduce the possibility of price controls.             That is, we assume that
new pharmaceutical products receive similar patent protection in all countries (as indeed is
dictated by the terms of the TRIPS agreement), but that existing international agreements
do not prevent a country from regulating domestic prices of prescription drugs. We compare
prices, pro…ts and rates of innovation in a regime in which the high-price country allows
parallel imports with those that arise when such trade is disallowed. We do so …rst under the
assumption that the innovative “North”allows its …rms to price freely and that no innovation
takes place in “South.”7 Subsequently, we show that the main insights carry over to the case
in which both countries regulate prices in a Nash equilibrium policy game, and also to the
case in which innovation occurs in both countries provided that North conducts su¢ ciently
more R&D than South.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we adapt the
Grossman-Lai model of ongoing innovation to allow for price controls.                    We develop the
model under the assumption that all innovation takes place in the North and that prices are
regulated only in the South.        In Section 3, we derive and discuss our main results, which
   5
     Indeed, Kanavos and Costa-Font (2005, p.766) cite policy changes of this sort in some European countries
in response to the growth of intra-European parallel trade in pharmaceutical goods. For example, they note
that Portugal and Italy have in recent years moved their regulated prices for reimbursed medicines closer to
average European prices, while France too has tended to allow freer pricing of highly innovative products.
   6
     Pecorino (2002) makes a related though di¤erent point in a static model of sales and exports by a single
…rm. In his model, export prices are determined as a Nash bargain between the manufacturer and the foreign
government. The possibility of reimportation strengthens the bargaining position of the manufacturer by
lending credibility to the threat that he will not serve the foreign market. Accordingly, the monopolist’s
pro…ts can be higher when parallel imports are allowed than when they are not.

     Whereas the geographic designations seem apt for Europe, the North American reader should not be
confused by the fact that, in the context of our model, the United States is “North” and Canada is “South.”

compare prices, pro…ts and rates of innovation under alternative regimes for exhaustion of IPR
in which North does and does not allow parallel imports. Section 4 addresses circumstances
in which North also may impose price controls and in which …rms in South have the capacity
to innovate. The …nal section summarizes our conclusions.


2    A Model of Ongoing Innovation
We consider an industry such as pharmaceuticals in which …rms innovate by introducing new
varieties of a di¤erentiated product, all of which have …nite economic lives. Our approach
builds on Grossman and Lai (2004).
    The world economy has two sectors, one that produces a tradable, homogeneous good and
the other that produces a continuum of di¤erentiated products. The designs for di¤erentiated
products are the outgrowth of investments in R&D. Each new product has a useful economic
life of length , which means that it can provide utility to consumers for a period of that
duration. When     years have elapsed from the time of invention, the product ceases to be of
economic value.
    There are two countries, North and South. Innovative products are consumed in both
countries whereas (for now) all innovation takes place in North. In country j, j = N (for
North) or j = S (for South) there are Mj consumers who demand the di¤erentiated products
of the innovating industry. The typical such consumer maximizes an intertemporal utility
function of the form                        Z   1
                                                                   (z t)
                                 Uj (t) =           uj (z)e                dz              (1)
                                            t

where                                           Z       n(z)
                            uj (z) = yj (z) +                  h [xj (i; z)] di ,          (2)
                                                    0

yj (z) is consumption of the homogeneous good at time z, xj (i; z) is consumption of the
di¤erentiated product i at time z, and n(z) is the number (measure) of di¤erentiated products
invented before time z that remains economically viable at z. As in Grossman and Lai (2004),
we will refer to Mj as the “size of the market” in country j.
    A consumer with the preferences represented by (2) maximizes utility by purchasing
di¤erentiated product i at time z up to the point where its marginal utility, h0 [xj (i; z)] is
equal to the local price of the good. After the consumer makes all of his optimal purchases
of the economically viable di¤erentiated products available at time z, he devotes residual
spending (which we take to be strictly positive) to the homogeneous good. With spending on
the homogeneous good assumed positive at every moment, (1) implies that the interest rate
must be constant and equal to . Then each household attains indirect utility equal to the
present discounted value of lifetime spending plus the present discounted value of consumer


                                                    5
surplus captured on purchases of di¤erentiated products.
       New varieties of the di¤erentiated product result from a research activity that requires la-
bor and a sector-speci…c factor that we call “research capital.”We take             j (z)   = 1 Kj1   LRj (z) ,
where      j (z)   is the ‡ow of new products developed in country j at time z, Kj is the (…xed)
stock of research capital in country j, and LRj (z) is the (e¤ective) labor devoted to research
in country j at time z.8 To capture a setting in which research capacity is highly concen-
trated in one country, we assume (for now) that KN > 0 while KS = 0. Note that the time
derivative of n(z) is n(z)
                      _    =        N (z)      N (z       ), because products invented at time z
become obsolete at time z. In steady state,           N   is constant and so n(z)
                                                                             _    = 0.
       Our earlier paper focused on the determination of patent lengths and enforcement rates
in non-cooperative and cooperative international regimes of intellectual property protection.
Here, we take the patent regime as given and assume that patent lengths have been harmo-
nized by some international agreement such as TRIPS. Every inventor is awarded a patent of
length      <      in both countries. We assume that patents are perfectly enforced.9 By taking
the terms of patent protection as given, we can focus most sharply on price controls and
parallel trade as instruments of innovation policy.
       Once a variety has been invented, it can be produced in North with c units of labor per
unit of output. We take North’s wage as numeraire, so c also represents the marginal cost of
production there. A …rm that holds a live patent for an economically viable good has the sole
right to produce that good and to make the …rst sale at home or abroad. Whether it can also
prevent reimportation of goods that it initially sells in South depends on the prevailing regime
for exhaustion of IPR. If North adopts national exhaustion, the patent holder can prevent
parallel imports of units it sells to consumers (or distributors) in South. If North instead
chooses international exhaustion, parallel imports cannot be barred. For simplicity, we ignore
transportation and marketing costs. Therefore, price arbitrage is perfect in a regime that
permits parallel trade.
       Firms that hold live patents set prices for (initial) sales in each market. They do so
after North has decided its regime for exhaustion of IPR and after the two governments
have announced their pricing policies, if any. If the price that a …rm charges for sales in
a country exceeds the legal price ceiling there, no distributor or consumer will be able to
purchase its product. If North adopts international exhaustion and a patent holder asks a
higher price there than that for sales in South, it will lose the Northern market to parallel
traders. Accordingly, a patent holder must charge a price for sales in each country no greater
   8
     In Grossman and Lai (2004), we allow for a constant elasticity of substitution between labor and research
capital that need not be equal to one. We …nd that most qualitative results do not depend on the size of this
elasticity, as long as it does not exceed two.
   9
     In Grossman and Lai (2004), where we allowed for imperfect enforcement, we showed how one could
construct a single measure of strength of IPR protection that re‡ects both duration of patents and rates of
enforcement. Here, we ignore the complications associated with imperfect enforcement for simplicity.



                                                      6
than the local price ceiling or its sales there will be zero, and it must charge identical prices
in the two markets under international exhaustion or its sales in the higher-priced market
will be zero.
       We denote by (p) the pro…ts that a patent holder makes per consumer when it charges
the price p in some market and serves all local demand at that price. Note that consumers in
both countries have identical demands, so these pro…ts are the same (as a function of price)
for sales in North and South. Similarly, C(p) is the surplus that a consumer in either country
enjoys when the di¤erentiated product i is available at price p. Let CC = C(c) be the surplus
per consumer when a di¤erentiated product is available at the competitive price c, and let
CM = C(pM ) be the surplus per consumer when the patent holder charges the unconstrained
monopoly price pM . As usual, the monopoly price is such that the markup over marginal
cost as a fraction of price is equal to the inverse demand elasticity.10
       Whenever a patent expires, the formerly-patented good can be produced by …rms any-
where in the world. We assume that any wage gap that exists between North and South
re‡ects a di¤erence in the productivity of labor in all of its uses. This, and the tradability of
the numeraire good, allows us to measure Southern labor in e¢ ciency units, with the wage
per e¢ ciency unit in South equal to that in North. Then the production cost for unpatented
goods is equal to c in both places.11
       We describe now the steady-state equilibrium for a given policy regime. In a steady state,
the measure of di¤erentiated products is constant. The products invented at time z replace
the products that become obsolete at z, which are those that were invented at z                  . The total
number of viable products is n =          N   , with nM =      N    of these under patent protection at
any moment, and the remaining nC =              N(        ) competitively priced. The patented goods
carry a price pN in North and pS in South. These prices will re‡ect the policy regime in
force, including the height of any price ceilings and whether North allows parallel imports.
A Northern monopolist earns a ‡ow of pro…ts MN (pN ) + MS (pS ) for a period of length ,
the present discounted value of which is


                                    v = [MN (pN ) + MS (pS )] T ,                                          (3)

where T        (1   e    ) = is the present value of a ‡ow of one dollar from time zero to time
 . Firms in North deploy labor in R&D up to the point where the marginal value product
  10
      We assume that the monopoly price is …nite, which requires a demand elasticity greater than one at the
relative point on the demand curve. For example, it would be su¢ cient that xh00 (x)=h0 (x) < 1 for all x.
We do not make the latter assumption as we did in Grossman and Lai (2004), because we wish to consider
linear demands as a special case.
   11
      This assumption of equal production costs is not needed for our results, but it simpli…es the exposition.




                                                      7
in this activity is equal to the wage, or

                                          v (KN =LRN )1       = 1.                                        (4)

                                                                                          1    1
Then, given this allocation of labor, the ‡ow of new innovations is               N   =       KN LRN , from
which the steady-state measure of di¤erentiated products can be computed.
       We assume that Northern …rms are owned by households in North and, without fur-
ther loss of generality, that investments in R&D are …nanced by aggregate savings there.12
Spending in North, EN , is the di¤erence between national income YN and national savings,
or between national income and national investment. National income comprises labor in-
come, the return to research capital, and the ‡ow of monopoly pro…ts paid as dividends, so
YN = LN + rKN + nM [MN (pN ) + MS (pS )], where r is the return to research capital and
LN is the aggregate labor supply in North. Investment is devoted entirely to R&D, the cost
of which is LRN + rKN : Therefore,

                          EN = LN        LRN + nM [MN (pN ) + MS (pS )] .                                 (5)

In South, all income derives from wages and all is spent, so ES = LS , where LS is South’s
labor supply measured in e¢ ciency units.
       We are ready now to describe the policy environment and the objective functions of the
two governments. North’s government faces an initial decision about its policy for exhaustion
of IPR. Our analysis focuses on the relative merits of its alternative options.13 We assume
that the choice of IPR exhaustion is a long-term commitment; i.e., the government decides
once and for all whether it will tolerate or ban parallel imports. Subsequently, at each moment
z > 0, the governments set their price regulations for goods invented at time z. A government
can commit at time z to a price ceiling that will apply during the economic life of any good i
invented at time z. Without this ability to pre-commit, both governments would be tempted
to enact price ceilings at the competitive level c for every new good the moment after it is
invented and, foreseeing this, …rms would have no incentive to invest in R&D. The ability to
pre-commit can be sustained, as usual, by an appropriate reputation mechanism. We assume
for the time being that North imposes no price controls or, equivalently, that its price ceiling
for every good equals or exceeds the monopoly price pM .
       While in principle South’s government could choose to set di¤erent price ceilings for goods
  12
     With quasi-linear preferences, our analysis would be una¤ected if we were to introduce the possibility of
international borrowing and lending. The constant interest rate equal to the discount rate makes consumers
indi¤erent to the time pro…le of their spending.
  13
     We could allow South’s government to make a simultaneous choice of policy regarding parallel imports.
However, inasmuch as prices of di¤erentiated products are higher in North than South in all equilibria that
we consider with national exhaustion, there is no incentive for parallel trade to ‡ow from North to South, and
thus South’s policy toward parallel imports is irrelevant.



                                                      8
invented at di¤erent times (or for di¤erent goods invented at the same time), it has no reason
to do so. Therefore, we shall solve for a single price ceiling that is optimal for South for all
goods and at all times, which however depends on what parallel trade regime is in e¤ect. At
time zero and thenceforth, the government of South chooses a price ceiling to maximize the
discounted value of the total consumer surplus that its households achieve on goods invented
subsequently. Considering that the number of Southern consumers is MS , that innovation
will be constant over time at rate        N,   and that each newly invented good spends the …rst
years of its economic life as a patented good with (endogenous) price pS and the remaining
        years as an unpatented good with price c, the South government’s objective is to
maximize the present discounted value of the sum of spending and consumer surplus,

                                 LS       MS     N
                          WS =        +              T C(pS ) + T    T CC   ,                  (6)


where T = (1     e   ) = is de…ned analogously to T .
    In North, aggregate welfare is the present value of spending plus consumer surplus, and
spending is augmented by pro…t income but diminished by the savings that …nance R&D; see
(5). Accordingly, the government of North will evaluate the alternative trade regimes with
an eye toward maximizing

                     LN    LRN        N
              WN =                +            T MN C(pN ) + T      T MN CC + T   N   ,        (7)

where    N   = MN (pN ) + MS (pS ) is the global pro…t ‡ow earned by a typical Northern
patent holder. The di¤erences between (6) and (7) re‡ect that (i) the sizes of the two
markets di¤er, (ii) pro…ts accrue to …rms in North but not to …rms in South, and (iii) North
devotes resources to R&D whereas South does not. In other words, as in Grossman and Lai
(2004), the governments have di¤erent interests because the countries have di¤erent markets
for innovative products and di¤erent capacities for research.
    In the next section, we discuss the optimal price control in South in a regime with national
exhaustion of IPR (no parallel imports) and in a regime with international exhaustion. Then
we compare the aggregate welfare in North under the alternative regimes, to shed light on
its decision whether or not to allow parallel trade. We also discuss how parallel trade a¤ects
welfare in South.


3    Price Controls with and without Parallel Trade
Throughout this section, we assume that the government of North does not impose price
controls and …rms in South do not innovate. When North prohibits parallel imports, South
can limit the prices of di¤erentiated products in its market without any e¤ect on the prices


                                                      9
that these products carry in North. Such restraints will bene…t Southern consumers and will
not cause any loss of income for Southern households. However, they will reduce the incentives
for innovation in North to an extent that depends on the size of the Southern market. We
derive the optimality conditions for the South’s price control in such circumstances and then
turn to the more subtle calculus that arises when parallel imports are tolerated in the North.
Then the government of South must recognize that Northern …rms would prefer at some
prices to sacri…ce sales in the Southern market in order to curtail arbitrage. And, if patent
holders set prices for initial sales in South that fall within the bounds of the price controls,
the opportunities for arbitrage will a¤ect prices in the North and thus the pro…ts that the
innovative …rms can earn at home. After we derive the optimal price controls in the presence
of arbitrage, we compare the welfare levels that result in each country under the alternative
parallel trade regimes.

3.1   Optimal Price Ceiling with National Exhaustion
Suppose that North prohibits reimportation of patented goods. With no price controls in
North, each producer of a di¤erentiated product charges the monopoly price pM there for
as long as its patent remains alive. In South, the monopolists can make positive pro…ts at
any price above c and will charge the highest price allowed under the price control, up to
a maximum of pM . Thus, South’s government can choose the local price between c and
pM that maximizes WS in (6), recognizing that the price determines both local consumer
surplus MS C(pS ) and the ‡ow of global pro…ts per patent, MS (pS ) + MN (pM ). The latter
determines LRN , which in turn determines the rate of innovation, via (4).
   If the South sets a price control pS above the marginal cost c, then the …rst-order condition
implies
                     d N dv ne                                                0
                               T C(pS ) + T              T CC +         NTC       (pS ) = 0

or, using (3), (4) and    N   =       KN LRN ,

                          C(pS ) +                 CC               =    (pS ) + m (pM ) ,    (8)
               1                           T                 x(pS )

where v ne = [MS (pS ) + MN (pM )] T is the value of a patent with national exhaustion of
IPR in North, x( ) is the demand per consumer for the representative di¤erentiated product
as a function of its price, and m      MN =MS is the relative size of the Northern market. For m
large, the right-hand side of (8) exceeds the left-hand side for all values of pS above c. Then,
South’s government sets its price ceiling pne                   ne
                                           S equal to c, where pS denotes the price ceiling
in a regime with national exhaustion. Otherwise, pne
                                                  S is the value of pS that solves (8).
   The …rst-order condition (8) expresses the trade o¤ between the bene…t to South of the


                                                        10
extra product diversity that results from greater innovation and the loss in surplus that
Southern consumers su¤er as a result of higher prices there. The term = (1                      ) represents
the elasticity of innovation              N    with respect to the value of a patent v, and thus can be
interpreted as the supply elasticity of R&D.14 The government of South sets a more lenient
price control (higher ceiling) when innovation is more responsive to pro…ts, when product life
is long relative to the duration of patents, and when the South’s market is relatively large.15

3.2       Optimal Price Ceiling with International Exhaustion
Now suppose that North permits parallel imports. If the price of a di¤erentiated product in
North were to exceed the (regulated) price of the same good in South, an arbitrage opportu-
nity would present itself. We have assumed that shipping and distribution are costless, which
means that no such arbitrage opportunities can persist in equilibrium. With international
exhaustion, either a di¤erentiated product must carry the same price in both markets or
the price charged by patent holders for sales in the regulated market must be so high as to
preclude sales there.
       Under the threat of such arbitrage, a Northern patent holder faces a choice. It can set a
price for sales in South that exceeds the price ceiling, thereby e¤ectively cutting o¤ supply
from that region and eliminating any source of reimports. Or it can accept the competition
from arbitrageurs and sell in both markets at a price less than or equal to the South’s
controlled price. The former strategy allows the …rm to earn maximal pro…ts in the Northern
market. The latter strategy a¤ords (possibly) positive pro…ts in South at the expense of
diminished pro…ts at home.
       We de…ne p~ implicitly by

                                          (MN + MS ) (~
                                                      p) = MN (pM ) ;                                     (9)

this is the price at which the two strategies yield equal pro…ts. If the government of South sets
a price ceiling below p~, a Northern patent holder earns higher pro…ts by selling at home at
pM and eschewing all sales in South than it does by selling in both markets at the maximum
price allowed by South. It can achieve these pro…ts, for example, by setting the price pM for
all sales. If the South’s price ceiling instead exceeds p~, the patent holder prefers to sell in both
markets at the highest price allowed in South. It cannot be optimal for South’s government
to allow its market for di¤erentiated products to be foreclosed. Accordingly, the government

       These claims rely on the second-order conditions being satis…ed, which we assume to be the case.

of South chooses its price ceiling pS subject to the constraint that pS                      p~.
   Let us ignore the constraint for a moment. Then the …rst-order condition for the optimal
choice of the South’s price ceiling is given by

                    d N dv ie                                                0

                     dv dpS
which, with v ie = [(MS + MN ) (pS )] T , implies that

where v ie is the value of a patent with international exhaustion (and thus uniform pricing)
and p is the price ceiling that South would enforce in a regime with parallel trade if it were
subject to no constraints.
   If p > p~, the constraint that dictates a price ceiling high enough to ensure positive sales in
South does not bind. Then the government optimally sets a maximum price of p . Otherwise,
the governments sets the ceiling at p~, the lowest level that generates positive supply. In other
words, the optimal price ceiling for South in a regime in which North permits parallel imports
is given by

3.3   Comparing Prices and Pro…ts in the Alternative IPR Regimes
In Figure 1, we depict pne
                        S , p and p
                                  ~ as functions of m, the relative size of the Northern market.
The price ceiling with national exhaustion pne
                                            S is a decreasing function of m until it reaches
c at some …nite level of m, which we denote by m1 . South’s government would never set a
price ceiling below c, because patent holders would not serve the Southern market at prices
below marginal production cost. Accordingly, pne
                                              S = c for all m                           m1 . Notice that p = pne
                                                                                                              S
when m = 0 inasmuch as the incentives facing the Southern government are the same in the
two regimes when the Northern market is negligibly small. However, p is independent of m
under international exhaustion; this is because arbitrage renders the e¤ect of price controls
on the incentives for innovation independent of the geographic distribution of world demand.
Finally, (9) implies that p~ = c at m = 0 and that p~ is an increasing function of m for all
m > 0. This is because patent holders will sell in South at any price equal to or exceeding
marginal cost when the Northern market is negligibly small, but require an ever higher price
to sell there (under the threat of arbitrage) as the Northern market grows relatively larger.
Let m2 be the level of m at which p = p~.
   The …gure depicts pne     ie
                      S and pS in bold. Evidently, we have

Proposition 1 Suppose that South does not innovate and North imposes no price controls.
Then pie   ne
      S > pS for all m > 0.

Intuitively, the prospect of arbitrage mitigates the ability of South to free ride on the intel-
lectual property protection a¤orded by North. With more at stake in terms of the adverse
e¤ect of a price ceiling on the innovation rate, the South will accept higher domestic prices.
And the gap between the pie     ne
                         S and pS is all the greater when, in the presence of parallel trade,
the South is forced to set a price ceiling even higher than its preferred (unconstrained) choice
to give patent holders reason to serve its market.
   Now we are ready to compare the options facing North’s government. We begin with
m < m2 , so that p > p~ and thus pie
                                  S = p . Let us de…ne the function

                                                          T        T            0 (p)
                        (p)                C(p) +                      CC                 .
                                 1                            T                x(p)

Notice that the left-hand side of (8) is           (pne
                                                     S ) and the left-hand side of (10) is             (p ). For
some demand functions (more on this later), the following condition holds.

Condition 1 Either      00   < 0 or j   00 = 0 j   <j   00 = 0 j   for all p 2 [c; pM ).

In the appendix we prove the following lemma.

Lemma 1 Suppose that South does not innovate, North imposes no price controls, m < m1 ,
and Condition 1 is satis…ed. Then (MN + MS ) (p ) > MN (pM ) + MS (pne
                                                                    S ).


                                                        13
       The consequent of Lemma 1 states that aggregate pro…ts for a patent holder are greater
when there is international exhaustion of IPR in North and South sets its price control at p
than they are when there is national exhaustion and South sets its price control at pne
                                                                                     S > c.
Figure 2, which depicts the case of a linear             (p) curve, may help us to understand why this
is so. The concave          (p) curve and the linear         (p) intersect at point E; which determines
p . The …gure also shows (m + 1) (p) and (p) + m (pM ). The intersection of                            (p) and
 (p) + m (pM ) at the point labelled C gives the price ceiling with national exhaustion,
pne                                              ne
 S . Note that (MN + MS ) (p ) > MN (pM ) + MS (pS ) if and only if (m + 1) (p ) >
 (pne
   S ) + m (pM ); i.e., if and only if the length of HD exceeds m times the length of F I.
But m = [ (pne
            S )             (pne
                              S )] = (pM ) by (8), and so is represented in the …gure by the ratio of
the length of CD to the length of F G. Therefore, for the length of HD to exceed m times
the length of F I, we need the ratio of HD to CD to exceed the ratio of F I to F G. But this
is true, because the triangle CEH is similar to the triangle EIG, while the curve DEF is
concave. If the        (p) curve passing through G and E instead were concave, the point C would
lie to the southwest of the position shown, which would strengthen the argument. However,
if the      (p) curve passing through G and E were convex, point C would lie to the northeast
of the position shown. In this case, the length of HD would exceed m times the length of F I
if and only if the absolute value of the curvature of             (p) were less than that of the curvature
of     (p).16
       Next we will show that, under Condition 1, m1 < m2 , as depicted in Figure 1. Recall
that m1 is the smallest value of m for which pne
                                              S = c (South’s government sets a price
ceiling at the marginal production cost in the absence of parallel imports), while m2 is
the smallest value of m for which p~              p (the constraint on South’s government to ensure
positive supply in a regime with parallel imports binds). Suppose that m1 > m2 . Then
(1 + m2 ) (p ) exceeds m2 (pM ) + [pne
                                    S (m2 )] by Lemma 1, which in turn exceeds m2 (pM )
by the fact that pne
                  S (m2 ) > c. But m2 (pM ) = (1 + m2 ) [~
                                                         p(m2 )] by the de…nition of p~. So
(1 + m2 ) (p ) > (1 + m2 ) [~
                            p (m2 )], which implies that p > p~ at m2 . But this contradicts
the de…nition of m2 .
       For m between m1 and m2 , South’s government sets a price ceiling of pne
                                                                             S = c in a regime
with national exhaustion of IPR in North and a price ceiling of pie
                                                                 S = p in a regime with
international exhaustion in North. With national exhaustion, aggregate pro…ts per patent
are MN (pM ). With international exhaustion, pro…ts are (MN + MS ) (p ), which exceeds
(MN + MS ) (~
            p) because p > p~. But (MN + MS ) (~
                                               p) = MN (pM ) by the de…nition of p~.
It follows that global pro…ts per patent are higher with international exhaustion than with
national exhaustion for this range of values of m as well.
       Finally, when m         m2 , pne         ie

to MN (pM ). We conclude that, under Condition 1, the value of a patent when North
tolerates parallel imports is no less than the value of a patent when it bars such imports,
and patents actually are more valuable with parallel trade whenever m < m2 . Innovation
responds positively to the value of a patent. It follows that innovation is at least as great,
and for small m is greater, in a regime with legal parallel trade.
   We are now ready to address the North’s choice of IPR regime and to evaluate the
implications of this choice for welfare in South. Let WNj denote North’s aggregate welfare (as
de…ned in (7)) in regime j, for j = fne; ieg. We have

Proposition 2 Suppose that South does not innovate, North imposes no price controls, and
Condition 1 is satis…ed. Then WNie > WNne .

   Proof. We have already seen that the innovation rate                     N   is at least as great in a
regime with international exhaustion in North as in a regime with national exhaustion. Also,
pne            ie          ~] < pM , where pjN is the price of a patented di¤erentiated
 N = pM while pN = max[p ; p
product in North in regime j: So C(pie       ne
                                    N ) > C(pN ). Finally, note the term                       NT   N   LRN
that appears in WN . This is aggregate pro…ts from all patents minus the cost of labor used
in research. But T     N      = v, the value of a patent, and the LRN that is chosen in each regime
                                                          ie   ie                ne
maximizes    Nv      LRN ; see (4). It follows that       NT   N      Lie
                                                                       RN        NT
                                                                                          ne
                                                                                          N    Lne

maxLRN (    Nv    LRN ) is increasing in v and the value of a patent is at least as great in a
regime with international exhaustion as in a regime with national exhaustion.

                                                     15
   Whereas North fares better by choosing international exhaustion (when Condition 1 is
satis…ed), this choice adversely impacts welfare in South. We record this observation in

Proposition 3 Suppose that South does not innovate, North imposes no price controls, and
Condition 1 is satis…ed. Then WSie < WSne .

   Proof. With international exhaustion, the world price of a patented good is pie
                                                                                S . In a
regime with national exhaustion, it is feasible for South’s government to set its price ceiling
for patented goods at pie
                       S . This would generate the same consumer surplus in South as in
a regime with international exhaustion and, because pie
                                                     S < pM , more innovation and greater
product diversity. Thus, by setting a price ceiling of pie
                                                        S in a regime with national exhaustion,
South could achieve greater welfare than WSie . Its optimal choice of pne
                                                                       S must yield even
greater welfare.
   This leads us to ask how likely it is that Condition 1 will be satis…ed. The expression for
Condition 1 in terms of the primitive parameters of the model is rather complicated. But we
can readily examine a pair of special cases that yield familiar demand functions.

           Constant Elasticity Demand
                                                    "
   Suppose that h(x) = a1="                        " 1       x("      1)="   for a > 0, " > 1. Then the demand function
is x(p) = ap     ",   which has a constant-elasticity form. The monopoly price in this case is a
mark-up over marginal cost, or pM = c"=("                                    1). We calculate that

     0                                     "              " (p        c)                           c" p1 "   c1 "                T
         (p) =   a                 p           1                              a                            +                             1   ,
                      1                                          p                1                p2 " 1 " 1                    T

which is negative for all p 2 [c; pM ]: Now we de…ne Z                                        00 (p) 0 (p)        0 (p) 00 (p).   and calculate

                                                                                                                     T
             Z=        a2 c"p      2(2+")
                                                                       p2 + c1    " "
                                                                                   p [c"           ("    2) p]               1       ,

which is negative for all p 2 [c; c"=("                              1)]. Since       0 (p)   < 0 and        0 (p)   > 0 for all p 2 [c; pM ),
Z < 0 implies j       00 = 0 j   <j        00 = 0 j   and Condition 1 is satis…ed. Notice that this is true for all
values of " > 1.

           Linear Demand
   Suppose that h(x) = A + ax=b                              x2 =2b for a > 0, b > 0, and a > bc. This last parameter
restriction ensures positive demand when a good is competitively priced. Then the demand
function x(p) = a            bp is linear and the monopoly price is pM = (a + bc) =2b. We …nd that
                                                             2                                                           3
                                       1                                                      (a    bc)3     T
                                                                                                             T       1
                       0
                           (p) =                             43a + bc             4bp +                                  5 ,
                                       2       1                                                    (a     bp)2

                                                                             16
which again is negative for all p 2 [c; pM ]. Now we calculate
                                                           "                        #

                                                                          (a bc)3   T

which is negative for all p 2 [c; (a + bc) =2b). Therefore, with linear demands too, Condition
1 is satis…ed.

    We conclude from these examples that Condition 1 is not unreasonable inasmuch as it
always is satis…ed for two families of commonly-used demand functions. When the condition
is satis…ed, the orthodox view that allowing parallel imports would retard innovation and
harm a country that specializes in research is false. Once we recognize that this country’s
trade partners will regulate prices di¤erently according to the prevailing policy on exhaustion
of IPR, we …nd that the policy change induced by a switch to international exhaustion can
easily be large enough to allow the innovating country to enjoy lower prices, greater pro…ts,
faster innovation, and higher welfare.


4     Extensions
In this section, we relax two of the simplifying assumptions that were used in the preceding
analysis to highlight our main points. First, we allow for positive research capacity and thus
active innovation activity in South. Second, we allow for the possibility that North may
institute price controls of its own.

4.1     Innovation in South
In Section 3, we emphasized the asymmetries in research capacities by assuming that KS = 0.
Now we allow for KS > 0, which, with the Cobb-Douglas technology for product development,
ensures positive innovation in South. As before, we assume that any wage gap that exists
between North and South matches a gap in labor productivity in all activities (including
research). Then LRS in the technology for product development in South measures the labor
deployed in Southern research in e¢ ciency units.
    When South is endowed with research capital, the objective function for country j becomes

                   1
         Wj =             Lj   LRj + (      N   +    S)   T MS C(pS ) + T                   T MS CC +      jT   j    ,

where    j   = MN (pN ) + MS (pS ) is the global pro…t earned by a typical producer in country


                                                               17
j of a patented good when prices of such products in North and South are pN and pS ,
respectively. The expression for welfare re‡ects that households in country j derive consumer
surplus from di¤erentiated products produced anywhere in the world, but they derive pro…t
income only from producers in their own country. Notice that                                     S   =   N   under our assumption
of wage equalization in e¢ ciency units, and thus the value of a patent v is the same in both
countries.
       Firms in South hire (e¢ ciency) labor to perform research up to the point where the
marginal value product is equal to the wage, or v (KS =LRS )1                                        = 1. Together with (4), the
analogous condition for equilibrium investment in North, and the production function for
                           1
innovation,     j   = LRj KRj , this implies              N= S       = KN =KS . We let                           j   = Kj = (KN + KS )
denote the fraction of the world stock of research capital located in country j. Then                                               j   also
is the fraction of world innovation that takes place in country j; i.e.,                                     j   =     j= ( N   +   S ).
       Still assuming that North does not regulate prices, South’s government chooses pS in
a regime with national exhaustion of IPR to maximize WS . The …rst-order condition that
applies when pne
              S > c is

Note the similarity with (8), to which (12) reduces when                                   S   = 0.
       We can similarly derive South’s choice of price control that applies under international
exhaustion of IPR when the constraint that pie
                                            S                            p~ does not bind. The analog to equation
(10) above is
                                                                 T T

We de…ne
                                                                                 T T
                                                              C(p) +              T        CC
                                    (p)                              x(p)
                                                                                                     .

Then (12) can be written as             (pS ) =       (pS ) + m (pM ), while the value of p that solves (13)
must be bigger than the p that solves                 (p) = (p); call the latter p .
       We now introduce a modi…ed version of Condition 1, namely

Condition 2 Either         00   < 0 or j     00 = 0 j   <j    00 = 0 j   for all p 2 [c; pM ).
  17                                                                         0
   To derive (12), we use the fact that dv ne =dpS = MS T                        (pS ), dC=dpS =             x(pS ) and v (d    S =dpS )   =
dLRS =dpS .


                                                              18
We can use exactly the same strategy and arguments as before to prove that if Condition
2 is satis…ed and pne
                   S > c, then (m + 1) (p ) > m (pM ) +                          (pne
                                                                                   S ). But since p > p ,
this is su¢ cient to establish that (m + 1) (p ) > m (pM ) +                     (pne
                                                                                   S ). In other words, with
Condition 2 and pne
                 S > c, global pro…ts per …rm and the world innovation rate are greater
with international exhaustion of IPR in North than with national exhaustion. It is also true
as before that when pne
                     S = c, global pro…ts per …rm are at least as high with international
exhaustion as with national exhaustion. And North enjoys higher consumer surplus with
parallel trade. This establishes

Proposition 4 Suppose that North imposes no price controls and Condition 2 is satis…ed.
Then WNie > WNne .


       Note, however, that Condition 2 may be more stringent than Condition 1. We compute for
example that if the demand function x(p) is linear, Condition 2 is satis…ed for all parameters
b, c and a > bc when           S   < :38. If the demand function has constant elasticity " then
Condition 2 holds when         S   < 1=2 and both " and T =T are su¢ ciently large. For example, if
 S     = 0:2, Condition 2 is satis…ed if 3:1T + "(1:9T             2:3T ) < 1:9T or if " = 2 and T =T > 1:3.18
Of course, Condition 2 must be satis…ed for su¢ ciently small (but positive)                    S.   And while
Condition 2 is su¢ cient for       WNie   >   WNne ,   it is not a necessary condition for this outcome.

4.2       Price Controls in North
Up until now, we have assumed that North does not impose any price controls of its own.
This assumption can be rigorously justi…ed if administering price controls imposes …xed costs,
and if these costs fall in a range such that maintaining a regulatory program is worthwhile
for South but not for North. Now we shall examine a policy environment in which the …xed
costs of maintaining price controls, while not literally zero, are arbitrarily small.19
       To simplify the exposition, we assume once again that all research capacity is concentrated
in North. First consider the regulation game in a regime in which North does not allow parallel
imports. In this case, the best response by South to a price ceiling pN in North is given by
the solution to
                                                       T T

    The details of these calculations are available from the authors upon request.
  19
    We make the assumption of small administrative costs to eliminate some unreasonable Nash equilibria of
the regulation game that can otherwise arise when parallel imports are allowed. When regulatory schemes
are costless, each country might impose the same low price ceiling and while both countries would prefer to
see higher prices of patented goods, neither has an incentive to raise its ceiling as long as the other’s ceiling
is unchanged.



                                                             19
if such a solution exists with pS > c, and by pne
                                               S = c otherwise. In North, the maximization
of WN in (7) with respect to the choice of pN implies

                                                             T T

                          m                        x(pN )
                                                                                    =        (pS ) + m (pN ) .   (15)

                                                        N



Notice that pN < pM for all values of pS .20 This is because a price ceiling in North set just
below the monopoly price causes only a second-order reduction in pro…ts and so a negligible
loss of product diversity, but generates a …rst-order gain in consumer surplus. Note too that
pne   ne
 N > pS as long as m                 1, which re‡ects the fact that monopoly pro…ts accrue to households
in North but not to households in South and that a country with a larger market provides
more incentives to innovators for the same increment in the price ceiling.
       Now consider the game that emerges when parallel imports are permitted by North. We
de…ne pN as the uniform global price ceiling most preferred by the government of North21
and p as the one most preferred by South, which once again is the value of p that solves
(10). Note that pN > p , because the two governments face similar incentives except that
monopoly pro…ts accrue to households in North. If (MN + MS ) (p ) > MN (pM ), then
South will set a price ceiling of pie
                                   S = p and North will impose no price ceiling in the Nash
equilibrium of the regulation game. In this case, South’s government is unconstrained in its
choice of price ceiling, and North’s government has no reason to bear the (small) …xed cost of
a regulatory program. If (MN + MS ) (p ) < MN (pM ) but p~ (as de…ned in (9)) is less than
pN , then pie
           S =p
              ~ and again North has no price ceiling in the Nash equilibrium. In this case,
South is constrained and it chooses p~, but North has no reason to introduce a price control
because it would like to see South choose an even higher value of pie
                                                                   S than this. Finally,
if (MN + MS ) (p ) < MN (pM ) and p~ > pN , then North sets a price ceiling such that the
constrained government of South will choose pie
                                             S = pN in order that its market be served.
                                                                                       22

       In the appendix, we prove the following proposition that compares global pro…ts per …rm,
the values of a patent and rates of innovation in the alternative regimes.

is strictly positive.

   The proposition states that pro…ts are higher, patents are more valuable, and innovation
is faster when the North allows parallel imports than when it does not. The proof is tedious,
because it requires separate consideration of …ve di¤erent cases depending on whether pie
                                                                                       S
is equal to p , p~, or pN , whether pne
                                     S equals or exceeds c, and whether p exceeds or falls
short of pne
          N . However, the reasoning is straightforward in several of these scenarios, which
we describe now.
   First, suppose that p > pne
                            N ; that is, an unconstrained South would choose a higher price
ceiling under international exhaustion than North’s Nash equilibrium price ceiling in the
regulation game with national exhaustion. Since the prevailing world prices with international
exhaustion are at least as high as p , and the prices in North and South with national
exhaustion are both lower than p , global pro…ts must be higher in the former regime than
in the latter.
   Next suppose that pie       ne     ne
                      S = p < pN and pS > c; i.e., the constraint on South’s government
to ensure positive supply of its market does not bind in either regime. Then it chooses p under
international exhaustion and a price above marginal cost under national exhaustion. Now
the argument is very similar to that used in proving the analogous result that applies when
North eschews price regulation. Figure 3, like Figure 2, depicts a linear                   (p) curve. When
there is national exhaustion of IPR in North, the Nash equilibrium of the regulation game

                                                  21
                                                                                    0
has        (pne        ne      ne
             S ) = m (pN ) + (pS ) which is represented by the point C in the …gure. South’s
choice of price ceiling with international exhaustion is found at E, where                (p ) = (p ). The
comparison of global pro…ts in the two equilibria now requires a comparison of the length
of H 0 D0 with m times the length of F 0 I 0 . But the relative size of the two markets m is
represented in Figure 3 by the ratio of the length of C 0 D0 to the length of F 0 G0 . So, the
concavity of (p) ensures that (m + 1) (p ) > m (pne      ne
                                                 N ) + (pS ). And, if                      (p) is concave, or
convex with curvature less than that of (p), we reach the same conclusion.
         A third case arises when pie      p; pN ] and pne
                                   S = min[~            S = c; i.e., South would like to set a lower
price ceiling in both regimes, but in each case it is constrained by the need to ensure positive
supply of its market. In this scenario, the pro…ts in North under international exhaustion
are at least as large as          (pN ) and those in South are positive. When parallel imports are
forbidden by North, pro…ts there are (pne                                                ne
                                       N ) while those in South are nil. But pN exceeds pN
for much the same reason that p exceeds pne
                                         S ; namely, North would choose a higher price
were that price to apply to markets in both countries than the price it chooses when the
price applies only at home. So patent holders earn higher pro…ts in both countries under
international exhaustion than under national exhaustion.
         Although Proposition 5 gives conditions under which parallel imports promote innovation
(by inducing changes in price regulation), these conditions do not guarantee a welfare gain for
households in North. Contrary to the common wisdom that parallel imports would enhance
consumer surplus but retard innovation, just the opposite can happen when North has price
controls of its own in the absence of parallel trade, and the endogenous response of these
controls is taken into account. If pie       ne
                                    S = p < pN , then consumer surplus in North is higher with
international exhaustion than national exhaustion, and Northern welfare is unambiguously
higher in the former regime than the latter. But if a ban on parallel trade leads North’s
government to set a reasonably tight price control in the Nash equilibrium of the regulation
game, then a removal of the ban could lead to a rise in prices for Northern consumers.23 If
so, the North still may bene…t from parallel trade, but the realization of such a bene…t would
require that the gains from greater product variety exceed the losses from higher prices.


5         Conclusions
Many countries impose price controls on pharmaceutical products to hold down the cost of
medicine to national health plans and local consumers. Such controls have generated sizable
di¤erences in the prices of similar drugs in di¤erent countries. The price gaps in turn create
incentives for arbitrage in the form of “re-importation” or parallel trade.
         Current trade rules leave the legality of such trade in the hands of the importing country.

In many of these countries, the question as to whether intellectually property rights should be
exhausted nationally or internationally has been highly controversial. Consumer advocates
argue for parallel importation as means to temper monopoly pricing, while the pharmaceutical
lobby points to the adverse e¤ects of price controls on the returns to research. By allowing
parallel imports, they claim, a country would import its trade partner’s price controls and
thereby undermine intellectual property and dampen incentives for innovation.
   In this paper, we have examined the welfare economics of parallel trade in a setting in
which such trade is motivated by di¤erential price controls. Our analytical framework is
one in which the protection of IPR creates a static distortion due to monopoly pricing, but
provides incentives for ongoing innovation. Our analysis takes o¤ from the observation that
governments face di¤erent incentives for regulating prices when parallel imports are allowed
by their trade partners than when they are not. Therefore, an evaluation of the costs and
bene…ts of allowing parallel imports should incorporate the indirect e¤ects of the trade regime
on the level of foreign price controls.
   We considered a two-country world in which product development is highly (or entirely)
concentrated in one country (“North”) and compared outcomes when this country practices
international versus national exhaustion of its patent rights. We found that the less innovative
country (“South”) always sets a more lenient price ceiling in the former regime than the latter.
In other words, the prospect of arbitrage induces the low-price country to accept higher prices
than otherwise. This is because arbitrage forces the country to export its price controls and
so impedes its ability to free-ride on the research incentives provided by its trade partner
This prediction of the model is consistent with the observation by Kanavos and Costa-Font
(2005) that the growth of parallel trade in Europe has been accompanied by a relaxation of
price controls in low-price countries such as Portugal, Italy and France, which now tolerate
prices closer to European averages than they did before.
   We …rst considered a setting in which South does no R&D and North imposes no price
controls. We provided a su¢ cient condition under which global pro…t ‡ows per patent, the
value of a patent, and the pace of innovation are higher when North allows parallel imports
than when it does not. Since reimportation also reduces prices in North, this country enjoys
both higher surplus per product and greater product variety when it tolerates parallel trade.
In contrast, the legalization of parallel imports by North spells a welfare loss for South,
where the pain of higher prices outweighs the gain of faster innovation. We showed that our
su¢ cient condition is satis…ed by all linear and constant-elasticity demand functions.
   Relaxing our assumptions of no Southern innovation and no Northern price regulation
introduced some caveats but did not alter the gist of our conclusions. With positive but
limited innovation in South, North still fares better by allowing parallel imports to cross its
borders. When both countries impose price ceilings non-cooperatively in a world without
parallel trade, a switch in trade regime again raises the return to R&D. However, in this

                                              23
case, faster innovation may come at the expense of higher drug prices in both countries.
   Lobbies for pharmaceutical …rms have vigorously encouraged their trade authorities to
negotiate the relaxation or elimination of foreign price controls. Our analysis suggests that
legalizing the reimportation of prescription medicines, perhaps paradoxically, might further
their cause.

^ (p ) = ^ (p ) = 0 and ^ 0 (p ) = ^ 0 (p ) =            ). Thus, ^ (p) and ^ (p) are tangent at
                                                      0 (p

p = p . Note too that ^ 00 (p) =        00 (p) > 0, while ^ 00 (p) =  00 (p) ? 0. If Condition 1 is

satis…ed, then ^ (p) ^ (p) for all p 2 [c; pm ], with equality only at p = p .
    Suppose Condition 1 is satis…ed. Then

                                k [ (p)      (p )]      (p )    (p),

with equality only at p = p . Therefore

                               k [ (pne
                                     S )     (p )] < (p )       (pne
                                                                  S )                         (A1)

and
                              k [ (pM )      (p )] < (p )       (pM ) .                       (A2)

But    (pM ) = 0, which, with (A1) and (A2), implies

                                (p )       (pne
                                             S )      (pne

                                (pM )       (p )           (p )

This in turn implies
                                (pne
                                  S )      (pS )      (pne

Recognizing that the left-hand side of this inequality is equal to m, we have

                           (m + 1) (p ) > (pne                ne
                                            S ) = m (pM ) + (pS ) .



        Proof of Proposition 5

    We distinguish …ve cases.
    (i) p > pne

    Since pie
           S      p > pne            ie
                       S , (m + 1) (pS )     (m + 1) (p ) > m ( pne      ne
                                                                 N ) + (pS ).

    (ii) pie       ne     ne
          S = p < pN and pS > c

    De…ne k, ^ (p) and ^ (p) as in the proof of Lemma 1. We have seen there that if Condition
1 is satis…ed,
                                k [ (p)      (p )]      (p )    (p)


                                                 27
for all p 2 [c; pM ], with equality only at p = p . Therefore

                              k [ (pne
                                    N)     (p )] < (p )         (pne

Since   (pne
          N ) > 0, (A1) and (A3) imply

                       (p )    (pne
                                 S )   (pne

                                                                  S )     (p )
                                     >                     >                   .

This in turn implies
                                (pne
                                  S )      (pS )      (pne
                                                        S )     (p )
                                       ne        >                   .
                                     (pN )                 (p )
Recognizing that the left-hand side of this inequality is equal to m, we have

                (m + 1) (pie                     ne        ne      ne
                          S ) = (m + 1) (p ) > (pS ) = m (pN ) + (pS ) .




   (iii) pie      p; pN ] and pne
          S = min[~            S >c

   In part (ii) we established that (m + 1) (p ) > m (pne      ne          ie
                                                       N ) + (pS ). Here, ps > p .
Therefore, (m + 1) (pie        ne      ne
                     S ) > m (pN ) + (pS ).

   (iv) pie       ne     ne
         S = p < pN and pS = c

   The fact that pie
                  S     p~ implies (m + 1) (pie
                                             s )       m (pM ) > m (pne        ne      ne
                                                                     N ) = m (pN ) + (pS ).

   (v) pie      p; pN ] and pne
        S = min[~            S =c

   Note that pN > pne                      ie
                   N . Therefore (m + 1) (pS )                 m (pie
                                                                   S)      m (pN ) > m (pne
                                                                                         N) =
m (pne      ne
