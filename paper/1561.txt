     Typically measures of multifactor productivity growth have been

based on a production and optimization framework that assumes all

inputs are instantaneously adjustable, thus ignoring the important

impacts of short run fixity of certain inputs. This paper focuses

on the distinction between short and long run production behavior

represented by economic capacity utilization indexes, and on the

adjustment of observed productivity measures for the effects of

short run fixity characterized by these indexes. A dynamic optimization

model based on adjustment costs for quasi—fixed inputs is developed

to calculate capacity utilization adjustments for productivity growth

measures. The resulting framework is then used to identify

empirically the effects of capacity utilization, nonstatic expectations,

nonconstant returns to scale and adjustment costs for both capital

and labor on productivity growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector,

1947—1979.

I. INTRODUCTION

      Measures of multifactor productivity growth have long been linked

to outward shifts in production isoquants or downward shifts in

average cost curves. Typically, such links have been built on a

production and optimization framework that assumes all inputs are

instantaneously adjustable, and thus assumes also that there is no

distinction between short and long run. This distinction can be very

important, however, particularly when large shocks occur, for in such

cases the characteristics of the firm's short run behavior during the

initial part of the adjustment response may differ substantially from

those occurring once long run equilibrium has been attained. This

paper focuses attention on the implications for multifactor productivity

measurement of increasing marginal adjustment costs for quasi—fixed

inputs, and thus on the need to distinguish short- from long-run impacts.

      Most of the models currently used for productivity analysis are

based on the assumptions of full utilization or long run equilibrium

and static expectations at all points in time for all inputs. More

specifically, these models are typically based on the assumption that

firms always use both technically and economically efficient input

combinations. Thus productivity growth may be represented by

,nY/3t -            (where Y is output, defined by the production function
              Eft
Y =   f(x),   and t represents the state of technology), or by

9nC/t -             (where   C is total costs). Ohta (1975) has developed

the dual relationship between Cft and                                 by showing that with

constant returns to scale (CRTS)               E        =       c     and with nonconstant
                                                   ft            ct
returns to scale (NCRTS)        C        = c                ,      where   ccy =   a9..nC/SLnY.

These representations of productivity, however, permit no distinction

between short and long run since they are essentially based on a

static or timeless model where all inputs are assumed instantaneously

variable.

     This problem was recognized in early studies of technical change

such as that by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), who attempted to adjust

productivity measures for cyclical adjustment using capacity utilization

(CU) indices. Such cyclical adjustments, however, have ambiguous inter-

pretation and have been a source of dispute since they are not based on

a theoretical foundation within which the short run-long run nature of

productivity growth is isolated.

     More recently, Berndt and Fuss (1981) and Baily (1981) have

attempted to capture the effect of "disequilibrium" using the deviation

of market- and implicit-valuation of the fixed capital stock faced by

the firm. These studies are of crucial importance for focussing

attention on the impacts of input stocks. Ambiguities still remain,

however, concerning the roles of dynamic optimization and anticipatory

expectations.

     In order to facilitate interpretation of utilization decisions and

resulting implications for productivity growth, an integrating framework

is required to capture variations in utilization, anticipatory behavior

and costs of adjustment, as well as the effects of nonconstant returns

to scale. Such a framework, a dynamic optimization model of an

imperfectly competitive firm producing at a point of long run nonconstant

returns to scale with increasing marginal adjustment costs on quasi-

fixed inputs and nonstatic expectations, has been constructed by
                                  —4—




Morrison (1983b,1984). The model is based on costs of adjustment for

quasi-fixed inputs that induce slow adjustment by firms to "optimal"

or "desired" levels of the quasi—fixed inputs consistent with nonstatic

expectations on prices and output. The model is structured so one can

derive explicitly a system of short run demand equations for variable

inputs and accumulation equation(s) for quasi-fixed input(s) based

on an endogenous "flexible accelerator" or partial adjustment process,

as n Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979). Thus by characterizing the

corresponding cost curves one can determine the firm's optimal

adjustment path from the short to long run in response to a temporary

disequilibrium situation.

     In this paper I show how various impacts on observed productivity

can be identified and measured within such a framework. The plan of

the paper is as follows. In Section II I first demonstrate that (i)

multifactor productivity measures are affected systematically by

divergence between long run equilibrium and short run (temporary)

equilibrium, hereafter denoted subequilibrium,   (ii) a properly

defined index of capacity utilization (CU) can be used to quantify this

divergence, and (iii) the existence of nonstatic expectations,

adjustment costs, and nonconstant returns to scale affects the time

path of investment and thus the time pattern of measured productivity

growth through impacts on CU. In Section III I develop and report on

an empirically implementable econometric model that permits separate

identification of the effects of CU, nonstatic expectations, adjustment

costs and nonconstant returns to scale on productivity in the U.S.

manufacturing sector, 1947-1979. A primary finding is that both
                                  —5—




subequilibriuin and anticipatory behavior have substantial impacts on

observed productivity measures. In addition, there is a notable

difference between two alternative models used, which suggests that

disaggregation of labor into production and nonproduction workers and

recognition of the quasi—fixity of nonproduction workers are crucial

for developing valid measures of productivity trends. Finally, in

Section IV I focus on how this research integrates much of the

previous literature on factor demands and productivity growth, and thus

provides a framework within which to reconcile alternative approaches.

II. PRODUCTIVITY AND ITS COMPONENTS: A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

     Productivity growth is defined as the diminution in total costs

from an increase in the state of technology (t) not explained by

substitution between inputs-—the residual €.       In   order empirically

to identify the impacts on total productivity mentioned in the

Introduction, a framework must be constructed in which deviations of

capacity utilization (Cu) from unity, nonstatic expectations, adjustment

costs, and nonconstarit returns to scale (NCRTS) are incorporated.

This requires recognizing the constraints on the firm which result in

subequilibrium utilization of the quasi-fixed inputs. Thus the analysis

is structured around a cost function divided explicitly into variable

and fixed cost components. The output or price choice for a firm

facing a demand curve with finite elasticity is assumed to be a

sequential decision, taken into account in the estimating model. I

begin by using this general framework to identify the current

subequilibrium--CU--and technical progress components of observed

productivity growth. Additional extensions are considered in turn.

     Assume the restricted or variable cost function can be represented

by G(x.,*.,w.,t,Y) where x. is a vector of J quasi-fixed input

quantities, k.     is the   time derivative of x.,, and w. is the vector
                                                J        1
of   I variable input prices. Increasing marginal costs of adjustment

due to         0 affect variable costs according to             >   0,
           >   0, and thus make the optimization problem a dynamic one.
     As outlined in Lau (1978) and Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979), G

represents minimum variable costs given x., w. and Y, and under

appropriate regularity conditions has standard properties including:
                                                    —7—




(la)         G/w. =            v = cost minimizing variable i input demand, and
  b)        -G/ax. =                   = shadow value for quasi-fixed input j.



A "shadow value of investment" can be defined analogously as:


  c)        -G/k. =
                       3
                               Z.  3
                                       =   the shadow value of k.
                                                                      3




This expression represents the marginal cost savings involved if one

less unit of investment is required to reach a given level of capital

stock. It therefore represents the "flow" costs incorporated in the
                           1
dynamic framework.

       Total costs are variable plus fixed costs or C(Y,t,w.,p.,x.,.) =
                                                                            13     J   3

        1    J     3           33 J                     3
prices for the fixed inputs. The change in total costs from technical

progress, represented by                     d9..nC/dt, is characterized by the full response

of both variable and quasi—fixed inputs to long run equilibrium levels:

                                                                dx.

This is a long run cost elasticity analogous to typical long run price

and output elasticities.2 In effect the long run adjustment is a

geometric series of adjustments toward the desired quasi-fixed input

stocks x* which are assumed to close the "gap" between x and x

by the proportion A in each period. This decomposition captures the

flavor of the difference between short and long run producivity impacts,

but is not very useful for interpretation or linkages with the notion of

      This expression is in fact the conventional productivity residual

calculated as the difference between the change in output and the

actual share—weighted sum of the changes in inputs or, in the dual,

as the change in costs less the actual share—weighted sum of the changes

in input prices. Note that equation (5) is valid if long run equilibrium

and CRTS exist. The expression appears different than is usually

seen because of the explicit recognition of the fixed input constraint-—

       0, and of non-zero investment in temporary equilibrium--.                           0.


In the long run, however, (5) collapses to the usual expression since

Z =       and Z. = 0       so CCj =             0       for all i.4

This definition of shadow costs is slightly different than the "gross"

measure defined by Berndt and Fuss (1981) as G +
                                                                                         ZkK where the
contribution of the quasi-fixed inputs are weighted by their shadow

instead of rental values. The Berndt—Fuss expression derives, however,

from a static optimization framework where the contribution of investment

to costs is not explicitly defined. With dynamic optimization, shadow

costs are "net" of adjustment costs because the costs of putting the

marginal unit of capital into place are recognized.5

      Substituting (7) into (6) yields:

In (8)             is the expression for multifactor productivity with CU =                                       1,
and is analogous to that derived by Berndt-Fuss; it adjusts observed

productivity               to account for subequilibrium. Essentially, (8)

adjusts the shares so that the contribution of capital is weighted by

its net shadow instead of rental value and it normalizes so that the

sum   of   the resulting shares is equal to unity. There are three

additional features of (8):                     (i)           can be interpreted as the

product of a conventional productivity measure and a CU term,                                             (ii)

can be shown to be equal to the production or primal side technical

change measure adjusted for short tun subequilibrium,                                            ,   and

(iii)          can directly be represented empirically using a parametric

approach. I now pursue the first two points; the third is considered

in the next section.

        The value of the cost side measure, Ce/C or                                 (1 -
                                                                                           E€:cj_EE;.)i
can lie on either side of unity depending on whether the net shadow

valuation of the quasi—fixed inputs exceeds or falls short of the

market rental price.6 Thus the observed "residual" productivity change

multiplied by 1/CU =             1/(1   —              —          =       C/Ct    reflects the effect

only of technical progress, which may be larger or smaller than the

combined observed productivity effect.

        Development of the production—side representation of technical

progress requires demonstrating the equivalence of                                         with a

corresponding production—side measure                                 .     First   note that with

If productivity growth Cf                     is being measured from a point of

subequilibriuin, the quasi-fixed inputs must be revalued to represent

the subequilibriuxn. This can be characterized by defining p and f.

This    final expression is directly analogous to                                                      given by (8) above.

Duality of                  and 6ft in the CRTS case along with the equality

between                   and C together imply that Cft/CU =                                                       where

y*/y = 1/CU.              Thus the output CU measure is exactly dual to the

cost CU measure, provided long run CRTS and competition exist.

       In summary, in this integrated approach the observed productivity

change               is distorted from a true technical progress measure by

fixed inputs and resulting deviations in CU from unity. It is possible,

however, to inpute the true technical progress impact                             as the

product of two parts, the observed productivity effect and the effect of

short run rigidities or subequilibrium:

where in the long run                = 6.. = 0 so CU =       1   and

       The cost-CU measure and its use as a link between short and long run

productivity measures can be interpreted in various ways.7 One inter-

pretation of this CU measure is as a form of a "multi—input Tobin's q"

measure. Specifically, 6Cj depends crucially on the deviation between

Z, and p, which is the basis for the calculation of marginal Tobin's

q as Zk/pkl where k represents capital, and where only the stock

effects or gross shadow value of capital is considered. Therefore in the

case of one quasi-fixed input, adjustment by Tobin's q as suggested by

Berridt and Fuss is equivalent to multiplication by CU. When there are

multiple quasi-fixed inputs, while the weighting of different quasi-fixed

inputs for Tobin's q is anthiguous, the CU adjustment is clearly

appropriate.

       Another interpretation of the cost CU measure is as a ratio of short

and long run returns to scale, where short run returns to scale are defined

over variable factors given fixed capital =                          = (1 -             —
                                                        CCY(sr)                   Ec.
This   view of CU is consistent with Ohta; in order to isolate technical
                                  —14—




change one must adjust by returns to scale, which in this case involves

short run returns.

    A final interpretation of the cost CU measure refers more to

conventional methods of productivity measurement. Multiplication of the

conventional measure by C/C* in effect revalues the shares of each of

the inputs and, therefore, the weight on the change in that input to

reflect the utilization of the given capital stock instead of the

measured share. This multiplication incorporates the true economic

valuation of the capital stock--its shadow marginal productivity in

conjunction with the other inputs--instead of its simple market

transaction value.

     The CU adjustment therefore is important and is consistent with

alternative interpretations. Observed productivity changes must also,

however, be recognized to depend on the existence of nonstatic

expectations, adjustment costs and NCRTS. I now consider these additions

to the basic structure.

     The conceptual importance of the extension to nonstatic expectations

is that some current behavior of the firm may not correctly be imputed

to responses in terms of current exogenous variables, but may result from

anticipation of future economic conditions. Since the firm cannot

respond instantaneously at a future point in time, it is rational for it

to adjust partially before the exogenous change. Assuming that the

observed productivity residual is a result only of rational optimizing

firm behavior in terms of current variables may therefore omit important

information that can further clarify the productivity residual.

     Introduction of nonstatic expectations introduces several
                                         —15—




complications. For example, with nonstatic expectations the economic

agent is not striving toward "desired" levels of quasi-fixed input stocks

x*(t) defined simply in terms of current variables, but instead can be

envisaged as moving toward the sum of x*(t) and a discounted weighted

average of the future desired stocks of x defined in terms of the

anticipated paths of exogenous variables, x :8


(12)          x(t) =   A(x* — x + J) = A(x**    —   x)       .

       In a model including nonstatic expectations the effect of J 0 on
the CU measure can be captured by imputing the current x that would

allow a geometric progression to x instead of to x, and then

determining the levels of variable inputs necessary to produce actual

output and these imputed investment levels, instead of those including all

anticipatory behavior. Two alternative CU measures can then be

calculated,       (i) a current value measure CU, and (ii) an imputed

present value measure CU .           The difference between these can be
                        pv
attributed to anticipatory behavior.

       CU      is based on measurement within the full nonstatic expectations
         cv
model and includes both subequilibrium and nonstatic expectations effects.

Calcualtion of CU             requires purging from               and   for all

the effects of investment due purely to anticipatory behavior, rather

than that attributed to current exogenous variables. This results in

the adjusted CU measure (1 -

observed variable input use. By contrast, adjustment by

   -          -            ' incorporates           the idea that variable inputs used for

anticipatory investment should not be evaluated as if they were

contributing to current productivity.

        Note that this procedure for purging the effects of anticipatory

behavior, although it attributes all current variable input demand to

decisions based on current variables, does not categorize all variable

input demands as those corresponding to current output production. To

sharpen measures of technical change it is however necessary to purge

costs of adjustment corresponding to all investment, not just antici—

patory investment, from the productivity calculation. To accomplish

this,     (1 -             -             or     CUt can be derived as a subequilibriuxn

indicator net of all investment costs that distort measurement of cost

diminution. By construction this measure purges the shares of variable

inputs of all input use that is not directly productive in terms of

augmenting current output levels.

        The final adjustment of productivity measures requires incorporation

of NCRTS. The importance of this extension in the preceding analysis

based on CRTS is first evident in equation (3); the substitution of

(1 -          —

With nonconstant returns to scale, d2,nC/d9nY =                              r    where l/rj captures

long run returns to scale, and d9nx./d2.nY = d2nc/d2.nY =                                        1.

       With nonconstant returns to scale, the shares are thus adjusted to

reflect the fact that some increases in tiefficiencyul or decreases in

cost are simply due to scale effects. The NCRTS adjustment alters the

cost shares to represent output shares- —purging the share of the scale

effect that decreases costs with no true increase in input efficiency.

III. EMPIRICAL ILLUSTRATION

     I now turn to an empirical implementation of the decomposition of the

path of productivity growth over time. Specifically, I attempt to assess

empirically the role of subequilibrium, adjustment costs, nonstatic

expectations, and NCRTS in determining the 1949-1979 path of productivity

growth in U.S. manufacturing.10 I proceed first to summarize the

measures used to decompose observed productivity growth and to isolate

technical progress.

     The measure of productivity used as a reference point is

This is the conventional measure of cost-side total factor productivity

calculated from the data on actual cost shares and changes in cost and

input prices as the (negative) difference between ê/C and the share-

weighted sum of input prices ./w. and j./p. .           It is also a
justifiable measure of productivity growth given long run equilibrium,

instantaneous adjustment, static expectations, and CRTS. The decom-

position of 6Ct is carried out by generalizing each of these

restrictions. For expositional purposes, to represent C            I rely on

the conventional index of the state of technology or level of

productivity denoted At where         =   A/A.
     Some of the observed productivity residual           may   arise   simply

from short run "rigidities" rather than from technical progress. A

more appropriate measure to isolate the impact of subequilibrium has

                               =
been shown to be
                                   C/CU;         the corresponding produc-

tivity index is denoted At. This is the first adjustment to be

analyzed below.

     In addition, observed changes in productivity may arise from
                                         -20—




nonstatic expectations. To adjust for nonstatic expectations it is

sufficient simply to measure E                          and the resulting state of

technology A .           CU    is a temporary equilibrium indicator based on

current instead of intertemporal optimization. This is the second

adjustment to be discussed.

        Since some observed productivity may also result from fluctuations

in variable input use for investment, the corresponding adjustment costs

should be purged in order to derive a sharper measure of technical
                                                           I I I
                                                                   =                 and
progress. This is accomplished by calculating
                                                                       Cct/net   ,



cumulating these growth rates to derive the index of productivity

levels, A''. This is the third adjustment to be assessed.

        This third measure, however, reflects true technical progress only

if the technology exhibits CRTS. Otherwise, the apparent productivity

changes resulting from scale effects are incorrectly attributed to

technical progress. To adjust for this it is necessary to multiply by

returns to scale, or in the notation above, to calculate

        =         /fl   and the associated At
                                        III,
        This final expression for                is the technical progress residual

after adjusting for the full set of structural and behavioral factors

considered above. It may therefore be used to determine whether, during

periods of volatility, changes in the economic situation usually

attributed simply to "productivity" are instead attributable to other

direct and indirect impacts.

        The model I use to construct and estimate these measures is from

Morrison (1983b). Briefly, this model assumes capital is quasi—fixed

and that costs of adjustment occur for net capital formation. An
                                  —21—




alternative specification compared here also includes nonproduction

workers (N) as a quasi—fixed factor; labor is "hoarded" in the sense

that there are costs of adjustment on net investment in the "stock" of

nonproduction workers. The firm is assumed to produce output using

capital and three variable inputs, labor (L) (or production workers (P)

for the alternative specification), energy (E), and nonenergy inter-

mediate materials (M). The firm's optimization process involves

maximizing at each time t the present value of the future stream of

profits given expected paths of the exogenous variables——output demand

and input prices-—and adjustment cost relations. This is accomplished

sequentially (as in Morrison (1983a)) by minimizing variable costs for

any output and quasi-fixed input levels, setting output price according

to a short run condition of equality between marginal revenues and costs

to determine the output level, and finally by choosing an optimal

investment plan, conditional on the quasi-fixed input stocks at time t.

     The firm's decisions are represented, given an explicit form for the

variable cost function G, by a system of demand equations for its

variable inputs, an output price equation, and investment equations

analogous to (13) for the quasi—fixed inputs incorporating nonstatic

expectations. Parameter estimation by maximum likelihood procedures

results in a full specification of short and long run elasticities.

Specifically, the model permits calculation of CU, E1

                                                                    C
and ECy•
     In the first column of Table 1A, I report the conventionally

measured index of the state of technology At. Productivity indices

calculated from the adjusted productivity growth estimates are presented
                                  —22—




in the next four columns for the one quasi-fixed input model as

               and     .   Analogous productivity measures for the
A,', A1'' ,
alternative two quasi-fixed input model, recognizing the short run

fixity of both K and N, are presented in Table 13.

     Although these conventional year—by—year measures provide some

indication of the post-1973 productivity slowdown, the impacts of the

adjustments are not immediately evident. I therefore suxnmarize the

information contained in Tables 1A and lB using average annual produc-

tivity growth rates over selected time periods; these are presented in

Table 2. This temporal breakdown is based on the common divisions into

time periods of pre—1965, 1965 to 1973, and post—1973.

     The first point to note from Table 2 is that the measures calculated

at the two levels of labor aggregation differ slightly. Over the entire

time period 1949-1979, the traditionally measured average annual multi-

factor productivity increase measured using four inputs, K, L, E, and

M, was .83% per year, whereas once L is disaggregated into N and P

productivity growth over this period appears one tenth larger--. 90%/year.

The post-1965 slowdown also appears more noticeable when both nonpro-

duction and production workers are considered separately than when they

are aggregated. This difference is largest precisely when the greatest

compositional changes occurred within L; such changes are obscured by

aggregation.

     Overall, from either model, a substantial amount of productivity

decline is evident since 1949—1965. A great deal of the productivity

growth change, however, appears to have taken place before 1973, as was

also noted by Norsworthy et al. (1979). In particular, although from

1949-1965 the average annual growth rate (AAGR) was 1.1% to 1.3%,

between 1965 and 1973 it dropped to .65% to .70%. From Tables 1A and 1B,

this appears to be a result of two significant declines in productivity,

one in 1966-1967 and another in 1970. Thus the AAGR over the sub-

period from 1965-1970 was negative—-approximately -.1% to —.2%. This

period could be a strong contender for the title of "productivity

growth slowdown."

     Compared to the 1965-1973 period, post 1973 the AAGR dropped

further, to approximately .41 to .44%--only about 35% of the productivity

growth rate observed in 1949—1965. This reflects, of course, the

celebrated recent "productivity growth slowdown." This productivity growth

slowdown is, however, driven by the productivity decreases of only a

couple of years. If, for example, a researcher in 1977 were considering

the productivity decline from 1973 it would appear much more imposing;

the 1973-1976 period exhibited a slight productivity decrease of

approximately -.01% per year. From 1976 on the AAGR in productivity

began to attenuate this evidence of stagnation; total factor productivity

between 1976 and 1979 again began to grow at about .7% to .9% per year,

close to that occurring between 1949 and 1965.

     Hence there appear to be two periods when large downward shifts in

productivity growth occurred, namely, the late 1960's and the few years

subsequent to 1973. Together these result in a rather substantial overall

effect on 1965-1979 productivity growth as compared to the previous

fifteen years, but they do not present conclusive evidence of a unique

sudden slacking off of productivity growth post-1973 in U.S. manufacturing.

     These trends in observed productivity growth are attenuted somewhat
                                  —27—




by the impact of the adjustments outlined above. The first adjustment to

the productivity measure is that for subequilibriuxn. The empirical

significance of this adjusted productivity measure, reported as             in

Table 1 and in terms of AAGR as C'
                                   ct
                                         in   Table 2, differs across models.

With the adjustment, in the one quasi-fixed input model the residual

decreases in all sub-periods, but by the largest proportion inthe

earlier years; part of the relatively large growth in productivity

observed in earlier periods appears to have been due to the effects

of subequilibrium. For the two quasi-fixed input model productivity

growth appears larger for both later time periods for            than for

Ati particularly for the 1973—1979 time period. This constitutes evidence

on the role of labor hoarding as well as fixity of capital in accounting for

subequilibrium effects.

     The above results reveal a modest decrease in the dispersion of

productivity measures over time with the subequilibriuxn adjustment. In

addition, the late l960s still appears as a period of poor productivity

performance and the two years after 1973 seem ever more catastrophic as

a result of large unexpected shocks, particularly for the two quasi-

fixed input model.

     The second adaptation of the productivity growth measure to

is more dramatic. The adjustment for nonstatic expectations in the one

quasi-fixed input model results in a larger productivity residual for all

time periods--even larger than the unadjusted          measure for the two

later time periods. This suggests a tendency for anticipatory investment

to have a depressing effect on traditional productivity growth measures.

This same tendency is evident for the two quasi-fixed input model.

     The distincition between subequilibrium adjustment to             and the

further nonstatic expectations adjustment to C'        is   that the former
                                 —28—




reveals the impact of unexpected subequilibrium which is not properly

accoxnmodated-—subequilibrium occurs in terms of present as well as

current valued variables--whereas the latter documents the effect of

anticipated changes. This implies that although when the firm is

optimistic productivity measures adjusted for nonstatic expectations

likely improve, at times when the firm's expectations are incorrect

      may fall. To illustrate the implications of this, reconsider the

indices in Tables 1A and lB. Although C' between 1973 and 1976

appears uniformly better than           ,   events in 1974 still had very
depressing effects as firms attempted to adjust to a subequilibrium

resulting from unanticipated shocks in 1973.

      The revision to account for total adjustment costs of C'' to
                                                            ct

C''    simply   augments, as expected, the trends found for the expectations

adjustment. Specifically, when net investment corresponding to current

exogenous variables is also purged, so that input use only for produced

output and not investment is attributed to the productivity measure,

productivity appears more robust over the entire period. In total, over

the 1949-1979 period the combined effect of these revisions to              in

the two quasi-fixed input model indicates that productivity growth was

approximately .94% per annum in contrast to the .90% corresponding to

contemporaneous observations. This tendency is even more pronounced

for the final sub-period. The unadjusted measure indicates .28% AAGR

over the 1973-1979 period, whereas with the three adaptations the AAGR

becomes .335%, about a 20% increase. Results for the one quasi-fixed

input model are similar.

obtained by considering the alternative CU indicators directly. These

indices are presented in Table 3 as CU , CU , and               CU     respec-

indices is that the CU

                           and CU             indicators reach values above
                                    net
unity less often than the CU        measure. As discussed further in
                            pv
Morrison (1984), this is a priori appealing; CU indicators including

nonstatic expectations tend to fall short of unity any time the firm

is investing additionally in anticipation of, for example, output

increases not justified on the basis of current economic conditions.

     Comparison of the overall patterns of the CU indices yields

several other interesting implications. Consider the "preferred" two

quasi-fixed input model CU measures. In the first few years and in

the early l960s CU

                     > 1 > CU

a shortage of capacity in terms of present value investment, even

though current observation indicates excess capacity. In 1952 to 1953,

1955 to 1956 and 1963 there is a shortage of capacity in both present

and current value terms, inducing additional investment. In the late

1950s and from 1967 on both CU    and CU    tend to fall short of
                              pv        cv
unity, although CU    is typically closer to one. This indicates that

although firms were optimistic about the future their optimism justified

only cautious investment plans, since capacity was underutilized even in

terms of present value. Finally, in 1969 and 1973 pessimism appears to

have been prevalent; CU
                         pv
                              < 1 < CU
                                       cv ,    indicating   a currently observed

shortage of capacity which actually corresponds to a slight excess of

available capacity given expectations of future conditions. The numbers

for the one quasi-fixed input model are slightly different; they tend in

general to be higher, and do not capture such phenomena as the pessimism

of 1969 and 1973.

     The last productivity adjustment to consider is that for NCRTS. The

AAGR for      '
                    is   the final column of Table 2 indicate that although

overall productivity growth estimates 1949—1979 are substantial with

effects of scale economies purged, this is not true for 1973—1979. In

fact for the two quasi-fixed input case the reverse is true for 1973-1979.

The difference in growth rates for both models between the earlier and

later years is diminished further with this adaptation.

     Recall that this scale adjustment recognizes the difference between

decreasing costs due to (i) pure technical progress and (ii) scale

economies. Over the 1949-1973 time period on average both of these

effects were evident. As a result, removing the scale effect imputes a

lower growth rate to technical progress. However, when output grows at a

lower or negative rate, the reverse can occur, i.e., lower productivity

growth is incorrectly attributed to reductions in the growth rate of

technical progress. During the sluggish growth years of 1973-1979 this

appears to have occurred; productivity change adjusted for this effect

increases to over 40% of the observed productivity change 1949-1979, and

to over 60% of that observed from 1965 to 1973.

     In summary, empirical decomposition of the productivity residual to

isolate the technical progress effects independently of subequilibrium,

anticipatory behavior, and economies of scale yields important overall

conclusions. These include:        (1) the anomaly of the observed post-1973

productivity growth slowdown measured using conventional methods appears

overstated;   (ii) the primary impact generating this measured result is,
                                  —32—




in a one quasi-fixed input model, that of anticipatory expectations;

however, if the model incorporates two quasi-fixed inputs then the

primary cause is that of subequilibrium, and (iii) the productivity

growth slowdown appears to have begun earlier than 1973, perhaps as

early as 1965.

     This empirical exercise indicates that distinct effects of various

components of observed productivity growth can be identified using the

procedures developed in this paper, and illustrates the richness of the

decomposition framework. Significantly, the adjustments do not

necessarily decrease the productivity residual or "measure of our

ignorance." In fact, overall they increase the residual in all periods

discussed. Nonetheless, they do indicate that much of the relative

productivity growth slowdown can be attributed to a combination of

Iv.    CONCLUDING REMARKS

       In    these concluding remarks I briefly summarize how different

existing approaches to subequilibrium productivity measurement can be

viewed as special cases of the model developed here.

       In many previous studies researchers have attempted to purge

cyclical effects from their productivity calculations by comparing only

"peak" years in the cycle. The justification offered for such a

this level are not a factor affecting productivity growth. The theo-

retical model outlined in this paper suggests that this approach is

valid provided measured CU is the same in each of these peak years.

       The framework presented here also reveals that CU, calculated

appropriately, involves a total output or total cost measure and thus

adjusts all input shares in the productivity calculation rather than

only one input, say capital. However, if utilization only of capital is

varying, this approach justifies the use of a capital utilization

measure to adjust the capital share in productivity calculations, as long

as the shares are re-scaled to equal unity.. For example, the method

advocated by Berndt and Fuss (1981) is a special case of the capacity

utilization approach presented here, where the shadow value of capital——

represented by Tobin's q——is interpreted as a measure of the utilization

of capital compared to its long run equilibrium. Similarly, Hulten

(1983) presents a method of adjusting productivity measures for

capital utilization by recognizing shifts in cost curves from the

short run revaluation of capital.

      More generally, the cost CU measure with one quasi-fixed input not
                                   —34—




only includes all the information contained in Tobin's q--for both

indicators depend on a comparison between Zk and       --but also is

directly dual to the quantity side. The primal output CU measure,

incorporating the effects of utilization of the quasi-fixed input(s)

on output, also depends on the deviation between      and     .    The

shadow revaluation concept and the more conventional quantity—based

capacity utilization adjustment can thus be recognized and reconciled

as "two sides of the same coin."

     In addition, with only one quasi-fixed input, capital, cost or

output Cu measures are a function only of capital utilization. In the

more general case with multiple quasi—fixed inputs, the economic

derivation of CU measures provides a justification for optimally

weighting the utilization of the individual quasi—fixed inputs into an

overall CU subequilibrium measure, and therefore contains more

information than Tobin's q.

     The incorporation of nonstatic expectations into the models is

also important. The existence of nonstatic expectations implies that

if firms expect increases in output demand or input prices that will

increase present value costs of investing in the future relative to the

present, current anticipatory investment will be carried out which will

appear excessively high given current levels of capacity. This will

result in lower levels of CU and lower levels of productivity for

variable inputs than if the firm were myopic.

     Empirically this framework provides a useful structure within which

to assess the productivity residual by identifying independently the

effects that should not be attributed solely to technical progress.

Although this study does not provide an explanation of the residual in the
                                    —35—




sense that the residual after the adjustments is larger than before, it

does provide important insights. Analysis of the productivity residual

suggests, for example, that even with CU adjustments the productivity

slowdown commenced at an earlier date than is often assumed. Since

dating the "productivity slowdown" and the impact of CU adjustments on

this dating is a point of contention in the literature, the framework

presented here is particularly relevant for assessing the alternative

irgiimntS -

     In   summary, the integration of the various technical and behavioral

impacts considered in the model developed here provides a systematic

framework that incorporates a number of existing approaches as special

cases. It therefore provides a useful framework within which to assess,

both theoretically and empirically, productivity growth and its inter-

relation with cyclical indicators such as Tobin's q and CU. Finally,

it is a particularly useful structure within which to pursue more

extensive empirical research on comparison of differential interna-

tional productivity trends and analysis of more micro data such as that

for electric utilities, where the interactions between productivity and

CU and the effects of fixity of different inputs are of crucial

importance.

                                                     FOOTNOTES

1    See Morrison (1984) for a related discussion of the use of this
shadow value of investment. Note that the use of the gross value of
capital ZkK = -GkK or the net value ZkK =          = GK) depends on
the relevant problem and interpretation. The net value should be used
when the dynamic optimization framework is explicitly characterized, but
in principle adjustment costs are not observed and therefore may not be
picked up in conventional measures. This provides one reason firms may
appear to be further from optimal Y than is actually the case;
Morrison (1984) shows that the gross measures more closely pick up
trends in the traditional measures. Numerically, however, for the
output and cost-CU indices the results differ very little between the
net and gross specifications.

2    See Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979) for an extensive discussion
of these types of elasticities.

3    The form of this representation for Ccy was                                 developed in Morrison
(1983c) from Lau (1978) with only one quasi-fixed                                input and no dynamic
behavior. This results in d2.nC/d9.nY = C/aY(Y/C)                                 + C/aK(dK/dY) (Y/C) =   1,
since with CRTS dR,nK/dLnY   1. Thus Ccy + Cck                                   1 with CRTS. The
generalization is consistent with Lau's analysis.

4    Although it is not as obvious, (5) represents a conventional Cct
measure even without long run equilibrium imposed. To see this rewrite
(5) as:

                                                                           JcJ x Y j

The first term on the right hand side of (5a) is the traditional
characterization of long run productivity. The latter two terms
capture the adjustment of the "augmented" quasi-fixed input stocks to the
"desired" level corresponding to exogenous variables including the new
output level and includes the costs of this adjustment represented by
3j/kj . Because of CRTS it must be the case both that j/x-Y/Y = d2.n
x—dn Y=O and                                                    Y0 for all j.
5    For further discussion of net versus gross shadow values and their
empirical content, see Morrison (1984).

6    The ideas that this measure is based on are developed further in
Morrison (l983d) for one quasi-fixed input, capital (K).

7      See Morrison (l983c).

8    The basis for this assertion stems from Morrison (1983b) and
Nickell (1978), where it is shown that the path of capital, or the
investment plan given a current capital stock, can be represented by a
flexible accelerator adjustment path toward the current "target" capital
stock defined in terms of current exogenous variables plus a term
capturing the effect of all future exogenous variable changes.

9       J is defined within the framework of Morrison (1984) as:

                        (s-t)
(13a)
           AG                   ((G+rG) (K_K)+G*is+Gky5)dS

where A is a diagonal adjustment matrix dependent on r and the
    mcrt-€p   rf f-h r,,h1         fnn      r r \Jrih1 inriit-      ir,
turn depend on current variables including the current levels of invest—
xnent in quasi-fixed factors.

10   The data on prices and quantities of output, capital, nonproduction
and production labor, energy and intermediate material inputs for U.S.
Manufacturing 1947-1981 were graciously provided by Ernst R. Berndt and
David 0. Wood. For a discussion of these data, which were constructed
similarly to those reported in Berndt and Wood (1975), see Berndt and
Wood (1984).

11   Note that any model which allows these elasticities to be calculated
may be used as the basis for empirical application of this decomposition
procedure. For example, any econometric model based on a short run or
"restricted" cost function allowing for NCRTS can be used to determine
the impact of subequilibrium and NCRTS on productivity. Distinguishing
the effects of adjustment costs and nonstatic expectations, however,
requires a full dynamic model and an explicit expectations process
respectively.
