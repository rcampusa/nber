We estimate the impacts of the Climate Change Levy (CCL) on manufacturing plants using panel
data from the UK production census. Our identification strategy builds on the comparison of
outcomes between plants subject to the CCL and plants that were granted an 80% discount on the
levy after joining a Climate Change Agreement (CCA). Exploiting exogenous variation in eligibility
for CCA participation, we find that the CCL had a strong negative impact on energy intensity and
electricity use. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the tax had no detrimental effects on economic
performance and on plant exit.

1      Introduction

The rise of climate policy on government agendas around the world has stirred a renewed interest
in the optimal design of large-scale regulation of environmental externalities. Climate change –
the “ultimate commons problem” (Stavins, 2011) – is caused by anthropogenic emissions of green-
house gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and is expected to have severe ecological and
economic consequences (IPCC, 2007). Mitigating climate change will require substantial abate-
ment of GHG emissions from all core economic sectors (Pacala and Socolow, 2004). The choice
of appropriate policy instruments for each of these sectors is essential for minimizing the overall
economic costs of mitigation with given technologies (static efficiency), and for stimulating tech-
nological innovations that will further reduce mitigation costs in the future (dynamic efficiency).
The relative performance of two such instruments to curb CO2 emissions from the manufacturing
sector is the focus of this paper.
    Manufacturing is a major contributor to GHG emissions around the world.1 Since most man-
ufactured goods are tradable, there is a risk that regulated firms will lose international competi-
tiveness, shed part of their labor force or even exit. These concerns have been fueling vehement
opposition towards regulation in this sector and left their mark on the design of the policies im-
plemented so far. Command-and-control policies have long been the predominant form of envi-
ronmental regulation in the manufacturing sector, and their impacts have been studied extensively
    1 Together   with primary industry, the manufacturing sector accounts for almost 40% of GHG emissions worldwide
(IEA, 2010).

in the context of air pollution.2 On theoretical grounds, economists have favored market-based
instruments such as taxes and tradable permit schemes because they are more efficient in both the
static and dynamic senses (e.g. Montgomery, 1972; Tietenberg, 1990; Milliman and Prince, 1989).
However, empirical evidence on the impacts of market-based environmental regulation on man-
ufacturing is scarce, especially when it comes to carbon emissions.3 For example, the European
Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the largest cap-and-trade system for carbon emis-
sions worldwide, is overdue for a microeconometric evaluation. While carbon taxes have been
implemented in various EU countries, their rigorous evaluation has proven difficult, be it for lack
of suitable microdata or of a compelling identification strategy.4
    This paper fills the void by analyzing the Climate Change Levy (CCL) package – the single
most important climate change policy that the UK government has unilaterally imposed on the
business sector so far. The package consists of an energy tax, the CCL, which added 15% to the
energy bill of a typical UK business when it was introduced in 2001 (NAO, 2007). The government
seeks to lighten the tax burden on energy intensive firms by offering an 80% discount on the tax
rate to businesses that join a Climate Change Agreement (CCA) which obliges them to adopt
a specific target for energy consumption or carbon emissions. These firms may also participate
in emissions trading on the UK carbon market. Together, the CCL and CCAs were expected to
contribute the lion’s share of total carbon savings from the business sector under the UK Climate
Change Programme between 2000 and 2010 (HM Government, 2006).
    Given its scope and institutional context, the CCL package provides a unique opportunity to
study the impacts of carbon pricing in an industrialized economy. We use longitudinal data on
manufacturing plants to estimate the impact of the CCL on energy use and economic performance.
Our strategy to identify the tax effect builds on the comparison of outcomes between fully-taxed
   2 See, for example, the sizable empirical literature on the effects of command-and-control regulation of air pollution

on emissions (Henderson, 1996; Greenstone, 2004), industrial activity (Becker and Henderson, 2000; Greenstone,
2002), plant births and deaths (Henderson, 1996; Levinson, 1996; List et al., 2003), plant-level productivity (e.g.
Berman and Bui, 2001; Gray and Shadbegian, 2003), foreign direct investment (Hanna, 2010) and market structure
(Ryan, 2010).
   3 One reason for this is that most existing cap-and-trade programs do not cover manufacturing emissions in signifi-

cant ways. The RECLAIM program for NOX emissions in California is an exception (Fowlie et al., 2011).

CCL plants and CCA plants. This raises two issues. First, eligibility is not randomly assigned
and eligible plants can decide voluntarily if they want to participate in a CCA. We thus expect
a fair amount of self selection into CCAs to be present, which might cause bias in simple least-
squares or fixed-effects estimates. To address this problem, we adopt an instrumental variable
framework that exploits exogenous variation in the initial CCA eligibility rules. Specifically, since
eligibility for the discount was tied to whether or not a facility emitted any pollutants subject to
pre-existing environmental regulation – the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) Act – we can
use this information to instrument for the tax rate. The second issue is that firms in the control
group were not only entitled to a tax discount, but they also faced a reduction target for energy
consumption or carbon emissions. To the extent that this target places a binding constraint on the
plant’s production choices, we recover a lower bound on the full price effect of the tax differential
between the two groups of plants.
   We find robust evidence that the CCL had a strong negative impact on energy intensity, par-
ticularly at larger and more energy intensive plants. An analysis of fuel choices at the plant level
reveals that this effect is mainly driven by a reduction in electricity use and translates into a neg-
ative impact on CO2 emissions. In contrast, we do not find any statistically significant impacts of
the tax on employment, gross output or total factor productivity (TFP). This means that worries
about adverse effects of the CCL on economic performance of surviving plants are unsubstantiated.
Looking at extensive-margin adjustment, we find no evidence that the CCL accelerated plant exit.
We conclude that, had the CCL been implemented at full rate for all businesses, further cuts in
energy use and carbon emissions could have been achieved without jeopardizing competitiveness.
   Our study extends a small number of previous assessments of the CCL which have struggled
with two main problems. First, it has proven difficult to establish generally accepted baselines
against which to measure progress of firms in CCAs towards their targets. Second, aggregate
energy data used in previous analyses are ill-suited to identify the causal impact of the CCL sep-
arately from that of unrelated changes in the economic environment, including other policies that
were introduced concurrently under the UK Climate Change Programme. To circumvent these


                                                  4
problems, we compile comprehensive microdata from restricted-access and other sources, and
adopt a research design that identifies the causal impact of the CCL relative to that of the CCA
plus emissions trading. More generally, our study provides much-needed empirical evidence on
the impacts of large-scale regulation aimed at pricing pollution. It does so in the context of climate
change – an area where regulatory stringency is bound to increase in the near future – and with
a focus on manufacturing, the principal engine of growth in the emerging economies and still a
cornerstone of employment in post-industrial economies.
     The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the CCL package
in detail and reviews previous research on the tax. Section 3 describes the research design and
econometric framework. Section 4 describes the data sources and summarizes the dataset used for
the analysis. Section 5 reports the main results and presents several robustness checks. Section 6
examines heterogeneous impacts, aggregate effects and estimates the impact of the CCL on exit.
Section 7 concludes.



2          Background

2.1         The Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreements

Since the 1990s the UK has adopted a series of increasingly ambitious targets for climate policy. In
addition to a 12.5% reduction of GHG emissions from 1990 levels to be achieved under the Kyoto
Protocol, the Blair administration promised to reduce CO2 emissions by 19% until 2010 and by
60% until 2050. With the passing into law of the Climate Change Bill in November 2008, the
commitment to reduce GHG emissions in the UK by at least 80% until 2050 has become legally
binding.5 The CCL and CCAs constitute the single-most important policy package that the UK
has implemented unilaterally in order to achieve these goals.6 By official estimates, combined
carbon savings from the CCL and CCAs would amount to 6.6 megatonnes of carbon (MtC) in
    5 It   is permissible, however, that part of this reduction may be achieved through action abroad.
    6 Only     the second phase of the EU ETS is expected to bring larger carbon savings.

2010, making it the top contributor towards a total reduction of 20.8 MtC projected by the UK
Climate Change Programme 2006 (HM Government, 2006).
    The CCL is a per unit tax payable at the time of supply to industrial and commercial users of
energy. It was first announced in March 1999 and came into effect in April 2001. Taxed fuels
include coal, gas, electricity, and non-transport liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). For each fuel type
subject to the CCL, Table 1 displays the tax rates per kilowatt hour (kWh), the average energy
price paid by manufacturing plants in 2001 and the implicit carbon tax. Energy tax rates vary
substantially across fuel types, ranging from 6.1% on coal to 16.5% on natural gas.7
    While the tax establishes a meaningful price incentive for energy conservation overall, it is
immediately seen that carbon contained in gas and electricity is taxed at almost twice the rate as
carbon contained in coal.8 Other fuel types were tax-exempt precisely because of their low carbon
content, such as electricity generated from renewable sources and from combined heat and power.
Hence, rather than a pure carbon tax the CCL is a tax on energy with non-uniform rates, shaped by
a mixed bag of fiscal and regulatory goals.
    Revenue from the CCL is, to a large extent, recycled back into industry in the form of a 0.3%
reduction of the employers’ share of National Insurance Contributions (NIC). A small part of the
   7 Tax  rates were constant from 2001 until 2006 and adjusted for inflation only in April 2007.
   8 David   Pearce (2006) attributed this perverse effect to historical ties between the governing Labour Party and the
coal industry, which had suffered from the “dash for gas” over the 1990s and successfully lobbied for a lower tax
rate on coal. Mineral oil was exempt from the tax because it was already covered by the rather unpopular ‘Fuel Duty
Escalator’, a policy of automatic increases in the taxes on diesel and gasoline. Residential energy use was not taxed
for fear of a possible regressive effect (Pearce, 2006).

revenues are diverted to the Carbon Trust, an institution set up by the government to foster research
and development into energy efficiency schemes and renewable energy resources.
    Similar to other European governments that had introduced energy taxes during the 1990s,
the UK government set up a scheme of negotiated agreements, the CCAs, in order to mitigate
possible adverse effects of the CCL on the competitiveness of energy intensive industries. By
participating in a CCA, facilities in certain energy intensive sectors can reduce their tax liability
by 80% provided that they adopt a binding target on their energy use or carbon emissions.
    Targets were negotiated at two levels. In an ‘umbrella agreement’, the sector association and the
government – represented by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)9
– agreed upon a sector-wide target for energy use or carbon emissions in 2010 and on interim
targets for each two-year ‘milestone period’ (i.e. 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008). At a lower level,
‘underlying agreements’ stipulate a specific reduction to be achieved by a ‘target unit’, i.e. a
facility or group of facilities in a sector with an umbrella agreement. Targets were defined either
in absolute terms or relative to output. At the end of each milestone period, the sector associations
reported to DEFRA whether the sector-wide target had been met. Only if a sector-wide target had
been missed did DEFRA verify compliance at the target unit level. A facility that was found in
non-compliance was not re-certified for the reduced rate in the following milestone period. If the
facility missed the 2010 target it faced the threat to repay all rebates on the levy it had accumulated
in previous periods.
    DEFRA originally negotiated 44 umbrella agreements with different industrial sectors, includ-
ing the ten most energy intensive ones (aluminium, cement, ceramics, chemicals, food and drink,
foundries, glass, non-ferrous metals, paper, and steel). Sector definitions used in the umbrella
agreements rarely coincide with common economic classification systems. While most sector asso-
ciations have chosen relative targets for energy, absolute targets were negotiated for the aerospace,
steel, supermarkets and wall coverings sectors. Carbon targets were negotiated for the aluminium
and packaging (including metal packaging) sectors.
   9 Since   2008 CCAs are administered by the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).



                                                        7
   While the primary objective of both the CCL and the CCAs is to enhance the efficiency of en-
ergy use in the business sector, the two instruments represent fundamentally different approaches.
The levy provides a price signal at roughly 15% of energy prices faced by the typical business
in 2001 (NAO, 2007). If energy demand is price sensitive, the increased relative price of energy
should lead to improvements in energy efficiency and – in the absence of a strong rebound effect
or exogenous increases in economic activity – to a reduction in energy use. In terms of CO2 emis-
sions, even the negative effect of an absolute reduction in energy use could be offset by a shift
towards more carbon-intensive fuels.
   In contrast, the CCA combines a very diluted price signal (approximately 3% of energy prices
faced by the typical business) with quantity regulation, mostly in the form of efficiency targets.
This target affects the plant only if it places a binding constraint on the dynamic trajectory of
energy use during the remaining economic lifetime of the plant. If this is not the case, the plant
faces weaker incentives for energy conservation than it would under the full tax rate. Since most
targets are specified in terms of energy units rather than carbon emissions, there is no guarantee
that even a stringent energy target leads to reductions in GHG emissions.


2.2   How stringent are the targets negotiated in the CCAs?

In theory, a government with perfect information about the firm’s abatement cost can choose a
tax discount and reduction targets so as to induce at least as much abatement as under the full
tax rate (Smith and Swierzbinski, 2007). In reality, however, the government is unlikely to have
perfect information about firm-specific abatement cost, especially if firms worry that sharing this
information with the government weakens their bargaining position in the target negotiations. What
is more, the government is unlikely to drive a hard bargain because of concerns about adverse
effects on competitiveness and exacerbating distortions in marginal abatement cost (de Muizon
and Glachant, 2003; Smith and Swierzbinski, 2007).
   In fact, a closer inspection of the negotiation, monitoring and enforcement of CCA targets sug-
gests that, as a rule, they were not placing any binding constraints on firm behavior. Officially,


                                                8
sector targets were set in such a way that they would close 60% of the average gap in energy effi-
ciency between a “business as usual” (BAU) and an “all cost effective” scenario. The latter scenario
assumed that firms implemented all efficiency enhancing measures that were cost effective without
placing restrictions on the availability of management time and capital.10 For the BAU scenario,
the government assumed that average energy efficiency in energy intensive sectors improved by
4.8% between 2000 and 2010. This number was at the low end of available estimates. For exam-
ple, the European Commission estimated a 9.5% improvement for all UK industry during the same
period (DG Transport and Energy, 1999), and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI, 2000)
expected an improvement of 11.5%.11 Since the average 11% reduction target to be achieved in
sectors with a CCA target falls well into this range of BAU estimates, some observers were con-
cerned that the government “double counted” carbon savings from the CCA scheme (ACE, 2005).
    The fact that CCA sectors massively overcomplied with their 2010 targets did not help to
dissipate such concerns. Combined annual carbon savings in all CCA sectors were substantially
larger than the 2010 target throughout the first three milestone periods. For the first milestone
period, CCA sectors reported savings of 4.5 MtC – almost twice the target amount of 2.5 MtC to
be achieved by 2010. Most of this (2.6 MtC) was due to a dramatic decline in steel production.
But even without steel and three other sectors that adopted absolute targets there was substantial
overcompliance, with estimated carbon savings of 3 MtC (3.9 MtC and 4.3 MtC, respectively, in
subsequent milestone periods; see NAO, 2007).
    Parallel to overcompliance at the sector level, a consistently high proportion of target units
were re-certified for the reduced tax rate. This proportion rose from 88% in the first period to
98% and 99% in the second and third target periods, respectively (AEAT, 2004; 2005; 2007).
Most CCA participants complied with their targets, and those who did not could meet their targets
by buying emission allowances on the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), a market for
carbon permits that was operational between 2002 and 2006. Due to significant oversupply of
  10 These measures included operational changes, low-cost retro-fit measures, major plant investments, and combined

heat and power generation (CHP)(AEAT, 2001).
  11 This accounts for the effect of the CCL alone without CCAs.




                                                         9
carbon credits, allowance prices remained below the implicit carbon tax rates given in Table 1.12
In fact, the lower bound on compliance cost is zero because a considerable amount of facilities
that missed their target were re-certified for subsequent milestone periods thanks to the sector as a
whole meeting its target. This was true, for example, of approximately 250 non-compliant target
units when the 2004 milestone was reached (NAO, 2007).
    In addition, a large degree of flexibility was built into the target negotiations both prior and
subsequent to the compliance review. Target units were allowed to call upon several ‘risk man-
agement tools’ that made it easier to meet their targets. Ex-post adjustments to targets could be
made to reflect a more energy intensive product mix, declining output (if minimum energy use was
spread over fewer units), or ‘relevant constraints’ arising from other types of regulation. In some
sectors, performance was measured against a ‘tolerance band’ in lieu of a fixed target. These risk
management tools had to be approved by the government, and some of them were discontinued in
later periods (NAO, 2007).
    Ex-ante flexibility was ensured by permitting each sector to choose its own baseline year. More
than two thirds of all sectors chose baseline years of 1999 or earlier, in some cases going as far back
as 1990 (NAO, 2007). This means that carbon savings that had occurred before the policy package
was implemented or even announced could be counted towards the target achievement. In some
instances, fast growing companies that belonged to a sector with an absolute target successfully
bargained for a relative target (and vice versa) as this made it easier to achieve compliance.
    In sum, there is ample evidence that negotiated CCA targets are unlikely to have placed binding
constraints on energy use by CCA companies.
  12 Smith  and Swierzbinski (2007) present data showing that the allowance price fluctuated between £7 and £15 per
ton of carbon (£2 and £4 per ton of CO2 equivalent) for most of the period. Activity on the UK allowance market
increased in March 2003 and March 2005 when firms participating in CCAs bought allowances to meet their interim
targets. Yet the demand for permits was not large enough to put upward pressure on the price.

2.3     Previous evaluations of the CCL package

Several evaluations of the CCL package were conducted at different stages of its implementation.
In the 2000 Regulatory Impact Assessment, the government projected that the CCL instrument
alone would achieve carbon savings of at least 2 MtC in 2010 against BAU projections (HMCE,
2000). This estimate was based on a model of business energy use maintained by the Depart-
ment of Trade and Industry (DTI).13 An official interim evaluation was commissioned at the end
of the second commitment period. The study’s main finding is a reduction in energy demand by
the service and public sectors (which excludes manufacturing) following the announcement of the
CCL package in March 1999 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2005). The authors identify this “an-
nouncement effect” as a structural break in an error correction model of quarterly energy demand.
They argue that the effect is permanent rather than transitory (see Agnolucci et al., 2004, for more
details).
    Other studies have used a macroeconometric model of the UK economy (MDM-E3) to forecast
business energy use under different versions of the CCL package. In line with the evidence pre-
sented in the previous subsection, this model predicts “that the energy (and therefore carbon) saving
and energy-efficiency targets would have been met without the CCAs” (Cambridge Econometrics,
2005, p. 7).14 Moreover, model simulations of the CCL package give rise to much smaller carbon
savings than those AEAT (2004) computed for the first milestone period. Ekins and Etheridge
(2006) conclude from this that “the CCL package as implemented [...] achieved a greater car-
bon reduction than a no-rebate CCL would have done by itself” (p.2079). They attribute excess
carbon savings to the possibility that managers became aware of more cost-effective efficiency
enhancement projects as they started to benchmark their energy use. Barker et al. (2007) simulate
the impact of the CCAs on macroeconomic outcome variables such as output, employment and
industrial energy demand. In their exercise, a large effect of the CCAs on sectoral energy demand
  13 Totalcarbon emissions from the business sector in 2000 were estimated at 60.3 MtC (NAO, 2007).
  14 With the exception of the “other industry” sector, which comprises all manufacturing other than basic metals,
mineral products and chemicals, the authors find that the targets would have been met at the reduced rate or even
without any CCL at all.

– averaging a 9.1% reduction in sectoral energy use by 2010 – is built into the model rather than
estimated.
    Overall, these assessments of the CCL package highlight two fundamental difficulties in pol-
icy evaluation, namely (i) to determine a valid baseline against which to measure the impact of a
policy and (ii) to attribute any measured impact to this policy in a causal fashion. Since the stud-
ies use simulated trajectories of energy use as a baseline against which to measure the impact of
the CCL package, their results critically depend on those counterfactual baselines. By definition,
counterfactual scenarios are not observable, hence the evaluation results are subject to a large de-
gree of uncertainty. When simulations are done using a macroeconometric model, this uncertainty
derives not only from compounded error in the estimation of the underlying parameters but also
from changes in the economic environment and from structural changes in the parameters (Lucas
critique).
    Furthermore, time series data aggregated at the sector level can hardly provide conclusive ev-
idence in terms of discerning the effects of the policy from other concurrent events in a dynam-
ically changing economic and political environment. When the CCL package was introduced,
energy markets in the UK had been undergoing important changes that entailed significant and
prolonged adjustments to prices, notably declining electricity prices and increasing prices of gas
and coal. The levy interacted with a number of pre-existing other taxes in the business sector, such
as National Insurance Contributions and the Fuel Duty Escalator. Not least, with the Enhanced
Capital Allowance and Carbon Trust energy audits, other energy efficiency enhancing measures
were introduced simultaneously.
    Ours is the first evaluation of the Climate Change Levy package to use longitudinal business
microdata. Our approach addresses the baseline problem by comparing changes in actual firm
behavior under two types of policy regimes, thus purging the effect of aggregate shocks. Moreover,
we identify the causal effect of the tax by exploiting exogenous variation in the eligibility rules for
the tax rebate. The next section explains our research design in detail.

3     Research design

We seek to estimate the effect of the CCL by comparing plants that pay the full tax rate with plants
that pay just 20% of the tax by virtue of being in a CCA. We consider the estimation equation


                                         yit = αTit + xit0 β + ξ t + ηi + εit                                       (1)


where yit is an outcome variable (for expositional purposes, think of energy use), Tit is the treatment
dummy indicating that a plant pays the full rate of the tax, xit is a vector of exogenous covariates
(including a constant), ξt and ηi are unobserved year and plant effects, respectively, and εit is a
random disturbance term. Three fundamental issues need to be addressed. First, while the CCA
plants in the control group receive a tax discount they are also subject to an energy consumption or
efficiency target which might affect their choices. Second, participation in a CCA is voluntary but
not every plant is eligible. This potentially creates a selection endogeneity in the control group.
Finally, the tax might have heterogeneous impacts among the group of treated plants.
    Consistent estimation of equation (1) recovers the full effect of the CCL if – as previous re-
search has suggested – CCA targets did not impose binding constraints on firm behavior. If the
converse is true, the estimated α falls short of the true price effect as control plants choose lower-
than-optimal levels of energy so as to comply with their CCA target. Hence, the estimated param-
eter α can be regarded as a conservative estimate of the impact of the CCL. Figure 1 illustrates this
point.15
    In order to estimate α consistently, one needs to address the issue of non-random selection of
plants into the control group. Section 4.2 below presents ample evidence of selection on observ-
ables, as CCA plants are, on average, older, larger and more energy intensive. Clearly, plants using
large amounts of energy receive a larger absolute discount on their CCL liability which gives them
a stronger incentive to join a CCA. In turn, as there are fixed costs of participating in a CCA, plants
   15 The stringency of CCA targets – though relevant for the interpretation of the estimated effect as a lower bound on

the full tax effect – does not affect the consistency of the estimation procedure. For example, if the targets were more
stringent than the full-rate tax then our method would lead to a negative coefficient on CCA participation. This would
still be a lower bound on the tax effect, albeit not a meaningful one.

Notes: The plant’s optimal energy consumption in the absence of policies is at point A. Given a tax τ, the optimal
consumption drops to point C. If the target set by a Climate Change Agreement (CCA) is at an intermediate point such
as B, comparing CCA and non CCA plants provides a meaningful lower bound for the impact of the tax. On the other
hand, if the target is at B’ we would not be able to identify the decrease in energy consumption from A to C due to the
tax. For simplicity, we have drawn the reduced tax rate to coincide with the horizontal axis.


with low levels of energy use may find it more profitable not to join.16 This is illustrated in Fig-
ure 2a. Controlling for observables may not solve the selection problem if there are unobservable
differences in marginal abatement cost. As shown in Figure 2b, even for two plants that initially
use the same quantity of energy, the one with the steeper marginal abatement cost schedule has a
stronger incentive to join the CCA.
    Thanks to having panel data we can control for selection based on time-invariant unobserved
heterogeneity ηi across plants by taking first differences of equation (1). This yields17


                                          ∆yit = α∆Tit + ∆xit0 β + ∆ξ t + ∆εit .                                      (2)
  16 In personal communications, representatives of CCA sector associations pointed out multiple sources of fixed
costs to us. The main cost drivers are payments to consultants or staff for doing the necessary energy accounting and
administrative work as well as administrative fees charged by the sector associations.
  17 In our data we face the practical issue that some smaller plants are not sampled consecutively. In order not to throw

away information on those plants we define the dependent variable in equation (2) as ∆yit = yit − yit−1 for t ≤ 2000 and
∆yit ≡ yit − yi2000 for t > 2000 and transform the RHS accordingly. We also control for trends at the level of 3-digit
sector and region. See Appendix A for details.


                                                           14
    Least-squares estimation of equation (2) provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect
α if ∆εit – the short-term deviation from a plant’s idiosyncratic trend in energy consumption – is
exogenous to the decision to join a CCA. This is not true if plants take into account their future
energy consumption when deciding on CCA participation. Plants expecting to expand their energy
consumption may perceive the CCA target as a binding constraint and therefore rather not join a
CCA, whereas plants that expect a reduction in consumption will take the opportunity to reduce
their tax liability provided that the (fixed) cost of joining the CCA is not too large. As a result,
plants might select themselves into treatment and control groups based on time-varying unobserved
shocks to the outcome variable, causing bias in the estimate of α.
    To address this issue we propose an instrumental variable approach based on eligibility rules for
CCA participation. As explained above, the government intended to base eligibility upon energy
intensity, yet in practice granted eligibility to all qualifying part A activities under the PPC Act.
An indicator variable Z of whether or not a facility carries out such an activity should thus be a
good predictor of CCA participation. When ∆Z is used as an instrument for ∆T in equation (2),
the identifying assumption is that PPC part A coverage is orthogonal to shocks ∆εit that occurred
after 2000.18
    For a better grasp of the intuition behind this instrument consider the glass industry. Both the
production and the recycling of glass containers are very energy intensive processes. However,
since only the former is pollution intensive, glass container recycling was not eligible for CCA
participation until the eligibility rules were revised in 2006. Similarly, the eligibility rules for the
British Apparel and Textile Confederation were amended in 2006 to include low-pollution, high-
energy users that had previously been excluded from CCA participation. This institutional ‘glitch’
provides us with exogenous variation in the probability of treatment.
   18 The exclusion restriction also rules out the possibility that public disclosure under EPER had a direct effect on

the outcome variable. While this assumption is untestable, we are not aware of any evidence that EPER reporting
requirements affected firm behavior in the UK. In the context of the US Toxic Pollution Inventory, studies have found
no significant effects of public disclosure rules alone on pollution abatement, stock market returns or housing prices
(Bui and Mayer, 2003; Bui, 2005). Moreover, the fact that pollution emissions in 2001 were published only in 2004
precludes any direct effects operating through the demand side.

Notes: Consider two plants that are given the same absolute energy reduction target T. In sub-figure (a), marginal
revenue cost curves are identical except for the fact that plant 1 uses less energy than plant 2. Upon joining a CCA,
plant 1 saves the striped area in taxes and abatement cost whereas plant 2 saves the sum of the striped and grey areas. It
is easy to control for size, but unobservable factors such as the slope of the marginal revenue cost curve also influence
the incentives to join a CCA. In sub-figure (b) plant 1 is assumed to differ not in size but in abatement technology.
Cheaper abatement options make CCA participation less attractive for plant 1 than for plant 2.



    Since the treatment variable T is binary and the instrumental variable Z is based on eligibility,
the coefficient estimate α̂ recovers the average treatment effect on treated plants (ATT). A possible
complication arises from the existence of reporting thresholds in the database that we use to con-
struct Z. Since these thresholds were irrelevant when determining CCA eligibility, we may miss
eligible plants whose emissions remain below the EPER reporting thresholds set for each of the
50 pollutants covered under PPC part A. In Appendix B we show that this shortcoming does not
bias the coefficient unless the ATT parameter differs between plants above and below reporting
thresholds, conditional on observable characteristics.
    Econometrically, we perform a two-stage least squares estimation where the first stage is a

4       Data

The compilation of a dataset suitable for the microeconometric evaluation of the CCL required a
major effort in terms of data collection, cleaning and matching. The result is a unique dataset that
matches publicly available information on CCA participation and EPER coverage to production
data from two confidential business datasets.


4.1      Data sources

The core dataset is the Annual Respondents Database (ARD) which is maintained by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) and can be accessed by approved researchers through its Virtual Micro-
data Laboratory. The ARD is an annual production survey that covers about 10,000 plants in the
manufacturing sector.19 During the sample period, all plants with 250 employees or more (in some
    19 Hereand in the remainder of the paper a “plant” corresponds to an ARD reporting unit. This is the lowest
aggregation level for which production data is available. In 70% of all cases a reporting unit is indeed a business
unit at a single mailing address – a ‘local unit’. Larger business units are allowed to report on several local units
combined so as to reduce compliance costs. The information linking local units to reporting units is obtained from
the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR), which in addition provides information on plant births and deaths as


                                                         17
industries: 100 or more) had to report annually whereas smaller plants were included on a random
basis (Barnes and Martin, 2002). The ARD comprises a wide range of economic characteristics
of the plant, including turnover, value added, total purchases of goods and materials, employment
number and costs, inventories, and net capital expenditure. Core ARD data are available from the
1970s until 2006. Since 1999 the ARD also contains a few questions of direct relevance for this
research, such as expenditures on total energy used in the running of the business.
    Detailed information on energy use is taken from the Quarterly Fuels Inquiry (QFI), a quarterly
survey among a panel of about 1,000 manufacturing plants managed by the ONS on behalf of DTI.
The survey collects data on prices and quantities for all relevant fuel types, including medium fuel
oil, heavy fuel oil, gas oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal (graded, smalls), hard coke, gas
(firm contract, interruptible contract, tariff), and electricity. We have data for the period from 1993
to 2004. The majority (83%) of the observations in the QFI can be matched to the ARD without
difficulty because both surveys use the same underlying government business register IDBR as
their sampling frame. However, due to random sampling in the ARD we do not have ARD data for
all QFI plants.20
    We gathered information on CCA participation from both the DEFRA and HM Revenue and
Customs (HMRC) websites. Lists of facilities in the original sector agreements were downloaded
from DEFRA’s website. The agreements stipulate the certification periods and the sector targets
along with the details on the calculation of the units of energy used and carbon emissions. They
also contain a list of all facilities initially covered by the CCAs. Seven agreements lack sufficient
information on the facilities covered by the CCA and thus had to be excluded from the analysis.21
The HMRC website provides, sector by sector, the list of facilities that have joined the CCA along
with the date of publication.22 The lists are regularly updated and facilities that have resigned
from the CCA are removed. We merged the DEFRA and HMRC lists to obtain a complete list of
well as on employment, location and industry. For more details see Criscuolo et al. (2003).
   20 For more details on the QFI and its combination with ARD data see Martin (2006).
   21 The craft baking sector and the meat processing sector do not contain a list of facilities. Another five sectors lack

facility addresses, namely the NFU poultry meat production sector, the pig farming sector, the egg production sector,
the British Poultry Meat Federation farms sector, and the British poultry meat federation processing sector.
   22 The date of publication is the date from which the CCA is applicable.

facilities that pay the reduced rate of the CCL. We match this information to the ARD and QFI by
combining information on a plant’s postcode and the UK Company Register Number (CRN).
    To construct the instrumental variable, we downloaded publicly available data from the Euro-
pean Pollution Emissions Register (EPER) which covers all European facilities regulated under
the IPPC directive whose emissions exceed the reporting thresholds. The 2001 EPER file contains
reporting thresholds and pollution discharges into air and water for 50 pollutants and covers 2,397
facilities in 56 sectors of activity in the UK. We construct the instrumental variable NEPER as a
dummy variable that equals one if a facility is not on the EPER list, i.e. it does not report emissions
of any of the pollutants regulated under PPC legislation. A value of zero is assigned otherwise.
Just like the treatment variable T , this variable is zero for all plants before 2001 and does not
vary between 2001 and 2004. To match EPER facilities to plants in our dataset we use the same
algorithm that we used for matching CCA participation data.


4.2       Descriptive statistics

Table 2 summarizes the main variables from the ARD and QFI datasets for our regression sam-
ple.23 ARD variables include age, number of employees, gross output, variable cost, capital stock,
materials, energy expenditure (including CCL payments), as well as the percentage of energy ex-
penditures in gross output and in variable costs (the sum of expenditures on materials, energy and
wages). There is a substantial amount of dispersion between plants in energy intensity. For exam-
ple, the energy expenditure share in gross output of a plant at the 90th percentile is more than 12
times larger than that of a plant at the 10th percentile. The QFI variables are electricity, liquid fuels
(including oil, petrol, and LPG), gas, solid fuels such as coal, and total energy use. We report both
quantities consumed and expenditures paid for all fuel variables. Moreover, we compute the share
of gas in the consumption of both gas and electricity, as well as in total kWh consumed. We also
compute total CO2 emissions (in thousands of tonnes) on the basis of the fuel mix.
  23 Tolimit the effect of outliers we dropped 1,535 plants for which growth in the outcome variables were in the top
and bottom percentiles.

Notes: Summary statistics for the year 2000 by CCL and NEPER status. For each variable, we report the mean

unequal variance, at ≤1% (***), ≤5% (**), ≤10% (*).

    The regression sample starts in 1999 – the first year for which energy data are available in the
ARD – and covers the first two target periods, i.e. from April 2001 until December 2004. This
window of analysis avoids possible complications due to (i) an overlap with the EU ETS which
affected about 500 CCA plants from 2005 onwards, (ii) adjustments of CCA targets for the third
milestone period, and (iii) new entry of sectors in 2006 following changes in the eligibility rules.
    Table 3 displays descriptive statistics from both samples in the pre-treatment year 2000, broken
down by treatment status. The treatment variable CCL takes a value of one if a plant pays the full
tax rate and a value of zero if the plant participates in a CCA. It also reports the results of a t-test
of equality of the group means (assuming unequal variance of the two groups). It is evident that
participation in CCAs is not random: CCA plants are, on average, older, larger and more energy
intensive, and for most of these plant characteristics equality between CCL and CCA plants is
rejected at the 1% significance level. In view of the strong correlation between treatment status
and observable plant characteristics, we cannot rule out that unobservable plant characteristics
also influence selection. The difference equation (2) controls for this type of bias provided that the
outcome variable follows a common trend across treatment and control groups prior to treatment.
We thus plot the trends in the outcome variables over the sample period and calculate pre-treatment
growth rates by both treatment and eligibility status (cf. Figure C.1 and Table C.2 in the Appendix,
respectively). Based on this, we cannot reject the common trends assumption.



5     Results

5.1    Determinants of CCL status

For NEPER to be a valid instrument, it must be sufficiently correlated with CCL status conditional
on other controls. Table 4 reports the results from various regressions of CCL status on NEPER
and other plant characteristics. Each regression is run in both the ARD and the QFI sample. The
specification underlying the results in columns 1 and 5 is a simple linear regression of CCL on
NEPER in the cross section for the year 2001. The results show that the instrumental variable

                                                  22
NEPER is a strong predictor of CCL status. Columns 2 and 6 report the marginal effects from
a probit regression of the same specification. The coefficients imply that a value of NEPER=1
increases a plant’s chances of paying the tax in full by 28.3% in the ARD sample and by 44%
in the QFI sample. Results from the actual first-stage equation (3) are reported in columns 3
and 7 and show that there is a robust positive and statistically significant relationship between the
treatment variable and the instrument. Columns 4 and 8 display the results from a probit regression
of CCL status in 2001 on various plant level controls evaluated at their 2000 levels. The coefficient
estimates show that the simple correlations between CCL status and plant characteristics we found
in Table 3 persist even when we control for sectoral differences. In particular, plants that were
larger in terms of their capital, labor and energy inputs prior to treatment were more likely to
participate in a CCA. Interestingly, we obtain a positive coefficient on gross output. A plausible
explanation for this is that, conditional on size, plants that expanded their output in the year before
the CCL package was introduced were less inclined to participate in a CCA as an expansion would
make it more difficult to meet their CCA target.


5.2       Average treatment effects on CCL plants

Table 5 reports regression results for various outcome variables from the ARD (panel A) and the
QFI (panel B). Column 1 reports OLS estimates of the treatment coefficient α in equation (2) and
column 2 reports the OLS estimate of the coefficient α̃ in the reduced-form equation (5). Column
3 reports the average treatment effect on CCL plants as identified by the IV regression equation
(4).
       The first two rows in panel A of Table 5 report the results for energy intensity measured as
energy expenditures over gross output and as the share of energy expenditures in variable costs,
respectively. We find that the CCL caused plants to decrease their energy intensity relative to CCA
plants. The point estimates from the IV regressions are -0.172 for the former measure and -0.202
for the latter. The effects are both economically and statistically significant. The importance of
controlling for selection is evident from the sizable differences between the OLS and IV estimates.

In particular, OLS estimation leads to an upward bias when estimating the effect of the CCL on
the growth in energy intensity. The direction of the bias is consistent with plants choosing to
participate in a CCA if they anticipated a negative shock to their energy intensity growth, as this
made it easier to comply with the CCA target. This would create a positive correlation between the
disturbance term and the treatment variable in equation (2), and it is also consistent with the results
from the probit regression above which showed a positive association between CCA participation
and a higher output in 2001 conditional on energy and other inputs in 2000.
    In rows 3 and 4, we break down the effect on energy intensity by looking at its components.
The IV point estimates of -0.085 for energy expenditure and 0.087 for real gross output suggest
that CCL plants both reduced energy and increased gross output so as to achieve the reductions
in energy intensity reported in row 1. However, these effects lack statistical significance at con-
ventional levels.24 Similarly, we obtain a positive but not statistically significant point estimate for
employment of 0.078.
    We derive an estimate of the CCL impact on TFP from an augmented equation (4) which
includes the production factors capital, labor, materials, and energy. This amounts to estimating
a production function where the treatment variable captures the impact of the CCL on otherwise
unexplained differences in TFP.25 The coefficients reported in row 6 are positive but small in
magnitude and lack statistical significance. We thus cannot reject the hypothesis that the CCL had
no effect on plant-level TFP.
    The evidence in panel A clearly shows that the CCL led to substantial improvements of plant-
level energy efficiency compared to the CCA. As the CCL was not part of a harmonized carbon tax
across Europe, this begs the question of whether the CCL jeopardized the competitiveness of UK
industry. If this was the case, we should find negative tax coefficients for employment and output
because plants that pay the full rate of the levy scale down production and employment relative to
the control group. However, our results do not support such concerns as the point estimates are
  24 The lack of statistical significance of the coefficient on energy expenditures could be the result of a negative effect

on energy demand which is partially offset by the increase in the after-tax price of energy.
  25 This controls for production function endogeneity arising from plant specific unobserved effects (Griliches and

Mairesse, 1995).


                                                            26
positive and lack statistical significance.
    It is less clear from the results in panel A whether the improvement in energy intensity was
brought about by technological change or by movements along the production isoquant. While the
point estimates are consistent with an increase in the scale and the substitution of labor for energy,
we cannot reject the hypothesis that the scale of operations remained unchanged at the treated
plants. From a climate-policy perspective, it is important to know, however, whether reductions
in energy expenditures in CCL plants actually occurred, whether they correspond to reductions in
energy consumption and whether they lowered carbon emissions. For example, instead of consum-
ing less of all fuel types CCL plants might substitute towards fuels that are cheaper but also more
polluting, such as coal. More detailed information on energy use is needed to address this issue, as
the energy expenditures variable lumps together changes in the tax-inclusive price and quantity of
energy, as well as the effects of substitution between different fuel types.
    Panel B of Table 5 reports results from regressions using quantity changes in energy consump-
tion by fuel type which are available in the QFI sample. Although this sample is smaller than
the ARD sample, we find economically and statistically significant evidence that the CCL caused
plants to decrease their electricity use by 22.6%. The strong response underlines the fact that the
CCL imposes the highest tax rate for electricity. For both gas and solid fuels we obtain positive
point estimates of the treatment effect, both in absolute terms and as a share of total kWh con-
sumed.26 While these coefficients are not estimated with enough precision to be conclusive, they
hint at the possibility that CCL plants switched from electricity to the lower taxed fuels gas and
coal. This would also explain why the statistical significance of the IV coefficient for electricity
does not carry over to the one for total kWh in row 10. If plants switch from electricity to gas
or coal they are likely to require more kWh of primary energy to achieve a given level of energy
services. This might account for at least a partial offset of a tax-induced reduction in the demand
for those services.
  26 We report gas use as a share of total kWh and as a share of gas and electricity only, as other fuels are less frequently

used. The regressions on solid fuels are conditional on a plant using solid fuels in at least one period. In contrast, the
solid fuels share is computed for all plants and takes the value of zero for plants that do not use it.



                                                            27
   The significant decrease in electricity consumption among CCL plants translates into a de-
crease in carbon dioxide emissions ceteris paribus, but this could be offset by an increase in the
consumption of other fuel types. The last row of Table 5 shows the impact of the CCL on total
CO2 emissions, calculated as the sum of emissions across fuel types. The CCL is associated with
a significant decrease in total CO2 emissions of 7.4% in the OLS regression. The point estimate
increases slightly when going from OLS to IV, yet statistical significance is lost. We conjecture
that this is due to the noisy estimates of the tax response for fuels other than electricity. In the
absence of a larger sample that would enable us to estimate this effect with more precision, there
are two possible ways of quantifying the effect of the CCL on carbon emissions. On the one hand,
one can choose to disregard statistically insignificant coefficients altogether and conclude that the
unchecked decrease in electricity consumption translates into a decrease in CO2 emissions of equal
magnitude. On the other hand, a more cautious interpretation of the results is to use the point es-
timate of -0.096 from the IV estimation which accounts for the possibility that some CCL plants
switched into dirtier fuels such as coal. We thus conclude that the CCL – though not designed as
a pure carbon tax – caused plants paying the full rate to reduce CO2 emissions by between 9.6%
and 22.6% compared to plants that paid the reduced rate.


5.3   The treatment effect over time

The time profile of the treatment effect is of interest because it can reveal a possible time delay
in plants’ responses to the treatment, or whether the treatment effect dies off after a while. We
estimate the time profile by interacting the CCL variable with dummy variables for post-treatment
years 2001-2004 and substituting them for the simple treatment dummy in the regression equation.


   Table 6 displays the annual treatment coefficients for the ARD variables. For energy intensity
the negative CCL impact is present from 2001 onwards. The differences in point estimates for
different years are well within the margins of sampling error. The coefficients on energy expendi-
tures, real gross output and employment have the same signs as in Table 5. They are most precisely

Notes: Column 1 displays the OLS coefficient on the treatment variable interacted with dummies for
post-treatment years. Column 2 displays the OLS coefficient on the instrumental variable (and year
interactions) in the reduced form, and column 3 displays the 2SLS coefficient on the treatment variable
(and year interactions). Column 4 reports the number of observations and plants. Dependent variables
are first-differenced from 1997 until 2000 and differenced at various intervals thereafter. All regressions
include age, age squared, and control for year, region and 3-digit industry effects. The total factor
productivity regressions also control for labor, capital stock, and for expenditures on materials and
energy. Robust standard errors are in parenthesis. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at 10% (*), at
5% (**) and at 1% (***).

estimated for 2001, the first year of treatment. The point estimates in later years always have the
same sign but lack statistical significance. Again, there is no statistically significant effect of the
CCL on TFP.
   Table 7 displays the time profile of treatment effects in the energy quantity regressions based
on QFI data. The effect on electricity consumption is always negative but becomes significant
only after 2001. Conversely, the impact on gas consumption is positive and statistically significant
in 2001 only. This suggests that CCL plants initially switched to gas but, from 2002 onwards,
managed to reduce electricity consumption without significantly increasing consumption of other
fuels, thus reducing the number of total kWh consumed as well as CO2 emissions.


5.4     Robustness checks

5.4.1   Balanced sample

Our sample is an unbalanced panel for a number of reasons: random sampling of smaller plants
in the ARD; plant births and deaths; a few plants missing responses in some years. As the set of
plants in the sample changes slightly from year to year, the time profile of the treatment effect might
reflect – at least in part – the changes in sample composition rather than the dynamic response to the
CCL. Another potential problem with the unbalanced panel is that the results could be dominated
by potentially more extreme responses of exitors. We therefore re-estimate the model with time
interactions in a subset of “stayer” plants with observations in all years after 1999. The results
are displayed in Tables C.3 and C.4 in the Appendix. The sample size drops by about half in
both samples, and the 2001 coefficients become statistically insignificant except for gas. This may
be due to the smaller sample size but also to the fact that plants were subject to treatment only
during the last three quarters of that year as CCL was introduced on April 1st. Apart from that,
the qualitative findings obtained in the full sample are confirmed in the sample of stayers. The
point estimates on the ARD energy variables are negative as in the full sample, and even larger in
magnitude towards the end of the sample period. There are no statistically significant effects on
output, employment and TFP. This suggests that energy efficiency improvements at treated plants

were achieved by reducing energy expenditures rather than increasing output. The results for the
QFI sample are both qualitatively and quantitatively close to those obtained in the unbalanced
sample, although they are generally estimated with less precision. In sum, the impacts of the
tax estimated using the unbalanced panel do not seem to be a result of changes in the sample
composition.


5.4.2      Controlling for unobserved trends

Our identification strategy relies on the assumption that there is no unobserved heterogeneity in the
difference equation (2). As shown in Section 4.2, the raw data support this “common trends” as-
sumption. In regressions summarized in Tables C.5 and C.6, we include a time-invariant eligibility
dummy in equation (2) to allow for the possibility that unobserved trends in the outcome variables
differ between eligible and non-eligible plants. This yields qualitatively similar results, albeit less
statistically significant ones in later years. Since the coefficients on the additional control are sta-
tistically insignificant for all outcome variables except solid fuels, we do not include them in our
preferred specification.


5.4.3      Common support regression

Despite our IV strategy there might be concern that results are driven by a fundamental heterogene-
ity between treated (eligible) and non-treated (non-eligible) plants . Therefore, as a robustness test
we restrict the control group to a common support which is identified by the predicted probability
of a plant in the control group to receive treatment.27 We construct this common support sample
by dropping plants that do not belong to the central 80% of the propensity score distribution so
as to balance the covariates between the treatment and the control group.28 We then re-estimate
the main specification using only observations that belong to the common support sample. The
  27 See  Blundell et al., (2004) for a framework that combines propensity score matching with a differences-in-
differences estimator.
   28 Propensity scores are computed as the predicted values of a probit regression of CCL status on plant characteristics

(as in columns 4 and 8 of Table 4) for the year 2000. We drop the top and bottom 5% of the resulting distribution. We
iterate on this procedure once and verify that covariates in the resulting sample are balanced.

results are reported in Table C.7. For the ARD variables in panel A this leads to slightly larger
point estimates, suggesting that heterogeneity within the treated group is not a major problem. In
the smaller QFI dataset, about half of the sample needs to be dropped, but this entails no qualitative
change to the results.



6     Heterogeneous impacts, aggregate effects, and plant exit

6.1      The impact of the CCL in different subsamples

Our discussion so far has focused on the average effect of the CCL on treated plants. Apart from
this, it is useful to know how the impact of the CCL varies across treated plants with certain
characteristics. For example, the tax impact may differ from the ATT in industries that are very
energy intensive because the levy imposes a higher cost burden on these industries. Moreover,
as the political cost of job losses is high, policy-makers might be interested in the tax impact on
small firms which are responsible for the bulk of total employment. Finally, the impact of the CCL
on competitiveness may be particularly high for firms in sectors with high import penetration, as
foreign competition prevents them from passing compliance cost on to their customers through
higher output prices.
    To shed light on this, we estimate the impact of the CCL separately for plants with more vs. less
than 250 employees, and for plants with high vs. low energy or trade intensities in 2000 or 1999.
The splitting points for energy and trade intensities are defined at the 3-digit and 4-digit sector
level, respectively, in the following fashion. First, average intensities are computed across plants
in each sector. Next, sectors are sorted in the order of increasing intensity. Starting with the sector
with the highest intensity, we then assign sectors to the high intensity group until approximately
50% of plants are assigned to this group. The remaining plants are assigned to the low intensity
group.
    The first two columns of Table 8 report the IV coefficients for the split by energy intensity,
defined as the share of energy expenditures in gross output. Results for the low and high intensity

groups are reported in the odd and even-numbered columns, respectively. The IV point estimates
for energy intensity and energy expenditures indicate that the average effects reported in Table 5
are due to a strong response by plants in the more energy intensive sectors. The point estimates in
this group are -0.195 for energy intensity and -0.154 for energy expenditures in this group and both
are statistically significant at 5%. In contrast, the point estimates for the low intensity group lack
statistical significance. The point estimates for electricity consumption are similar in magnitude
but lack statistical significance in the group of less energy intensive plants.
    In columns 3 and 4 of Table 8 we split the sample according to the trade intensity in 4-digit
NACE sectors, which is computed as the value of imports and exports to non-EU countries over
the total market size within the EU27.29 This measure has been used by the EU Commission to
gauge the competitiveness impact of the EU ETS on manufacturing firms. To the extent that trade
intensity measures the degree of competition from non-regulated countries, it picks up the (lack of)

mining a list of sectors and subsectors which are deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage pursuant
to Article 10a (13) of Directive 2003/87/EC”, of September 4, 2009.


                                                                  34
ability of firms to pass on the cost of the CCL to their customers. The point estimates for the ARD
variables in the high trade intensity group closely follow those obtained in the full ARD sample. In
contrast, the impact on energy intensity is not statistically significant in the low intensity group. It
appears that the impact of the CCL on electricity consumption is more negative for the low intensity
group than for the high intensity group – however, neither coefficient is estimated with precision.
We do not find any significant impact on employment in either of the two groups. This gives rise to
two interpretations: first, that trade intensity might not be a good criterion for identifying adverse
effects on competitiveness; or second that the hypothesis which states that there are no such effects
should not be rejected.
   The last two columns of Table 8 report the results for the employment split. While the point
estimates for energy intensity are close to the corresponding estimate for the full sample in both
groups, only the coefficient for the larger plants is statistically significant at 10%. Similarly, the
point estimate for electricity use is negative in both samples but significant only in the sample of
larger plants. This suggests that the negative impacts of the CCL on energy intensity and electricity
use are driven by the tax response of larger plants.


6.2    Aggregate effects of a carbon tax

While the micro-level approach allows for better identification of the causal impacts of the tax,
from a policy point-of-view the aggregate implications of the tax matter. In this section, we calcu-
late the aggregate impact of the CCL on energy consumption. Furthermore, we compute the effect
of a counterfactual carbon tax similar to the CCL but without the reduced tax rate. This exercise
allows us to compare our results to studies assessing the impact of energy price changes on fuel
consumption at the aggregate level.
   In order to estimate the impact of the CCL on the aggregate of an outcome variable Y , we
weight the corresponding micro-level ATT estimate with the share in ∑i Yi that treated plants (those




                                                  35
paying the full tax rate) accounted for prior to treatment. This yields


                                                 {i|Ti =1} Yi,2000
                                              ∑
                                   ΓY = eα̂ − 1                    .
                                                   ∑i Yi,2000

For energy expenditure, the share of fully taxed plants is given by 52.42% and hence ΓEE =
−4.27%. In the case of electricity, fully taxed plants accounted for 45.96% of total electricity
consumption and hence ΓEl = −9.30%.
   When computing the aggregate impact of a counterfactual CCL without discounts, we need to
take into account how plants that were not eligible for a discount would have behaved had they
been eligible. Some of those plants would not have applied for a discount. For these ‘not tax-
concerned types’ we make the conservative assumption that they do not respond to the tax at all.
For all other plants (the ‘tax-concerned types’) we assume that their tax response equals the ATT.
Since the type is not observed for the majority of plants in our sample, we predict the probability
pi that plant i is of the ‘tax-concerned’ type using the Probit regression summarized in columns 4
and 8 of Table 4. We then compute the aggregate impact Λ̂Y by weighting each plant’s impact by
this predicted probability p̂i , multiplied by its share in the aggregate prior to treatment, i.e.


                                                       ∑i ( p̂iYi,2000 )
                                     Λ̂Y = (eα̂ − 1)                     .                           (6)
                                                        ∑i Yi,2000

   This yields Λ̂EE = [exp(−0.085) − 1] · 0.57 = −4.64% for energy expenditure and Λ̂El =
[exp(−0.226) − 1] · 0.59 = −11.93% for electricity. According to this back-of-the-envelope calcu-
lation, had the CCL been applied to all plants without rebates, it would have decreased aggregate
energy expenditures in manufacturing by at least 4.6% and aggregate electricity consumption by
at least 11.9%.
   One might ask what these estimates imply for the price elasticity of energy demand. Given
                                    1.15
that, on average, CCL plants pay    1.03   − 1 =11.7% more for energy, the implicit price elasticity of
energy expenditures can be computed as ηEE = | −0.046
                                                0.117 | = 0.39. This implies an upper bound on the




                                                    36
price elasticity of energy demand equal to ηE = | − 0.39 − 1| = 1.39.30 The elasticity of electricity
demand can be computed in a similar fashion. Given that the CCL raised the electricity price
     0.43
by   4.25   = 10.1% for the average manufacturing plant (cf. Table 1), the tax differential between
                                                                0.8×0.43
CCL plants and non-CCL plants is approximately               4.25+0.2×0.43   = 7.9%. Hence the elasticity of
electricity demand is given by | −0.119
                                  0.079 | = 1.51, which is slightly larger than the elasticity recovered

in the ARD sample.
     Both numbers are at the upper end of elasticity estimates obtained in comparable studies. For
example, Bjorner and Jensen (2002) estimate the energy price elasticity at -1.37 in the pooled
cross-section and -0.50 in a fixed-effects specification.31 The reader should bear in mind, however,
that we recover an estimate of a tax-induced price elasticity. Davis and Kilian (2010) argue that this
is structurally different from elasticity estimates based on other kinds of price variation because
taxes may be perceived as more persistent and hence induce larger behavioral changes. They also
point to a possible additional effect of media coverage that accompanies the introduction of such
taxes. Since the CCL was promoted as the UK’s flagship regulation for mitigating climate change,
there was ample scope for such an effect of the CCL, and our comparatively large estimates do not
speak against this possibility.
     Finally, notice that the IV point estimates are too large if we are underestimating the share
of compliers Pr(CCL = 0|NEPER = 0). This possibility could arise because we were not able
to match all CCA facilities when information on the business address or name was missing or
wrong. In this case, the intent-to-treat (ITT) parameter or reduced-form coefficient reported in
column 5 of Table 5 can provide a lower bound because it does not depend on the quality of the
CCA match. The ITT point estimates for energy expenditures and electricity are -0.027 and -0.069,
respectively. This translates into elasticity estimates of | exp −0.027−1
                                                                 0.117    − 1| = 1.23 for energy demand
and | exp −0.069−1
          0.079    | = 0.84 for electricity demand which are both within the bounds derived using
  30 If the CCL lowers the producer price (relative to CCA plants) then the elasticity of energy demand is less than
1.39. The extent to which energy suppliers can price-discriminate between customers who pay different tax rates
depends largely on the type of fuel and on local market structure.
   31 Our OLS estimate in the difference equation implies an upper bound on the elasticity of 1.09 but – as we have

argued above – this is biased towards zero if contracting firms select into CCAs.

the simple approximation to the aggregate impact of the CCL.


6.3     The CCL and plant exit

The analysis so far has focused on how paying the full rate of the CCL affects various outcome
variables in surviving plants. Rather than adjusting energy use and production at the intensive
margin, there is a concern that firms might respond to the CCL by closing down plants altogether
or by re-locating to non-regulated countries (“pollution havens”). After all, the substantial tax re-
bates granted under the CCA are intended to prevent such extensive-margin adjustments by energy
intensive firms.32
    We examine this by constructing a dummy variable EXIT which equals 1 in the year of exit
(defined as the year following the last reported year) and 0 otherwise. If exit occurs in year t, the
plant is removed from the sample in subsequent years. We might be tempted to estimate the effect
of the CCL on plant exit decisions by substituting EXITit for the outcome variable in equation (4).
However, since we do not observe any exit by treated plants in pre-treatment periods, all plants
that exit prior to treatment are automatically assigned to the control group, causing the estimated
treatment effect to be biased. To see this, recall that the differences-in-differences estimator of an
exogenous treatment T is identified from the sample equivalent of the expression


                          α =        E [Yit |Ti = 1, Tit = 1] − E [Yit |Ti = 1, Tit = 0 ]
                                    −E [Yit |Ti = 0, Tit = 1] + E [Yit |Ti = 0, Tit = 0]


where Tit indicates the treatment period and Ti = 1 indicates that a plant belongs to the treat-
ment group. In the case of exit, by construction we have no exit in the treatment group, i.e.
E [EXITit |Ti = 1, Tit = 0 ] = 0. As a consequence, even in the case of an exogenous exit probabil-
ity ρ > 0 which is constant across plants and time periods (i.e. α = 0), this estimator is upwardly
   32 Loss of international competitiveness and carbon leakage have been used with some success by industry to lobby

against carbon taxes or similar regulations. Virtually all European governments that levy taxes on energy use or carbon
emissions (i.e. Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and the UK) have also granted exemptions or partial
tax rebates to industries carrying a high tax burden.

biased, since â = ρ − 0 − (ρ − ρ) = ρ > 0. IV estimation using NEPER is not a solution here
because the instrument suffers from the same problem as the treatment variable (we falsely assign
NEPER = 1 to some plants that would have been listed in EPER had they survived until 2001).
   To overcome this issue, we propose an IV estimator that exploits variation in pre-sample em-
ployment size. We define a dummy SMALLi which indicates that employment at the plant was
below the median in 1997. Using data from 1998 onwards, we estimate the probit regression


                          Pr (EXITit = 1) = Φ αCCLit + SMALLi1997 + xit0 β .
                                                                          

This allows for fixed differences in the exit propensity between small and large plants and, since
employment size and treatment status are strongly correlated (see Table 3), SMALL may also con-
trol to a large extent for fixed heterogeneity between treatment and control groups. Moreover, we
use the interaction of SMALLi with a post-treatment dummy I{t>2000} to instrument for CCLit . The
idea behind this is (i) to use the fact that size influenced the decision to participate in a CCA and (ii)
to rely on variation in size prior to our sample period so as to preserve the exogeneity of the instru-
ment. Unlike the ATT estimates reported above, the estimated coefficient α has the interpretation
of a local average treatment effect (LATE).
   Since all the information needed to estimate equation (7) is available from the IDBR, we im-
plement these regressions at the local unit level (see footnote 19 above). Table 9 reports the results

             Notes: Columns display IV estimates of the impact of the CCL on log employment at the local unit level for
             different samples. The dependent variable is first-differenced from 1996 until 2000 and differenced at various

             trade intensity samples are split according to the median defined at the 3-digit and 4-digit sector level,
             respectively, in 1999 or 2000. Size is defined based on employment at the respondent unit, those with 250
             employees or less in 2000 or 1999 qualified as small. All regressions include age, age squared, year dummies, a
             full set of region-by-year and 3-digit sector-by-year dummies. Robust standard errors are in parenthesis.

from probit and IV probit models, along with the corresponding reduced-form and first-stage re-
sults. In each of the exit regressions, the coefficient on SMALL is positive and significant; confirm-
ing the already well-documented empirical regularity that smaller firms are more likely to exit. The
simple probit model yields a positive and significant coefficient estimate on CCL which implies a
6.5% increase of the exit probability at the average CCL plant. Notice that this effect is not nec-
essarily causal. In fact, the positive coefficient is consistent with a reverse-causality explanation
according to which, plants that anticipate to exit in the near future do not sign a CCA because the
tax savings this generates over the remaining lifetime of the plant do not cover the fixed costs of
certification to be paid upfront. Once we instrument for CCL status, the point estimate becomes
statistically insignificant, as foreshadowed by the insignificant coefficient estimate on the instru-
ment obtained in the reduced form. The first-stage regression coefficients show that our instrument
is strongly correlated with CCL status. In sum, we find no evidence that the CCL had an impact
on plant exit decisions. This finding is robust to the inclusion of industry controls and to splitting
the sample by either energy or trade intensity as in Section 6.1 above.33
  33 Table C.8 in the Appendix reports reduced-form and first-stage results for the robustness checks. The coefficient
estimates for the full sample with 2-digit sector dummies – reported in columns 1 and 2 – are virtually identical to the
ones in Table 9. When the sample is split by energy or trade intensity – columns 2 through 5 – the coefficient estimates
for the reduced form remain unchanged and the first-stage estimates change only in insignificant ways.



                                                                   40
     As a further robustness check, we estimate a version of equation (1) using employment data
at the local unit level. Table 10 reports estimates of the CCL impact on employment in the full
sample and when the sample is split according to energy and trade intensities, or size (defined as
previously at the reporting unit). As before, we do not find evidence of a detrimental effect of the
CCL on employment, regardless of which way the data are cut.34



7       Conclusion

There is widespread consensus that optimal climate policy should aim to regulate GHG emissions
at minimal cost across a broad range of economic sectors. Although curbing industrial emissions
must be an integral part of any such policy, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence on the
impacts of large-scale regulations of industrial GHG emissions – let alone using market-based in-
struments. This paper evaluates the most salient such regulation implemented in the UK – the
Climate Change Levy and negotiated agreements. Using a large panel of manufacturing plants
from the UK production census allows us to circumvent two main weaknesses of previous evalu-
ations. First, we avoid assumptions about macroeconomic or sectoral trends in energy use which
need to be made in simulation studies to establish counterfactual (“baseline”) emissions. Instead,
we compare changes in plant outcomes both over time and between plants that were subject to
different tax rates. The “baseline” is hence given by the contemporaneous outcomes of plants that
faced lower tax rates by virtue of being in a CCA. Second, our estimates of the impact of the CCL
are purged of confounding factors that affect plant performance at the level of the economy, the
region and the sector. Since we also control for self-selection into CCAs by exploiting exogenous
variation in CCA eligibility rules, we interpret our estimates as the causal effect of the CCL on
plant outcomes.
     We find robust evidence that the price incentive provided by the CCL led to larger reductions in
energy intensity and electricity use than the energy efficiency or consumption targets agreed under
    34 Ourpreferred estimates include a trend coefficient for the treatment group because we find it to be statistically
significant for the high trade intensity group.

the CCA. Tax rebates under the CCA were originally granted in order to shield energy intensive
firms from competitiveness losses they might possibly suffer in international product markets as
a consequence of the unilateral implementation of a significant energy tax. Contrary to this, we
find no discernible impact on employment, output or productivity across groups, and we cannot
reject the hypothesis that the CCL had no impact on plant exit. Our findings thus provide no
justification for granting tax discounts. They do, however, make a strong case for the introduction
of moderate energy taxes to encourage electricity conservation, to improve energy efficiency and
to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing sector. This is in contrast to previous
research that attributed substantial carbon savings to the CCA scheme on the basis of comparisons
with counterfactual baseline emissions (Ekins and Etheridge, 2006; Barker et al., 2007; AEAT,
2004).35 While our research design arguably produces a more credible estimate of the effect of the
CCL, it is clear that this effect is additional to any effect the CCA targets may have had on firm
behavior.
    This raises the question of whether alternative measures of putting a price on carbon emissions
such as tradable permits would have yielded similar results. Since CCA firms were allowed to
participate in the UK ETS, our results support the conclusion that the tax outperformed the cap-
and-trade regulation. It seems very likely that this is the consequence of an overly generous cap.
Neither previous research (Cambridge Econometrics, 2005; Ekins and Etheridge, 2006) nor our
own shows any evidence that the targets negotiated under the CCA were very stringent, and the
consistently low carbon prices in the UK ETS documented by Smith and Swierzbinski (2007) are
in line with this as well. Rather than proving that a cap-and-trade system cannot establish mean-
ingful prices for carbon, the UK experience demonstrates that a cap must put binding constraints
on energy use to deliver real emissions reductions. It also serves as a reminder that the difficul-
ties associated with this must not be underestimated. Aside from political factors, asymmetric
   35 This finding contrasts as well with results obtained by Bjorner and Jensen (2002) who investigate the consequences

of a similar policy package in Denmark and obtain a positive effect of negotiated agreements on energy efficiency.
Apart from institutional differences between the British and the Danish policy packages, the discrepancy might be
owed to differences in the research design as these authors do not control for selection into negotiated agreements
based on time-varying unobservables.



                                                          42
information about abatement cost and the case-by-case nature of target negotiations with sector
associations are likely to have left their mark on the final outcome.
   Our study constitutes a first step towards building an evidence base that informs policymakers
about the impacts of climate change policies on industry. As more such policies are being im-
plemented across countries, and as business microdata are becoming more abundant and easier to
access, we expect that researchers will exploit the variation in policies and institutional settings to
make important contributions to this evidence base. In the context of climate change policy in the
UK, there are several issues that deserve attention in future research. First, it seems important to
gain a better understanding of how plants achieved the substantial reductions in energy use that
we measure. This will require gathering more qualitative information on the key drivers of energy
conservation – be they technical, economic or managerial – which will facilitate the design of more
sophisticated policy instruments. From a political economy point-of-view, a thorough analysis of
the bargaining process in the setting of CCA targets and of compliance behaviour of individual
CCA facilities will provide valuable insights regarding the design of negotiated agreements. Fi-
nally, given the long-term nature of climate change, an important open question is whether a mod-
erate energy tax such as the CCL can stimulate much-needed innovation to bring about substantial
carbon reductions in the future.

disturbance. Relabeling the year 2000 so that t = 0 and normalizing ξ0 = 0 yields


                                      yi0 = const + Si0 β˜S + ηi + vi0


and the level-t difference is given by


                               yit − yi0 = αTit + t · Si0 βS + ξt + vit − vi0 .


Similarly, we derive the pre-treatment difference


                                 yi0 − yi−1 = S0 βS − ξ−1 + vi0 − vi−1 .


Based on this, we obtain the stacked equations used in the regression:

In the IV estimation, we use Zi and tZi as instrumental variables for Ti and tTi , respectively.



B     IV estimation with an imperfectly observed eligibility rule

The IV estimator of the effect of a treatment Di on an outcome yi using instrument zi is given by


                                         E [yi |zi = 1] − E [yi |zi = 0]
                                  θ̂ =                                   .                         (B.1)
                                         E [Di |zi = 1] − E [Di |zi = 0]

    Since the instrument is based on an eligibility rule we use that


                                E [Di |zi = 0] = Pr [Di = 1|zi = 0] = 0.                           (B.2)


A well-known consequence is that θ̂ recovers the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)



            E [∆yi Di |zi = 1] E [∆yi |zi = 1, Di = 1] Pr [Di = 1 |zi = 1]
     θ̂ =                     =                                            = E [∆yi |Di = 1 ]      (B.3)
             E [Di |zi = 1]                Pr [Di = 1 |zi = 1]

    where we have used the notation ∆yi ≡ y1i − y0i and the independence of zi and yi .
    In our application, we only observe an imperfect measure of the eligibility rule, z̃, which equals
zero for some eligible firms. For example, some firms emit pollutants covered under PPC legis-
lation but are not contained in the EPER database because the quantities emitted are below the
reporting threshold. In contrast, whenever z̃ = 1 we know for sure that a firm is eligible, i.e.


                                          Pr (zi = 0 |z̃i = 1) = 0.                                (B.4)


Consider the IV estimator with the imperfect instrument z˜i

                                       E [yi |z˜i = 1] − E [yi |z˜i = 0]   ρ̃
                                θ̃ =                                     ≡                         (B.5)
                                       E [Di |z˜i = 1] − E [Di |z˜i = 0] δ̃



                                                      iii
    The denominator of this expression can be written as


                                     δ̃ = Pr (Di = 1|z˜i = 1) − Pr (Di = 1|z˜i = 0)                                         (B.6)


The numerator corresponds to the reduced form regression of y on z and can be written as


                                     ρ̃ = E {∆yi Di |z̃i = 1} − E {∆yi Di |z̃i = 0} .                                       (B.7)


Note that from (B.4) we get for the first term in (B.7):


 E {∆yi Di |z̃i = 1} = E {∆yi Di |z̃i = 1, zi = 1} = E {∆yi |z̃i = 1, zi = 1, Di = 1} P {Di = 1 |z̃i = 1}
                                                                                                                            (B.8)
and for the second term1


                   E {∆yi Di |z̃i = 0} = E {∆yi |z̃i = 0, zi = 1, Di = 1} Pr {Di = 1 |z̃i = 0}                              (B.9)


    To simplify notation, let En ≡ E[∆yi |Di = 1, z̃i = n, zi = 1] and pn ≡ Pr (Di = 1 |z̃i = n) for
n ∈ {0, 1}. This yields
                                                            E1 p1 − E0 p0
                                                     θ̃ =                 .                                                (B.10)
                                                               p1 − p0

    How does this estimator relate to the ATT θ̂ ? Denoting by Ē = E0 + λ (E1 − E0 ) where λ ≡
   1 Write E {∆y D |z̃ = 0 } = E {∆yi Di |zi = 1, z̃i = 0 } Pr {zi = 1 |z̃i = 0 }+E {∆yi Di |zi = 0, z̃i = 0 } Pr {zi = 0 |z̃i = 0 } .
                i i i
The second term of this expression, E {∆yi Di |zi = 0, z̃i = 0 } = E {∆yi |Di = 1, z = 0, z̃i = 0} Pr {Di = 1 |zi = 0, z̃i = 0}
equals zero because of condition (B.2).

                                 p1 − p0

since the term in brackets is the linear combination of two positive probabilities and hence positive.
In our application, p1 − p0 > 0 so that the condition implies


                  θ̃ R θ̂ ⇔ E[∆yi |Di = 1, z˜i = 1, zi = 1] R E[∆yi |Di = 1, z˜i = 0, zi = 1].


This result is intuitive. If the average treatment effect on firms that we observe as eligible is higher
than among those that are erroneously identified as not eligible, then we overestimate the ATT and
vice versa.

Notes: Summary statistics for the difference in growth rates between year 1999 and 2000 by CCL and NEPER
status. For each variable, we report the mean and the number of observations in the row below the variable
mean. Columns 3 and 6 report significance levels of a t-test of differences in group means with unequal
variance. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at 10% (*), at 5% (**) and at 1% (***).

Notes: Column 1 displays the OLS coefficient on the treatment variable interacted with dummies
for post-treatement years. Column 2 displays the OLS coefficient on the instrumental variable (and
year interactions) in the reduced form, and column 3 displays the 2SLS coefficient on the
treatment variable (and year interactions). Column 4 reports the number of observations and
plants. Dependent variables are first-differenced from 1997 until 2000 and differenced at various
intervals thereafter. All regressions include age, age squared, and controls for year, region and 3-
digit industry effects. The total factor productivity regressions also control for labor, capital stock,
and for expenditures on materials and 28 energy. Robust standard errors are in parenthesis.
Asterisks indicate statistical significance at 10% (*), at 5% (**) and at 1% (***).

are first-differenced from 1997 until 2000 and differenced at various intervals thereafter. NEPER is a
dummy variable that equals one if a facility is not on the EPER list. All regressions include a time-
invariant eligibility dummy interacted with year differences (NEPER*year difference), age, age squared,
and control for year, region and 3-digit industry effects. Robust standard errors are in parenthesis.
Asterisks indicate statistical significance at 10% (*), at 5% (**) and at 1% (***).

Notes: Column 1 displays the OLS coefficient on the treatment variable interacted with dummies for
post-treatment years. Column 2 displays the OLS coefficient on the instrumental variable (and year
interactions) in the reduced form, and column 3 displays the 2SLS coefficient on the treatment
variable (and year interactions). Column 4 reports the number of observations and plants. Dependent
variables are first-differenced from 1997 until 2000 and differenced at various intervals thereafter.
NEPER is a dummy variable that equals one if a facility is not on the EPER list. All regressions
include a time-invariant eligibility dummy interacted with year differences (NEPER*year difference),
age, age squared, and control for year, region and 3-digit industry effects. Robust standard errors are
in parenthesis. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at 10% (*), at 5% (**) and at 1% (***).

      Notes: The table reports results from reduced-form (RS) and first-stage (FS) regressions of the exit equation when 2-digit sector dummies are included. Columns 1 and 2
      correspond to column 2 and 3 in Table 9. The remaining columns report the results from regressions after splitting the sample according to the sector's energy intensity
      (columns 3 to 6) and trade intensity (columns 7 through 10), as explained in Section 6.1. SMALL is a dummy indicating that employment at the plant was below the
      median in 1997. All regressions including year dummies, age and age squared. The sample period ranges from 1998 to 2004. Standard errors are clustered at the local unit
      level. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at 10% (*), at 5% (**) and at 1% (***).
