Why Are Some Recoveries Short and Others Long?

NBER Working Paper No. 28982
July 2021
JEL No. E3,E32

                                          ABSTRACT

Using the recession recovery point equal to the month when private payrolls first exceeded their
previous peak level, this paper argues that it was the negative secular trend in manufacturing jobs
that was the most important determinant of the length and depth of the last three recessions/
recoveries. This negative secular trend changed the layoff/recall pattern of jobs in manufacturing
into permanent displacements, a malady that lengthened the recovery periods and that is not the
explicit target of either traditional monetary policy or traditional fiscal policy. Using the ideas
gathered from an examination of the US two-digit sectoral data for the US overall, attention turns
to the recession/recoveries of the 50 US states in the last three national recession periods.
Regressions that explain the lengths and depths of the recessions in 50 US states reveal the
importance of construction jobs, but the most important predictor was manufacturing jobs: the
greater the share of manufacturing jobs prior to the recession, the worse was the recession/
recovery.

This paper presents an exploratory study of the relationship between features of the 2-digit sectoral
employment levels preceding the US recessions and the subsequent lengths and depths of recessions
and recoveries, first for the US overall and then for the 50 States of the United States. This search for
precursors of severe problems could be a step toward formulating a well-targeted policy response to
make the recessions shorter and shallower in a way that varies with the circumstances.

The first section deals with US national recessions and recoveries, first by offering a definition of the
month when the recovery ends to accompany NBER peak and trough months, second by showing that
the last three recessions had the longest recoveries and third by looking at jobs in NAICS 2-digit sectors
to determine which sectors recovered early and which recovered late. It is the premise of this
exploration that the sectors making the recovery long are those that recover late, which is an algebraic
property of the recovery data but not necessarily a causal conclusion.

After a study of US GDP, unemployment and payrolls to define the recoveries, I have opted for the most
easily determined choice for an "early" recovery point: when overall payrolls returned to their previous
peak. This is "early" because at this recovery point the unemployment rate is typically above the level at
the previous peak, and neither GDP nor payrolls are back to trend.

I report in this first section the recovery status of the employment levels in the 2-digit NAICS sectors
when overall jobs returned to their previous peak. For example, on average over the first eight US
recessions, when total payrolls returned to previous peak, durable manufacturing was still 6.2% below
its previous peak, which is the lowest of any of the 2-digit sectors. In an accounting sense,
manufacturing thus contributed most to making these first eight recessions longer.

An important takeaway is that employment in durable manufacturing in the first eight recessions had a
distinct V-shape with the downward stroke of the V lasting almost a year and with the upward stroke
restoring the durable manufacturing employment level in the third year. But in the last three
recessions, jobs in durable manufacturing traced out an L not a V. Thus the historical path of temporary
layoffs followed by recalls was replaced with permanent displacements. The permanently displaced
workers needed to find new skills, new locations and new aspirations. That takes a lot more time, which
is why the last three recoveries were very delayed.

I argue that the switch from V to L in manufacturing was caused by a change in the secular trend from
positive to negative. Negative secular trends have also occurred in other sectors, including construction
and information, which also are associated with delayed recoveries.

There are only eleven not-very distinct recessions in the US since 1948 and with only eleven
observations it is difficult to identify variables that can be used reliably to explain the recession lengths
and depths. I thus turn to three recessions experienced collectively by the 50 States of the United
States: 1991, 2001 and 2008/09. Only three recession episodes are considered because the state 2-digit
payrolls that I have used begin in 1990. To determine the depths and lengths of the recessions, the first
step is to devise an algorithm to assign peaks, troughs and recovery points for all 50 states. I then
estimate regressions separately for each of these three recession events to explain the depth equal to
the job loss from peak to trough, the length in months between previous peak and recovery, and the
severity which is depth times length. The explanatory variables are the previous employment shares in
manufacturing, construction and information, all of which having been identified as probable
contributors by the study of the US overall.

                                                                                                             2
Although Leamer(2008) is on record of saying "Housing is the Business Cycle", it is manufacturing
employment not construction employment that dominates the predictors of both length and depth in
2001 and 2008/09. The reason is that manufacturing has the most evident downward secular trend in
employment and thus the biggest contributor to permanent displacements instead of layoffs and recalls.

There is a large related literature in labor economics that explores the problems of permanent layoffs.
Lillien(1980) comes close to the themes of this paper by describing the prevalence of temporary layoffs
followed by recalls in manufacturing in recessions, before the emergence of the negative secular trend
in manufacturing jobs. John Haltiwanger has a number of pertinent publications regarding
temporary/permanent layoffs including Haltiwanger(1984), Haltiwanger(1987) and Haltiwanger and
Maccini (1994). Von Wachter et. al. (2011) is a study of layoffs in the 1982 recession, leading to Davis
and von Wachter(2011) which highlights the greater effect of job losses in recessions than job losses in
expansions.

The labor economics literature on temporary vs. permanent layoff is very interesting and very large but
rarely connects to the macro-economic question: what makes recoveries take a long time? Groshen and
Potter(2003) explore a closely related question: "Has Structural Change Contributed to a Jobless
Recovery?" To identify industries with permanent layoffs they compare job growth in the recessions
with job growth in the first twelve months of recovery. This is related to the negative secular trend
viewpoint that is offered in this paper but not the same. The 2003 timing of this paper prevented a
similar study of the Great Recessions and created a focus on the 2001 recession.



US Recessions and Recoveries
What's a Recovery?
"The NBER's traditional definition of a recession is that it is a significant decline in economic activity that
is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months." 1 There are no official precise
definitions of business cycle peaks and troughs, which are decided by an NBER committee of Ph.D.
economists exploring multiple data series. But "peaks" and "troughs" of economic activity are pretty
clear visual images that probably drive the committee deliberations. In particular, take a look at Figure
1 which illustrates the US monthly unemployment rate with the official NBER recessions in yellow. A
period of sustained increases in unemployment does a remarkably good job mimicking the NBER
decisions, and when there is a conflict maybe it's the unemployment rate that gets it right.

Peaks and troughs are fairly easy to identify but the point when a recovery is completed and the
economy is back to "normal" is a much more ambiguous situation. For example, take another look at
Figure 1 and notice the long slow decline of the unemployment rate all the way to the end of many
expansions. Can you see the end of the recovery there?

The academic literature on recoveries including Barthélémye.al.(2010), Fernald el al. (2017), Gali et
al.(2012), Gadea et. al.(2017) focusses attention on the years immediately after the official NBER cycle

                                                                                                              3
trough, often looking for exceptional growth of GDP and employment, though without making a
recommendation of the point at which the recovery ends and a normal healthy economy returns.

For convenience and simplicity, I define the recovery point as the month when total payroll jobs
returned to their previous peak level. This leaves the unemployment rate higher than its level at the
previous GDP peak and the rate of growth of GDP is still exceptional, both suggesting that "normal" has
not yet been achieved. My attempt to find an algorithm for identifying a later return to normal using
either GDP growth or payroll growth or the unemployment rate did not produce a workable alternative.

Figure 2 illustrates the US total payroll data during the eleven expansions since WWII displayed from the
cycle peak until payrolls first exceeded the previous peak, the proposed recovery point. The vertical axis
in this figure refers to the percent difference from the cycle peak, with zero being both the peak and the
point of recovery for all the expansions. The horizontal axis starts at the cycle peak and measures
months after the peak. Vertical lines at the 12-month points identify years. The legend refers to the
months of the cycle peaks at which the data display begins. One thing that jumps out of this figure is the
long times for recovery from the last three recessions. We need to know why, and what fiscal or
monetary policy might have made the recovery quicker.

In pursuit of better definition of recovery point, Figure 3 illustrates US Real GDP cumulative growth from
peak quarter to the quarter when payrolls first exceeded their previous peak level, including a 3% trend
and a 2% trend. Every one of the episodes in this image has GDP returning to previous peak before
payrolls did, usually not by much. When payrolls returned to previous peak, GDP exceeded its previous
peak level by amounts ranging from 2.8% in the 1973 expansion to 11.7% in the 2001 expansion. That
productivity gain in the aftermath of recessions reflects the emphasis on cost-cutting achieved by laying
off the least productive workers and instituting new management rules and new capital investments to
make the remaining workers more productive than they were before the recession began.

In the first eight episodes, real GDP collapsed downward for a few quarters and then when growth
occurs it was at rates well in excess of the 3% normal, and the real GDP moved sharply upward toward
the 3% trend line. That exceptional growth was occurring when GDP returned to previous peak,
suggesting that the recovery was still ongoing. The last three expansions have been very different. The
1990 downturn was brief and shallow but the return toward the 3% trend was very tepid. The 2001
growth was along the 2% trend until 9 quarters and then seemed to try hard to get to the 3% trend line,
but never made it. The 2007 expansion was quite unlike any of the earlier ones with a recession
followed by pretty stable growth at around 2%. If we defined a recovery as a period of exceptional GDP
growth based on the rehiring of workers discharged in the recession, then 2007 had no recovery at all.
It just transitioned from the recession into 2% growth.

A recession could be defined as a sustained period of market failure during which there is elevated
unwanted idleness of labor and capital. It's not growth; it's idleness, though these are related. The
idleness definition seems to call for using a return to previous peak rate of unemployment to define the
full recovery point. The unemployment data illustrated in Figure 4 reveal that the unemployment rate
was always above its previous peak level when payrolls returned to their value at the previous peak.
Both GDP and the unemployment rate are therefore suggesting that the recovery was not completed
when payrolls returned to their previous peak level. But a definition that calls for return to the
unemployment rate at the previous peak has a problem with it: several of the expansions never
experienced a return to previous peak unemployment rate. An alternative explored in Leamer(2009) is

                                                                                                         4
to identify a full recovery point when the economy produces a plateau of stable unemployment which
sometimes occurs While that is interesting, it complicates the definition of recovery, and I will use the
return to previous peak employment measured by payroll jobs, which works well for the purposes here,
even though it is an early call for the end of the recovery.

How long did the eleven recoveries last?
To make clear that the last three recoveries have been unusually long, Figure 5 is a bar chart with one
bar for each of the eleven expansions, with a blue segment representing the number of months from
peak to trough and an orange segment representing the additional months until payrolls return to the
previous peak. Until recently the recessions lasted a bit under 12 months and the recoveries occurred in
another 12 months, under 24 months (2 years) in total. The previous peak was recovered in under two
years in the first five recessions and the sixth was the first to exceed two-years, but by only one month.
The seventh (1980) was very short-lived and then commenced a sequence of four expansions with
variable length recessions but much longer recoveries.

Which Sectors Made the Recoveries Long?
Many academic papers have taken note of the slow recoveries, especially after the 2008/09 Great
Recession, but a clear causal story has yet to emerge. Per Fernald et.al. (2009) the explanation was slow
productivity growth and reduced labor force participation. Galí et. al. (2012) use a New Keynesian
model to produce their "structural interpretation." "When we take a closer look at the recent episode
we uncover a nonnegligible role for adverse wage markup and monetary policy shocks as factors behind
the slow recovery. We interpret the latter finding as reflecting the zero lower bound on interest rates
and the likely presence of downward wage rigidities." Gadea et.al. (2017) use cluster analysis applied to
a set of measures to conclude: "According to the new measures, we identify that expansions before and
after the beginning of the Great Moderation (1984) are clearly different."

This paper offers some preliminary exploratory work that lays the foundation for causal conclusions to
come. The preliminary work is a study of the behavior of jobs in the 2-digit subsectors. Let's find out
which sectors have the smallest percentage declines, which make the largest contributions to overall
decline, and which ones bounced back the fastest. And let's determine how these properties have
changed over time.

Table 1 reports the 2018 average employment levels in thousands and the percent of total by 2-digit
sector. Mining and Logging is the smallest sector with only 0.5% of employment and Education and
Health Services is the largest with 15.9%. The last column in this table has the mnemonics for all these
sectors.

Figure 6 illustrates the percent change in sectoral employment at the recovery point when the change of
overall payrolls was near zero. Black bars represent the average of the first eight episodes and the other
three colored bars represent the last three episodes before our 2020 shutdown. Sectors are sorted by
the black bars. The historical laggards have negative black bars and the sectors with early returns to
previous peak have positive black bars. At the extreme left is durable manufacturing with a -6.2% black
bar which means that durable manufacturing was still at 6.2% below previous peak when payrolls
overall were already back to previous peak. The blue arrows pointing downward identify the sectors
that were much more sluggish in the last three cases than the earlier average eight: durable
manufacturing, information, nondurable manufacturing, construction, wholesale trade and retail trade.

                                                                                                           5
The green arrows pointing up are the sectors that recovered more rapidly in the last three cases: Leisure
and Hospitality, and Education and Health Services.

Permanent Separations are the main problem
One important reason for a slow recovery is the prevalence of permanent job separations. Every
recession and recovery has workers who are laid off and then return to the same job or an equivalent
job in the same sector, and other workers who are laid off and find themselves forced by circumstances
to make an unwanted change in sector of employment or to remove themselves from the labor force.
Sectors that are growing have layoffs in recessions followed by recall opportunities, but sectors which
are shrinking while the economy is growing have mostly permanent displacements in recessions, which
requires workers to find new jobs in new locations, with new skills and new aspirations. That can make
the recoveries longer. The primary example of this problem is manufacturing which has had a secular
negative trend since the 1980s. More recently, a negative trend has emerged in information, retail and
wholesale, which is confirmed below.

Manufacturing has been a big part the problem
One of the most important reasons for the slowing recoveries is illustrated in the manufacturing
employment data in Figure 7 with log scales that allow straight lines to represent constant rates of
growth This figure has three straight arrows, the first arrow identifying the period of generally rising
employment in manufacturing and the other two identifying period of declining employment, the first
labeled suggestively "Layoffs and Recalls" and the other two "Permanent Separations."

The reason why the underlying long-term direction of job growth separates the labor market
performance into these two categories is explained with the two illustrations in Figure 8. Each
illustration begins with a cost-cutting phase with a downward stroke representing the job loss and a
shorter upward stroke representing the amount of hiring that is necessary to get back to previous peak
output, allowing for the improvements in productivity put in place during the recession, as was
discussed above. To that cost-cutting partial V is added a secular time trend to reflect the long-term
trend in employment, contrasting up from down. The first illustration shows that when positive growth
in demand is added to the recession cost-cutting, the result is a happy V: layoffs followed by recalls. The
lower image adds to the cost-cutting partial V a secular decline, and that is what produces the lazy L,
with permanent layoffs and no recalls.

The message of these images is that secular increases in jobs support a layoff and recall pattern but a
secular decline creates permanently separated workers who may need to move to new locations and/or
acquire new skills and/or greatly reduce their aspirations before they can find another job. That takes a
lot more time than a recall.

The difference between "Layoffs and Recalls" versus "Permanent Separations" in manufacturing is made
abundantly clear in Figure 9 which illustrates manufacturing jobs from cycle peak to cycle recovery
point. Here we see the V-shaped patterns with a strong bounce back of manufacturing jobs except for
the last three recessions: 1990, 2001, 2007. (2020 was a shutdown not a recession.) That confirms with
the logic of Figure 8.

We may pause a moment to comment on the use of fiscal and monetary "stimulus" during the first eight
recessions versus the last three. It is possible but not proven that fiscal and monetary policy could
make the downward stroke of the manufacturing jobs V shorter, and could make the upward stroke

                                                                                                           6
steeper which, in a more understandable language, means the recession would be briefer and not as
deep. However, during the last three recessions policy should not have tried to create a V that could
never occur. These manufacturing workers needed to be moved to other jobs, with new skills, new
locations and new aspirations. It is possible but quite doubtful that fiscal and monetary policy might
create high demand for workers in other sectors in other locations, making the transition away from
manufacturing materially easier and quicker, but surely the best policy would focus directly on the
affected communities, with counselling and retraining and relocation assistance. As a nation, we chose
to ignore these communities, and that has ignited the political firestorm that is consuming our politics
today.

If we learned from that mistake we would be alert to any other major secular negative trends that have
been unmasked in our recent recessions, and we would design public policy either to slow those
transitions or to facilitate them, helping out the adversely affected workers using tax contributions from
those who profit from the negative secular trend. Amazon, for example.

Sectoral Details: The Other Troubled Sectors
Next we can take a look at graphs of the six other troubled sectors identified in the bars of Figure 6
(manufacturing, construction, information, retail and wholesale.) These time series graphs reveal the
details that lie behind those bars.

Construction jobs are illustrated in Figure 10 which reveals the biggest problem by far in construction
jobs was in the 2007 episode following the Great Recession. My "causal" interpretation of this event
offered in Leamer(2008,2015) is that the Federal Reserve stimulated the housing market with very low
interest rates after the recession of 2001, even though housing did not suffer in that recession and even
as housing starts were skyrocketing above 2 million per year when 1.5 million was the historical norm.
Those low interest rates did not create a permanently higher level of demand for homes. They
accelerated the construction of homes, taking sales from the future, making the recovery from the Great
Recession longer.

Information jobs are illustrated in Figure 11. This sector used to bounce back quickly but not in the 2001
or 2007 episodes. Employment levels in the six subsectors of the information sector are illustrated in
Figure 12. Here again we see the negative secular trend since 2000 in telecommunications, publishing
and broadcasting. Some of the problem here was created by the Internet Bubble of the late 1990s but
some of the reason for the negative secular trend was the power of the Internet and personal
computers in driving job losses. While the Federal Reserve celebrated the Housing Bubble of the 2000s
it expressed concern about the Internet Bubble, which is strange because the Fed probably had control
over the Housing Bubble but not the Internet Bubble.

Figure 13 illustrates jobs in wholesale trade which like manufacturing have also been weak in the last
three recessions. Retail jobs illustrated in Figure 14 have flattened out like wholesale jobs. Both of
these job categories have been affected by technological change that replaces workers with equipment.




                                                                                                           7
Recessions and Recoveries of 50 US States
Based on what has been uncovered about the sectors that contributed to longer and deeper US
recessions, I now study the variability of the depth and length of the most recent three recessions for all
50 states, seeking an explanation why some states had deeper and longer recession/recoveries than
others.

Some of the total payrolls for each of the 50 states have strong and distinctive seasonal patterns, and
the first step is to create seasonally adjusted data, which is discussed in an appendix.

Identifying Peaks and Recoveries
There are no official peak and trough months for US states. Rather than a committee of economists to
decide collectively when the peak and trough and recovery occurred in each of these states, I will use an
algorithm applied across all states, with a bit of additional tinkering after the algorithm makes its
suggestions. The appeal of an algorithm over a committee is that objections to an algorithm can be
relevant and decidable, while objections to the choices made by a committee may have little force
unless you were there witnessing the discussion.

The focus here is on peak and recovery months. A recession and recovery form a sustained period
during which payroll jobs are below their previous peak. An algorithm that identifies this period of
sustained payroll shortfalls by comparing the seasonally adjusted payroll data with the previous peak
falters with the nervous twitching of much of the data illustrated in Figure 15 which has the official US
recessions shaded. After some exploration, I have chosen to choose the peaks and recoveries by
studying a 13 month centered moving average of the seasonally adjusted log data of total employment
by state. Figure 16 illustrates the California seasonally adjusted data, the 13 month centered moving
average, and the (shaded) periods of time during which the centered moving average was below it's
previous peak. The smoothed 13 month moving average tracks the actual peaks and valleys, and the
algorithm has identified the periods of time when payrolls were below their previous peak. This
algorithm isn't perfect. It has identified November 2007 as the beginning of a period of declined payrolls
in California, with September part of the episode but October not. That stand-alone month of
September 2007 can be fixed either by assigning it to the pre-recession period or assigning October to
the recession. I have chosen the first option.

Much more tinkering is needed for Alaska. Figure 17 has the periods in which the centered 13-month
moving average of the AK log seasonally adjusted employment was below its previous peak. What we
are looking for are the state equivalents of the three national recessions that occurred in three periods:
August 1990 to March 1992, April 2001 to November 2001, and January 2008 to June 2009. The
algorithm has revealed that Alaska had receding employment from 2015 onward. While it is appropriate
to call that a recession, it doesn't match any of the periods of US recessions and will not be compared
with recessions in the other states. Figure 18 has a corrected image for AK with only one of the three
national recessions represented. Corrected images like this one for all 50 states are in an appendix.

Table 2 has the length and depth of each of the three episodes based on the shaded regions in the
appendix that identify the recessions/recoveries for all 50 States. The length is the number of months in
the shaded regions and the depth is the difference between the minimum and maximum log seasonally
adjusted employment values. Thus, for example, the first state, ALASKA, did not have recessions in the
first two national episodes but in the third episode had a recession/recovery that lasted 16 months with

                                                                                                          8
a maximum payroll decline of -.6%. Connecticut (CT) is the only state to be in the top five lengths all
three times. The Great Recession (Episode 3) was longer and deeper in most states than the other
episodes.

Explaining the Depth and Lengths of Three Recessions in 50 States
In preparation for the study of the variability of recession outcomes across US states, Figure 19
illustrates the national employment shares of manufacturing, construction and information since 1987
with the official recessions in red and the periods during which total payrolls were below their previous
peak in yellow except that payrolls in the last month of each recovery exceeded the previous peak.
These three sectors are thought to be "foundation" jobs on which the other jobs are constructed. The
foundation sectors sell most of their output outside the state, to other states or to other nations. These
are the sectors in which a state earns revenues that can be used to purchase goods and services
produced elsewhere. If these foundation jobs are established in a state, then they attract support jobs
in restaurants, health care, education, government and so on. The apparent exception to this statement
is the construction sector which sells it's output locally, but the finance needed to support the purchase
of homes or other structures comes from the national or global bond market, bringing revenue that can
be spent locally in restaurants and hospitals and schools.

The declining share of manufacturing until 2010 probably contributed to both the depth and the length
of the recessions, since this created large numbers of permanently displaced workers who had to find
jobs in other sectors, something that probably took significantly longer than the recalls that occurred
after earlier recessions. The construction sector probably contributed to the length and depth of the
1990 recession and the 2008/09 recession when the share of construction jobs fell substantially but not
much in the 2001 recession when the share of construction jobs was rather constant. The Information
jobs share bubbled up in the late 1990s but fell from then on. Those jobs are likely to have had adverse
consequences especially for the 2001 recession but also played a role in the 2008/09 downturn.

Table 3 reports the fractions of jobs in manufacturing, construction and information in the 50 US states
in 1990, 2000 and 2006 2, the years before US recessions. These data will be used to explain the length

and depth of recessions. The states in the top five in manufacturing in all three episodes are Arkansas
(AR), Indiana(IN), Missouri (MS) and Wisconsin(WI). The fraction of jobs in manufacturing declined in all
but two of the 50 states (ND and NV) from 1990 to 2000 and all but one (ND) from 2000 to 2006. These
declines are expected to have played an important role in the length of the recession/recovery and also
the depth.

Table 4 reports the summary statistics for 1990 shares and the changes in shares in the next two
expansions. The initial construction job shares ranged from 1.7% to 8.0% over the 50 states. The
increase from 1990 to 2000 ranged from -.9% to 3.2%, and the increase from 2000 to 2006 ranged from
-.4% to 2.5%. What these numbers suggest is that the 2001 downturn did not involve a housing
correction and overbuilding was a two-expansion cumulative problem. The manufacturing shares in
1990 varied from 0.39% to 26.4% and the subsequent declines were mostly negative in both expansions,
as big as -7.0% in the 1990-2000 expansion. The information shares are the lowest of the three, and
were generally growing in the 1990s but declining thereafter.

Table 5 reports summary statistics for the dependent variables. The first recession was rather mild with
an average decline in jobs of 1.6% and average length of 22.8 months. The second recession was slightly
deeper and a lot longer (40 months), but the Great Recession is the real outlier here with average depth
of 6.7% and an average length of 80.8 months. Incidentally, the usual recession drives GDP below it's
normal trend and during the recovery GDP growth is exceptional and GDP returns to trend. But the
2001 event brought GDP from above trend back down to trend which is a path that does not have a
traditional recovery with exceptional growth. This path is one of a slight decline and a long recovery. It
might be best not to call the 2001 event a recession but a correction for the irrational exuberance of the
Internet bubble.

The last row of Table 5 reports the range of the length and depth variables, the maximum value minus
the minimum. I have put a negative sign in front of depth so that a larger number means greater
depth. For both depth and length, the range was smallest for episode 2, the 2000s, and largest by far
for the Great Recession. I will use regression models to help explain why some states had deep and long
recessions. The regressions now to be discussed explain three different variables that describe the
recessions of the 50 states: the length, the negative of the depth and the product of the two which I will
call severity. No regressions are reported that explain the length or depth of the 1991 recession because
no variables are available that can capture what was happening in the expansion that ended in 1991.

Table 6 has regressions that explain the length and depth of the 2001 recessions across the 60 States.
The column of regressions on the left has six explanatory variables, Construction, Manufacturing and
Information shares in both 1990 and 2000. The 1990 data are included to capture dynamic effects like
overbuilding. There are two explanatory variables that have t-values in excess of one for all three
dependent variables but no coefficient attains a t-value of 2 or more. This is partly due to overwhelming
the data with too many parameters to estimate.

The column of regressions on the right in Table 6 was designed to create coherent interpretable results
by using the difference between the 2000 value and the 1990 value when the coefficients are opposite
in sign and similar in absolute value or by setting coefficients equal to each other when the estimates
are similar in magnitudes and the same sign, in which the case the variable becomes the average. In



                                                                                                       10
addition, variables with t-values less than one are omitted to maximize the adjusted R-squared and
minimize the S.E. of regression, thus concentrating the data resource on a smaller set of questions.
Finally, the variables are standardized to have unit standard errors, and the estimated coefficient are
"beta-values" indicating how many standard deviations of the dependent variable are associated with a
one standard deviation change in the explanatory variable. This we will use to measure the
"importance" of the variable, and the t-value measures the statistical reliability of the importance
measure. In each regression, the largest beta-coefficient and largest t-value are highlighted.

Focusing on the trimmed, standardized results, the standout variable is the manufacturing share. For
explaining the length of the year 2001 recessions in the 50 States is the average of the manufacturing
employment shares in 1990 and 2000. This variable has the largest t-value and the largest beta-value,
which is positive, meaning that states with large manufacturing shares had long recessions in 2000. The
manufacturing employment share stands out also for the depth and the severity (Length times depth).
The average of the information employment shares in 1990 and 2000 has a statistically significant effect
on the length of the recessions, and has a fairly large beta-coefficient. A large information share
contributed to the length and depth, and a growing information share contributed to the depth. That
makes a lot of sense since 2001 was a tech correction following the Internet Rush of the 1990s. The
construction employment share coefficient is negative in all three regressions suggesting that a large
construction employment share helped make the recession shorter and shallower, possibly because the
States with large construction shares benefited at that time from the Fed's low interest rates.
Information and construction played a role, but the crucial driver in 2001 was the size of the
manufacturing employment share and the consequent permanent loss of manufacturing jobs.

Table 7 is a similar set of results for the Great Recession 2008/09 period with explanatory variables
equal to construction, manufacturing and information employment shares in 2006, 2000 and 1990. The
results on the left have a mixture of signs of coefficients and the results on the right with a reduced
parameterization is again designed to make the results more understandable. All variables in the results
on the right have unit standard errors and the coefficients are "beta-values." The largest t-values and
the largest beta-values are highlighted.

Again manufacturing jobs contribute most noticeably      Scatter Diagram Comparing Changes in Employment Shares

2006 probably predicted more troubles in the 2008/09 recession, and thus the negative coefficients in
the regression.

For the depth of the Great Recession, the second most statistically significant and most important
variable is the construction boom defined as the increase in construction share of employment from
2000 to 2006. The earlier increase in the construction share of employment from 1990 to 2000 doesn't
help predict the problems of the Great Recession. An interpretation of that fact is the overbuilding was
not a problem through 2000 and it was only the further increases after 2000 that needed to be
corrected by the Great Recession.

For the severity variable, depth times length, it is the information employment share that has the largest
beta-coefficient, but with a negative sign. The negative sign applies to all the other coefficients on the
Information employment variables. In words, a small and declining information share predicts greater
length, depth and severity. This is the opposite of the 2001 recession results. It could be that the job
losses caused by the technological innovations were mostly suffered before the Great Recession when
Tech helped make the recession shallow and short.

Conclusion
The basic goal of macroeconomics should be to help formulate policies that would make the behavior of
the economy better and fairer. It isn't exactly news that overbuilding of homes in the period from 2001
to 2006 laid the foundation for many of the problems that emerged before and during the Great
Recession, an idea that this data analysis has supported. The best policy probably would have been the
choice of interest rates by the Fed in 2003-2005 that were high enough to cool off the housing bubble.
The Fed's unwise low interest rate policy did much harm to many US communities, while the corrective
actions taken by the Fed and the US government during and after the Great Recession mostly saved the
complicit financial sector on Wall Street but left Main Street floundering with foreclosures and lost jobs
in construction. This damage was concentrated on the lowest-income home owners and the
communities they lived in, and also on communities where home construction collapsed, ending jobs for
many low-income high-school graduates.

During the first eight recessions, public policy might have focused on making the first stroke of the
recession V flatter and the second stroke steeper with a focus on manufacturing, especially durables,
and housing. An appropriate treatment during the recession second stroke would be low interest rates
to stimulate demand for durables. (The interest rate is the "price" of durables.) A policy that might
have made the first stroke flatter would be higher interest rates late in expansions to prevent
overbuilding of durables. However, when the shape of the manufacturing durables recession turned
from V to L, public policy needed to be completely reformulated and focused on smoothing the decline
of manufacturing jobs and on helping out the affected communities.

The role of declining manufacturing jobs in making our recessions deeper and longer lasting has not to
my knowledge had the attention of housing, though housing too has been neglected and in 2005 I chose
the wake-up title "Housing IS the business cycle." The long-term decline in manufacturing jobs from
over 30% of jobs in 1950 to about 8% today has eliminated many of the best jobs for high school
graduates, and devastated many communities around the United States. This decline in jobs was
caused by a combination of technology, globalization and low savings. Process improvements in
manufacturing have continuously increased worker productivity which means fewer manufacturing

                                                                                                        12
workers unless that force is offset by a combination of population growth and product innovations.
Globalization which integrates high-wage countries with low-wage countries shifts the labor-intensive
manufacturing work to the low-wage countries, leaving the high-wage countries with fewer
manufacturing jobs. In addition, a country with a low savings rate needs a real exchange rate that is
high enough to create an external deficit large enough to close the gap between savings and investment.
This can shift the workforce out of the tradables sector into the nontradable service sector work: fewer
manufacturing jobs and more restaurant work. The biggest public policy contributor to this outcome is
probably the large deficit run by the Federal Government. Policies to increase national saving like tax
breaks to encourage more savings for retirement would help out, but the fundamental technological
and globalization forces cannot be reversed.

Though economists have been taught to favor free trade, and most do, many economists may not
realize that international trade can have winners and losers, and the right way to endorse free trade is
to accompany the support for free trade with some thoughtful way to help the individuals, families and
communities that are harmed by free trade. The United States has completely neglected these
communities, and the people who remain have there been voting enthusiastically to end American
democracy.

In conclusion, there is substantial evidence that the behavior of job shares in construction and
manufacturing predicted the length, depth and severity of the last two recessions. The regressions that
are used to support this conclusion have rather low R-squares, which means that there is a lot more
than just manufacturing and construction that matter, and it remains to be seen if the results in all these
regressions would be upended if other variables are included.

All this is looking backward but the negative secular trend in manufacturing may be at an end, in which
case what we learned about the last three recessions may not tell us much about future ones.
