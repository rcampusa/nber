                                          ABSTRACT

We examine the correlation between gender and bureaucratic corruption using two distinct
datasets, one from Italy and a second from China. In each case, we find that women are far less
likely to be investigated for corruption than men. In our Italian data, female procurement officials
are 34 percent less likely than men to be investigated for corruption by enforcement authorities;
in China, female prefectural leaders are as much as 75 percent less likely to be arrested for
corruption than men. While these represent correlations (rather than definitive causal effects),
both are very robust relationships, which survive the inclusion of fine-grained individual and
geographic controls.

I       Introduction
     There exists a very long literature on the relative probity of women versus men, and
a distinct body of work on whether women govern differently from men.1 A natural ­
and important ­ point of intersection is whether women are more corrupt than men when
put in a position of public trust.
      In this paper we show that, for officials in two very distinct settings at two very
different levels of government/bureaucracy, women are far less likely to be suspected of
or arrested for corruption. We employ two very different datasets obtained for distinct
research agendas to study the association between gender and corruption. Our first
dataset includes the universe of Italian officials who presided over at least one procurement
auction during 16 years. The second is a dataset of all Chinese bureaucrats who held the
position of prefecture mayor or party secretary during 1979-2014 years. For our Italian
data, we know whether the official has ever been flagged as suspected of corruption by any
of the country's enforcement authorities. For our Chinese data, we observe whether an
official has been arrested for corruption. Our data thus come from officials from distinct
geographies, cultures, political systems and at very different levels in the bureaucracy.
    In both cases, we find far lower corruption rates among women relative to their
male counterparts. In our Italian data, for men and women working within the same
procurement authority women are 34 percent less likely to be investigated for corruption
by enforcement authorities. In our Chinese data, female prefecture leaders are as much
as 75 percent less likely to have been arrested for corruption than men. In both cases,
we include fine-grained fixed effects to account for regional or demographic differences.
      While as we noted at the outset that gender and ethics is well-traveled ground
(Rosenbaum et al., 2014; Kennedy et al., 2017), we bring what we believe to be some
new and potentially important facts to the topic. Most notably, research on gender and
honesty has tended to emphasize two fundamental explanations for gender differences in
how individuals respond to ethical dilemmas: socialization versus social roles (Franke et
al., 1997). According to the former view, gender-specific moral compasses develop due to
differences in socialization during formative years, whereas the latter attributes gender
differences to the distinct roles that men and women generally play in society. If social
roles were the dominant explanation, one might expect gender differences to be muted for
men and women working in the same field or occupation. Our results suggest that gender
differences persist. Selection may similarly mute any gender differences in corruption for
    1
     See Rosenbaum et al. (2014) a survey of research on gender and honesty, and Jacobsen et al. (2018)
for a summary of economics-focused work on the topic. For gender-based differences in how politicians
govern, see Ferreira and Gyourko (2014) for a study of U.S. mayors, and Pande and Ford (2012) for a
survey of studies based on gender quotas (including the classic work of Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004))


                                                  1
individuals holding comparable positions, even if, as suggested by some prior work, men
and women approach ethical questions differently on average.
     We also observe that the literature is far from conclusive on the question of gender
differences in ethics. While some surveys suggest that the preponderance of evidence
indicates higher ethical standards for women, many papers do not find any gender dif-
ference. The difficulty in publishing null results certainly raises concerns of a file drawer
problem. Furthermore, most findings on gender differences in probity tend to be based on
laboratory experiments, often with student populations. From the perspective of under-
standing any relationship between gender and actual corruption (as opposed to behavior
in the lab or survey responses) our paper focuses on highly relevant populations, and
looks at the ultimate outcome of interest, the actual abuse of public office for private
gain.
     There does exist a small literature on gender and government corruption. Some prior
work studies whether country-level differences of female representation in government
correlate with corruption perception indices (Dollar et al., 2001; Swamy et al., 2001),
though these findings have the natural concern of omitted country-level attributes. A
second body of work shows that in surveys, women are more likely to express disapproval
of bribery and less likely to respond that they had engaged in bribery themselves. Given
that the surveys have no payoff consequences, these findings may be explained by social
desirability bias, which plausibly differs between men and women.
     Finally, two papers look at the corruption of male versus female political leaders
exploiting random assignment from quotas in India (Afridi et al., 2017) and quasi-
experimental assignment exploiting close elections in Brazil (Brollo and Troiano, 2016).
The evidence from India uses the same variation as the classic study of Chattopadhyay
and Duflo (2004) based on the requirement in West Bengal that villages have a female
leader. This requirement was done at random, rotating among villages with a third
treated at a time. In treated villages, survey respondents reported lower corruption.
Once again, these findings rely on survey responses; furthermore, the study's design nec-
essarily conflates turnover with gender. Brollo and Troiano (2016) combines data from
Brazil's random municipal audits (Ferraz and Finan, 2008) with election results from
close mixed-gender races, and reports a lower number of corruption cases for female-led
municipalities. However, once one limits the sample to mixed-gender close elections, the
sample size is very small (161 observations), and sensitive to the choice of specification.
    We bring a number of key contributions to this literature. First, we show that for
two large and diverse populations of bureaucrats, there is a far lower rate of observed
corruption among women. As with Brollo and Troiano (2016), we use real measures of
corruption, which are detailed in the next section, sidestepping at least some concerns


                                             2
of response bias. And in contrast to the sizeable collection of lab experiments, we cap-
ture gender differences which combine the effects of selection and any underlying gender
difference in values; this combined effect may be most relevant for policy, to understand
whether, conditional on reaching a particular position, women behave more or less cor-
ruptly than men. The populations we examine are also of note, as they involve very
different cultural and political environments, and officials at vastly different positions in
their respective hierarchies. While our data were chosen opportunistically as a result of
data availability, the fact that we find a clear gender gap in corruption in both datasets
suggests that we may be able to generalize from the patterns that we observe to other
settings.
     It is also important to note the limitations of our analysis upfront. We do not
offer any causal identification on whether a randomly selected woman is more dishon-
est/corrupt than a randomly selected man. As noted previously, however, that may not
be the most relevant policy question, since we may be interested in the combined effects
of selection and underlying differences.2 And in this paper we are unable to comment
on why women are less corrupt. We do not, for example, distinguish between underlying
preferences for corruption versus opportunities to accept bribes (for example, because
women are less connected to networks of exchange, as in Fang and Huang (2017)). The
magnitude of our effects suggests, at a minimum, that the topic deserves deeper consid-
eration.
     Throughout the rest of the paper we will proceed with two parallel sets of analyses.
We describe our Chinese and Italian datasets in Section II and in Section III we provide
regression results for both settings. Section IV concludes.


II      Data

II.A      Data on Chinese prefectural leaders
     Our sample of Chinese officials takes the data of Fisman and Wang (2017) as its
starting point. This dataset includes the identities and characteristics (based on offi-
cials' resumes) of mayors and prefecture-level party secretaries who started their posts
during the years 1979-2014. The identities were originally extracted from provincial year-
   2
     The results we report suggest that, all else equal on observables, women may be better suited to
tasks that involve a risk of corruption or malfeasance. We would not be the first to reach this conclusion.
In 1999 the newly installed Mexico City police chief handed over ticket-writing authority to female
officers because, "I trust them" not to take bribes. See, for example, Joseph Treaster, "The World:
Equal Opportunity in Mexico City; Counting on Women to Be More Honest Than Men," The New York
Times, August 15, 1999.



                                                    3
books and the official website of the People's Daily, People.cn; additional information on
politicians' qualifications and career trajectories was derived from resumes accessed via
baike.Baidu.com, which is similar to Wikipedia for China (see Fisman and Wang (2017)
for more details). We use the cutoff of 1979 as it is the year of transition from Mao
to Deng. The sample includes a total of 3133 officials across 289 prefectures. In addi-
tion to information on gender, the data also include information on education and, for
approximately 84 percent of officials, their place of birth.
      For this sample, we identify politicians that are publicly investigated for corruption.
Note that investigation, arrest, and conviction are essentially synonymous in the Chinese
context and we use the terms somewhat interchangeably; this is very different from the
Italian setting we describe below. The vast majority of the cases in our data were launched
under the anti-corruption crackdown of Party Secretary Xi Jinping, which was initiated
at the beginning of 2013. Almost our entire sample had already reached the position
of mayor or higher by the time the anticorruption campaign was launched. Thus, the
officials we study were already quite high up in the hierarchy ­ with opportunities for
bribe extraction. And since the campaign was entirely unanticipated, officials likely felt
they could act with greater impunity during most of the period we study.
     The list of officials targeted with investigation comes from http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/scdc/,
the official website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China's top anti-
corruption authority. Of the 3133 officials in our initial sample, 235 (7.5 percent) have
been investigated for corruption. That vast majority of these investigations ­ 209 of the
235 total ­ took place under Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. In some specifica-
tions we will focus exclusively on these 209 post-2013 investigations as our measure of
corruption. Finally, in some specifications we will limit our analysis to the 1878 officials
who started a new position as mayor or party secretary 1998 or later. This year is a
natural cutoff, as it is the beginning of the 5-year Central Committee term, and because
the anticorruption crackdown targeted recently active officials. In practice, 208 of the 209
individuals targeted by Xi's campaign are included in this post-1998 subsample (results
are identical if we use an earlier or later cutoff).
     In Table 1, Panel A we show summary statistics for the full sample, while panel B
provides summary statistics for the set of leaders that held positions starting 1998 or later
(and thus were vulnerable to Xi's anti-corruption campaign). As expected, the fraction
of women leaders is higher for the more recent sample (5.3 versus 3.8 percent); corruption
investigations are also far higher (11.7 versus 7.5 percent) ­ as noted earlier, all but one
of Xi's arrests in our sample are from individuals starting positions 1998 or later.
     The Table also provides the differences in means for male versus female leaders
(the p-values in the final column are calculated using heteroskedasticity-robust standard


                                             4
errors). In the full sample, men are more than twice as likely as women to have been
arrested (significant at the 10 percent level). However, this may understate the difference,
as women are represented at a much higher rate in the post-1998 sample when corruption
arrests primarily took place. When we limit the sample to this later period, the male-
female gap widens to a three-fold difference (significant at the 5 percent level). It is
also of note that in the post-1998 sample men and women are better balanced on other
basic observables ­ in particular age is quite similar in the post-1998 sample; women are
still more educated than their male counterparts, which may suggest a higher bar for
promotion for women.


II.B      Data on Italian Procurement Officials
     Our data draw on the same sources as Decarolis et al. (2019), a study of corruption
in Italian procurement. These data include all road and building procurement auctions
in Italy between 2000 and 2016, with a value of at least e40,000. These data include the
identity of the contracting officer overseeing each contract (the "Responsabile Unico del
Procedimento", or RUP) and her social security record, from which we can identify gender,
municipality of birth and age. Crucially, we are also able to link these individuals to the
Sistema D'Indagine Interforze (SDI) archive, which is a primary source of information
that police officers and intelligence agencies use to identify potential targets for further
investigation. The SDI is managed by Italy's internal intelligence and security agency,
AISI, and contains reports of all individuals investigated by any of the Italian police
forces: state police (Polizia di Stato ), finance police (Guardia di Finanza ), military police
(Carabinieri ), and environmental police (Guardia Forestale ).
     An entry in the SDI database typically occurs after a police force, based on a pre-
liminary investigation, determines that there is sufficient evidence to open a formal in-
vestigation. This investigation might or might not lead to a court case and, if so, to a
conviction. Therefore, court cases are a strict subset of the entries in the SDI database.
The resulting sample of suspect offenders thus includes individuals that were convicted,
acquitted, or never charged. The latter two groups plausibly comprise a large number of
offenders whose guilt could not be proven in court. Indeed, corruption cases are generally
complex, and convictions relatively rare, particularly in Italy.3 Thus our Italian database
is far more conclusive than standard measures of corruption based on convictions. For
each RUP in our dataset, AISI searched the SDI database for any investigation in the
following crime categories: corruption, malfeasance and embezzlement; abuse of power
and undue influence; and violations in public auctions.
   3
   A court case can only be initiated if there is direct proof of a kickback received by an official (either
monetary or some other form of benefit such as hiring of a relative.)

    The interested reader may consult the data section of Decarolis et al. (2019) for more
details on the SDI database.
    In Table 2, we show summary statistics for the full sample of analysis as well as a
comparison of the characteristics of female versus male RUPs.4 The first thing to note is
that men are almost twice as likely as women to have been investigated. In contrast to
what we observed in our Chinese data, here we do note substantial gender differences
on a number of characteristics: women are on average 6 years younger, they are more
prevalent in the North and they are less likely to be RUP in the same region or same
municipality of birth, relative to males. Because of these differences, we will present
some saturated specifications that include fixed effects for municipality, year of birth,
and number of contracts managed by a RUP in our dataset.


III      Results

III.A      Evidence from arrests of Chinese prefectural leaders
     In this section we study whether gender is correlated with top municipal leaders'
arrests for corruption, primarily under Xi Jinping's anticorruption campaign. We employ
variants on the following specification:



  Investigatedi = 1  F emalei + 2  EducationControlsi + p(i) + StartCohorti +                      i



      for politician i, where p(i) is a set of fixed effects for the province p that the official
first appeared as a public official in our data, StartCohorti is a set of 7 fixed effects for
each 5 years starting in 1979 to capture the first date that a politician appears in our
dataset, EducationControlsi is a set of indicator variables for bachelor's, master's, and
doctoral degrees (no college is the omitted category), and i is the error term (we use
robust standard errors throughout).
     In column (1) we present results including only start year fixed effects, to account
for the fact that women are vastly under-represented in the earlier part of the sample
when few corruption arrests took place (Table 1 includes the simple difference in means
for the full sample). The coefficient of -0.068 (significant at the 1 percent level) indicates
that, after accounting for the start date, women are 6.8 percentage points less likely to
be arrested for corruption than males who started during the same 5-year period. The
   4
   Given that a RUP might hold positions in different municipalities, an observation in our dataset is
a RUP-by-procurement authority; in practice, moving across municipalities is relatively rare.



                                                  6
inclusion of province fixed effects in column (2) has no appreciable impact on the estimate;
the inclusion of individual controls increases the magnitude of the female effect to -
0.078. (The correlation with age is near-mechanical, and results from the fact that more
recent cohorts of officials were more likely to have been targeted by Xi's anticorruption
campaign.)
     In the remaining columns we limit the sample to officials who started a new position
as a municipal leader in 1998 or later. As observed earlier, the arrest rate for these newer
politicians is much higher (12 percent). In this subsample the coefficient on Female
increases in magnitude, to -0.091. Given a mean arrest rate among males in this sample
of 12.1 percent, our point estimate implies that men are four times more likely to have
been arrested than women. In column (4) we add fixed effects for five year age cohorts
(based on age in 2018); the point estimate on Female is largely unchanged. In Appendix
Table A.1 we repeat these analyses focusing on arrests that occurred as part of Xi's post-
2013 anti-corruption crackdown. The coefficients on F emale are essentially unchanged.


III.B     Evidence from investigations of Italian procurement offi-
          cials
     We proceed in much the same manner as in the preceding subsection, subject to dif-
ferences in the data structure and availability of covariates. Most importantly, the dataset
on Italian procurement officials is vastly larger than that of the preceding section, and the
fact that we observe multiple procurement officials per contracting authority (generally
municipalities) means that we may have fine-grained fixed effects to compare the conduct
of women and men within a relatively narrow geography (the median municipality has a
population of 7000).
    Our main specification takes the form:

InvestigatedRU Pi = F emalei + RU P Controlsi + P AControlspa(i) + reg(i,t) + pa(i) + i

for RUP i working in procurement authority pa(i). The year t captures the year a
RUP first appears in our dataset, and in the first column, we provide results that in-
clude 340 region-year fixed-effects reg(i,t) to account non-parametrically for time-varying
geographic differences in corruption as well as female representation in procurement po-
sitions. The point estimate on F emale is -0.036 (significant at the 1 percent level),
indicating that female RUPs are about half as likely to be investigated for corruption as
their male counterparts. The inclusion of PA and individual RUP controls in columns
(2) and (3) reduces the F emale coefficient to -0.030 and -0.027 respectively, and adding


                                             7
PA fixed effects in column (4) further reduces it to -0.021 (still significant at the 1 per-
cent level). The point estimate on age is positive; while on the face of it this appears
to contrast with the pattern in China its interpretation here is also straightforward ­ an
older official will have had more time and opportunities to have been investigated for
corruption or other crimes. In column (5) we provide a saturated regression that includes
fixed effects for birth year and also for number of contracts overseen by i. These further
controls do not affect the point estimate on F emale. In the final column, we repeat the
specification from column (4), limiting the sample to municipalities, which serves to ex-
clude administrations that do not map to a specific local geography such as educational
institutions, hospitals, and public companies dealing with the management of motorway
sections under concession. The point estimate is very similar to the full sample results.


IV      Conclusion
     The goal of this paper is straightforward: to document a very sizeable and robust
difference in rates of corruption investigations between men and women, for two very dif-
ferent populations of public officials. We cannot, with the data available to us, delve into
the underlying reasons for these differences, but the very large effect sizes we document
suggest that it is well worthwhile delving into the underlying mechanisms that generate
the gender gap in bureaucratic corruption.
     As we observe in the introduction, part of the explanation may lie in differences
in socialization of men versus women, and resultant differences in probity. We observe,
however, that findings in this literature are mixed. Some prior work also argues that
even in the presence of gender differences in the population overall, men and women
in comparable roles should exhibit similar behaviors; our findings would seem to argue
against that view.
     There are various candidate explanations ­ none mutually exclusive from one another
­ that warrant further study. The most basic explanations are based on gender differences
in preferences. Women may have a greater taste for probity, as we emphasized at the
outset, or a greater aversion to risk (e.g., Borghans et al. (2009)). Differential enforcement
may also play a role. Though we are skeptical that leniency toward female bureaucrats
could explain the very large differences we observe. Differential selection may also offer
an explanation. It is easier to see how this could play a role in our Italian data, where
the position of municipal procurement officer is relatively desirable for women versus men
(given their outside options), and thus may attract higher-quality female candidates. We
note, however, that earlier work finds no correlation between mental acuity and honesty
(Hanna and Wang, 2017), so selection based on quality is not immediately obvious. The

                                              8
same argument may suggest gender differences in incentives: given their lesser outside
opportunities, efficiency wage arguments may explain why women behave more honestly.
One challenge to both incentive- and selection-based explanations is the consistent finding
across both datasets ­ the officials we study in China are already high level officials, and
if anything incentives for good behavior would be stronger for male city leaders, as they
plausibly have stronger chances for promotion. Finally, men may simply have more
opportunities for promotion, to the extent that corruption involves favor exchange that
requires a network of co-conspirators. If women are less connected to such networks Fang
and Huang (2017), they may have fewer opportunities for corruption.
     We leave for future work the much larger enterprise of explaining the large gender
differences in corruption that we document in this paper.

 Notes:The dependent variable, Investigated is an indicator equal to 1 is the public official in
charge of the auction (the RUP) has been investigated. The analysis is conducted on a panel
of RUP-PA observations. PA Controls include a set of dummies for the type of PA (Central,
Region and other local authority, Hospitals and Universities, Transportations), the total number
of auctions done by the PA (in log) during the sample period, the total number of RUPs observed
in the PA (in log) during the sample period, and the total number of auctions managed by the
RUP (in log). Individual Controls include the age (in log), an indicator for whether the RUPwas
born in the same city where she operates as RUP, and a set of dummies for the region of birth
of the RUP. Robust standard errors clustered at the RUP level are in parentheses.Significance:

 p < 0.1, p < 0.05, p < 0.01.
