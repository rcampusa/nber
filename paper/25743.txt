                                        ABSTRACT

Farmer and Nicolò (2018) show that the Farmer Monetary (FM)- model outperforms the three-
equation New-Keynesian (NK)-model in post war U.S. data. In this paper, we compare the
marginal data density of the FM-model with marginal data densities for determinate and
indeterminate versions of the NK-model for three separate samples using U.S., U.K. and
Canadian data. We estimate versions of both models that restrict the parameters of the private
sector equations to be the same for all three countries. Our preferred specification is the
constrained version of the FM-model which has a marginal data density that is more than 40 log
points higher than the NK alternative. Our findings also demonstrate that cross-country
macroeconomic differences are well explained by the different shocks that hit each economy and
by differences in the ways in which national central banks reacted to those shocks.

   Some International Evidence for Keynesian Economics
               Without the Phillips Curve∗


              By Roger E.A. Farmer†                              Giovanni Nicolò‡


           Farmer and Nicolò (2018) show that the Farmer Monetary (FM)-
          model outperforms the three-equation New-Keynesian (NK)-model
          in post war U.S. data. In this paper, we compare the marginal
          data density of the FM-model with marginal data densities for de-
          terminate and indeterminate versions of the NK-model for three
          separate samples using U.S., U.K. and Canadian data. We es-
          timate versions of both models that restrict the parameters of the
          private sector equations to be the same for all three countries. Our
          preferred specification is the constrained version of the FM-model
          which has a marginal data density that is more than 40 log points
          higher than the NK alternative. Our findings also demonstrate that
          cross-country macroeconomic differences are well explained by the
          different shocks that hit each economy and by differences in the
          ways in which national central banks reacted to those shocks.



                                        I.    Introduction

  The Phillips curve (Phillips, 1958) was introduced into macroeconomics in the
1960s as a way of endogenising prices in the IS-LM framework that John Hicks
(1937) and Alvin Hansen (1936) had developed to popularize Keynes’ General
Theory (Keynes, 1936). The Phillips curve, and its modern variant, the New-
Keynesian (NK) Phillips curve (Galı́, 2008), have fallen out of favour in recent
years (Farmer, 2013, 2016) as unemployment has fallen to record low levels with
no apparent resurgence of either wage or price inflation.
  In a recent paper presented at the 9th Manchester Conference on Growth and
Business Cycles in Theory and Practice, Farmer presented empirical evidence
(Farmer and Nicolò, 2018) in favour of an alternative to the New-Keynesian
model.1 This alternative, the Farmer Monetary Model (FM-Model), replaces the
NK-Phillips curve with a belief function. The FM-model originated in Farmer

(2012) and is further developed in Farmer and Platonov (2019). The belief func-
tion is a concept that was introduced in Farmer (1993) as a way of closing models
that would otherwise be indeterminate. Farmer (2016) argues that the belief
function should be accorded the same methodological status as preferences and
technology.
   Macroeconomic data among advanced economies show distinct cross-country
differences. These differences could potentially be attributed to one of three
causes. First: Private sector saving rates or private sector risk aversion parame-
ters may differ. Second: The size and sequence of the shocks that each country
experienced might vary (Sims and Zha, 2006; Primiceri, 2005). Finally, insti-
tutions, such as the central bank, in each country could operate differently and
respond to macroeconomic shocks by adopting distinct monetary policies (Clarida
et al., 2000; Lubik and Schorfheide, 2004; Canova and Gambetti, 2009).
   In this paper, we ask: Why do the data look different across countries? We
focus on three advanced economies: the United States, the United Kingdom and
Canada. To explain the observed differences in the macroeconomic behaviour
of real GDP, the inflation rate and the yields on 3-month Treasury securities,
we compare the FM-model (Farmer, 2012), closed with a belief function, with
the New-Keynesian model, closed with the NK-Phillips curve.2 In line with the
findings of Farmer and Nicolò (2018), we show that the FM-model outperforms
the NK-model on U.S., U.K. and Canadian data. Considering all three countries,
the FM-model has a marginal data density that exceeds the best performing NK
specification by a considerable margin.
   To identify the reasons for differences in the data among the United States,
the United Kingdom and Canada, we estimated two alternative specifications of
the FM-model and the NK-models over the full sample, from 1961Q1 to 2007Q4,
and over two sub-samples corresponding to the break in U.S. monetary policy in
1979Q3. For our first specification, we estimated a version of the FM- and NK-
models in which we allowed the private sector, the conduct of monetary policy and
the size of the fundamental shocks to differ across countries. For our second spec-
ification, we estimated restricted versions of each model in which we constrained
the private sector equations to have common parameters across countries.
   For both the NK- and the FM-model, we found strong evidence in favour of the
constrained specification in which the parameters of the private sector equations
were restricted to be the same in all three countries. We conclude that cross-
country macroeconomic differences were caused by differences in the shocks that
hit each economy and that the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada
conducted distinct monetary policies in response to these shocks.
   In our previous work, we used a version of the Taylor Rule (Taylor, 1999) to
model the central bank reaction function and, as in the paper by Lubik and

   2 Farmer (Farmer, 2012) introduced the FM-model to explain persistent high unemployment. Farmer
and Platonov (2019) explain the relationship between the FM-model and alternative interpretations of
the textbook IS-LM model (Mankiw, 2010) on which modern New-Keynesian models are based.

Schorfheide (2004), we allowed for the Taylor Rule to be either active or passive
(Leeper, 1991). We follow that same approach in our current work and in line with
our previous findings for the U.S. case (Farmer and Nicolò, 2018), we find that the
FM-model is indeterminate in both sub-periods. Moreover, while our preferred
specification for the NK-model also found indeterminacy in both sub-periods, the
FM-model outperforms the NK-model in the U.S., U.K. and Canadian data in
the full sample estimates and in both sub-samples.

  The data used for our study are plotted in Figures 1, 2 and 3. For each country,
we used three time series for the period from 1961Q1 through 2007Q4.3 The initial
date is constrained by data availability, and the ending date is chosen to coincide
with the onset of the Great Recession.4

for the three countries and Figure 3 presents the 3-month yields on the Treasury
Securities issued by the public sector in each country.
   Visual inspection of Figure 2 suggests that there is a break in the behaviour
of inflation around 1980. For the case of the United States, this apparent break
is confirmed by structural break tests (Beyer and Farmer, 2007) which place the
date of the break as 1979Q3. This date coincides with the disinflation initiated
when Paul Volcker became Chairman of the Federal Reserve System.
   In line with earlier studies (Clarida et al., 2000; Lubik and Schorfheide, 2004;
Primiceri, 2005), we estimated the FM- and the NK- models over the full sample
as well as over two separate sub-samples. We ran constrained and unconstrained
specifications of both models for the full sample and for both sub-samples. Our
first sub-sample runs from 1961Q1 through 1979Q2. Our second sub-sample runs
from 1982Q4 to 2007Q4. We excluded the quarters from 1979Q3 through 1982Q3
because, over that period, the Fed explicitly targeted the growth rate of the money
supply, a policy rule that is inconsistent with our formulation of the central bank
reaction function which we model with a Taylor Rule (Taylor, 1999).

           III.   The Structural Forms of the FM- and NK-Models

  In our previous work (Farmer and Nicolò, 2018), we explained how the FM- and
NK-models differ. The reduced form of the FM-model is a Vector Error Correction
Model (VECM) which allows for non-stationary, but co-integrated behaviour of
the three observable variables. In contrast, the reduced form of the NK-model is
a conventional Vector-autoregression (VAR). For completeness, in section III, we
reproduce the argument from Farmer and Nicolò (2018, Section II).
  The FM- and the NK-models that we estimate in our empirical work have two
equations in common. One of these is a generalization of the NK IS curve that
arises from the Euler equation of a representative agent. The other is a policy rule
that describes how the Fed sets the fed funds rate. The two common equations
of our study are described below.

         A.   Two Equations that the FM- and NK-Models Share in Common

  We assume the log of potential real GDP grows at a constant rate that we
estimate for each country. Unlike our previous work (Farmer and Nicolò, 2018),
in our cross country analysis we estimated the trend growth of GDP in one step
by allowing the measurement equation in the Kalman filter to contain a trend.
We explain that process further in Section IV. The output gap is defined as the
difference between the estimated trend and the logarithm of the real GDP series
for each country.
  The FM-model implies that the output gap is non-stationary and cointegrated
with the CPI inflation rate and the federal funds rate. The NK-model implies
that the output gap is stationary. In Equations (1) and (2), yt is the difference
of the log of GDP from its estimated trend, Rt is the federal funds rate and πt
6                       A FARMER-NICOLÒ RESEARCH PAPER                                      JUNE 2019


is the CPI inflation rate. The term zd,t is a demand shock, zR,t is a policy shock
and zs,t is a supply shock.


(1) ayt − aEt (yt+1 ) + [Rt − Et (πt+1 )]
                               = η (ayt−1 − ayt + [Rt−1 − πt ]) + (1 − η)ρ + zd,t .



(2)              Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) [r̄ + λπt + µ (yt − zs,t )] + zR,t .

  Equation (1) is a generalization of the dynamic IS curve that appears in stan-
dard representations of the NK-model. In the special case when η = 0 this
equation can be derived from the Euler equation of a representative agent.5 The
shock zd,t represents a demand shifter of the IS curve and is assumed to follow
an autoregressive process of the form zd,t = ρd zd,t−1 + εd,t . The supply shock zs,t
also follows the autoregressive process, zs,t = ρs zs,t−1 + εs,t .
  Equation (2) is a Taylor Rule (Taylor, 1999) that represents the response of the
monetary authority to the lagged nominal interest rate, the inflation rate and the
output gap. The monetary policy shock, zR,t , denotes innovations to the nominal
interest rate caused by unpredictable actions of the monetary authority. The
parameters ρR , λ and µ are policy elasticities of the fed funds rate with respect
to the lagged fed funds rate, the inflation rate and the output gap.

               B.   Two Equations that Differentiate the FM- and NK-Models

    The third equation of the NK-model is given by

(3.a)                            πt = βEt [πt+1 ] + φ (yt − zs,t ) .

Here, β is the discount rate of the representative person and φ is a compound
parameter that depends on the frequency of price adjustment.6 Since β is ex-
pected to be close to one, we will impose the restriction β = 1 when discussing
the theoretical properties of the model. This restriction implies that the long-run
Phillips curve is vertical. If instead, β < 1, the NK-model has an upward slop-
ing long-run Phillips curve in inflation-output gap space. An extensive literature
derives the NK-Phillips curve from first principles, see for example Galı́ (2008),
    5 See for example Galı́ (2008), or Woodford (2003). An equation of this form for the general case when
η 6= 0 can be derived from a heterogeneous agent model (Farmer, 2018) where the lagged real interest
rate captures the dynamics of borrowing and lending between patient and impatient groups of people.
In the case when η = 0, the parameter a is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and
ρ is the time preference rate.
    6 In the NK-model, the discount parameter β that appears in the Phillips curve is related to the
                                                                  1
parameter ρ that appears in the IS curve by the identity β ≡ 1+ρ    . We did not impose that restriction
in our estimates. If we had imposed it, our results in favour of the FM-model would have been even
stronger since the restriction does not hold exactly in the estimates of the NK-model.

based on the assumption that frictions of one kind or another prevent firms from
quickly changing prices in response to changes in demand or supply shocks.
  In contrast to the NK-Phillips curve, the third equation of the FM-model is a
belief function. Following Farmer (1993, 2012), the functional form for the belief
function that we use in this study is described by Equation (3.b),

(3.b)                   Et [xt+1 ] = γxt + (1 − γ)Et−1 [xt ] ,

where xt ≡ πt +(yt − yt−1 ) is the growth rate of nominal GDP. The belief function
is a mapping from current and past observable variables to probability distribu-
tions over future economic variables and the functional form that we chose for
the belief function, captured by Equation (3.b), asserts that agents’ expectations
about future nominal GDP growth are adaptive.
   When we estimated the model, we found that the data strongly favour the
parameter restriction, γ = 1 and in Section V we report the estimates of the FM-
model under this restriction. When we incorporate this restriction into the belief
function, our model implies that beliefs about future nominal income growth
are equal to current nominal income growth. By modeling beliefs about future
nominal income growth as a new fundamental we resolve both dynamic and static
indeterminacy.
   In the FM-model, the monetary authority chooses whether changes in the cur-
rent growth rate of nominal GDP will cause changes in the expected inflation rate
or in the output gap. Importantly, these changes will be permanent. The belief
function, interacting with the policy rule, selects how demand and supply shocks
are distributed between permanent changes to the output gap, and permanent
changes to the expected inflation rate.

             C.   The Steady-State Properties of the FM- and NK-Models

   In this section, which reproduces our argument in Farmer and Nicolò (2018,
Section III), we compare the theoretical properties of the non-stochastic steady-
state equilibria of the NK and FM-models. The NK-model has a unique steady-
state equilibrium. The FM-model, in contrast, has a continuum of non-stochastic
steady-state equilibria. Which of these equilibria the economy converges to de-
pends on the initial condition of a system of dynamic equations. This property
is known as hysteresis.
   Rather than treat the multiplicity of steady state equilibria as a deficiency, as
is often the case in economics, we follow Farmer (1993) by defining a new fun-
damental, the belief function. When the model is closed in this way, equilibrium
uniqueness is restored and every sequence of shocks is associated with a unique
sequence of values for the three endogenous variables.
   We begin by shutting down shocks and describing the theoretical properties of
the steady-state of the NK-model. The values of the steady-state inflation rate,
interest rate and output gap in the NK-model are given by the following equations

When β < 1, the long-run Phillips curve, in output gap-inflation space, is upward
sloping. As β approaches 1, the slope of the long-run Phillips curve becomes
vertical and these equations simplify as follows,

                              (r̄ − ρ)
(4)                    π̄ =            ,   R̄ = ρ + π̄,       ȳ = 0.
                              (1 − λ)

  For this important special case, the steady state of the NK-model is defined by
Equations (4).
  Contrast this with the steady state of FM-model, which has only two steady
state equations to solve for three steady state variables. These are given by the
steady state version of the generalized dynamic IS curve, Equation (1), and the
steady state version of the Taylor Rule, Equation (2).
  The FM-model is closed with the belief function. In this paper, the specific
implementation of the belief function assumes that agents form adaptive expec-
tations about future nominal income growth. This equation does not provide
any additional information about the non-stochastic steady state of the model
because the same variable, steady-state nominal income growth, appears on both
sides of the equation.
  Solving the steady-state versions of equations (1) and (2) for π̄ and R̄ as a
function of ȳ delivers two equations to determine the three variables, π̄, R̄ and ȳ.

                              (r̄ − ρ)   µ

                              (1 − λ) (1 − λ)

The steady-state of the FM-model is under-determined because there are only
two equations to determine three variables. We refer to this property as static
indeterminacy. Static indeterminacy is a source of endogenous persistence that
enables the FM-model to match the high persistence of the unemployment rate
in data.
   In standard economic models, the approximate system that describes how the
variables evolve through time is a linear difference equation with a point attractor.
In the absence of stochastic shocks, the model economy converges asymptotically
to this point. In the FM-model the approximate system that describes how the
variables evolve through time is a linear difference equation with a one dimensional
line as its attractor. In the absence of stochastic shocks, the model economy
converges asymptotically to a point on this line; but which point it converges to
depends on the initial condition. The reduced form representation of the FM-
model is a VECM, as opposed to a VAR.
   An implication of the static indeterminacy of the FM-model is that policies
                               KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS                               9


that affect aggregate demand have permanent long-run effects on the output gap
and the unemployment rate. In contrast, the NK-model incorporates the Natural
Rate Hypothesis, a feature which implies that demand management policy cannot
affect real economic activity in the long-run.

              D.   The Dynamic Properties of the FM- and NK-Models

  In this section, which is reproduced from (Farmer and Nicolò, 2018, Section
IV), we discuss the dynamic properties of the FM-model and compare them with
the NK-model. For both models we study the special case of ρR = 0, and η = 0.
The first of these restrictions sets the response of the Fed to the lagged interest
rate to zero. The second restricts the IS curve to the representative agent case.
These restrictions allow us to generate, and compare, analytical expressions for
the Taylor Principle in both models.
  The special cases of Equations (1) and (2) are given by

(10 )              ayt = aEt (yt+1 ) − (Rt − Et (πt+1 )) + ρ + zd,t ,

and

(20 )                   Rt = r̄ + λπt + µ (yt − zs,t ) + zR,t .

   In the NK-model, the Taylor Principle directs the central bank to increase the
federal funds rate by more than one-for-one in response to an increase in the
inflation rate. When the Taylor Principle is satisfied, the dynamic equilibrium
of the NK-model is locally unique. When that property holds, we say that the
unique steady state is locally determinate (Clarida et al., 1999).
   When the central bank responds only to the inflation rate, the Taylor principle
is sufficient to guarantee local determinacy. When the central bank responds
to the output gap as well as to the inflation rate, a sufficient condition for the
NK-model to be locally determinate is that

                                       1−β
(6)                               λ+       µ > 1.
                                        φ

  For the FM-model, we refer to the analysis in Farmer and Nicolò (2018) which
shows that for the special case of logarithmic preferences, corresponding to the
parameter restriction a = 1, a sufficient condition for local determinacy in the
FM-model is,

                                       λ
(7)                                       > 1.
                                      λ−µ

This is the FM analog of the Taylor principle for this special case. When this
condition holds, each element of the set of steady state equilibria of the model is
10                      A FARMER-NICOLÒ RESEARCH PAPER                                    JUNE 2019


dynamically determinate.
  The form of the determinacy condition has no simple closed form for general
values of the parameters. We were, however, able to derive an analytic expres-
sion for the case when λ = µ. Here, the Taylor Principle requires the following
inequality to hold,7
                                                        λ
(8)                                          a<1+         .
                                                        2
Given our estimates of a, λ and µ in our previous study, we found that the
determinacy condition is violated in the U.S. data. Our current paper finds the
same result when we extend our analysis to include U.K. and Canadian data.
  The conjunction of static and dynamic indeterminacy provides two sources
of endogenous persistence. Static indeterminacy implies that the output gap
contains an I(1) component. Instead of converging to a point in interest-rate-
inflation-output gap space, the data converge to a one-dimensional linear mani-
fold. Dynamic indeterminacy implies that the fed funds rate, the inflation rate
and the unemployment rate display persistent deviations from this manifold.
  Dynamic indeterminacy allows the FM-model to explain why prices appear to
move slowly in data. In a model with fully flexible prices and a locally unique
equilibrium, current and expected future prices respond on impact to a monetary
shock to maintain a constant real interest rate. In the FM-model, where equilibria
are locally dynamically indeterminate, agents form self-fulfilling expectations that
generate a source of endogenous persistence in response to a monetary shock.8
  In contrast to the NK-model, prices are not sticky in the sense that there is
a cost or barrier to price adjustment. They are sticky because people believe,
correctly, that future prices will validate their decision to demand fewer goods
and services in response to an increase in the money interest rate.9

IV.         Estimating the FM- and NK-Models on U.S., U.K. and Canadian Data

  To estimate the parameters of the FM- and NK-models we used data on CPI
inflation rates and nominal interest rates and data on real GDP in levels. To
relate the theoretical model, which contains the output gap as a variable, we
specified a measurement equation that maps data on real GDP and a time trend

     7 In
        Farmer and Nicolò (2018) this inequality is mistakenly cited as a condition for indeterminacy.
     8We thank Martin Ellison (2018) for his discussion of our previous work (Farmer and Nicolò, 2018).
Ellison (2018) highlighted the role that the covariance terms between the sunspot shock, η2 , and the
exogenous shocks play in determining the dynamics of inflation. In our previous work, we assumed
that the sunspot shock was uncorrelated with fundamental disturbances, implying that prices were pre-
determined and could only respond with a lag to exogenous shocks. In contrast, the version of the FM-
model in Section IV allows us to estimate the covariance terms. This approach ensures that exogenous
disturbances could have a contemporaneous impact on inflation when the estimated covariance differs
from zero.
    9 The idea that indeterminacy can explain sticky prices was discussed in Farmer (1991) and developed
further in Farmer (1992) and Farmer (2000). See also Matheny (1998) and Benhabib and Farmer (2000).

into the theoretical concept, yt .

(9)                                 ytobs = (cy + gy t) + yt .

Here, cy and gy represent the intercept and the slope of a linear trend that char-
acterizes the data on real GDP (expressed in logs). Equation (9) implies that the
log of real GDP grows at a constant rate, and it defines the output gap as the
residual of a regression of the log of real GDP on a constant and a time trend.

   Because the FM-model is characterized by static indeterminacy, the intercept
terms in the growth regressions are not identified. To handle this problem, we cal-
ibrated the intercept terms using country-specific least-squares regressions, while
allowing the slope coefficients to be separately identified as part of the full model
estimation step.10 Table 1 records the values we obtained for this calibration and
Appendix B reports the calibrated values for cy when the models were estimated
over separate sub-samples.
   The FM- and NK-models are examples of structural Dynamic Stochastic Gen-
eral Equilibrium models and they each contain forward looking expectations in
the model equations. To estimate a model in this class, the model must first be
solved by computing its reduced form. To compute the reduced forms of the FM-
and NK-models, we applied the method developed in Bianchi and Nicolò (2017)
which can handle structural models that may have an arbitrary degree of inde-
terminacy. We estimated the parameters of the constrained and unconstrained
specifications of both models for the full sample and for the two sub-samples
using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, implemented in DYNARE (Ad-
jemian et al., 2011). Table 2 summarizes the prior distributions that we adopted.
The table reports the prior shape, mean, standard deviation and 90% probability
interval.
   We centered the prior for the slope parameter of the linear trend in the (loga-
rithm of) real GDP, gy , to 0.007, implying a 2.8% annualized growth rate and we
set the standard deviation of the supply shock, σs , to 0.1. We made this choice
because earlier studies found that the variance of supply shocks was higher in the
pre-Volcker sample as a consequence of two major oil-price shocks in the 1970s
(Primiceri, 2005; Sims and Zha, 2006).

   10 Calibrating c in this way corresponds to choosing a reference path for the output gap. By cali-
                   y
brating this parameter, we substantially improved the convergence of the model parameters during our
estimation.
12                  A FARMER-NICOLÒ RESEARCH PAPER                                    JUNE 2019


  Our priors for a, λ and µ place the FM-model in the indeterminacy region
of the parameter space. This is consistent with our exploratory estimates for
the U.S. data in which we compared posterior odds ratios for determinate and
indeterminate regions of the parameter space for the FM-model. We found that
the likelihood that the model parameters lie in the determinacy region for the
FM-model is zero.
  For the case of the NK-model, Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) found that the
U.S. data favour the indeterminacy region for the pre-Volcker sample and the
determinacy region for the post-Volcker sample. For this reason, we estimated
constrained and unconstrained versions of the NK-model for both regions of the
parameter space and we report all six sets of results.

  For the case of an indeterminate equilibrium, the Bianchi and Nicolò (2017)
method requires the researcher to reclassify one of the endogenous forecast er-
rors of the model as a new fundamental. In our estimates we selected a unique
equilibrium by choosing the forecast error

                                 η2,t ≡ πt − Et−1 [πt ],

to play the role of a new fundamental. We denote the standard deviation of
                                      KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS                                              13


this new fundamental shock by ση2 and we specify new parameters to represent
the covariance of η2,t with the other fundamental shocks in the model. These
parameters are represented by the symbols ρx,η2 where x = {R, d, s}.11 When
these covariance terms are non-zero, all of the shocks may have a contemporaneous
impact on inflation by affecting the expectations that agents have about expected
future prices.12

                              V.    A Discussion of our Results

   In this section, we ask if the cross-country data can be explained by a model
in which the private sector equations are restricted to be the same across coun-
tries and we compare posterior marginal data densities for three different sample
periods and for eighteen alternative models.
   For the full sample, and for each sub-sample, we estimated constrained and
unconstrained versions of the FM-model. We compared our parameter estimates
with those obtained by estimating constrained and unconstrained versions of the
NK-model in both the determinate and indeterminate regions of the parameter
space. In all cases, the constrained FM-model outperformed all alternative spec-
ifications of the NK-model by a considerable margin.
   For the FM-model, the parameters of the private sector equations consist of the
degree of risk aversion, the discount parameter, and the persistence parameter η.
For the NK-model the parameter set also includes the parameters of the NK-
Phillips curve. For the constrained specifications of each model, we restricted all
of the private sector parameters to be the same across countries.
   In Model 1, Fully unrestricted, we estimated all the parameters of the FM-model
separately for each country. In Model 2, Constrained, we allowed the parameters
of the policy rule and the shock processes to vary across countries, while we
constrained the parameters associated with the private sector to be common. We
found that for both models, we could not reject the restrictions that the private
sector parameters are the same across all three countries. We report these findings
in Table 3.A.
   The logarithms of the marginal data densities were computed using Geweke’s
(1999) modified Harmonic mean estimator. Unlike a standard likelihood ratio
statistic, the marginal data density penalizes a model that is over-parameterized.
It is possible, as we find in this instance, that a restricted model can have a
higher posterior probability than an unrestricted model. In three of the model
comparisons that we report in Table 3.A, the constrained model outperforms the
unconstrained model by more than 5 log points.

   11 For the methodology behind our estimation procedure the reader is referred to Farmer et al. (2015)
and Bianchi and Nicolò (2017). These papers establish that, as long as the covariance terms are unre-
stricted, choosing η2 as a new fundamental is equivalent to the choice of η1,t ≡ yt − Et−1 [yt ]. There is
a one-to-one transformation that maps one representation of the model into the other.
   12 We direct the readers to footnote 8 and Ellison (2018) for a more in-depth discussion of the role of
the covariance terms in determining the dynamics of the inflation rate.

  Tables 3.B and 3.C report log data densities from the estimation of the NK-
model under indeterminacy and determinacy, respectively. For both tables, we
report the results for the constrained and unconstrained specifications for the full
sample and for both sub-samples. We see from comparing the columns of Table
3.B and Table 3.C that in five of six possible comparisons, the log data density
of the constrained NK-model, reported in the right-column, is larger than the log
data density for the unconstrained NK-model, reported in the left column. The
one exception was the indeterminacy specification for the full sample in which the
unconstrained model fared better than its constrained counterpart.
  Our most important finding comes from comparing the values of the log data
density in Table 3.A, which represents the FM-model, with the corresponding en-
tries in Tables 3B and 3C, which represent the NK-model for specifications that

restrict the parameters to be in the indeterminacy region, Table 3.B, or the deter-
minacy region, Table 3.C. Here we see that for all the sample periods considered,
each specification of the FM model is preferred to the corresponding version of
the NK model. Moreover, when we can compare the largest entries for the FM
model with the largest entries for the determinate and indeterminate versions
of the NK model, the FM model has a marginal data density that outperforms
the best NK alternative by 46 log points for the full sample, 8 log points for the
pre-Volcker sample and 140 log points for the post-Volcker sample. These results
are in line with the findings in Farmer and Nicolò (2018) for the U.S. case.
  We next turn to detailed parameter estimates for the full sample FM-model
which we report in Table 4A. Sub-sample parameter estimates for this model are
contained in Appendix B.

  Our estimates of the relative risk aversion parameter, a = 5.8 and the time pref-
erence parameter, ρ = 0.026 are in line with previous studies of these parameters
in U.S. data. Our estimate of the parameter η = 0.92 is significantly different
from 0 which indicates that the data strongly prefer our generalized version of the
IS curve over the conventional representative agent version in which it is equal to
0. The fact that we find a non-zero value for this parameter is not particularly
surprising and is consistent with previous estimates of the NK-model in which
researchers often include richer dynamics in the IS curve by allowing for habit
formation preferences.
  In Table 4.B we report the posterior mean and 90% probability interval for
the country-specific model parameters for the FM-model. The first block of this
table represents our cross-country estimates of the parameters of the Taylor Rule.
The parameter r̄ is the constant in the Taylor Rule, ρR is the coefficient on the
lagged interest rate, and λ and µ represent the inflation rate and output gap
response coefficients. Although these parameters display qualitative similarities,
they are statistically different across countries. For example, the posterior mean
of the Canadian central bank interest rate response coefficient, ρR , is equal to
0.62 which is outside of the 90% confidence bounds for the same coefficient in the
United States or the United Kingdom.
  The Taylor Rule coefficients on inflation are all above 1 which would indicate
that the equilibrium in each country are determinate if we were estimating the
NK-model. But this is not the relevant test for indeterminacy. Instead, the
determinacy condition for the FM model is a complicated function that involves

not only the parameters of the Taylor Rule, but also the parameters of the IS
curve. The relevant condition is that the risk aversion parameter a, must be
small relative to λ and µ. For our estimated values of a = 5.8, λ less than 1.6 and
µ between 0.25 and 0.6, we found that the FM version of the Taylor Principle is
violated for all three countries.

  The second block of rows of Table 4B reports estimates of the growth rates and
the auto-correlation parameters ρd and ρs . The U.K. quarterly growth rate is
estimated to be 0.6% which is lower than the quarterly growth rates for the U.S.
and Canada, both of which are estimated at 0.8%. The auto-correlation param-
eters are qualitatively similar across countries, but estimated precisely enough
in each case to reject the hypothesis that these parameters are the same across
countries.
  Next, we turn our attention to the shock variances and co-variances which are
reported in the third and fourth row-blocks of Table 4.B. For all countries, the
standard deviation of the innovation to the supply shock, σs is roughly three times
larger than the standard deviation of the innovation to the IS shock and eight
times larger than the standard deviation of the innovation to either the policy
shock or the standard deviation of the innovation to the inflation process, ση2 .

                                   VI.   Conclusions

  This paper has two major findings. First, we established that the FM-model
outperforms the NK-model in explaining the data for U.S., the U.K. and Canada.
                             KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS                                17


Second, we found that all of the cross country differences in economic performance
for these countries can be attributed to differences in shocks and to the way that
their respective central banks responded to these shocks. The equations that
describe private sector behaviour appear to be similar, and the specification in
which they are constrained to be the same outperforms the unconstrained model
by a wide margin. This finding holds for both the FM-model and for five of our
six specifications of the NK-model.
  It is instructive to ask why the FM-model outperforms the NK alternative. We
believe it is because the FM-model displays not only dynamic indeterminacy, but
also static indeterminacy. The former property, dynamic indeterminacy, allows
the model to explain apparent price-stickiness in the data. The second property,
static indeterminacy, allows the FM-model to mimic the co-integrating properties
of the interest rate, the inflation rate and the output gap, each of which are well
described by non-stationary but cointegrated processes.
  The different properties of the FM-model have important policy implications
that are explored in Farmer (2016) and Farmer and Platonov (2019). Farmer
and Platonov show that, in the FM-model, demand and supply shocks may have
permanent effects on employment and inflation. Importantly, beliefs about nom-
inal income growth are fundamentals of the economy that act as an equilibrium
selection device. Beliefs influence the output-gap not only during periods of ad-
justment, but also in the long-run.
  In Farmer and Nicolò (2018) we ended our paper with the following paragraph:

     Central bankers use the concept of a time-varying natural rate of un-
     employment before deciding when and if to raise the nominal interest
     rate. The difficulty of estimating the natural rate arises, in practice,
     because the economy displays no tendency to return to its natural rate.
     That fact has led to much recent skepticism about the usefulness of the
     Phillips curve in policy analysis. Although we are sympathetic to the
     Keynesian idea that aggregate demand determines employment, we
     have shown in this paper that it is possible to construct a ‘Keynesian
     economics’ without the Phillips curve.

  In this companion piece, we have provided additional empirical evidence in
favour of the FM-model by demonstrating that our results hold, not only in
United States data, but also when we include data from the United Kingdom and
Canada.
