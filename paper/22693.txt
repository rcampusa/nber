                                          ABSTRACT

A vector autoregression with time-varying parameters is used to characterize changes in Federal
Reserve policy that occurred from 2000 through 2007 and describe how they affected the
performance of the U.S. economy. Declining coefficients in the model’s estimated policy rule
point to a shift in the Fed’s emphasis away from stabilizing inflation over this period. More
importantly, however, the Fed held the federal funds rate persistently below the values prescribed
by this rule. Under this more discretionary policy, inflation overshot its target and the funds rate
followed a path reminiscent of the "stop-go" pattern that characterized Fed behavior prior to
1979.

Introduction

      The years from 2000 through 2007 lie between two remarkable, but very

different, episodes in United States economic history. The period from the mid-

1980s through 2000 exhibited extraordinary macroeconomic stability and

came to be known as the “Great Moderation.”1 December 2007, on the other

hand, marked the beginning of the “Great Recession,” a period of economic and

financial turmoil of a kind not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression.

The timing of these events, and the sharp contrast between them, suggest that

something fundamental must have changed between 2000 and 2007.

      The statistical analysis presented here is directed at assessing the role

monetary policy may have played as a possible source of that change. Its focus

on monetary policy is motivated by two interrelated sets of considerations.

First, a host of studies, including Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000), Gali, Lopez-

Salido, and Valles (2003), Lubik and Schorfheide (2004), and Boivin and

Giannoni (2006), present evidence that links the improved performance of the

U.S. economy during the Great Moderation to better monetary policymaking.

In particular, these studies find that, in the early 1980s, monetary policy began

to place more emphasis on stabilizing inflation and less on stabilizing output

and employment. These studies go on to argue that this shift in the Federal

Reserve’s focus removed monetary policy itself as a source of business cycle

1 Kim and Nelson (1999), McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), and Stock and
Watson (2002) establish 1984 as the starting date for this period. Although
there is, as yet, no similar consensus as to when the Great Moderation came to
a close, it suffices for now to note that over the 16 years that followed, steady
growth in aggregate income and employment was interrupted by only one,
relatively minor, recession lasting from March through November 1991.

fluctuations and helped the economy respond more efficiently to a range of

non-monetary disturbances. If these arguments are correct, a shift in

emphasis back towards smoothing fluctuations in the real economy around

2000 may have created conditions conducive to the reemergence since then of

monetary disturbances as a source of inefficient fluctuations.

      Taylor (2009) offers a different interpretation of events by arguing that

the Federal Reserve began to deviate persistently from the prescriptions of his

original (1993) rule and, in so doing, set the stage for the financial crisis of

2007 and the Great Recession that followed. His (2009) comparison of the

actual trajectory of the federal funds rate from 2000 through 2007 against the

values prescribed by his original (1993) rule suggests that monetary policy had

been too accommodative over most of this period and fueled a boom-bust cycle

in housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.2 In short,

Taylor’s argument is that the Fed abandoned the guidance of a rule and

returned to policy actions guided by “discretion” instead.3


2 Barnett (2012, pp.133-134) also blames the housing boom on overly
expansionary monetary policy in the years following 2001, arguing that Federal
Reserve officials might have noticed this error had they used appropriate
measures of money instead of the federal funds rate to gauge the stance of
their policies. That restrictive monetary policy preceded the onset of recession
in 2007 is an argument also made by Hetzel (2009, 2012).

3 The contrast drawn here between “rules” and “discretion” comes closest to the
distinction as it is made by Taylor (1993, pp.198-199): The former refers to the
policymaker’s systematic response to changes in the economy as summarized
by a small number of state variables, such as inflation and the output gap,
whereas the latter alludes to less predictable actions motivated, perhaps, by
the policymaker’s own judgment. In contrast, Barro and Gordon’s (1983)
theoretical framework characterizes a “discretionary” policymaker as one who
sets inflation too high in order to exploit a Phillips curve trade-off, but still

                                          2
      This paper attempts to draw distinctions between these alternative

interpretations of how the Federal Reserve implemented its policy decisions

during the period from 2000 through 2007. To this end, it estimates a vector

autoregressive time series model with time-varying parameters and stochastic

volatility using Bayesian methods introduced and outlined by Cogley and

Sargent (2005) and Primiceri (2005). The equation for the interest rate in this

model takes the same general form as the Taylor (1993) rule, but imposes fewer

constraints on the dynamics with which the Federal Reserve adjusts its target

for the funds rate in response to changes in the economy. Thus, the model is

capable of capturing a range of ways in which monetary policy can change and,

in particular, distinguishes between whether the central bank adjusted the

strength of its systematic responses to inflation versus output (or

unemployment) and whether it deviated from that systematic behavior to a

greater or lesser extent. Because it embeds this version of the Taylor Rule

within a simultaneous-equation system, however, the model can be used to

investigate a more general question: How changes in monetary policy during

this period affected inflation and output as well the short-term interest rate.

The model sheds light, in particular, on whether macroeconomic conditions

leading up to the Great Recession might have evolved differently if the Fed had

not changed the weights it put on inflation versus output in the estimated rule

or if it had not deviated from the behavior prescribed by that rule.


behaves in a perfectly predictable manner; Ireland (1999) presents a statistical
analysis designed to test whether Federal Reserve policy has been discretionary
in this alternative sense and offers some support for this perspective.

                                        3
      The results point to both a shift in Federal Reserve policy away from

stabilizing inflation between 2000 and 2007 and to important departures from

rule-like behavior during that time. Moreover, counterfactual simulations

conducted with the model indicate that the estimated changes in monetary

policy – but especially departures from the policy rule – caused inflation to be

higher than it otherwise would have been when the Great Recession began.

These results raise the question of whether the United States, after an

interlude spanning the mid-1980s through the 1990s, entered a period of

renewed monetary instability after 2000. They underscore, as well, the

advantages that accrue when central bankers respond systematically to

movements in inflation and real economic activity within the context of a

monetary policy rule and avoid persistent deviations from that rule.

      Some previous studies estimate interest rate rules with time-varying

parameters to examine whether the coefficients of a Taylor rule have changed

in ways that are more complex than a one-time sample split around 1979

might suggest. Work on this question includes Jalil (2004), Boivin (2006), Kim

and Nelson (2006), McCulloch (2007), Trecroci and Vassalli (2001), Li (2012),

Jung and Katayama (2014), Lakdawala (2015), and Lee, Morley, and Shields

(2015). Other studies, such as Bayoumi and Sgherri (2004), Mandler (2007),

Ang, Boivin, Dong, and Loo-Kung (2011), and Doko Tchatoka, Groshenny,

Haque, and Weder (2016), go further to consider the effects that time-variation

in Taylor rule parameters have had on the persistence of inflation, the

predictability of the federal funds rate, the behavior of long-term bond yields,


                                        4
and the stability of the economy’s rational expectations equilibrium. Canova

and Gambetti (2009), Koop, Leon-Gonzalez, and Strachan (2009), and Liu and

Morley (2014) use vector autoregressions with time-varying parameters to

characterize changes in both monetary policy and the monetary transmission

mechanism in the U.S. economy. The analysis here builds on and adds to this

literature by focusing, first, on how Federal Reserve policy changed over the

more recent period from 2000 through 2007 and, second, on how these

changes affected the trajectories of inflation and real activity in the period

leading up to the Great Recession.



The Model

      The model – a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters

and stochastic volatility – is based on Primiceri’s (2005). Two model variants

are considered, each using a different set of variables. Both variants measure

the short-term nominal interest rate Rt using the federal funds rate, which the

Federal Reserve focuses on most closely in conducting monetary policy. The

two model variants differ, however, in the way they measure inflation Π t and a

“gap” variable Gt that tracks the cyclical position of the real economy.

      The first model variant measures inflation using year-over-year

percentage changes in the price index for core personal consumption

expenditures (PCE), reflecting the Federal Reserve’s shift in emphasis from the




                                         5
consumer price index to the PCE price index in 2000.4 Use of the output gap

to measure Gt then allows this variant of the model to describe monetary policy

in a manner that is closest to that provided by the original Taylor (1993) rule,

but with more flexible dynamics that enter through time-varying coefficients on

the current and lagged values of inflation and the output gap as well as lags of

the federal funds rate itself.5 These data also reflect the latest estimates of

inflation and the output gap available from the U.S. Department of Commerce

and the Congressional Budget Office, and may thereby provide the most

accurate estimates of how the economy responded to Federal Reserve policy

actions over the period from 2000 through 2007.

      Bernanke (2010) argues, however, that in understanding how the Federal

Reserve responded to perceived changes in the economy over this same time

period, it may be important to consider “real-time” data actually available to

policymakers when setting their federal funds rate targets. Thus, the second

model variant uses year-over-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) to



4 See Board of Governors (2000, p.4, footnote 1) for a brief discussion of the
rationale for this shift.

5 The output gap is measured as the percentage-point difference between
actual real GDP and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of potential
output. In addition to bringing the variables included in this version of the
VAR into close accordance with those appearing in the original Taylor (1993)
rule, use of the output gap, instead of the growth rate of real GDP, may help
the model control for the effects of technology shocks that affect both real and
potential GDP, but not the gap; Giordani (2004) discusses this point in more
detail. Consistent with this intuition, results very similar to those reported
here obtain when this three-variable version of the model is expanded to
include Fernald’s (2014) measures of consumption and investment-specific
total factor productivity growth.

                                         6
measure inflation and the unemployment rate as its gap variable. Once

released, readings on these variables are never revised; hence, they may reflect

more closely the information available to Federal Reserve officials in real time.6

          Both model variants collect their three variables in a 3x1 vector

                                                               ′

which is assumed to follow a second-order VAR with time-varying coefficients

and a time-varying covariance matrix for its innovations. The model’s reduced

form is

                               yt = bt + B1,t yt −1 + B2,t yt −2 + u t ,             (1)

where bt is a 3x1 vector of time-varying intercept terms, Bi ,t , for i = 1 and i = 2 ,

are 3x3 matrices of time-varying autoregressive coefficients, and ut is a 3x1

vector of heteroskedastic shocks with time-varying covariance matrix Ωt . By

stacking the intercept and autoregressive coefficients into the 21x1 vector

                                                ⎝ ⎣ ⎦⎠

and decomposing the covariance matrix Ωt as

                                      Ωt = At−1Σt Σ′t ( At′) −1 ,                    (2)

where the 3x3 matrix

6 Croushore and Evans (2006) develop an econometric model with constant
parameters that simultaneously exploits information in both real-time and
revised data sources to understand Federal Reserve policy and its effects on the
economy. Extending this model to allow for time-varying parameters presents
an interesting but technically challenging exercise for future research.

is 3x3 and diagonal, so that the standard deviations in σ t evolve as

independent, geometric random walks. Following Primiceri (2005), it is

assumed that S is block-diagonal, with one non-zero element in the first

column of the first row and three distinct non-zero elements in the second and

third columns of the second and third rows. Hence, Q has 231 distinct

elements, S has four distinct non-zero elements, and W has three non-zero

elements.



Estimation Strategy

      Going back to the earliest work by Litterman (1979), Bayesian techniques

have proven quite useful in estimating and interpreting vector autoregressions,

as these methods offer theoretically coherent and computationally convenient

ways of coping with the large numbers of parameters appearing even in VARs

with coefficients that do not vary over time. More recently, Cogley and Sargent

(2005) and Primiceri (2005) have outlined more powerful Markov Chain Monte

Carlo algorithms for simulating the posterior distributions for the still larger

number of parameters in systems like that described here by equations (3)-(7).

                                           9
Following the same approach taken by Cogley and Sargent and Primiceri, prior

distributions for these parameters are calibrated with the help of classical

estimates obtained by applying a training sample consisting of the first ten

years of data to a constant-parameter version of (3):

                                   yt = X t′B + A−1Σε t .

In particular, an estimate B̂ of the parameter vector B is obtained by applying

ordinary least squares, individually, to each equation in this system, and

estimates α̂ and σ̂ of the parameter vectors α and σ are found by applying

the same Cholesky factorization shown in (2) to the covariance matrix of least-

squares residuals. Standard least-squares formulas provide an estimate of VˆB ,

the covariance matrix of B̂ , while Lutkepohl’s (2006, Ch.9. p.373) Proposition

9.5 derives an expression for Vˆα , the covariance matrix of α̂ . These

magnitudes help fix normal priors for the initial values

                                     B0 ∼ N ( B̂,4VˆB ),

                                    α 0 ∼ N (α̂ ,4Vˆα ),

and

                                  log σ 0 ∼ N (log σ̂ , I 3 )

similar to those used by Primiceri (2005), which then imply, through (4)-(7),

normal priors for all three sets of time-varying coefficients.

      For Q , the two diagonal blocks S1 and S2 of S , and each diagonal

element wi ,i , i = 1,2,3, of W , inverse Wishart priors are calibrated as



                                             10
                                   Q ∼ IW (22kQ2VˆB ,22),

                                    S1 ∼ IW (2kS2Vˆα ,1 ,2),

                                    S2 ∼ IW (3kS2Vˆα ,2 ,3),

and

                                     wi,i ∼ IW (2kW2 ,2)


for i = 1,2,3, where Vˆα ,1 and Vˆα ,2 are the diagonal blocks of Vˆα . The settings

k S2 = 0.01 and kW = 0.0001 are again taken directly from Primiceri (2005), while
                 2




the setting kQ2 = 0.00035 follows Cogley and Sargent (2005) and Benati (2011) to

allow for additional time-variation in the autoregessive parameters.7

      Starting from these priors, the remaining sample of quarterly data,

running from 1970:1 through 2007:4, is fed through a “Metropolis-within-

Gibbs” sampling algorithm to draw blocks of parameters from their conditional

posterior distributions. The multi-move algorithm outlined by Carter and Kohn

(1994) and Fruhwirth-Schnatter (1994) generates draws for the sequence of

cofficients in Bt ; following Cogley and Sargent (2005), draws implying explosive

VAR dynamics are rejected. Primiceri’s (2005) equation-by-equation method

provides draws for the sequence of parameters in α t . Draws for the volatility

Primiceri’s (2005) setting kQ2 = 0.0001 and obtains results that are, qualitatively,
quite similar to those presented here, but with less time-variation in the
elements of Bt .

which approximates the true, log-chi-square distribution for each of these

coefficients with a mixture of seven normal distributions. Within this

algorithm, the state variable indicating which normal distribution each

volatility parameter is chosen from gets selected before sampling a value for the

volatility parameter itself; the importance of this ordering of steps is discussed

by Del Negro and Primiceri (2015). Also as in Del Negro and Primiceri (2015), a

Metropolis-Hastings step is added to this part of the algorithm to account for

the approximation error between the mixture-of-normals posterior distribution

and the true, log-chi-square distribution for the volatility parameters. Finally,

updated draws for the parameters in Q , S , and W are taken from their inverse

Wishart conditional posterior distributions.

       After cycling through this procedure 100,000 times in a burn-in period,

all of the results below are based on the 50,000 draws of each parameter that

follow. To check that output from the Markov Chain converges and mixes

adequately, the algorithm is initialized from different, randomly chosen starting

points, to verify that none of the results is affected. In addition, and more

formally, table 1 presents summary statistics for inefficiency factors across four

blocks of parameters: in the sequences B T = {Bt }Tt =1 , AT = {α t }Tt =1 , and ΣT = {σ t }Tt =1 of

time-varying autoregressive coefficients, shock covariances, and shock

volatilities, and in the elements from the matrix V of hyperparameters defined

in (7). For each individual parameter θ , the inefficiency statistic, described in

more detail by Chib (2001, pp.3579-3580), is defined as the inverse of

Geweke’s (1992) measure of relative numerical efficiency:

                                                12

                                            −π



where Sθ (ω) is the spectral density of θ at frequency ω . Thus, IF (θ ) is

computed here by multiplying an estimate of the spectral density of θ at

frequency zero, obtained using Newey and West’s (1987) Bartlett weighting of

24 lagged autocovariances of θ , by 2π and dividing the result by the variance

of θ over the 50,000 draws. Primiceri (2005) and Benati (2011) suggest that

inefficiency factors at or below 20 are acceptable, and while the statistics for

the hyperparameters in V cluster tightly around that upper bound, those for

the autoregressive parameters and shock covariances and volatilities come in

well below it.



Identification of Structural Shocks

      At least two approaches can be used to identify structural disturbances,

including monetary policy shocks, from the reduced form described by (1) and

(2). One approach, which dates back to Sims (1980), uses assumptions about

the timing with which monetary policy disturbances affect inflation and output

or unemployment to re-interpret the triangular factorization of the reduced-

form covariance matrix shown in (2) as a mapping between the reduced-form

and structural models.8 An alternative, taken here, uses “sign restrictions” on

impulse responses to identify an entire set of structural disturbances based on

8The earlier version of this paper, Belongia and Ireland (2015), takes this
approach, obtaining results that are qualitatively similar to those presented
here.

                                            13
the effects each is assumed to have on inflation, the gap variable, and the

interest rate. Faust (1998), Canova and De Nicolo (2002), and Uhlig (2005) first

developed the idea that sign restrictions can serve as a source of identifying

assumptions in VARs, while Benati (2011) implements the particular scheme

used here within a similar VAR framework with time-varying parameters.

      The algorithm, based on Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner, and Zha (2010) and

Arias, Rubio-Ramirez, and Waggoner (2014) and outlined in more detail in the

appendix, works to factor the reduced form covariance matrix as

                                   Ωt = Ct−1Dt Dt′(Ct′) −1 ,                      (8)

where Ct and Dt are 3x3 matrices of the form

                                   ⎡ 1           −cπ g ,t   −cπ r ,t ⎤

restricted further so that the three structural disturbances – to aggregate

supply, aggregate demand, and monetary policy – affect inflation, the gap

variable, and the federal funds rate as illustrated in table 2. Equations (8)-(10)

provide the mapping between the reduced form (1) and (2) and the structural

model, which now can be written as

                          Ct yt = γ t + Γ1,t yt −1 + Γ 2,t yt −2 + Dtξt ,        (11)

where γ t = Ct bt , Γi ,t = Ct Bi ,t for i = 1 and i = 2 , and


                                                ξt = ⎡⎣ξtas ξtad ξtmp ⎤⎦′                                             (12)

is a 3x1 vector of structural disturbances to aggregate supply, aggregate

demand, and monetary policy, with Eξtξt′ = I 3 .

       The third row of the structural model described by (8)-(12) is a monetary

policy rule

                  Rt = γ r ,t + crπ ,t Πt + γ 1,rπ ,t Πt −1 + γ 2,rπ ,t Πt −2
                                                                                                                      (13)

where the intercept terms and the coefficients on the lagged values of inflation,

the gap variable, and the interest rate are those from the third rows of the

vector γ t and matrices Γ1,t and Γ 2,t in (11).9 This policy rule takes the same

general form as Taylor’s (1993), in that it prescribes a setting for the federal

funds rate with reference to changing values of inflation and the gap variable.

However, (13) also allows for considerable flexibility in the dynamic response of

the funds rate to changes in inflation and the output gap and, through the

inclusion of lagged interest rate terms on the right-hand side, captures as well

the central bank’s tendency to smooth interest rate movements over time.

Deviations in the actual federal funds rate from the value dictated by the

current and lagged values of inflation, the gap variable, and the interest rate

get picked up as monetary shocks in (13). Finally, (13) allows for time-

9 Note that the minus signs in front of the impact coefficients in (9) are just
normalizations, which allow the monetary policy rule to be written as (13), after
isolating the interest rate on the left-hand side and moving the
contemporaneous values of inflation and the gap variable to the right.

                                                               15
variation in all of the response coefficients and in the standard deviation δ r ,t of

the monetary policy shocks.

       Therefore, by expanding the time-varying estimation beyond that of a

Taylor rule’s coefficients in isolation, this specification becomes ideally suited

for distinguishing between a variety of changes to monetary policy that might

have occurred over the period from 2000 through 2007. In particular, this

more generalized estimation permits drawing distinctions between changes in

the emphasis that the Federal Reserve placed on its stabilizing objectives for

inflation versus the gap variable and the extent to which Federal Reserve

officials became more willing to tolerate deviations from their systematic

behavior. And, because the parameters of (13) are estimated within the

multivariate system (11), the model also can be used to trace out the

implications that these changes in monetary policy had on inflation and real

economic activity over the same period.



Estimation Results

       Figures 1 and 2 focus on the time-varying parameters of the monetary

policy rule (13). Figure 1 tracks the evolution of the impact coefficients crπ ,t

and crg ,t , which measure the contemporaneous responses of the federal funds

rate to movements in inflation and the gap variable. Figure 2 does the same for

the measure of “interest rate smoothing” given by the sum γ 1,rr ,t + γ 2,rr ,t of the

coefficients on the lagged interest rate terms and the “long-run coefficients”



                                            16
                         (crπ ,t + γ 1,rπ ,t + γ    2,rπ ,t   ) / (1 − γ 1,rr ,t − γ 2,rr ,t )

and

                          (crg ,t + γ 1,rg ,t + γ 2,rg ,t ) / (1 − γ 1,rr ,t − γ 2,rr ,t ),

which measure the total increase in the funds rate that would, in theory, follow

a permanent one-percentage-point increase in inflation or the gap variable.

      The graphs show steady declines in the policy response of the funds rate

to changes in inflation, both on impact and in the long run, between 2000 and

2007. When inflation is measured with the core PCE price index, the median

impact coefficient falls from 1.04 to 0.73 and the median long-run coefficient

from 1.94 to 1.64; similarly, when inflation is measured with the core CPI, the

impact coefficient falls from 1.10 to 0.54 and the long-run coefficient from 2.26

to 1.85. Meanwhile, the coefficients on the gap variables take their expected

signs – positive for the output gap and negative for the unemployment rate –

but remain fairly stable over the 2000-2007 period. Thus, the estimates do

point to a noticeable shift in the emphasis of monetary policy, responding less

to inflation relative to real economic activity.

      Figure 3 plots the changing standard deviations of the structural

disturbances, measured by the diagonal elements of the matrix Dt shown in

(10). In particular, the two panels in the bottom row track the evolution of the

identified monetary policy shock: on the left for the model estimated with the

core PCE price index and output gap and on the right for the model estimated

with the core CPI and unemployment rate. The broad historical patterns are



                                                       17
similar for both model variants, showing that monetary volatility was extremely

high during from early-to-mid 1970s and through the period of the Volcker

disinflation; compared to those very high levels, the standard deviation of

monetary policy shocks has remained low and stable since. Nevertheless, both

graphs hint at an increased willingness of Federal Reserve officials to depart

from the systematic behavior prescribed by the estimated policy rules during

and after the recession of 2001. When estimated with PCE price inflation and

the output gap, the median value of δ r ,t rises from 0.34 in 2000:1 to 0.47 in

2001:2 before falling back to 0.32 in 2007:4; and when estimated with CPI

inflation and the unemployment rate, the median value of δ r ,t increases from

0.31 in 2000:1 to 0.40 in 2001:2, then declines to 0.21 in 2007:4.

      Of course, figures 1-3 also indicate that considerable uncertainty

surrounds most of the parameter estimates, with wide bands appearing

between the 16th and 84th percentiles of their distributions. Table 3 confirms

this by computing, in a manner suggested by Cogley, Primiceri, and Sargent

(2010), the posterior probability that the value for each monetary policy

parameter in 2000:1 exceeds its value in 2007:4. In only one case – for the

impact coefficient on CPI inflation – do the data provide enough information to

assign a probability higher than 90 percent to a unidirectional shift.

      Thus, figure 4 digs deeper by plotting estimates of the realized monetary

policy shocks between 2000 and 2007. Over the entire period, these shocks

are most frequently expansionary (negative) in the model based on PCE

inflation and the output gap. Most notably, the Federal Reserve appears to

                                        18
have held its funds rate target below the value prescribed by the estimated rule

for the entire year running from 2003:3 through 2004:2. These patterns

appear somewhat muted in the bottom panel, which shows results from the

model estimated with CPI inflation and the unemployment rate. These

dampened magnitudes offer some support for Bernanke’s (2010) arguments

that Federal Reserve policy appears to come closer to following a Taylor rule

when “real-time” data are considered. Nevertheless, even when the statistical

uncertainty summarized by the 16-84 percentile bands is taken into account,

both graphs point to potentially important deviations from that rule in the

aftermath of the 2001 recession.

      Before moving on, however, figures 5-8 and tables 4 and 5 look for other

possible shifts in monetary policy that may have occurred between 2000 and

2007 and their consequent effects on aggregate activity. Figure 5 plots time-

varying “inflation targets” for the core PCE price index and CPI, defined as in

Cogley and Sargent (2005) and Cogley, Primiceri, and Sargent (2010) as the

stochastic trend towards which inflation would gravitate based on draws of the

model’s parameters for each period t = 1,2,...T . While both panels show

evidence of a long-run decline in the Federal Reserve’s objective for inflation

over the entire estimation period beginning in 1970, the estimated targets

remain stable, just below 2 percent for the PCE price index and 2 1/2 percent

for the CPI, from 2000 through the end of the sample in 2007. Likewise, table

3 shows that the data provide no clear evidence of any shift in the inflation

targets in either direction between 2000:1 and 2007:4.


                                        19
      Figures 6-8, meanwhile, trace out impulse responses of each observable

variable to identified aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and monetary policy

shocks. Following Primiceri (2005), these impulse responses are computed for

each period based on draws from the posterior distributions of the parameters

estimated for that period; thus, they summarize how the Fed and the economy

responded to shocks at a particular point in time. The top rows of figures 6

and 7, in particular, show larger responses of inflation to aggregate demand

and, especially, aggregate supply shocks in 2007:4 compared to 2000:1,

consistent with the decline in the monetary policy response coefficients for

inflation appearing previously in figures 1 and 2. Figure 8, however, reveals

little change in the effects of monetary policy shocks across the two periods.

      Finally, tables 4 and 5 report percentages of forecast error variances in

inflation and gap variables attributable to monetary policy shocks for horizons

ranging one to ten years ahead. As with the impulse response functions, each

of these variance decompositions is based on draws of the model’s parameters

from their posterior distributions for 2000:1 and 2007:4 in order to summarize

changes in monetary policy and the economy taking place between those dates.

Particularly when data on the PCE price index and the output gap are used to

generate the numbers in table 4, the estimated model attributes sizable

fractions of the volatility in inflation to monetary policy shocks. Once again,

however, there is little evidence in either table 4 or 5 of dramatic shifts in any

of these statistics across the two periods.




                                        20
      Overall, many of the estimation results do suggest that the Federal

Reserve shifted its emphasis away from stabilizing inflation between 2000 and

2007. The most striking evidence of a change in monetary policy, however, is

provided by the realized shocks shown in figure 4: Rather than indicating a

change in emphasis between the two objectives in a standard Taylor Rule,

these point to an increased willingness of policymakers to depart from rule-like

behavior, especially during 2003 and 2004.



Counterfactual Simulations

      To assess how these changes in monetary policy affected U.S. economic

performance, figure 9 reports results from two experiments in which the

estimated model is used to describe counterfactual scenarios. In the first, the

coefficients of the policy rule (13) beginning in 2000:1 and ending in 2007:4 are

drawn, not from their own posterior distribution but instead from the posterior

distribution from 2000:1. Thus, this experiment is designed to infer what

would have happened to inflation, real economic activity, and the federal funds

rate if the systematic component of monetary policy from 2000 through 2007

placed consistently higher weight on inflation stabilization. Focusing on the

results derived from data on PCE price inflation and the output gap, the graphs

in the first column of figure 9 suggest that this shift in emphasis back towards

inflation-fighting would have done little to change the course of history:

Although the panel in the top row shows that inflation would have been about

10 basis points lower in 2004 and 2005 with the counterfactual policy rule, the


                                       21
differences between the actual and counterfactual paths are otherwise so slight

that the two lines in each graph can scarcely be distinguished.

      The second experiment attempts, instead, to change history by “turning

off” the monetary policy shocks that, according to the estimated model,

occurred between 2000:1 and 2007:4. In this case, for the model with PCE

price inflation and the output gap, the graphs from the second column of figure

9 show more important differences between the actual time series and the

median counterfactual paths. Without monetary policy shocks, the funds rate

runs higher for virtually all of the five-year period from 2001 through 2005.

Most notably, the median counterfactual trajectory for the funds rate between

2003:4 and 2005:2 lies between 40 and 90 basis points above the actual

settings.

      The graph in the top row of the second column of figure 9, meanwhile,

displays the model’s implications for how the estimated monetary policy shocks

affected inflation. The median path for inflation in the counterfactual without

shocks falls below the actual path from 2003:3 onward and runs continuously

between 20 and 35 basis points beneath the actual series over the 2004:2

through 2006:4 interval. Moreover, instead of overshooting what has since

become the Federal Reserve’s official long-run inflation target of two percent, as

it did in the actual data by the end of 2004, inflation under the counterfactual

converges, and then remains very close to, two percent through the end of the




                                       22
sample.10 The graph in the middle row of the second column suggests that the

negative output gap that persisted in the years following the 2001 recession

would have been as much as 40 basis points larger in absolute value without

the estimated monetary policy shocks. Thus, by deviating from rule-like

behavior, the Fed appears to have successfully “bought” higher output at the

cost of creating more inflation. Note from the bottom graph, however, that the

actual path for the funds rate moves 50 basis points or more above the path

without monetary policy shocks beginning in the second half of 2006. At least

in hindsight, deviations from the rule in (13) over this period suggest that

interest rates were kept too low for low long even as the economy continued to

recover and inflation began to rise and then increased too quickly and by too

much when inflation exceeded its target. This pattern bears a troubling

resemblance to the discretionary, “stop-go” dynamics that Hetzel (2012)

associates with Federal Reserve policy before 1979.

      Consistent with the estimates of the monetary policy shocks themselves

displayed in figure 5, the last two columns of figure 9 show that the differences

between the actual and counterfactual paths from both experiments are

smaller when the model is estimated with data on CPI inflation and the

unemployment rate. In the figure’s third column, virtually no difference


10 In Belongia and Ireland (2015), the results of this no-shock counterfactual
appear even more striking when the monetary policy shocks are identified
using a more traditional, Cholesky factorization of the reduced-form covariance
matrix, assuming that inflation and output react to these shocks with a one-
period lag. There, along the counterfactual trajectories, the federal funds rate
rises as much as 150 basis points above the actual setting, and inflation falls
by 45 basis points below its historical path.

                                       23
appears between the historical data and the counterfactual when the 2000:1

policy rule applies over the entire period running through 2007:4. And in the

fourth column, along the median counterfactual paths without the estimated

monetary policy shocks, inflation never falls more than 20 basis points below

and the federal funds rate never rises more than 45 basis points above their

actual values.

      For the purposes of these exercises, however, the choice between the

revised PCE and output gap data and the unrevised CPI and unemployment

data is by no means clear-cut. Even if Bernanke (2010) is correct in stating

that real time data are more useful to understanding why policymakers

behaved as they did, the most recently revised figures provide more accurate

estimates of how the economy responded to their policy actions. Thus, figures

4 and 9 do suggest that, as argued by Bernanke (2010), the Fed’s motivation to

keep interest rates low after the 2001 recession was based partly on

preliminary estimates of inflation that, later, were revised substantially

upward. But, even using the unrevised data, both figures point to deviations

from the estimated monetary policy rule that contributed to higher inflation

later on. And the most recently revised data on core PCE inflation and the

output gap indicate that, whether deliberate or inadvertent, monetary policy

actions taken to keep interest rates low played an important role in causing

inflation to overshoot its target in the years leading up to the Great Recession.




                                        24
Conclusion

      Although the Federal Reserve never has announced that it follows a rule

to guide monetary policy decisions, Taylor (1993) described a framework the

Fed might use to determine its target value for the federal funds rate. Despite

its simplicity, this rule appeared to track actual Federal Reserve policy

decisions quite well over the period between 1987 and 1992 that was the focus

of Taylor’s original study. Moreover, the rule’s parsimony meant that it could

be incorporated easily into even the simplest of New Keynesian models, which

focus on the behavior of the same three variables – inflation, the output gap,

and the short-term nominal interest rate – that appear in the rule itself. For

both of these reasons, the Taylor rule has become a benchmark for assessing

and evaluating how Federal Reserve policy has changed over longer periods of

time, well beyond the short sample first considered by Taylor.

      The models considered here include a version of the Taylor rule that

allows for time variation in both the coefficients measuring the Federal

Reserve’s systematic responses to inflation and real economic activity and in

the volatility of an identified monetary policy shock, which may reflect the Fed’s

willingness to deviate from the interest rate setting prescribed by the rule.

Therefore, when estimated, this model works to characterize, more sharply

than previous studies have, the changes to Federal Reserve policy that

occurred between 2000 and 2007, a period spanning the end of the Great

Moderation and the beginning of the Great Recession. Moreover, because the

model embeds the time-varying policy rule within a vector autoregressive


                                        25
framework, it also can be used to investigate how these changes affected the

behavior of inflation and real activity.

      The results suggest, first, that the Fed did decrease the weight it placed

on stabilizing inflation from 2000 to 2007; this finding appears consistently,

whether the model is estimated with the most recently-revised data on PCE

price inflation and the output gap or with unrevised data on CPI inflation and

the unemployment rate. The estimates point more strongly, however, to

persistent deviations from the estimated policy rule that had important

implications for the behavior of output and, especially, inflation.

Counterfactual simulations run with the estimated model suggest that the path

for the funds rate under a policy rule would have allowed core PCE price

inflation to converge to the Federal Reserve’s two percent target without

overshooting and also would have avoided the abrupt tightening of monetary

policy that occurred just prior to the onset of the Great Recession.

      Simulations done with the same CPI and unemployment data that would

have been available to the Federal Reserve in approximate real time lend some

support to Bernanke’s (2010) claim that policymakers may have been misled by

initial readings of low inflation that were subsequently revised upward. A

persistent series of expansionary policy shocks appears, however, even when

the model is estimated with unrevised CPI data. On balance, therefore, the

results bolster Taylor’s (2009) claim that monetary policy was too expansionary

for too long following the earlier recession of 2001. More broadly, the results

reinforce a basic message from modern macroeconomics: That economic

monetary policy rule.



Appendix

      Benati (2011, pp.1111-1112) describes how the algorithm developed by

Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner, and Zha (2010) and Arias, Rubio-Ramirez, and

Waggoner (2014) can be applied in VARs with time-varying parameters with

stochastic volatility. Let the index i = 1,2,..., N keep track of the desired draws

from the posterior distribution. For each i = 1,2,..., N , the algorithm loops

through the following steps.

   1. Draw sequences ( AT , ΣT ) from their conditional posterior distributions

      during the Gibbs sampling stage.

   2. For each t = 1,2,..., T , construct At and Σt based on the draws for ( AT , ΣT ) .

      Then, let Lt = At−1Σ t , so that the reduced-form covariance matrix can be

      recovered as Ωt = Lt Lt′ .

   3. Draw X! , a 3x3 random matrix with each element having an independent

      standard normal distribution. Then, factor this matrix as X! = QX RX ,

      where Q X is an orthogonal matrix and R X is upper triangular with

      positive diagonal elements.

   4. Let L! = Lt QX′ and note that L!t L!t′ = Lt QX′ QX Lt′ = Lt Lt′ = Ω t by virtue of the fact

      that Q X is orthogonal. These equalities highlight that multiplying the




                                                27
      structural model (11) through by Dt−1 and then Q X results in an

      observationally-equivalent rotation of the model’s three equations.

      Suppressing for convenience explicit reference to the constant and lagged

      terms in (11), the candidate structural model based on the specific draw

      for Q X can be written as yt = L!tξt ; thus, the matrix L!t contains impact

      coefficients linking the structural shocks in ξt to the observable variables

      in yt . The sign restrictions shown in table 2 require the elements of L!t

      to display similar sign patterns. If these restrictions are not satisfied for

      any t = 1,2,..., T , the draws for ( AT , ΣT ) and X! are discarded and the

      algorithm returns to step 1. If the restrictions are satisfied for all

      t = 1,2,..., T , then L!t is factored as L!t = Ct−1 Dt , where Ct and D t have the

      forms shown in (9) and (10), these draws are saved, and the Gibbs

      sampling routine moves on.

line) and 16th and 84th percentiles (thin red lines) of the posterior distribution
of the inflation target, defined as the time-varying long-run mean for inflation.
Top graph is from the model with core PCE price inflation and the output gap;
bottom graph is from the model with core CPI inflation and the unemployment
rate.
