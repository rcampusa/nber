Pharmaceutical Innovation and Longevity Growth in 30 Developing and High-income Countries,
2000-2009

NBER Working Paper No. 18235

JEL No. I12,J11,O33,O4

                                            ABSTRACT

I examine the impact of pharmaceutical innovation, as measured by the vintage (world launch year)
of prescription drugs used, on longevity using longitudinal, country-level data on 30 developing and
high-income countries during the period 2000-2009. I control for fixed country and year effects, real
per capita income, the unemployment rate, mean years of schooling, the urbanization rate, real per
capita health expenditure (public and private), the DPT immunization rate among children ages 12-23
months, HIV prevalence and tuberculosis incidence.

The estimates indicate that life expectancy at all ages and survival rates above age 25 increased faster
in countries with larger increases in drug vintage (measured in three different ways), ceteris paribus,
and that the increase in life expectancy at birth due to the increase in the fraction of drugs consumed
that were launched after 1990 was 1.27 years—73% of the actual increase in life expectancy at birth.

I.       Introduction


        Longevity increase is increasingly recognized by economists to be an important part of
economic growth and development.1 Economists also recognize that, in the long run, the rate of
economic “growth…is driven by technological change that arises from intentional [research and
development (R&D)] investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents” (Romer (1990)).
According to the National Science Foundation (2012), the medical devices and substances
industries are the most research intensive industries in the economy. In 1997, “medical
substances and devices firms had by far the highest combined R&D intensity at 11.8
percent,…well above the 4.2-percent average for all 500 top 1997 R&D spenders combined. The
information and electronics sector ranked second in intensity at 7.0 percent.”
        In principle, technological change could be either disembodied or embodied in new
goods. Solow (1960) hypothesized that most technological change is embodied: to benefit from
technological progress, one must use newer, or later vintage, goods and services. Bresnahan and
Gordon (1996) argued that “new goods are at the heart of economic progress,” and Hercowitz
(1998, p. 223) also reached the “conclusion…that 'embodiment' is the main transmission
mechanism of technological progress to economic growth.”
        When technological progress is embodied in new goods, the welfare of consumers (and
the productivity of producers) depends on the vintage of the goods (or inputs) they purchase.
Solow (1960) introduced the concept of vintage into economic analysis.2 Solow’s basic idea was
that technical progress is “built into” machines and other goods and that this must be taken into
account when making empirical measurements of their roles in production. A number of
econometric studies (Bahk and Gort, Hulten, Sakellaris and Wilson) have shown that
manufacturing firms using later-vintage equipment have higher productivity.
        I hypothesize that the health and longevity of a population depends on how
technologically advanced the medical goods (including drugs) and services its members use are.

  See e.g. Nordhaus (2003) and Murphy and Topel (2006). Murphy and Topel estimated that, over the 20th century,
cumulative gains in U.S. life expectancy were worth over $1.2 million per person for both men and women.
Between 1970 and 2000, increased U.S. longevity added about $3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, an
uncounted value equal to about half of average annual GDP over the period.

  This was one of the contributions to the theory of economic growth that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
cited when it awarded Solow the 1987 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.
                                                                                                                    3


Furthermore, how technologically advanced a medical good or service is depends on its vintage,
defined as its year of invention or first use.3
         This study will examine the impact of pharmaceutical innovation, as measured by the
vintage of prescription drugs used, on longevity using longitudinal, country-level data on 30
developing and high-income countries during the period 2000-2009. The analysis will be based
on data drawn from several reliable databases: data on the utilization of over 89,000
pharmaceutical products from the IMS Health MIDAS database; life tables produced by the
World Health Organization; and indicators of socioeconomic status, health expenditure, risk
factors, and other variables from three World Bank databases and the OECD Health database.
         Longevity growth is likely to depend on the vintage (hence quality) of non-
pharmaceutical as well as pharmaceutical goods and services, so it would be ideal to include
measures of the vintage of medical devices and procedures as well as measures of drug vintage
in models of disability days. But measuring the vintage of medical devices and procedures is
much more difficult than measuring drug vintage. Some evidence (described later in this article)
indicates that non-pharmaceutical innovation is not correlated across countries or diseases with
pharmaceutical innovation, so that excluding non-pharmaceutical innovation will not bias
estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity. Moreover, there are good
reasons to think that pharmaceutical innovation has a greater impact on health outcomes than
non-pharmaceutical innovation.4 First, the number of people exposed to pharmaceutical
innovation tends to be much larger than the number of people exposed to other types of medical
innovation: for example, in 2007, 62% of Americans consumed prescription drugs, while only
8% of Americans were admitted to hospitals.5 Second, pharmaceuticals are more research-
intensive than other types of medical care: in 2007, prescription drugs accounted for 10% of U.S.

  According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, one definition of vintage is “a period of origin or manufacture (e.g.
a piano of 1845 vintage)”. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintage.

  Ford et al (2007) estimated that 47% of the decline between 1980 and 2000 in the age-adjusted U.S. death rate for
coronary heart disease was due to “treatments,” 24% was due to reductions in total cholesterol, and 20% was due to
reductions in systolic blood pressure. Many of the treatments identified by Ford et al were pharmaceutical
treatments, and pharmaceuticals (e.g. statins) probably also played an important role in reducing cholesterol and
blood pressure.

  Source: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2007 Full Year Consolidated Data File. Lichtenberg (2013a) found
that therapeutic procedure innovation increased the life expectancy of Western Australia hospital patients (whose
mean life expectancy was about 10 years) by 2 to 3 months between 2000 and 2007. Since the fraction of the
population that is hospitalized is fairly low, the implied contribution of hospital procedure innovation to aggregate
longevity growth is fairly modest—much smaller than estimates (reviewed below) of the contribution of
pharmaceutical innovation to aggregate longevity growth.

health expenditure (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2013: Table 2)), but more than
half of U.S. funding for biomedical research came from pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms
(Dorsey et al, 2010). Much of the rest came from the federal government (i.e. the NIH), and new
drugs often build on upstream government research (Sampat and Lichtenberg, 2011).
         A number of previous studies have examined the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on
longevity. Several types of econometric studies have been performed. Some studies used
patient-level data, to investigate the following question: do patients using newer drugs live
longer than patients using older drugs, controlling for their demographic characteristics (age, sex,
race, income, education, etc.), medical conditions, behavioral risk factors, and other variables?6
Other studies used longitudinal state-level data, to investigate whether life expectancy increased
more rapidly in (U.S. or German) states experiencing more pharmaceutical innovation,
controlling for changes in income, education, and other variables.7 Other studies (e.g.
Lichtenberg (2013c)) used longitudinal disease-level data, to determine whether life expectancy
has increased more rapidly for people with diseases experiencing more pharmaceutical
innovation.8 I will compare estimates from this study to estimates obtained from previous
studies (which were almost entirely based on data from high-income countries).
         In Section II, I postulate a model of longevity as a function of drug vintage and other
variables. I also consider why the increase in drug vintage is likely to vary across countries,
describe the other variables I will control for, and briefly review some of the literature about the
determinants of longevity. In Section III, I discuss the measurement of longevity and
pharmaceutical innovation. Descriptive statistics are presented in Section IV. Empirical results
are presented in Section V. Implications of the estimates are discussed in Section VI. The final
section provides a summary.

  Lichtenberg et al (2009) studied the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity using patient-level data on
elderly residents of Quebec, and Lichtenberg (2013b) studied this issue using patient-level data on elderly
Americans.

  Lichtenberg (2011) studied the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity using longitudinal state-level
U.S. data, and Lichtenberg (2012) studied this issue using longitudinal state-level German data,

  In the studies based on patient-level and longitudinal state-level data, pharmaceutical innovation was measured by
the mean vintage (FDA approval year) of drugs. In the studies based on longitudinal disease-level data,
pharmaceutical innovation was measured by the number of drugs previously approved to treat a disease. Vintage is
a superior measure of pharmaceutical innovation, since longevity should be more strongly related to drugs actually
used than it is to drugs that are potentially available (i.e. previously approved).
                                                                                                     5


II.     A model of longevity


        I hypothesize the following model of longevity:


        LONGEVITYct =  VINTAGEct +  Zct + c + t + ct                                   (1)

where

 LONGEVITYct = a measure of longevity in country c in year t
   VINTAGEct = a measure of the vintage of prescription drugs used in country c in
             year t
         Zct = a vector of other attributes (e.g. income, education, risk factors,
             health expenditure) of country c in year t
         c = a fixed effect for country c
          t = a fixed effect for year t
         ct = a disturbance

The country fixed effects control for unobserved determinants of longevity that vary across
countries but are constant (or very stable) over time; the year fixed effects control for unobserved
determinants of longevity that change over time but are invariant across countries. Eq. (1) is a
difference-in-differences model: a positive and significant estimate of  would signify that
countries with larger increases in vintage had larger longevity increases, controlling for changes
in other included attributes.
        As explained below, there are only two years (2000 and 2009) for which data on
LONGEVITY and VINTAGE are both available. Versions of eq. (1) may be written for each of
these two years:
        LONGEVITYc,2000 =  VINTAGEc,2000 +  Zc,2000 + c + 2000 + c,2000                (2)

        LONGEVITYc,2009 =  VINTAGEc,2009 +  Zc,2009 + c + 2009 + c,2009                (3)

When we subtract eq. (2) from eq. (3), the country fixed effects vanish:

        LONGEVITYc = VINTAGEc            + Zc         +     + c               (4)

where, for example,LONGEVITYc = LONGEVITYc,2009 - LONGEVITYc,2000 and  = 2009 -
2000. Eq. (4) indicates that the 2000-2009 change in longevity in country c depends on the
change in drug vintage and the changes in other determinants of longevity in country c.
                                                                                                                  6


        In eq. (4), pharmaceutical innovation (the change in drug vintage) is treated as exogenous
with respect to longevity growth. If we were examining the relationship between pharmaceutical
innovation and longevity growth at the global level, “reverse causality” (from longevity growth
to pharmaceutical innovation) might pose a serious problem. An increase in longevity increases
the number of consumers of (or size of the market for) pharmaceutical products, especially the
number of elderly consumers; as shown in Figure 1, pharmaceutical consumption rises sharply
with age. As previous investigators (Acemoglu and Linn (2004), Cerda (2007)) have shown,
increases in market size tend to induce more drug development. But most countries are “small
open economies”9 with respect to pharmaceutical innovation: they participate in international
trade of pharmaceutical products, but are small enough that they have little effect on global drug
development. Civan and Maloney (2006) found that global drug development depends only on
the size of the U.S. market, not the sizes of markets in other high-income or developing
countries; Lichtenberg (2005a) obtained similar results. Longevity growth in most countries
(even countries with large populations such as Indonesia and Mexico) is therefore likely to have
a negligible effect on the number of new drugs used by their residents.
Sources of international variation in drug vintage growth. There are several reasons why the
increase in drug vintage (VINTAGE) is likely to vary across countries. Danzon et al (2005)
demonstrated that both the probability and timing of the launch of a new drug in a country
depends on the expected price of the drug (which is influenced by the regulatory environment)
and the size of the market. They analyzed the effect of price regulation on the timing of launches
in 25 major markets, including 14 EU countries, of 85 new chemical entities (NCEs) launched
between 1994 and 1998. Their results indicated that countries with lower expected prices or
smaller expected market size have fewer launches and longer launch delays, controlling for per
capita income and other country and firm characteristics. Controlling for expected price and
volume, country effects for the likely parallel export countries are significantly negative.10

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_open_economy
10
   Each NCE's expected price and market size in a country are estimated using lagged average price and market size
of other drugs in the same (or related) therapeutic class. We estimate a Cox proportional hazard model of launch in
each country, relative to first global launch. Only 55% of the potential launches occur. The US leads with 73
launches, followed by Germany (66) and the UK (64). Only 13 NCEs are launched in Japan, 26 in Portugal and 28
in New Zealand. Because a low price in one market may ‘spill-over’ to other markets, through parallel trade and
external referencing, manufacturers may rationally prefer longer delay or non-launch to accepting a relatively low
price.
                                                                                                    7


       The rate of pharmaceutical innovation varies across diseases. Therefore, even if the
drugs used to treat a given disease were the same in different countries, heterogeneity of
countries with respect to the nature of diseases afflicting the population would cause the increase
in drug vintage to vary across countries. Moreover, due to physician practice variation, the drugs
used to treat a given disease are likely to be different (and to change at different rates) in
different countries.
Other potential determinants of longevity. I will control for a number of other country attributes
that some previous studies have indicated may be important determinants of longevity:
      income (real per capita GDP in constant 2000 US$)
      unemployment rate
      education (mean years of schooling, 15+, total)
      urbanization rate
      real per capita health expenditure (public and private)
      DPT immunization rate (% of children ages 12-23 months)
      risk factors (HIV prevalence (% of population ages 15-49) and tuberculosis incidence)
   Although the effects on longevity of at least some of these variables might seem obvious, the
effects of some of them are theoretically ambiguous, or there is mixed evidence about their
effects. I briefly review some of this evidence below.

Real income. Cutler, Deaton and Lleras-Muney (2006) observed that, “in both the time-series
and the cross-section data, there is a strong correlation between income per capita and mortality
rates, a correlation that also exists within countries, where richer, better-educated people live
longer.” However, based on their review of the literature, they “downplay direct causal
mechanisms running from income to health,” and “tentatively identify the application of
scientific advance and technical progress (some of which is induced by income and facilitated by
education) as the ultimate determinant of health.” Deaton and Paxson (2004)’s examination of
patterns of mortality, income, and income inequality in the United States and in Britain since
1950 did “not suggest any simple relationship between income growth and the decline in
mortality, nor between income inequality and mortality rates. In the United States, the period of
slowest income growth saw substantial accelerations in the rate mortality decline.” Lichtenberg
(2010, 2012) found no correlation and in some cases a negative correlation across states between
income growth and longevity growth, both in the U.S. and in Germany.
                                                                                                    8


Unemployment rate: Mean income tends to decline when the unemployment rate rises.
Therefore, if income had a positive effect on longevity, one would expect mortality rates to rise
when the unemployment rate rises. But Ruhm (2005) has shown that the death rate rises during
periods of low unemployment rates, and it falls when the unemployment rate goes up.
Education. More educated people tend to have longer life expectancy. In 2007, the life
expectancy at age 25 of Americans with bachelor’s degree or higher education was about 9 years
longer than that of Americans with no high school diploma (Source: National Health Interview
Survey Linked Mortality File, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2011/fig32.pdf). However,
cross-sectional correlations between longevity and either income or education may substantially
overestimate the effect of socioeconomic status per se on longevity. For example, the positive
correlation between income and longevity may reflect the effect of health on income (“reverse
causality”) as well as the effect of income on health. Almond and Mazumder (2006) argue that,
“although it is well known that there is a strong association between education and health, much
less is known about how these factors are connected, and whether the relationship is causal.”
Lleras-Muney (2005) provided perhaps the strongest evidence that education has a causal effect
on health. Using state compulsory school laws as instruments, Lleras-Muney found large effects
of education on mortality. Almond and Mazumder (2006) revisited these results, noting they
were not robust to state time trends, even when the sample was vastly expanded and a coding
error rectified. They employed a dataset containing a broad array of health outcomes and found
that when using the same instruments, the pattern of effects for specific health conditions
appeared to depart markedly from prominent theories of how education should affect health.
They also found suggestive evidence that vaccination against smallpox for school age children
may account for some of the improvement in health and its association with education.

Urbanization: Leon (2008) disputes the largely negative view in the epidemiological and public
health literature of the population health impact of cities and urbanization in the contemporary
world.
Risk factors. Although a rise in the incidence of HIV would be expected to reduce longevity,
one would not necessarily expect an inverse correlation between HIV prevalence and
                                                                                                     9


longevity.11 Advances in the treatment of HIV/AIDS are expected to increase survival
(longevity) of AIDS patients, hence the number of people living with HIV (prevalence).
           The World Bank Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) database contains some data on
other risk factors, such as the number of malaria cases reported, diabetes prevalence, and
smoking prevalence. Unfortunately, data on these risk factors is missing so frequently that it is
infeasible to include them in the longevity models we estimate, or to investigate their correlation
with pharmaceutical innovation. However, more complete data on the following risk factors are
available for OECD countries from the OECD Health database:
          BMI_GT25: Overweight or obese population, self-reported, % of total population
          BMI_GT30: Obese population, self-reported, % of total population
          TOBACCO: Tobacco consumption, % of population aged 15+ who are daily smokers
          ALCOHOL: Alcohol consumption, liters per capita (15+)

To determine whether growth in these risk factors was correlated across countries with
pharmaceutical innovation (growth in VINTAGE), we estimated models of the following form,
using annual data during the period 1999-2009:

           ln(RISKct) =  POST1990%ct + c + t + ct                                        (5)

where RISK = BMI_GT25, BMI_GT30, TOBACCO, or ALCOHOL, and POST1990% is the
quantity-weighted-mean fraction of pharmaceutical products sold in country c in year t that were
launched after 1990.12 Eq. (5) was estimated by weighted least squares, weighting by POPct (the
population of country c in year t); disturbances were clustered within countries. The results are
shown in Table 1.
           The increase in drug vintage was not correlated across OECD countries with the growth
in obesity, tobacco use, or alcohol use. It was significantly positively correlated with growth in
the fraction of the population that was either overweight or obese (whose mean value was 54%),
but Flegal et al (2005) concluded that “overweight [is] not associated with excess mortality.”
Therefore, failure to control for these variables in the longevity growth equation (eq. (4)) is
unlikely to bias estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity growth.
Non-pharmaceutical medical innovation. I hypothesize that the health and longevity of a
population depends on how technologically advanced the non-pharmaceutical as well as

11
     The World Bank publishes data on HIV prevalence, but not on HIV incidence.
12
     Measurement of POST1990% will be described in detail below.
                                                                                                                 10


pharmaceutical medical goods and services its members use are. Unfortunately, non-
pharmaceutical medical innovation is much more difficult to measure than pharmaceutical
innovation. However, data on one important type of non-pharmaceutical medical innovation—
advanced imaging equipment—is available for OECD countries during the period 1999-2009
from the OECD Health database. Two indicators contained in that database are the number of
Computed Tomography (CT) scanners and the number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
units per million population.13 To investigate the correlation across countries between the
diffusion of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical medical innovations, we estimated models
of the following form, using annual data during the period 1999-2009:

        ln(IMAGEct) =  POST1990%ct + c + t + ct                                                        (6)

where IMAGE = the number of CT scanners, the number of MRI units, or the sum of the number
of CT scanners and MRI units, all defined per million population.14 Eq. (6) was estimated by
weighted least squares, weighting by POPct; disturbances were clustered within countries. The
results are shown in Table 2.
        The increase in drug vintage is positively correlated across OECD countries with growth
in the number of MRI units per million population. However, it is negatively correlated with
growth in the number of CT scanners per million population, and it is not significantly correlated
with growth in the overall quantity of advanced imaging equipment (CT + MRI) per million
population.
        Lichtenberg (2013c, Appendix 2) used longitudinal disease-level measures of non-
pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical medical innovation for the U.S. during the period 1997-2007
to assess whether rates of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical medical innovation are
correlated across diseases. He measured the fraction of non-drug and non-imaging outpatient
and inpatient medical procedures performed that were ‘‘new’’ (post-1991) procedures, by

imaging” (as opposed to “standard imaging”) procedures in its Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) health

Lichtenberg (2010) found that life expectancy increased more rapidly in U.S. states where the fraction of Medicare
diagnostic imaging procedures that were advanced procedures increased more rapidly, and Lichtenberg (2012)
found that the age-adjusted mortality rate declined more rapidly in German states with larger increases in the per
capita number of CT scanners.
14
   On average, there were almost twice as many CT scanners as there were MRI units during the period 1999-2009
(sample mean values are 22 and 14 per million people, respectively), but the number of MRI units increased more
rapidly.
                                                                                                       11


disease and year; a ‘‘new’’ procedure was defined as a procedure whose code did not exist in
1991. His estimates indicated that the rate of pharmaceutical innovation was uncorrelated across
diseases with rates of innovation in imaging and other procedures. This suggests that failure to
control for non-pharmaceutical medical innovation in the longevity growth equation (eq. (4)) is
unlikely to bias estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity growth.


III.    Measurement of longevity and pharmaceutical innovation



Longevity measurement. Beginning with the year 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO)
began producing annual life tables for all Member States. These life tables form the basis of all
WHO's estimates about mortality patterns and levels worldwide. Life tables have been
developed for all Member States for the reference year 1990, 2000 and 2009 starting with a
systematic review of all available evidence from surveys, censuses, sample registration systems,
population laboratories and vital registration on levels and trends in under-five and adult
mortality rates. WHO applies standard methods to the analysis of Member State data to ensure
comparability of estimates across countries.
       I will analyze two types of measures contained in the WHO life tables: life expectancy at
different ages (0, 25, 45, 65), and survival from age a0 to age a1 (birth to 25, 25 to 65, 65 to 75,
and birth to 75). Life expectancy at a given age reflects mortality (or survival) at all subsequent
ages. For example, life expectancy at birth depends on mortality rates among the elderly. I
examine age-specific survival rates as well as life expectancy because the effect of
pharmaceutical innovation on survival rates may vary across age groups. As shown in Figure 1,
which is based on data from Denmark, utilization of prescription drugs rises sharply with age:
per capita consumption of medicines by people age 75-79 is over 10 times that of people age 25-
29. The effect of pharmaceutical innovation on survival rate of young people may be much
smaller than its effect on the survival rate of older people; it may even be zero.
Pharmaceutical innovation measurement. I construct three alternative measures of
pharmaceutical innovation from the IMS Health MIDAS database, which provides annual data
on the quantity (number of “standard dose units”) of every prescription drug product sold in each
                                                                                                                   12


country during the period 1999-2010.15 The database also indicates the molecules (active
ingredients) contained in each product, and the world launch year of most molecules (world
launch years of some (apparently very old) molecules are unknown). The three alternative
measures are:
       POST1990%ct = the quantity-weighted fraction of products sold in country c in
                   year t that were launched after 1990

       POST1980%ct = the quantity-weighted fraction of products sold in country c in
                   year t that were launched after 1980

 LAUNCH_YEARct = the quantity-weighted-mean launch year of products sold in
               country c in year t

The methodology used to construct these measures is described in Appendix A.


IV.      Descriptive statistics


         Descriptive statistics (population weighted) for 30 countries on the levels of variables in
2000 and 2009 are shown in Table 3. (Complete data on longevity, pharmaceutical use, and
other variables, by country and year, are shown in Appendix Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.)
The first part of the table shows statistics on longevity. Life expectancy at birth increased by 1.6
years, from 74.1 to 75.7 years, between 2000 and 2009. In 2000, life expectancy at birth ranged
from 56.3 years in South Africa to 81.3 years in Japan. Life expectancy at age 65 increased by
0.8 years, on average. The probability of surviving from birth to age 75 increased from 59.8% in
2000 to 63.2% in 2009. Most of that increase was due to an increase in the probability of
surviving from age 65 to age 75.
         The next part of Table 3 shows statistics on pharmaceutical use. In general, medicines in
use tend to be quite old. In 2000, the quantity-weighted mean world launch year of drugs was
1946.5, i.e. the average drug consumed was more than half a century old. Moreover, this

15
   The number of standard ‘dose’ units sold is determined by taking the number of counting units sold divided by the
standard unit factor which is the smallest common dose of a product form as defined by IMS HEALTH. For
example, for oral solid forms the standard unit factor is one tablet or capsule whereas for syrup forms the standard
unit factor is one teaspoon (5 ml) and injectable forms it is one ampoule or vial. Other measures of quantity, such as
the number of patients using the drug, prescriptions for the drug, or defined daily doses of the drug, are not
available.
                                                                                                                13


calculation excludes drugs with unknown world launch years, which tend to be quite old. The
difference between the mean launch years of drugs used in 2000 in Indonesia (1928.0) and the
Netherlands (1960.5) was over 32 years. The mean launch year of drugs increased by 4.7 years
between 2000 and 2009. About 28% of the drugs consumed in 2009 had been launched after
1970; 18% had been launched after 1980, and 8% had been launched after 1990. Figure 2
depicts the quantity-weighted-mean fraction of products sold in 2009 that were launched after
1990 (POST1990%), by country. Figure 3 shows that there is a highly significant positive
relationship across 26 countries between the number of new chemical entities launched during
1982-2001 and POST1980% in 2000.16
        The remainder of Table 3 shows statistics on other variables included in out model of
longevity. Mean real per capita GDP and years of schooling both increased modestly (by 4.4%
and 5.8%, respectively) during the period 2000-2009. Mean real per capita health expenditure
increased much more rapidly (by 32.0%).
        Descriptive statistics (2009 population weighted) for 30 countries on 2000-2009 changes
in variables are shown in Table 4. Coefficients of correlation between changes in two alternative
measures of pharmaceutical innovation and changes in other variables in the longevity growth
model are shown in Table 5. There is a significant correlation between the change in the fraction
of post-1990 drugs (POST1990%) and just two variables: the log change in GDP per capita,
and the change in urbanization rate. Both correlations are negative: countries with higher GDP
growth had smaller increases in the fraction of post-1990 drugs. Table 5 also indicates that
countries with larger increases in educational attainment had smaller increases in the quantity-
weighted mean launch year of drugs consumed.
        Table 6 shows the top 25 post-1990 molecules, ranked by number of standard units in 30
sample countries in 2010.




16
  Data on the number of new chemical entities (NCEs) launched during 1982-2001were obtained from Table 1 of
Lichtenberg (2005b). Japan and Italy had the most NCEs launched (422); Malaysia had the fewest (122). The
regression equation shown in Figure 3 indicates that the difference in NCEs (422 – 122) would be associated with a
difference in POST1980% of .135 (= .0045 * 300). As shown in Appendix Table 2, the values of POST1980% in
2000 for Italy, Japan, and Malaysia were 20%, 22%, and 5%, respectively.
                                                                                                                   14


V.       Empirical results


         Estimates of the longevity change model (eq. (4)) are presented in Table 7. I analyze 8
different measures of the dependent (longevity change) variable: the change in life expectancy at
birth and at ages 25, 45, and 65 (LE0, LE25, LE45, LE65, respectively), and the log
change in the probability of survival from birth to 25, 25 to 65, 65 to 75, and birth to 75. For
each dependent variable, I estimate two versions of the model: one in which VINTAGE is the
only regressor (in which the vector  is constrained to equal zero), and one that includes the other
potential determinants of longevity change (Z) described earlier. I also include an additional
regressor: the change in the log of the per capita quantity of prescription drugs (q_rx);
VINTAGE might be considered as the change in the average quality of prescription drugs.17
         All equations were estimated by weighted least squares, weighting by 2009 country
population. The data exhibit heteroskedasticity: the variance of LONGEVITY is larger for
small countries than it is for large countries. Heteroscedasticity can cause ordinary least squares
estimates of the variance (and, thus, standard errors) of the coefficients to be biased, possibly
above or below the true or population variance.18 However, the weighted least squares estimates
are not very different from ordinary least squares estimates.
         In the models presented in Table 7, the measure of VINTAGE is POST1990%. After
presenting these estimates, I will present (in Table 8) estimates of longevity change models
based on two alternative measures of VINTAGE: POST1980% and LAUNCH_YEAR.
         In model 1 in Table 7, the dependent variable is the 2000-2009 change in life expectancy
at birth, and the only regressor is POST1990%. The coefficient on this variable is positive and
highly significant (p-value = 0.008), indicating that countries with larger increases in drug
vintage had larger increases in life expectancy at birth. Model 2 includes the ten other potential
determinants of longevity change discussed above. The coefficients on just two of these


17
   Eminent philosophers and scientists have noted the importance of accounting for both quantity and quality. For
example, in John Stuart Mill’s theory of utilitarianism, both the quantity and the quality of the pleasures resulting
from an action should be considered when making a moral judgment about it. Also, James Clerk Maxwell, the
distinguished Scottish theoretical physicist, said the following: “It was a great step in science when men became
convinced that, in order to understand the nature of things, they must begin by asking, not whether a thing is good or
bad, noxious or beneficial, but of what kind it is? And how much is there of it? Quality and Quantity were then first
recognized as the primary features to be observed in scientific inquiry.”

variables are statistically significant: countries with larger increases in unemployment had larger
increases in life expectancy at birth (a finding consistent with those from some previous studies),
and countries with larger increases in HIV prevalence had smaller increases in life expectancy.
Controlling for the ten other potential determinants of longevity change increases the coefficient
on POST1990% by about 32%. Figure 4 is a bubble plot of the correlation across countries
between the 2000-2009 change in life expectancy at birth and POST1990%, controlling for
changes in other variables.19 It indicates that the strong positive correlation is not due to a small
number of outliers.
        Models 3-8 are similar to models 1-2, in which the change in life expectancy at birth is
replaced by the change in life expectancy at age 25, 45, or 65. In all of these models, the
coefficient on POST1990% is positive and highly significant (p-value < .001). The only other
coefficients that are statistically significant are on HIV_prev in the LE25 equation (model 4),
health_expend in the LE45 equation (model 6), and urban% in the LE45 and LE65
equations (models 6 and 8). Controlling for the ten other potential determinants of longevity
change does not reduce the coefficient on POST1990% by more than 19%.
        In model 9 in Table 7, the dependent variable is the 2000-2009 log change in the
probability of survival from birth to age 25, and the only regressor is POST1990%. The
coefficient on POST1990% is negative and significant. However, when we control (in model
10) for the ten other potential determinants of longevity change, the coefficient on POST1990%
is far from statistically significant (p-value = .728). As discussed earlier, utilization of
prescription drugs is much higher among the elderly than it is among young people, and only a
small fraction of aggregate drug utilization is by young people. It is therefore not surprising that
there is not a significant correlation between our measure of pharmaceutical innovation (which is
based on drugs used by all age groups20) and the log change in the probability of survival from
birth to age 25. There is a positive association between the log change in this probability and

residuals from the population-weighted regression of POST1990% onZ.
20
   Unfortunately, the IMS MIDAS dataset does not contain any information about the age of pharmaceutical
consumers, so it is not feasible to construct age-specific measures of pharmaceutical innovation. However, as
Acemoglu and Linn (2004) showed, drugs in some therapeutic classes (e.g. antiinfectives) tend to be predominantly
used by young people, whereas drugs in other therapeutic classes (e.g. antineoplastics) tend to be predominantly
used by old people. Hence data on the therapeutic classes of drugs could be used to assign drugs to different age
groups. This is a task for future research.
                                                                                                    16


changes in per capita income, educational attainment, and the unemployment rate, and a negative
association with the change in per capita health expenditure.
          Models 11-16 are similar to models 9-10, in which the log change in the probability of
survival from birth to age 25 is replaced by the log changes in the probability of survival from 25
to 65, 65 to 75, and birth to 75. When other potential determinants of longevity are included (in
models 12, 14, and 16), the coefficient on POST1990% is positive and significant (p-value <
.020). Countries with larger increases in drug vintage had larger increases in the probability of
survival from 25 to 65, 65 to 75, and birth to 75. The only other coefficients that are statistically
significant are on HIV_prev in the 25-to-65 and birth-to-75 survival equations (models 12 and
16), and urban% in the 65-to-75 survival equation (model 14).
          In the models presented in Table 7, the measure of VINTAGE is POST1990%. Table
8 presents estimates of coefficients on VINTAGE in the longevity change model (eq. (4)) based
on 2 alternative measures of VINTAGE: POST1980% and LAUNCH_YEAR. To conserve
space, I do not report estimates of the coefficients on all of the covariates included in these
models. To facilitate comparison, panel A of Table 8 reproduces the coefficients on
POST1990% in models 2, 4,…,16 of Table 4. Panel B of Table 8 displays the corresponding
coefficients on POST1980% when that variable is substituted for POST1990%. The
coefficient on POST1980% is positive and significant (p-value < .026) in all models except the
model of the log change in the probability of survival from birth to 25. Panel C of Table 8
displays the corresponding coefficients on LAUNCH_YEAR when that variable is substituted
for POST1990%. Once again, the coefficient on LAUNCH_YEAR is positive and significant
(p-value < .055) in all models except the model of the log change in the probability of survival
from birth to 25.
          As stated in the introduction, a number of previous studies have examined the impact of
pharmaceutical innovation on longevity. Table 9 compares estimates of the marginal effect of
drug vintage on longevity (LONGEVITY/LAUNCH_YEAR) from the present study
(reproduced from Panel C of Table 8) with estimates from four previous studies.21 This study’s
estimate of the effect of LAUNCH_YEAR on life expectancy at birth (.121) is similar to the
estimate (.135) in Lichtenberg (2011), which was based on longitudinal U.S. state-level data. It

21
     Some previous studies did not provide estimates of LONGEVITY/LAUNCH_YEAR.
                                                                                                    17


is about 33% lower than the estimate (.182) of the effect of LAUNCH_YEAR on mean age at
death in Lichtenberg and Duflos (2008), which was based on longitudinal Australian disease-
level data, and about 40% lower than the estimate (.208) of the effect of LAUNCH_YEAR on
life expectancy at birth in Lichtenberg (2012), which was based on longitudinal German state-
level data. This study’s estimate of the effect of LAUNCH_YEAR on life expectancy at age 65
(.076) is similar to the estimate (.066) in Lichtenberg (2013b), which was based on cross-
sectional patient-level data on elderly American community residents. Hence, this study’s
estimates of the marginal effect of drug vintage on longevity are similar to those in two previous
studies, and smaller than those in two other studies.


VI.     Discussion


       The estimates in Tables 7 and 8 indicate that life expectancy at all ages and survival rates
above age 25 increased faster in countries with larger increases in drug vintage (measured in
three different ways), controlling for an extensive set of other factors. Now I will use those
estimates to assess both (1) how much of the global growth in life expectancy was due to
pharmaceutical innovation, and (2) the extent to which international differences in life
expectancy in 2009 were attributable to differences in drug vintage.
       As shown in Table 4, for the 30 countries in our sample, between 2000 and 2009
population-weighted mean life expectancy at birth increased by 1.74 years, and POST1990%
increased by .050. The coefficient on POST1990% in model 2 of Table 7 is 25.36. This implies
that the increase in life expectancy at birth due to the increase in the fraction of drugs consumed
that were launched after 1990 was POST1990% = 25.36 * .050 = 1.27 years. This is 73% of
the actual increase in life expectancy at birth. Similar calculations can be performed for life
expectancy at higher ages, and alternative measures of vintage. The results are shown in Table
10.
       When either POST1990% or POST1980% is used as the vintage measure, the increase in
life expectancy at age 25 due to the increase in drug vintage exceeds the actual increase in life
expectancy at age 25. This is possible because HIV prevalence and urbanization increased
(Table 3), and the estimates in Table 7 imply that these trends may have reduced longevity.
Moreover, obesity has increased (at least in OECD countries), and previous research (Flegal et al
                                                                                                                 18


(2005)) indicates that this has also reduced longevity.22 Although per capita income and
educational attainment have also increased, there does not appear to be a consensus among
scholars about the effects of these trends on longevity growth, and the estimates in Table 7 and in
other studies suggest that they have not made a contribution to survival gains among adults.
        Estimates of the increase in life expectancy attributable to pharmaceutical innovation
based on the POST1980% vintage measure are similar to, but slightly smaller than, estimates
based on the POST1990% vintage measure. Estimates based on the LAUNCH_YEAR vintage
measure are considerably smaller—less than half the size of estimates based on the POST1990%
vintage measure. This may be due to the fact that world launch dates of many (old) molecules
are unknown, so that LAUNCH_YEAR is a much noisier measure of vintage than POST1990%
or POST1980%.23
        To assess the extent to which international differences in life expectancy in 2009 were
attributable to differences in drug vintage, we will compare the top 5 countries (ranked by
POST1990% in 2009), as depicted in Figure 2, with the bottom 5 countries (ranked by the same
criterion). As shown in Table 11, the difference between these groups in POST1990% was 0.13.
Since the coefficient on POST1990% in model 2 of Table 4 is 25.36, this implies that the
difference between these two groups in life expectancy at birth due to the difference in the
fraction of drugs consumed that were launched after 1990 was POST1990% = 25.36 * .13 =
3.4 years. This is 37% of the actual difference (9.1 years) between these two groups in life
expectancy at birth.


VII.     Summary


        This study examined the impact of pharmaceutical innovation, as measured by the
vintage of prescription drugs used, on longevity using longitudinal, country-level data on 30
developing and high-income countries during the period 2000-2009. The analysis was based on
data drawn from several reliable databases: data on the utilization of over 89,000 pharmaceutical
products from the IMS Health MIDAS database; life tables produced by the World Health


22
   Ford et al (2007) found that increases in body-mass index and the prevalence of diabetes increased the number of
U.S. deaths from coronary disease by 8% and 10%, respectively, during the period 1980-2000.
23
   Measurement error in the vintage measure is likely to bias its coefficient in eq. (4) towards zero.

Organization; and indicators of socioeconomic status, health expenditure, risk factors, and other
variables from three World Bank databases and the OECD Health database.
       The difference-in-differences estimation approach controlled for unobserved
determinants of longevity that varied across countries but were constant (or very stable) over
time, and for unobserved determinants of longevity that changed over time but were invariant
across countries. I also controlled for a number of time-varying country attributes that some
previous studies have indicated may be important determinants of longevity: real per capita
income, the unemployment rate, mean years of schooling, the urbanization rate, real per capita
health expenditure (public and private), the DPT immunization rate among children ages 12-23
months, and some risk factors (HIV prevalence and tuberculosis incidence).
       I analyzed two types of measures contained in the WHO life tables: life expectancy at
different ages (0, 25, 45, 65), and survival from age a0 to age a1 (birth to 25, 25 to 65, 65 to 75,
and birth to 75). The estimates indicated that life expectancy at all ages and survival rates above
age 25 increased faster in countries with larger increases in drug vintage (measured in three
different ways), controlling for an extensive set of other factors. The increase in drug vintage
was the only variable that was significantly related to all of these measures of longevity growth.
Controlling for all of the other potential determinants of longevity did not reduce the vintage
coefficient by more than 20%.
       My measures of pharmaceutical innovation (which are based on drugs used by all age
groups) were not related to the change in the probability of survival from birth to age 25. This is
not surprising, since utilization of prescription drugs is much higher among the elderly than it is
among young people, and only a small fraction of aggregate drug utilization is by young people.
       Due to data limitations, certain risk factors (obesity, tobacco use, or alcohol use) could
not be included in the model, but I showed that the increase in drug vintage was not correlated
across OECD countries with the growth in these risk factors. It was also not correlated with a
measure of non-pharmaceutical medical innovation: the growth in the overall quantity of
advanced imaging equipment (CT scanners and MRI units) per million population.
       I used the estimates of the longevity growth model to assess both (1) how much of the
global growth in life expectancy was due to pharmaceutical innovation, and (2) the extent to
which international differences in life expectancy in 2009 were attributable to differences in drug
vintage. For the 30 countries in our sample, between 2000 and 2009 population-weighted mean
                                                                                                     20


life expectancy at birth increased by 1.74 years. The estimates indicate that the increase in life
expectancy at birth due to the increase in the fraction of drugs consumed that were launched after
1990 was 1.27 years—73% of the actual increase in life expectancy at birth. Some estimates
imply that the increase in life expectancy at age 25 due to the increase in drug vintage exceeds
the actual increase in life expectancy at age 25. This is possible because HIV prevalence and
urbanization increased, and our estimates imply that these trends may have reduced longevity.
Moreover, obesity has increased (at least in OECD countries), and previous research indicates
that this has also reduced longevity. Although per capita income and educational attainment
have also increased, there does not appear to be a consensus among scholars about the effects of
these trends on longevity growth, and our estimates and those in some other studies suggest that
they have not made a contribution to survival gains among adults.
       To assess the extent to which international differences in life expectancy in 2009 were
attributable to differences in drug vintage, I compared the top 5 countries (ranked by drug
vintage in 2009) with the bottom 5 countries (ranked by the same criterion). Life expectancy at
birth in the top 5 countries (Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain) was 9.1 years higher
than it was in the bottom 5 countries (Morocco, Egypt, Colombia, Thailand, Indonesia). My
estimates imply that 37% (3.4 years) of this difference was due to the difference in drug vintage.
       In recent years, several emerging economies, including India, Argentina and the
Philippines, have passed laws placing strict limits on pharmaceutical patents, and Brazil and
Thailand have been issuing compulsory licenses for AIDS drugs for years under multilateral
agreements that allow such actions on public health grounds (Harris and Thomas, 2013). While
such policies may benefit patients in those countries in the short run, in the long run, they are
likely to diminish incentives for new drug development, particularly because sales in emerging
markets like Brazil and China are expected to account for 30 percent of global pharmaceutical
spending by 2016, up from 20 percent in 2011, according to IMS Health. The evidence presented
in this paper indicates that reduced investment in pharmaceutical innovation would have adverse
long-term effects on longevity.

                                Pharmaceutical innovation measurement


          In this Appendix I describe the construction of measures of pharmaceutical innovation
from the IMS Health MIDAS database, which provides annual data on the quantity (number of
“standard dose units”) of every prescription drug product sold in each country during the period
1999-2010.24 The database also indicates the molecules (active ingredients) contained in each
product, and the world launch year of most molecules (world launch years of some (apparently
very old) molecules are unknown).
          I use a two-step procedure to measure pharmaceutical innovation.25 The first step is to
measure the vintage of each “international product”:26


 PROD_YEARp = m INGRED_OFpm LAUNCH_YEARm
                      m INGRED_OFpm
where

        PROD_YEARp = the vintage of product p, i.e. the (mean) launch year of the
                   active ingredient(s) of product p
       INGRED_OFpm = 1 if product p contains molecule m27
                   = 0 otherwise
     LAUNCH_YEARm = the world launch year of molecule m




24
   The number of standard ‘dose’ units sold is determined by taking the number of counting units sold divided by the
standard unit factor which is the smallest common dose of a product form as defined by IMS HEALTH. For
example, for oral solid forms the standard unit factor is one tablet or capsule whereas for syrup forms the standard
unit factor is one teaspoon (5 ml) and injectable forms it is one ampoule or vial. Other measures of quantity, such as
the number of patients using the drug, prescriptions for the drug, or defined daily doses of the drug, are not
available.
25
   In this methodology, a new molecule is considered an innovation, but a new combination of existing molecules is
not. The IMS Health MIDAS database identifies the world launch years of new molecules but not of new
combinations of existing molecules. Food and Drug Administration (2013) data indicate that during the period
1990-2004, the number of new molecules approved in the U.S. was over 5 times as large as the number of new
combinations (431 vs. 79). Moreover, the number of new “priority-review” molecules approved in the U.S. was
over 30 times as large as the number of new priority-review combinations (183 vs. 6). “Priority-review” products
are those believed to offer “significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis, or
prevention of a disease”; “standard-review” products “appear to have therapeutic qualities similar to those of one or
more already marketed drugs.”
26
   There are over 89,000 international products. (m INGRED_OFpm) = the number of active ingredients of product
p. About 28% of standard units are for combination drugs.
27
   There are approximately 5600 molecules. IMS provides world launch dates for about 1600 of these molecules.
                                                                                                                 25


The second step is to measure the quantity-weighted-mean launch year of products sold in
country c in year t:

LAUNCH_YEARct = p Qpct PROD_YEARp
                        p Qpct
where

 LAUNCH_YEARct = the quantity-weighted-mean launch year of products sold in
               country c in year t
          Qpct = the quantity (number of standard dose units) of product p sold in
               country c in year t


The world launch year of some molecules is not known. But it is safe to assume that molecules
with missing world launch years are generally old molecules, e.g. that they were not launched
after 1990.28 Therefore it is useful to define the following binary variable:

      POST1990m = 1 if LAUNCH_YEARm > 1990
                = 0 if LAUNCH_YEARm < 1990 or LAUNCH_YEARm is unknown


An alternative measure of the vintage of each “international product” based on this binary
measure is:

     POST1990%p = m INGRED_OFpm POST1990m
                        m INGRED_OFpm


where

       POST1990%p = the fraction of product p’s active ingredients that were launched
                       after 1990
An alternative measure of the mean vintage of pharmaceuticals consumed in a country in a given
year is:

     POST1990%ct = p Qpct POST1990%p
                           p Qpct

28
   The quantity-weighted-average fraction of products with molecules with missing launch years declined from
31.6% in 1999 to 27.5% in 2010. The quantity-weighted-average fraction of products with molecules with missing
launch years varies considerably across countries: it exceeds 40% for Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, and
is below 16% for Greece, Sweden, and the Netherlands.
                                                                                               26


where

     POST1990%ct = the quantity-weighted-mean fraction of products sold in country
                 c in year t that were launched after 1990


POST1990%ct can be computed using data on all products, whereas LAUNCH_YEARct can be
computed only using data on products containing molecules with known launch years. We also
calculated measures analogous to POST1990%ct using different launch-year cutoff values, e.g.
POST1980%ct = the quantity-weighted-mean fraction of products sold in country c in year t that
were launched after 1980.
