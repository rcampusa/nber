In a seminal contribution, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) argue property-rights institutions
powerfully affect national income, using estimated mortality rates of early European settlers to instrument
capital expropriation risk. However 36 of the 64 countries in their sample are assigned mortality rates
from other countries, typically based on mistaken or conflicting evidence. Also, incomparable mortality
rates from populations of laborers, bishops, and soldiers - often on campaign - are combined in a manner
favoring their hypothesis. When these data issues are controlled for, the relationship between mortality
and expropriation risk lacks robustness, and instrumental-variable estimates become unreliable, often
with infinite confidence intervals.

Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson’s seminal paper (2001) – henceforth AJR – has
reinvigorated debate over the relationship between property rights and economic growth.
Following research by Knack and Keefer (1995), Mauro (1995), La Porta et al. (1998),
Hall and Jones (1999), Rodrik (1999) and others, AJR endeavor to determine the causal
effect of institutions that protect property rights, measured by risk of capital
expropriation, on economic performance. This endeavor is complicated by the fact that
the correlation between institutional and economic measures may reflect the reverse
influence of economic growth on institutions or the simultaneous influence of omitted
variables on both economic output and institutions. To circumvent these problems, AJR
use an instrumental variable (IV) for expropriation risk in an equation determining GDP
per capita across previously colonized countries.
       AJR argue that during the colonial era, Europeans were more likely to settle in
places where they had a lower risk of dying from disease. Colonies in which Europeans
settled developed institutions that protect property better than colonies where Europeans
did not settle. The authors argue that, in the long run, the direct effects of mortality and
European settlement on national income faded, while the indirect effect through property-
rights institutions persisted. Their argument motivates the use of potential European
settler mortality rates as an instrument for the risk of capital expropriation. AJR’s IV
estimates of the effect of expropriation risk on GDP per capita are large, explaining much
of the variation in income across countries.
       The historical sources containing information on mortality rates during colonial
times are thin, which makes constructing a series of potential European settler mortality
rates challenging. AJR construct their series by combining the mortality rates of soldiers
(Curtin 1989, 1998), laborers (Curtin 1995), and bishops (Gutierrez 1986). Researchers
have been eager to use this new series, particularly given its promise as an instrumental
variable for institutions.   Currently, over twenty published articles, and many more
working papers, use AJR’s settler mortality data.
       This paper argues that despite AJR’s ingenuity and diligence, there are a number
of reasons to doubt the reliability and comparability of their European settler mortality


                                               1
rates and the conclusions which depend on them. First, out of 64 countries in their
sample, only 28 countries have mortality rates that originate from within their own
borders. The other 36 countries in the sample are assigned rates based on AJR’s
conjectures as to which countries have similar disease environments. These assignments
are based on weak and sometimes inaccurate foundations. Six assignments are based
upon AJR’s misunderstanding of former names of countries in Africa. Another sixteen
assignments are based on a questionable use of bishop mortality data in Latin America
from Gutierrez (1986), which are based on 19 deaths. Additionally, AJR use the bishop
rates multiplied by a factor of 4.25, a procedure that appears to contradict evidence in
their own sources. At a minimum, the sharing of mortality rates across countries requires
that statistics be corrected for clustering (Moulton, 1990). This correction noticeably
reduces the significance of AJR’s results. If, in the hope of reducing measurement error,
AJR’s 36 conjectured mortality rates are dropped from the sample, the empirical
relationship between expropriation risk and mortality rates weakens substantially,
particularly in the presence of additional covariates.
       Second, AJR’s mortality rates never come from actual European settlers, although
some settler rates are available in their sources. Instead, AJR’s rates come primarily from
European and American soldiers in the nineteenth century. In some countries, AJR use
rates from soldiers at peace in barracks, while in others, they use rates from soldiers on
campaign. Soldiers on campaign typically have higher mortality from disease, and AJR
use campaign rates more often in countries with greater expropriation risk and lower
GDP. Thus, AJR’s measures of mortality artificially favor their hypothesis. In a few
countries, AJR use the maximum mortality rates of African laborers, although these do
not appear comparable with average soldier mortality rates. Controlling for the source of
the mortality rates weakens the empirical relationship between expropriation risk and
mortality rates substantially. Furthermore, if these controls are added and the conjectured
data are removed, the relationship virtually disappears. Additional data provided by AJR
in their Response (2005) do not restore this relationship.
       Without a robust relationship between expropriation risk and mortality rates,


                                              2
AJR’s IV estimates of the effect of expropriation risk on GDP per capita suffer from
weak instrument problems:       point estimates are unstable, and corrected confidence
intervals are often infinite.
        Lastly, AJR’s (2006) defense that their results hold when African observations are
removed is not reassuring. Without conjectured mortality rates, the sample without
Africa contains only 13 observations, and the relationship between mortality and
expropriation risk rests entirely on the inclusion of the “Neo-Europes,” which do not
seem to belong in the sample.

I.      Problems with the Settler Mortality Data

AJR construct their mortality rates in four steps, as described in their data appendix. In
their first step they take average mortality rates from a table in Curtin (1989, pp. 7-8) of
European soldiers from disease (not combat) in the early to mid-nineteenth century. In
step two, AJR add new countries to their sample by using average mortality rates from a
selection of military campaigns in Curtin (1998). AJR state that when more than one rate
is available, they take the earliest rate. In step three, they add peak mortality rates from
Curtin et al. (1995) of African laborers who were moved to foreign disease environments.
Also in step three, AJR assign mortality rates to neighboring countries which they believe
to have similar disease environments. Finally in the fourth step, AJR take the mortality
rates of Latin American bishops in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from
Gutierrez (1986), multiply them by a factor of 4.25 to conform to a rate taken from a
campaign in Mexico, and apply them to sixteen countries.
        Mortality rates are expressed in the number of deaths per year per thousand at
risk, and are catalogued in Table A1.       In order to keep the discussion here brief,
considerable detail is left to my Appendix, available on the NBER website.

A.      The Matching of Mortality Rates to Neighboring Countries

AJR extend their limited data to 64 countries. They state they assign “a mortality number
to a country if it neighbors a country for which we have data and has the same disease
environment,” (Data Appendix, p. 3). However, AJR provide little explanation of how


                                             3
they determine whether countries share similar disease environments. In regions such as
sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, neighboring countries in AJR’s data have widely
differing mortality rates, so their series is sensitive to how they choose neighboring
countries.
         AJR argue that large differences in mortality occur between neighboring countries
“because there exists substantial variation in disease environment, particularly for
malaria, even in neighboring areas” citing differences in microclimates (Data Appendix,
p.1).1 Yet, substantial differences in disease environments undermine AJR’s strategy of
assigning mortality rates to neighboring countries. With the paucity of information they
present, AJR cannot reasonably defend how they assign such different rates to some
neighboring countries, and then share the same rates across others.                            If disease
environments vary little across neighboring countries, then much of the variation in
AJR’s data is due to measurement error, and true mortality rates are likely collinear with
other variables suspected to affect institutions or GDP.
        One set of mortality assignments, illustrated in Figure 1, comes from mortality
rates which are all from French campaigns in western Mali, reported in Curtin (1998).
These assignments are difficult to explain, but appear to originate from a
misunderstanding of changing geographic names for Mali, as explained in my Appendix.
Summarizing briefly,
    •   Mali is assigned a rate of 2940, which is annualized from a severe yellow fever
        epidemic that killed 49 percent of an expeditionary force over two months in 1878
        (p.81).
    •   Niger is assigned a rate of 400, from 1880 to 1883 (p. 85),
    •   Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Angola and Uganda are assigned a rate of 280,
        from 1883 to 1884 (p. 238).
There are two fundamental problems with these assignments. First, since all three rates
come from western Mali, there is no basis for assigning each of these rates to different

1
  This comment arises when AJR a assign a rate of 17.7 to Malaysia and 170 to neighboring Indonesia. In
fact, Curtin (1989, pp.17-18) does not ascribe this difference to microclimates, but rather to the fact that
soldiers were at war in Indonesia.


                                                     4
countries. Second, and more fundamentally, there is no justification for assigning rates
from Mali to countries as far away as Angola and Uganda. The six countries with rates
taken from Mali have neighbors with widely varying rates, from 78.2, in Algeria (which
borders Niger) to 2004 in Nigeria (which borders Niger and Cameroon). This large
variation implies that assigning mortality rates from neighboring countries is very
sensitive to choice.
         The differing rates from Mali raise the question of what rate properly represents
it. According to Curtin (p. 81), the rate of 2940 is an overestimate: because of acquired
immunity, “the annual rate and the rate of loss over two months [490] would have been
about the same.” The second rate of 400 is not representative either as it is “unusually
high because it included the deaths from yellow fever of soldiers who stayed in Saint
Louis [on the coast of Senegal]” (Curtin p. 84). Thus, the third rate of 280 seems to be
the first available rate that represents Mali.2
         AJR’s assignment of mortality rates to sixteen Latin American countries based on
thin data from bishops in Gutierrez (1986) is also worrisome. Gutierrez does not provide
mortality rates by country: rather, he categorizes cities with bishops into low, medium,
and high temperature regions, admitting that he only assumes that cities with similar
temperatures have similar disease environments.3 It is AJR who assign the countries to
the three regions.
         The bishop rates AJR use (p. 39) are based on 4, 5, and 10 deaths out of at-risk
populations of 24, 28.5, and 30.5 bishops in each region over ten years, implying
mortality rates of 16.7, 17.5 and 32.8. These rates are not significantly different from
each other, or from mortality rates of similarly-aged contemporary males in Sweden of
18.32 (Sundärg, 1905), or from soldiers in barracks (15.3) in England or France (20.17)



2
  Curtin (p. 87) singles out a lower rate of 200.24 (1883 to 1888) as campaign rate useful for comparison
with a barracks rate from Senegal . Using that rate instead of 280 only strengthens the results below.
3
  Gutierrez states (p. 33, my translation) “we cannot study in a profound way the influence of climate on the
mortality of Latin-American bishops in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, given the small number of
observations, the diversity of environmental situations of which we do not know well the characteristics,
and finally the lack of knowledge of the diseases which could affect adults having survived the perils of
diseases in infancy and youth.”


                                                     5
(Curtin 1989, p. 7).4 In his abstract, Gutierrez (1986) writes that the life expectancy at
age 40 for bishops was 20.3 years in Latin America relative to 29 years in France,
implying mortality was about 43 percent higher than in Europe, with the difference due
mainly to the high mortality region. Also, bishops in Latin America born in Europe died
at rates slightly lower than those born in the New World.
         Although this evidence suggests that mortality in Latin America was not much
higher than in Europe, AJR scale up all of the bishop rates by 325 percent. AJR’s
justification for this adjustment is that campaigning French soldiers in Mexico from 1862
to 1863 incurred a mortality rate of 71, 4.25 times the low-temperature bishop rate of
16.7.5   In defense of this “benchmarking” method, AJR (2001, p. 1383) claim that
“alternative methods produce remarkably similar results.” However, as I document in my
Appendix, using similar assumptions, alternative benchmarking methods produce
remarkably dissimilar results. Of the many methods possible, AJR report those that
produce relatively high rates. 6
         The countries with mortality rates inferred from Mali and Mexico account for 22
of the 36 countries with conjectured rates. There are other problems with the remaining
14. For Hong Kong, once called “an unhealthy, pestilential, unprofitable and barren
rock” (Cantlie, 1974, p. 480), AJR use a rate of 14.9, belonging to a British force that in
the summer of 1860 campaigned close to Beijing.7 Also, this rate applies only to the
duration of the campaign, not the year. As AJR report in their Response (2005, p. 32),
British soldiers in Hong Kong in peacetime died at a rate of 285 from 1842 to 1845
(Tulloch, 1847, p. 254), 19 times AJR’s original assignment.8


4
  An F-test that all three regions have the same mortality rate is not rejected at a level of 12 percent.
5
   AJR’s extrapolation appears incorrect given their assumptions. First, the rate from Mexico is not
annualized; a more accurate rate, based on the annualized troop strengths in Mexico reported in Reyanud
(1898), is 61. Also, the French soldiers spent more time in Veracruz, a high temperature area, than in
Mexico City, a low temperature area (Reynaud, 1898, pp. 102-22). Benchmarking the annualized rate to the
high temperature area lowers the scaling factor from 4.25 to 1.86.
6
  In their Response (2005, p. 35), AJR propose a benchmarking system which produces a mortality rate for
low-temperature regions of 15.4, close to the original bishop mortality rate of 16.7.
7
   The soldiers did assemble briefly in Hong Kong, but left before the pestilential summer (Elleman, 2001).
8
  AJR cite many valuable additional sources in their Response (2005), including Tulloch (1847), Cantlie
(1974), and others mentioned in my Appendix.

B.       Campaigning Soldiers and African Laborers

The cited works by Curtin are concerned primarily with the health and mortality of
soldiers during the European conquests of the nineteenth century.9 Accordingly, he took
as given the current circumstances and living conditions of the soldiers when comparing
their mortality rates.      These rates do not necessarily provide a good proxy for potential
European settler mortality, which would ideally compare settlers with similar living
conditions, subject to the constraints imposed by their environments. Living conditions
have a large effect on mortality rates from disease. Curtin (1989, pp. 40-61) discusses
how clean water and adequate sewage disposal can drastically lower mortality rates from
waterborne diseases, such as typhoid and other gastrointestinal infections. Adequate
shelter, nutritious food, and quinine prophylactics – long known to protect against
malaria – also lower mortality from disease.
         Variation in disease due to living conditions seriously affects AJR’s mortality
data. One reason for this is that they use the mortality rates (from disease alone) of
soldiers in barracks from some countries, and rates from soldiers on campaign from
others, without adjustment. Yet Curtin carefully distinguishes between what he terms
“barracks rates” and “campaign rates,” asserting (1989, p. 4) that “one of the fundamental
facts of military medical experience [is that] troops in barracks are much healthier than
troops on campaign, even disregarding losses from combat.” Soldiers on campaign took
fewer precautions against disease and were less likely to have safe water, fresh food,
decent shelter, or sewage disposal. Consequently, “The disease toll for soldiers on
campaign was inevitably higher than it was in peacetime,” (Curtin, 1998, p. xi).
         In his writing, Curtin usually discusses whether a mortality rate is from a
campaign or not, making it possible to code a variable indicating which of AJR’s rates
are from a campaign, as discussed in my Appendix. For a given country, campaign rates
tend to be higher than barracks rates, although there is no stable relationship between the
two. Curtin (1998, pp. 221-4) documents how during campaigns mortality from malaria

9
 This is evident in Curtin (1989, p. xiii): “This book is a quantitative study of the relocation costs among
European soldiers in the tropics between about 1815 and 1914,” and the title of Curtin (1998), Disease and
Empire: The Health of European Troops in the Conquest of Africa.


                                                     7
typically increases by more than 100 percent, from gastrointestinal infections by more
than 200 percent, and from typhoid by more than 600 percent, resulting in mortality rates
66 to 2000 percent higher than barracks rates.10 Even in Europe, where barracks rates are
usually below 25 (Curtin, 1989, p. 5), campaign rates rose as high as 332, seen by the
British in the Netherlands in 1809 (Balfour, 1845, p. 198). 11
         The distinction between barracks and campaign rates affects the analysis as AJR
use campaign rates more often in countries with high risk of capital expropriation and
low GDP per capita.12 Thus, measured mortality rates are endogenous: places with lower
future security of property rights and lower output per capita essentially suffer from
positive measurement error in their mortality rates. This creates artificial support for
AJR’s hypothesis that mortality is negatively correlated with expropriation risk and GDP
per capita.13
         The effects of campaigning on mortality are evident in North Africa, where
according to Curtin (1989, p. 17) mortality is similar to Southern Europe in more
peaceful conditions, as seen in AJR’s rate of 16.3 for Malta.14                        Instead, AJR use
campaign rates about four times as high: 63 for Tunisia, 67.8 for Egypt, and 78.2 for
Algeria and Morocco. Most of these deaths were from typhoid and other digestive
diseases, with malaria playing a minor role (Curtin, 1989, p. 36; 1998, pp. 152, 158,



10
   Curtin’s distinction is only two-fold: he uses the terms “peacetime” and “barracks” interchangeably, as
he does with the terms “campaign” and “expedition.” AJR’s three-fold distinction in their later (2005,
2006) work between what they call “peacetime,” “expedition,” and “wartime” rates is their own, not
Curtin’s. AJR claim that peacetime and expedition rates are comparable, contrary to Curtin’s views, but
not with wartime rates. AJR’s distinction seems inappropriate since higher mortality rates during
expeditions and wartime are primarily due to living conditions which differ from those in barracks.
Furthermore, the rates AJR use for Algeria, Indonesia, Mexico, and Sudan are from violent conflicts, which
seem worthy of the term “wartime,” despite AJR’s claims that they do not use wartime rates.
11
   This source is used in AJR (2005), although they do not mention these rates.
12
   At a 2 percent size one rejects the null hypotheses that either expropriation risk or log GDP per capita is
unrelated to variable indicating when a country’s rate is taken from a campaign.
13
   AJR (footnote 17) admit that their data contain measurement error, but state that “this measurement error
does not lead to inconsistent estimates of the effect of institutions on performance.” This is true only if
measurement error is uncorrelated with the error term in the equation determining log GDP per capita.
14
   “Climatically the south shore of the Mediterranean was much like the north shore in Italy or southern
France…The high Algerian figure [78.2] in the 1830s was certainly the result of campaigning in the
conquest period. Within a decade or so, the Algerian death rate was close to the rates of the Mediterranean
islands.” AJR (2005, p. 22) disagree with my interpretation of this passage.


                                                      8
169).15
          A related difficulty arises as AJR inconsistently combine campaign and barracks
rates in the second step of their data construction. AJR state two different rules for how
they select their data: in their original paper, AJR (Data Appendix, p. 2) state that,
“Whenever Curtin provides more than one estimate, we use the earliest available
number.” In their Response (2005), AJR state they take the earliest peacetime rate if a
peacetime rate is available, otherwise they use the earliest “expedition” rate. Yet, as
discussed further in the Appendix, for Sudan, Egypt, and Madagascar AJR choose rates
from Curtin (1998) which violate both of these stated selection rules, as they are from
campaigns and are not the earliest rates available – although they are the highest rates
available.16 As documented in the Appendix, these inconsistent choices strengthen the
empirical relationship between measured mortality and expropriation risk, further
justifying the need to control for the effects of campaigning on measured mortality rates.
          Another source of incomparability comes from AJR’s use of mortality rates from
African laborers, coerced to move to foreign environments under harsh conditions (Curtin
et al., 1995, pp. 463, 491). Comparing rates in Curtin (1968), AJR argue that the laborer
rates provide a lower bound for soldier rates, as black soldiers in Africa had lower
average mortality rates than white soldiers. There are two problems with this argument.
First, it is uses the mortality of black soldiers, not black laborers. Second, the rates
referred to are average rates, but AJR instead use maximum rates available for laborers:
for the Congo they choose a maximum rate of 240 over an average rate of 100; for Kenya
they use a maximum rate of 145, as no average is reported.17


15
   Deaths from digestive diseases also play a large role in the rates for Mexico, India, and Vietnam. This
may have more to do with preexisting poverty than with climate: Curtin (1998, p. 113) writes “Typhoid had
become a ‘tropical disease’ – because the tropical world is poor, not because of climate.” Earle (1979, p.
119) estimates that in Virginia from 1618 to 1624, British settlers suffered a mortality rate of 283, primarily
from dysentery and typhoid. This is far less than the later barracks rate of 15 AJR use for the United States.
Because of these diseases, AJR disregard actual settler mortality rates, mentioned in Curtin (1998, p. 116),
but use similarly impacted mortality rates from campaigning soldiers in poorer countries.
16
   AJR (2005, n. 16) contend that they never changed their stated rule of choosing the first available rate, as
this always meant the first available peacetime rate, stating “We thought this was obvious.” However,
neither rule is applied consistently. Furthermore, AJR use a campaign rate to benchmark the bishop rates.
17
   Quotations from Curtin, (1995) in my Appendix make it clear that the mortality rates are maxima.


                                                      9
II.      Sensitivity of AJR’s Empirical Results

The above discussion raises questions about any empirical results based on AJR’s
mortality data. For the sake of brevity, only results from AJR’s original article (2001) are
examined here.
         AJR’s econometric model can be written as the combination of a first-stage
equation ri = βmi + υi and a second-stage equation yi = αmi + εi, where i indexes colonial
countries, yi is log GDP per capita, ri is expropriation risk, mi is log potential settler
mortality, and υi and εi are error terms, with E[miυi] = 0 by construction.18 IV estimates
require an instrument which is relevant (β ≠ 0) and excludable (E[miεi] = 0). Letting π =
αβ and ξi = αυi + εi, the reduced form of the second stage equation is given by y i = πmi +
ξi . By the principle of indirect least squares, the IV estimator of α is the ratio of the OLS
estimates of π and β, i.e. αˆ IV = πˆ OLS βˆ OLS . The analysis here first considers the OLS
estimate of β, and afterwards the IV estimate of α.
         Because mortality rates are shared by countries, the residuals are correlated
because of clustering effects (see Moulton, 1990). This invalidates the conventional
standard errors and test statistics used by AJR. The standard procedure used to correct
for these clustering effects, as well as heteroscedasticity (Wooldridge, 2001, pp. 152,
191), is applied below.19
         More fundamentally, it is worthwhile to examine how sensitive AJR’s results are
to robustness checks that account for the weaknesses in the data documented above. One
check is to drop countries with conjectured mortality rates that originate from outside
their own borders – including the “benchmarked” Latin American data – and to replace
Mali’s rate of 2940 with the more representative rate of 280.20 If AJR’s theory is true,


18
   Control variables may be accounted for by having all of the above variables refer to the residual
projections of the original variables, after being regressed on the control variables.
19
   AJR do not report clustered standard errors although they mention in their footnote 18 that clustering has
“little effect on the standard errors.” See Table 1, Panel A, for the differences.
20
   The countries kept in this check do not correspond to the countries kept in columns (3) and (4) of AJR’s
Appendix Table A5 labeled “Earliest Available Data”, with 30 observations (31 in their NBER Working
Paper), and which is supposed to correspond to the rates derived from their first two steps. AJR’s sample
retains Niger, Burkina Faso, Guyana, and Singapore although their rates are from elsewhere, while they
omit Ghana and Nigeria, whose rates are native. I also retain Congo and Kenya, since the African laborer


                                                    10
their results should continue to hold in the smaller sample without the conjectured rates.
        A second robustness check, to deal with AJR’s use of different data sources, is to
add two control variables which indicate when mortality rates are taken from
campaigning soldiers or from imported African laborers. These controls weaken AJR’s
results, indicating that comparability problems in AJR’s data indeed bias their results
towards their conclusion.

A.      First-stage Estimates
Table 1 presents the first-stage estimates obtained when one applies the two checks
described above, using the types of controls found in AJR’s original paper. The first five
columns use geographic controls: latitude (measured in absolute degrees), continent
dummies (Asia, Africa, and “Other,” with the Americas as the reference), and omitting
“Neo-Europes” (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States).                            These
correspond to Columns (1), (2), (3), (7), and (8) in Table 4 of AJR’s paper. The
specification in column (6) adds climate controls from Parker (1997), similar to AJR’s
Table 6, column (1), except that it is more parsimonious, using only mean temperature
and minimum monthly rain, rather than four temperature and four humidity variables.
Column (7) controls for the percentage of the population of European descent in 1975,
like AJR’s Table 6, column (3). Column (8) controls for the percentage of the population
living where falciporum malaria is endemic in 1994, as in AJR’s Table 7, column (1).
        The first-stage results with the original data in Panel A report that log mortality is
usually a significant predictor of expropriation risk, although the clustered standard errors
are larger than the homoscedastic ones, making β insignificant at the 10 percent level in
columns (5) and (6).
        In Panel B, the first robustness check is applied, dropping conjectured rates and
correcting the Mali rate.         Normally, using a more accurate sample should reduce
measurement error, counteracting the effects of attenuation, and raising the point estimate
of β. The opposite occurs here as the estimate of β falls, which should not occur unless


rates are derived directly from these countries. These countries should be omitted from AJR’s check, since
they are added in their third step, yet they retain Congo. Gabon is not in AJR’s Appendix Data Table (A2).


                                                   11
the relationship between mortality and expropriation risk is stronger in countries with
                       21
conjectured rates.           The standard errors also widen, but not drastically with the
clustering correction. Altogether, β is only significant at the 18 percent level in all of the
specifications with controls in Panel B.
         With their original sample, AJR find that most control variables, with the
exception of latitude, are not significant and do not affect their estimates of β.
Accordingly, AJR only consistently use latitude as a control variable. Yet, when the
conjectured mortality rates are dropped, all of the control variables grow appreciably in
significance, while the point estimates of β are smaller with the controls. AJR’s
conjectured mortality rates diminish the importance of the control variables, which, in the
more reliable subsample, appear collinear with mortality.
         Using the original sample again, Panel C demonstrates that controlling for
whether a mortality rate comes from soldiers on campaign or from African laborers also
reduces the estimate for β, which is insignificant at the 5 percent level in all specifications
with controls. However, the campaign and laborer dummies themselves are generally
insignificant.
         As shown in panel D, without conjectured rates, these dummies become
significant, as do several other control variables. With both data checks in place, the
estimates of β fall to very low levels, becoming insignificant even in column (1) without
controls, and switching signs in columns (5), (6) and (8).22 In conclusion, when either
robustness check is applied, the relationship between expropriation risk and mortality
loses robustness with control variables; with both checks combined, it loses robustness
even without controls.
         Data revisions using new rates from AJR’s Response (2005), discussed in my
Appendix, do not restore their hypothesis in the presence of these data checks, as seen in

21
   Results without the Mali correction, given in Table A3, are still not highly significant. Also, first-stage
significance is greatly reduced if Mali is corrected and only other countries with Mali-based rates, shown in
Figure 1, are dropped. Results in Table A4 reveal that if unadjusted bishop mortality rates are used in Latin
America, first-stage significance falls more than if the countries are simply dropped.
22
   To ensure that results are not dependent on using expropriation risk as the measure of institutions, my
Appendix Tables A5 and A6 show results using alternate measures – Constraint on Executive in 1990 and
Law and Order Tradition in 1995. These estimates reveal a similar lack of robustness and significance.

B.       Instrumental Variable Estimates
When the first-stage estimate of β is not significantly different from zero – a common
occurrence in the results seen so far – the relevance assumption needed for IV estimates
(β ≠ 0) is not guaranteed, causing a weak instrument problem. This introduces a number
of statistical pathologies to the IV estimates. Most importantly, inference based on the IV
estimate using conventional asymptotic confidence regions (point estimate ± t × standard
error), based on the Wald statistic, can be grossly incorrect (Dufour, 1997). Confidence
regions for α of the correct size can be built by inverting the AR statistic proposed by
Anderson and Rubin (1949). While using the AR statistic seems unorthodox – producing
asymmetric, and sometimes disjointed and unbounded confidence regions – it provides an
exact test as appropriate as t-statistics in OLS, and provides correct inference in the
presence of a weak instrument. When an instrument is strong, AR and Wald confidence
regions are similar, as the latter is not grossly incorrect. 24
         Table 2 presents the IV estimates and confidence regions corresponding to the
first-stage results in Table 1. In Panel A with the original data, weak-instrument problems
appear despite the stability of the point estimates. In columns (1) and (2), where the first
stage is fairly strong, the AR and Wald 95 percent confidence regions are fairly similar.
However, as the instrument weakens in columns (3) and (4), the AR confidence regions
widen, until in columns (5), (6), and (8) they become unbounded: as the indirect least
squares formula α = π/β implies, once zero cannot be rejected for β, infinity cannot be
rejected for α.
         As the robustness checks are applied in panels B through D, these weak


23
  New data shown in Table A7; results without the data checks, or one at a time, are in Table A8.
24
   Moreira (2003) proves that, in the exactly identified case, AR tests are the uniformly most powerful
amongst unbiased tests. The AR confidence regions are said to have “95 percent confidence” because they
have 5 percent size. It does not mean that the true α is within this region 95 percent of the time, but that the
AR statistic computed is within the first 95 percent of the cumulative distribution of the statistic under the
null hypothesis. With a weak instrument, Staiger and Stock (1997) show that conventional F-tests of
significance for exogenous variables and over-identification tests (e.g. Sargan, 1958) for the second stage
are invalid. Correctly specified tests depend on parameters which cannot be estimated. Since mortality is a
weak instrument in most cases, these test statistics are not reported to save space.


                                                      13
instrument problems are aggravated: point estimates become unstable and the confidence
regions expand until most of the regions in Panels D and E equal the entire real line.
Furthermore, the estimates of α are sometimes implausibly large. A value of α equal to
two implies some incredible conclusions: e.g. if Mexico and the United States had the
same property rights (a 2.5 point difference) then the GDP per capita ratios of the two
countries would go from less than one third to over 40 in Mexico’s favor. In other cases,
the estimate of α becomes large and negative, as the estimate of β becomes small and
positive, while the reduced-form estimate of π remains negative.
        The volatile estimates and unbounded confidence regions for α reveal how
instrumental variable inference is frustrated when the first-stage estimate of β is not
highly significant. This occurs even with AJR’s original data using controls, albeit much
more strongly when problems with the mortality data are accounted for.

C.      Special Treatment of Africa
AJR (2006) claim their results are highly robust if Africa is excluded from the sample.
This claim is addressed in Table 3, which reports estimates of β and α, and cumulatively
applies the two data robustness checks to three samples: one without Africa, one with
only Africa, and one without Africa or the Neo-Europes. These results reveal several
problems with this defense.
        First, Africa provides a large fraction of AJR’s data. Without Africa there are only
37 rates, of which only 13 are not conjectured, and the rates outside of Africa appear no
less problematic than the rates in Africa. Second, AJR provide no compelling reason for
why their theory should not be tested in Africa. In fact, North Africa, with a hospitable
Mediterranean climate but disappointing performance, provides an important
counterexample to their theory. As seen in column (2), within Africa β is insignificant,
especially with the robustness checks.25
        Third, as seen in Panels B and C of column (3), results without Africa or


25
   Note also, that even using the original data in column (1) of Panel A, excluding Africa lowers the IV
estimate of α to 0.61, putting it close to the OLS estimate of about 0.52, which AJR (2001) had originally
rejected as being too small an estimate, motivating their IV approach.


                                                   14
conjectured rates, based on 13 countries, are driven by the Neo-Europes – Canada, New
Zealand, and the United States. AJR’s IV model assumes that European settlers changed
property-rights institutions and nothing else which affected growth, an assumption which
is clearly violated by these countries, where Europeans imported their entire civilization.
The Neo-Europes should be excluded from the sample as they cannot support AJR’s
theory.26

III.      Conclusion

Given the paucity of plausible instruments in the cross-country growth literature it is
regrettable that AJR’s mortality series suffers from severe measurement issues. While
AJR are right to point out that regions like West Africa and the Caribbean were unhealthy
for Europeans, the mortality differences between neighboring countries are largely
unreliable. Much of the mortality variation is due to AJR’s questionable assignments,
which often reflect transitory fluctuations or living conditions of the populations
observed rather than actual permanent differences among these countries. Given the
limited data sources currently available, it seems unlikely that a convincing set of settler
mortality rates can be constructed. As such, cross-country growth regressions cannot
disentangle the effect of settler mortality from that of other variables which may explain
institutions and growth, such as geography, climate, culture, and pre-existing
development.       This leaves AJR’s theoretical hypotheses without a strong empirical
foundation.

   AJR (2006) also claim that their results are robust to capping mortality rates at 250, which primarily
affects mortality rates in Africa. This ad hoc adjustment cancels out much of the variation within Africa
which is unfavorable to their hypothesis. If AJR stand by these results, then they should explicitly retract
their original estimates with rates over 250. Furthermore, rather than making piecemeal adjustments, AJR
should also consider eliminating other sources of variation which appear specious, such as the mortality
difference between the United States and Argentina, which become more important once this first
adjustment is made.

 Expropriation Risk is “Average protection against expropriation risk 1985-1995” as measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score represents greater protection, by
Political Risk Services. The original Log Mortality is the logarithm of European settler mortality rates from AJR (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001). Standard errors,
assuming uncorrelated homoscedastic errors, are shown in braces {} in Panel A. All other standard errors and tests adjust for heteroscedasticity and clustering effects, where
clusters are defined by countries sharing the same mortality rate. p-value of controls are probability values from standard F-tests of whether the controls are significant in the
regression. p-value of dummies refers to an F-test of the joint significance of the campaign and laborer dummies. See Appendix Table A1 for indicators of whether a country's
data is conjectured or is a rate from campaigning soldiers or laborers. "Correcting Mali" involves replacing AJR's mortality rate of 2940 with 280. "Neo-Europes" consist of
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, and are based off of three mortality rates. The three continent variables included are Africa, Asia, and Other, taken
from AJR, consists of Australia, Malta, and New Zealand. Minimum monthly rainfall and mean temperature are taken from Parker (1997). Percent of European Descent in
1975 is the percent of the population of European descent in 1975 from AJR. Malaria in 1994 refers to percent of the population with endemic malaria in 1994 in Gallup and
Sachs (2001) which does not contain data for Malta and the Bahamas. Revisions with new data from AJR (2005) are discussed in the Appendix and given in Table A7. See the
text for more detail.
