                                              ABSTRACT

The old-age security hypothesis establishes that one important reason why parents have a large offspring
is to ensure that they will receive financial support from them in old age. In this paper we use data
on fertility and financial development in 19th century U.S. to indirectly test this theory. In particular,
we explore whether more developed local financial markets reduce the incentives for families to have
a large offspring. After controlling for several factors likely to create cross-county variation in fertility
levels and for potential spatial correlation, we find that the presence of a bank and the degree of financial
development in a given county are strongly associated with lower children-to-women ratios. We find
compelling evidence for the old-age security hypothesis.

1       Introduction

In many modern developing countries and in rich countries around the time of their industrial
revolution parents often viewed their children as an instrument to secure support when in
old age. This is known as the old-age security hypothesis and it was first proposed by
Neher (1971) and Caldwell (1976). This hypothesis suggests that in the absence of capital
markets, children serve as an asset that permits parents to transfer income to old age. A
direct implication is that the fertility levels in a given economic area (country, region, state,
county) should be negatively associated with the development of its financial system.

The main purpose of this paper is to test the old-age security hypothesis using county-
level data in Northeastern United States around 1850. This is a sensible choice of country
and time period to carry out this exercise since in the 19th century the U.S. experienced a
rapid development in its financial and banking systems (see Bodenhorn and Cuberes 2010).1
Another important characteristic of this historical process of financial development is that
there was a substantial heterogeneity across states and counties in granting bank charters
(Bodenhorn 2008).2 Additionally, in the U.S. social insurance and pension systems were
developed only after 1850: before the Social Security Act of 1935, there was no general social
insurance system (Guinnane 2011).3 States did provide various types of poor relief, often
to widows, orphans and the elderly, but the generosity of relief is believed to have declined
between the 1810s and 1850s (Hannon 1984). The elderly could not rely on the state to
support them in their old age.

In this paper we take advantage of the heterogeneity in fertility rates and bank charters across
US counties to test the association between financial development and fertility choice around

1850. Our focus is on eight Northeastern states: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

We measure financial development using alternative measures that capture the presence of
banks and the intensity of banking in each county around 1840-1850. Fertility levels are
measured using mainly the child-woman ratio in 1850. We also consider Pennsylvania as
a case study. This state has the advantage that Pennsylvania banking policy was slow to
respond to changes in demand for banks. Because it is less likely that the effect of local banks
on fertility reflects reverse causality in Pennsylvania, we take existing banks around 1850 as
exogenous and we investigate their association with fertility in 1850 within the state.

We find a robust negative correlation between financial development and fertility, which
strongly supporting the old-age security hypothesis. We do not argue that the old-age security
motive is the main - nor even the most important - factor shaping fertility in historical U.S.
Our results are rather interpreted as highlighting the importance of financial development as
a mechanism reducing parents’ incentives to have a large number of offspring. Our analysis
indicates that the old-age security motive is economically important: OLS estimates suggest
that the presence of a bank in a given county around 1850 reduces the child-woman ratio
by approximately 3 percentage points, from 0.67 to 0.64 children per woman, or nearly one-
fourth of the standard deviation in fertility.




2    Literature review

The literature analyzing fertility behaviour points out several important factors that can ex-
plain differences in fertility by studying historical data (Guinnane 2011, Galor 2012). Among
these, the most relevant ones are the demand for human capital and the corresponding inter-
play between quantity and quality of children (Galor and Weil, 2000), income (Becker and


                                                 3
Lewis, 1973; Becker, 1981), child and infant mortality rates (Coale 1973; Sah 1991; Ehrlich
and Lui 1991; Kalemli-Ozcan 2002; Tamura 2006), and different dimensions of gender gaps
(Galor and Weil 1996; Goldin 1990; Lagerlöf, 2003).

There is an abundant literature in demography and economics that studies the direction of
intergenerational family transfers, their motives, and how they are affected by different in-
stitutional and cultural arrangements. This literature argues that intergenerational transfers
have a significant impact on family size, in particular desired fertility.

Several authors explore the old-age security hypothesis and its role in shaping the fertility
behaviour from a theoretical perspective. Caldwell (1976, 1982) proposes a theory based on
the idea that transfers from children to parents are the main reason behind parents’ choice
of having a large offspring.4 Nugent (1985) also emphasizes the importance of this channel
(p.76): ”old-age security is likely to be an important motive for fertility when the relevant
parent is both uncertain about his or her ability to be self-supporting in old age and dubious
that there are other more reliable or more effective means of such support than his or her
own children.” Ehrlich and Liu (1991) develop a dynamic overlapping-generation model of
endogenous growth where different generations are interdependent through financial transfers.
Morand (1999) presents a model in which growth and fertility interact with each other as
a result of the fact that parents rely on their children to support them in old age. Boldrin
and Jones (2002) also modify Barro and Becker (1989) to allow for altruism running from
children to parents.

Financial development can affect fertility behaviour by reducing the importance of the old-
age security motive. In fact it might be that (Guinnane 2011, p. 598) ”children were an
important way to ensure against risk and to provide for old age, and that the rise of state
social insurance as well as private insurance and savings vehicles led households to substitute
  4
      Willis (1980) formalizes Caldwell’s argument in a highly stylized model.



                                                       4
out of children”. Under this hypothesis the spread of banks offers alternative means to
provide for old age security. Financial development can affect fertility through the possibility
of borrowing resources from banks, which renders current consumption less dependent on
current income. If children were sent to work to provide additional resources to the household,
the development of a banking system would then reduce parents’ optimal number of children
because the child’s importance in providing contemporaneous income decreases.5

In spite of the solid theoretical foundation of the old-age security motive, the existing em-
pirical evidence of its relevance is mixed.6 According to Galor (2012), while the old-age
security hypothesis is one of the mechanisms that can explain differences in fertility levels,
the existing evidence indicates that its role as trigger of a country’s fertility transition is
rather small. For instance, there is evidence that 16th century England had institutions that
afforded parents financial assistance independent of their children (Pelling and Smith, 1991;
Hindle, 2004) but fertility rates did not decline until several centuries later.7 Moreover, Galor
argues that, before the demographic transition, richer households - who arguably had better
access to financial services - tended to have higher fertility rates than poor ones, which also
casts doubts on the old-age support hypothesis (Clark and Hamilton 2006).8 Brown and
Guinnane (2002) use data for Bavaria in the period 1880-1910 to argue that the old-age
security motive was in fact unimportant in that historical context. Finally, Kaplan (1994)
using modern data from Peru and Paraguay finds evidence of intergenerational transfers from
parents to children rather than the reverse, suggesting that the old-age support hypothesis
   5
     Financial development can affect fertility also through the interaction with the business cycle. For
example, during recessions a better access to banks can allow to relax the household budget constraint, thus
potentially allowing families to have more children.
   6
     Some authors have also criticized the old-age security hypothesis on theoretical grounds. See Nerlove,
Razin and Sadka (1986, 1987).
   7
     These institutions were known as English Poor Laws, a poor relief system introduced at the end of the
16th century.
   8
     The latter argument is however weak if it is indeed the case that most of the wealth of the rich relies on
non-wage income since, in that case, there could exist an old-age security motive but fertility may be higher
for rich households than for poor ones due to a pure income effect.



                                                      5
is not operative in these countries.

On the other hand, other studies have found strong support for this hypothesis. Galloway
et al. (1994) claim that this theory was relevant in Prussia between 1875 and 1910. In a
study closely linked to ours Steckel (1991) also finds a negative correlation between financial
development at the state level and fertility for a sample of rural families from across the U.S.
in the 19th century. However, there are important differences between his study and ours.
First, we use county-level data on financial development and fertility for the entire population,
not just the rural population. Second, we enlarge the set of controls and attempt to deal
with potential endogeneity problems. Finally, evidence in favour of the old-age hypothesis
from several developing countries is provided by Nugent and Gillapsy (1983). Cain (1981)
and Dharmalingam (1994) show this effect in India and Cain (1977, 1981) and Jensen (1990)
in Bangladesh and Malaysia, respectively.9 Finally, Kagitcibasi (1982) and Willis (1980)
find support for the old-age security hypothesis in a sample of countries emphasizing the
importance of cultural aspects whereas Entwisle and Winegarden (1984) and Nugent and
Gillapsy (1983) show that public policies targeted at old-age support have a negative effect
on fertility.




3         Theoretical benchmark

In this section we develop a simple theoretical framework that rationalizes the negative
relationship between financial development and the number of children a household chooses
to have. This is meant to illustrate the main mechanism in place without developing a full-
fledged model. Assume a household is formed by two parents and a number of children.
Following Ray (1998), let α be the probability that a child looks after her parents when she
grows up. This probability takes into account infant and child mortality, the possibility that
    9
        Robinson (1986) argues that the old-age security does not really apply to Bangladesh.


                                                        6
the child survives to adulthood but earns an income insufficient to provide for her parents,
and the probability that her income is sufficient but she chooses not to look after them.
Parents have access to a ”technology” through which they can receive some income when
old, namely the use of financial services provided by a local bank. One natural way to achieve
this is to save when young and then use these savings and their financial return when old.10
Let β be the probability that the location where the parents reside has a bank.11 Finally, let
γ be the threshold probability that of receiving some kind of economic support from at least
a child or a bank that parents find acceptable. For instance, γ = 0.95 means that parents
find it intolerable to have more than a 5% chance that they would not receive any support
from either a child or a bank when they get old.

We next assume that a household has n children. Then the probability that none of them
looks after their parents when they are old is (1−α)n . On the other hand, the probability that
there is no local bank in which the household can make its savings grow is 1 − β. Therefore,
the probability that parents will have some financial resources from at least a child or a bank
is:



                                         1 − [(1 − α)n (1 − β)]                                         (1)


Parents want to guarantee that this probability is not lower than γ, which leads them to
have at least n∗ children i.e.:12
   10
      The importance of local banks in providing financial services to households has been explored, for in-
stance, in Guiso et al. (2004).
   11
      We use the term ”location” here in a vague way so that it can refer to a town, city, or even a county.
The important thing in our reasoning is that the bank is located ”nearby” where households live so that it
is reasonably easy - in the context of 19th century U.S - for them to visit this bank and use its financial
services.
   12
      We assume γ > β to ensure a non-negative optimal number of children. This appears a realistic as-
sumption since it seems reasonable that parents in 19th century U.S. had a markedly high aversion to reach
old-age without financial support. For example, Ray (1998) suggests a value of γ equal to 0.95. A plausible
estimate of β can be obtained from the percentage of counties with a bank aroun 1850, which is 70% in our
dataset, implying a value of β of around 0.7

                                                                  1−γ

                                                      ln (1 − α)

It is then easy to show that an exogenous increase in the probability that a bank is present
near the household location - a proxy for financial development - reduces the number of
children that this household chooses to have:

4      Data

Our analysis exploits cross-county variation in order to assess the role of financial develop-
ment on fertility choice. Our largest sample consists of 196 counties in the Northeastern
United States (Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont). Data on banks creation at the city-level
is taken from Weber (2011).13 His dataset documents all banks in the United States prior to
1861. We aggregate Weber’s data - available at the town level - to get county-level measures
of financial development. Our first measure of financial development is the availability of
banking, which we proxy with a dummy variable (labelled Bank dummy 1840s) taking on
value one if there is some financial activity in the county over the period 1846-49. The second
index we use is a measure of banking intensity (labelled Intensive banking 1840s) and it is
calculated as the sum of a bank’s circulating currency and deposits in per capita terms over
the period 1846-49.14 We focus on currency and deposits because in the period we investi-
gate the average person did not have a bank account and her most common way of saving
  13

  14
     We apply a log transformation to this variable (i.e. log(1+x)) to reduce the impact of outliers, also in
light of the fact that for many counties this variable takes on a value of zero.


                                                     8
was by holding bank-issued money or banknotes. These cash holdings are best captured in
the data by the amount of circulating currency.15 While banknotes represented the most
common form of money holdings, one motivation for which is precautionary savings, the use
of deposits was increasing in the 1850s in parts of the Northeast. Thus, we use the sum of
currency and deposits as the relevant measure of local finance.

In order to assess the association between financial development and fertility, we are interested
in measuring the ”quantity” of children that a household has. Following recent papers (Becker
et al. 2010, 2012) analyzing fertility-related issues in similar historical contexts, we measure
fertility with the child-woman ratio computed as the number of children aged 0-4 relative to
the number of women aged 15-39.16 As a robustness check we also use alternative definitions
of the child-woman ratio, that is using children aged 1-4 (child-woman ratio 2) or 5-14 (child-
woman ratio 3) and the crude birth rate.17 By using children aged 1-4 or 5-14, we remove the
potential effect of infant or child mortality, thus capturing the effects of surviving children.
All measures of fertility are calculated using the U.S. Population Census of 1850. As Figure
1 shows, there is a strong positive unconditional correlation (0.69) between the child-woman
ratio and the crude birth rate across the counties in our sample.

We control for several factors considered important in determining fertility levels. To account
for the role of human capital and the interplay between quantity and quality of children, we
add as a regressor the school attendance rate in each county. This is measured as the
number of individuals (white population) attending school over the population aged 5-19.
One important variable that may determine fertility is income per capita. According to
Becker (1981), if one makes the plausible assumption that the income effect on the demand
  15
      Temin (1969) estimates that specie represented as little as 5 percent of the money supply in the early
1830s, though the fraction rose later in the antebellum era to around one-fifth.
   16
      We restrict ourselves to the white population due to data availability, following other studies. However,
from the U.S. census we know that the percentage of free colored and slaves in the states and time period
that we analyze was very small, around 1.9%.
   17
      The crude birth rate is computed using surviving births until June 1, 1850, so it partially accounts for
the effect of mortality during childhood, a variable considered important in explaining fertility choices.

        Figure 1: (Log) Child-woman ratio and (log) crude birth rate across counties

for children is smaller than the substitution effect households optimally choose to have fewer
and more educated children when their income becomes sufficiently high. Because we do not
have data on income per capita at the county level, we use two proxies. The first proxy is (per
capita) public spending in schools that is financed through taxation: the rationale for this is
that counties with higher income should also have larger revenues from taxation and hence
more funds allocated to education.18 Our second proxy for income per capita is the county’s
urbanization’s rate, defined as the share of population living in cities with at least 5,000
inhabitants. Apart from capturing the level of development and structure of a given county,
the urban environment might be important because certain norms and cultural attitudes
towards fertility - for example about contraception - tended to spread first in urban areas
than in rural ones. Moreover, some authors have shown that fertility has historically been
higher in rural areas than in urban ones (e.g. Galloway et al. 1998).19 As recent findings in the
  18
     This measure also captures the supply of (public) education, which may be relevant for the child quantity-
quality trade-off discussed above.
  19
     One may argue that per capita public spending in schools and urbanization are highly correlated and so
including both variables as regressors may create problems of collinearity. However, in our case the correlation
between the two variables is rather low, 0.26.

literature suggest (e.g. Bodenhorn and Cuberes 2013), urbanization in 19th century U.S. was
largely influenced by financial development so by controlling for urbanization we capture the
effect of banking on fertility independently of its effect on urbanization. Moreover, because of
this positive correlation between two of our regressors the total effect of financial development
on fertility levels is likely to be larger than the one captured by the estimate of our banking
measure. We also control for the share of individuals employed in the manufacturing sector
(in the population older than 15), as industrialisation might have increased opportunity cost
of having children especially for women. Finally, we also account for agricultural productivity
- measured as the value of farming implements/machinery per acre of improved land in farms
because it is likely to affect income and, among other things, the demand for child labour.20

In our regressions we also introduce as controls several variables that, while they have not
been pivotal in the existing theoretical models of fertility, we believe are relevant to explain
cross-county variation in fertility levels in 19th century U.S. First, we include a measure of
parents’ education since - especially in the case of mother’s education - it has often been
regarded as an important factor in explaining fertility behaviour as it affects knowledge of
fertility controls, earnings and preferences (e.g. Cochrane 1979; Becker et al. 2013). We
measure parents’ education with the percentage of literate white men and women older than
20 years of age. In order to address the importance of the economic and social role of women
we also use the ratio between literate women and literate men, as a proxy for the well-
established gender gap in education. Second, since marriage is one of the main explanatory
factors of fertility behaviour, we use a proxy for married women computed as the number
of families over women older than 15. Third, an important issue we account for is selective
migration as it is possible that individuals who prefer finance to children as means of securing
financial support at old age or that for some reason have few or no children may relocate closer
  20
    For instance, Rosenzweig and Evenson (1977) show that agricultural productivity is positively related to
child labour-force participation in rural India.

to banks or to counties that have a local bank. We do this by controlling for immigration
flows in each county from other states and from abroad. This is an imperfect measure of
moving to finance but the census reports only state or country of birth.

Finally, we acknowledge the fact that the fertility behaviour of one county is likely to affect
that of neighbouring counties. To address this, we control for spatial correlation by including
a spatial component in the error term of our regressions. Table 1 displays the source of each
variable while Table 2 shows some descriptive statistics.

5      Empirical analysis

5.1     Empirical strategy

Our empirical strategy consists of estimating several cross-sectional regressions of the follow-
ing form:



                                  f erti = γ1 f indevi + γ2 Xi + i                                 (4)


where f erti is the measure of fertility in county i in 1850, f indevi is a measure of finan-
cial development in county i in the period 1846-1849, Xi includes the county-level control
variables discussed in the previous section measured in 1850, and i is a standard error term.

To account for spatial correlation, we also estimate a spatial error model, that is a model
that includes a spatial component in the error term:21



                       f erti = γ1 f indevi + γ2 Xi + µi      µi = λW µi + i                       (5)


where W is the spatial weight matrix and Wµi is the spatially lagged error term.22 The
inclusion of a spatial component in the error term allows to capture spatial patterns related
to omitted variables such as, for example, the diffusion of new cultural norms.

The previous regressions are estimated using county data for 8 Northeastern states. We also
consider counties in Pennsylvania as a separate case study. Pennsylvania is a convenient
state to test the old-age security hypothesis because its banking policy was slow to respond
to changes in demand for banks. As a direct consequence of the Omnibus Banking Act passed
  21
    Spatial error models are estimated by MLE using Stata command spmlreg (see Jeanty 2010).
  22
    The inverse distance spatial weights matrix is computed using average latitude and longitude of each
county.


                                                  14
in 1814 in which the state was divided into twenty-seven districts, a total of forty-one banks
were chartered and each district received at least one bank. Pennsylvania did charter banks
after 1814, just not as many as other states and it tended to do so in clusters (Bodenhorn
2008). In fact, there was a second ”wave” of charters in the 1830s. Since in this context it
is indeed hard to argue that the effect of local banks on fertility reflects reverse causality,
we take banks existing circa 1840-1850 as exogenous and we consider their association with
fertility around 1850.



5.2    Results: cross-section

Figure 2 shows the unconditional relationship between the bank dummy - a measure of
banking’s availability - and fertility across counties. It is apparent that there is a strong
negative correlation between the two variables - as implied by the old-age security hypothesis
- and this is not driven by outliers. The average (median) fertility level in counties that had
at least one local bank was 0.62 (0.59), whereas the figure for counties without banks were
0.79 (0.78).

We now proceed to study this relationship more systematically. Table 3 reports the OLS es-
timates of equation (4) using the banking dummy as a proxy for the availability of financial
markets. The coefficient on local bank development is significantly negative in all specifi-
cations, providing strong support for the hypothesis that financial development reduces the
incentives of families to have a large offspring. The association of schooling with fertility
is negative and significant in almost all specifications, suggesting that the quantity-quality
trade-off played a role in shaping fertility choice (e.g. Galor and Weil 2000). Our first proxy
of income per capita does not show a robust significant correlation. However, urbanization
rates are negatively associated with fertility. Higher shares of employment in manufacturing
are related to lower child-to-women ratios. It may be that industrial development reduces fer-


                                              15
tility by increasing the opportunity cost of childbearing for women since production becomes
more skilled biased and women tend to have a comparative advantage in mental capacities vs.
physical ones (Galor and Weil 1996).23 Men’s literacy and the education gap (measured as
the ratio of women’s over men’s literacy) display a negative correlation with fertility confirm-
ing the relevance of the gender gap in affecting fertility choice. As expected fertility is higher
in counties with a larger share of married women, and agricultural productivity is negatively
associated to fertility. As mentioned above, one potential concern with this regression is the
possibility of selective migration: households who prefer finance to children as a technology
to implement inter-temporal transfers or those with few or no children at all may, for some
reason, relocate closer to banks. In order to address this we construct proxies for immigra-
tion flows to a given county from other U.S. states and from abroad.24 Immigration flows
from other U.S. states tend to be negatively (but not significantly) associated with fertility,
whereas immigration from abroad is positively related to fertility. The latter could reflect
that immigrants may have preferences for larger families that are culturally rooted and that
persist in a different environment. Importantly though, the coefficient associated with bank-
ing survives the inclusion of these migration controls. Finally all specifications include state
dummies to capture common (state-level) characteristics.

Using the specification with the largest number of controls (8) our estimates suggest that
the presence of a bank in a given county reduced the child-woman ratio approximately by 3
percentage points or from 0.67 to 0.64 children per woman. This reduction represents about
one-fourth of the standard deviation in the child-woman ratio. It is interesting to note that
the R2 associated with our regressions is high, indicating that our empirical model captures
a substantial share of cross-county variation in fertility.

In Table 4 we show the estimates of the same regressions but now using a measure of intensity
  23
     For example, Wanamaker (2012) finds a negative correlation between industrialisation and fertility in
19th century South Carolina.
  24
     Unfortunately, the census does not report migration at the county level.

- rather than simply the presence of at least a bank - of banking in each county. Similar to
Table 3, counties with higher intensity of financial activity are characterized by lower fertility
levels. A one standard deviation change in local bank money holdings is associated with a 3
percentage-point decrease in the child-woman ratio, based on estimates in Columns (6)-(8).
This holds when controlling for all the previously discussed potential explanatory factors that
determine fertility behaviour.

Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of the child-woman ratio across the counties in our
sample. A casual look at the map suggests the presence of possible spatial effects in fertility.
In order to account for the potential role of spatial correlation, we estimate a spatial error
model (Equation 5). We report two different regressions for the two measures of banking,
availability and intensity: one including state dummies and one without them. Table 5
displays the estimates of this model. As in Tables 3 and 4 we find a strong and robust
negative association between financial development and fertility. On the other hand there is
evidence of spatial correlation (positive and significant λ) when we do not include the state
dummies. Remarkably, when we include the state dummies the spatial component is not
significantly different from zero, thus suggesting that spatial correlation is already captured
by the state effects.

One potential issue that might affect our previous results is endogeneity. To partially tackle
the potential bias of our OLS estimates we use Pennsylvania as a case study. Following up
on our discussion in Section 5.1, studying the relationship between financial development
and fertility in Pennsylvania is useful because in most of its counties banks were created
before 1820, so that it is hard to argue that their correlation with fertility reflects reverse
causality.25 Table 6 shows that the coefficients on the bank dummy and banking intensity are
still negative and statistically significant in this state, which is remarkable given the small
number of observations (56 compared to 196 in the regressions that use the 8 states).
 25
      We exclude 5 (out of 61) counties that got a bank after 1820.

6      Robustness checks

6.1     Alternative measures of fertility

Our first robustness check is to consider similar regressions to those previously estimated
but using alternative child-to-women ratios, using children aged 1-4 (labelled CWR2) or 5-14
(labelled CWR3) and the crude birth rate (CBR) to measure fertility levels.26 Infant and
child mortality may affect fertility through replacement of children that die; moreover, mor-
tality risk can affect fertility through a precautionary demand for children (Tamura 1996,
Kalemli-Ozcan 2002). By using children aged 1-4 or 5-14, CWR2 and CWR3 remove the
potential effect of infant and/or child mortality, thus capturing surviving children. When we
use the crude birth rate we control for the mortality environment (during childhood and also
adulthood) by including as a control the (log) crude death rate.27 Since crude birth rates
are defined as births over total population, we replace the family-to-woman ratio with the
(log) marriage rate, calculated as the number of marriages (until June 1, 1850) over total
population. When using the CWR3, the bank dummy and banking intensity are calculated
using data on financial activities for the period 1836-39, so to be consistent with the new def-
inition of the dependent variable.28 Table 7 shows that the results of this exercise are similar
to those obtained in our previous regressions. Across all specifications our main variables of
interest - the presence of at least a bank and the intensity of financial development show a
significant negative relationship with fertility. School attendance and income per capita do
not always display a negative association. Higher shares of employment in manufacturing are
still related to lower child-to-women ratios. Urbanization is also negatively associated with
fertility, as the education gap. Fertility is higher in counties with a larger share of married
  26
    CWR3 is computed using women aged 20-39.
  27
    Since surviving births are only measured between January and June, they only account for (initial) infant
mortality but not for infant mortality six months after birth or child mortality.
 28
    Children between 5 and 14 in 1850 were born between 1936-1945.

women (or higher marriage rate), and agricultural productivity is negatively associated to
fertility. Immigration flows to a given county from other U.S. states and from abroad tend
                                                                                               29
to display a similar association as the one reported above, with some exceptions.

Making similar calculations as in the previous section, our OLS estimates from column (3)
suggest a drop in about 5% in crude birth rates, from an average of 0.25 to 0.24 (i.e. from
250 to 240 births per 1000 inhabitants).



6.2     Panel

Potential unobserved heterogeneity could affect our cross-sectional analysis. To investigate
this possibility we collect data on banking intensity and fertility for the years 1840, 1850
and 1860 for counties not affected by changes in administrative borders. Using this (sub)set
of counties we exploit the panel dimension to account for potential time-invariant omitted
factors. We match child-to-women ratios (children aged 0-4 over women 15-39) in 1840 to
financial activity in 1836-39, child-to-women ratios in 1850 to financial activity in 1846-49,
and child-to-women ratios in 1860 to financial activity in 1856-59. Table 8 reports averages for
the years in our sample while Table 9 displays the results of pooled (Columns 1-3) and fixed
effects (Columns 4-6) OLS. We use three measures of financial development by disaggregating
the general measure we used so far into two different indexes, one using only circulating
currency and the other only deposits. The results suggest that levels of financial development
are relevant in explaining levels of fertility (pooled OLS), while changes in banking might
play a role - but not be the most important factor - in explaining changes in fertility (FE
OLS), that is fertility transitions.

explain differences in fertility levels. We find evidence that the availability and intensity of
banking are related to lower fertility levels across Northeastern U.S. counties in the 19th
century. Our results are robust to a number of socio-economic controls and the presence
of spatial effects in the data. This finding provides strong support for the importance of
the old-age security hypothesis, which argues that children are one of the instruments that
parents use to secure support when old. A corollary of this theory - precisely what we test
in this paper - is that the availability of alternative tools might then reduce the incentives of
households to have a large offspring.

This finding has important policy implications for today’s developing countries that still have
relatively high fertility levels. Our results suggest that policies designed to provide access to
banking services (or social security systems) may reduce parents’ incentives to have a large
number of children, thus facilitating increases in standard of livings via the well-known child
quantity-quality trade-off.
