Fiscal Rules and Discretion in a World Economy

Governments are present-biased toward spending. Fiscal rules are deficit limits that trade off
commitment to not overspend and flexibility to react to shocks. We compare coordinated rules –
chosen jointly by a group of countries – to uncoordinated rules. If governments' present bias is
small, coordinated rules are tighter than uncoordinated rules: individual countries do not
internalize the redistributive effect of interest rates. However, if the bias is large, coordinated
rules are slacker: countries do not internalize the disciplining effect of interest rates. Surplus
limits enhance welfare, and increased savings by some countries or outside economies can hurt
the rest.

    The integration of capital markets in Europe following the adoption of the
Euro in 1999 led to a convergence of interest rates and a rise of imbalances across
the region. Tight fiscal policy in Northern European countries such as Germany
contributed to a region-wide decline in interest rates, which induced increased
borrowing by other European countries such as Greece.1 Between 2003 and 2008,
for example, Germany’s government deficit declined from 4.2% to 0.2% of GDP,
whereas Greece’s government deficit increased from 7.8% to 10.2% of GDP.2
    How should countries coordinate their fiscal policies in an integrated capital
market? Is there a benefit to the joint design of fiscal rules? Over the past 30
years, more than 90 countries have adopted fiscal rules, including rules applying
to individual countries and rules applying to groups of countries. In 2013, of the
97 countries that had fiscal rules in place, 49 were subject to national rules, 48
to supranational rules, and 14 to both.3 For example, Germany was constrained
not only by the guidelines of the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact
(SGP), but also by its own constitutionally mandated “debt brake” which imposed
a tighter limit on the government’s structural deficit than the SGP.4
    In this paper, we study the optimal design of coordinated fiscal rules, which are
chosen jointly by a group of countries, and compare them to uncoordinated fiscal
rules, which are chosen independently by each country. Are coordinated rules
tighter or more lax than uncoordinated rules? What happens if some countries
— like Germany in the case of the European Union — can supplement coordinated
rules with additional fiscal constraints?
    Our theory of fiscal rules is motivated by a fundamental tradeoff between

     The impact of Germany’s fiscal reforms on its declining government deficit is documented
in Breuer (2015), and the impact of the government deficit on the current account is discussed
in Kollmann et al. (2015) for Germany and Abbas et al. (2011) more broadly. Draghi (2016)
addresses the depressing effect of Germany’s current account on interest rates.

Villaverde, Garicano and Santos (2013) argue that the drop in interest rates that followed
European integration led to the abandonment of reforms and institutional deterioration in the
peripheral European countries.

West African Economic and Monetary Union, the Central African Economic and Monetary
Community, and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.

commitment and flexibility: on the one hand, rules provide valuable commitment
as they can limit distorted incentives in policymaking that result in a spending
bias and excessive deficits; on the other hand, there is a cost of reduced flexibility
as fiscal constitutions cannot spell out policy prescriptions for every single shock
or contingency, and some discretion may be optimal. Under uncoordinated fiscal
rules, each country resolves this commitment-versus-flexibility tradeoff indepen-
dently. Under a coordinated fiscal rule, countries resolve this tradeoff jointly.
    We consider a two-period model in which a continuum of identical governments
choose deficit-financed public spending. At the beginning of the first period, each
government receives an idiosyncratic shock to the social value of spending in this
period. Governments are benevolent ex ante, prior to the realization of the shock,
but present-biased ex post, when it is time to choose spending. This preference
structure results naturally from the aggregation of heterogeneous, time-consistent
citizens’ preferences (Jackson and Yariv, 2015, 2014), or as a consequence of
turnover in political economy models (e.g., Aguiar and Amador, 2011).5 We
assume that the shock to the value of spending is a government’s private infor-
mation, or type, capturing the fact that not all contingencies are contractible or
observable. The combination of a present bias and private information implies
that governments face a tradeoff between commitment and flexibility. We define
a fiscal rule in this context as a fully enforceable deficit limit, imposed prior to
the realization of the shock.
    Our environment is the same as that considered in Amador, Werning and
Angeletos (2006) and Halac and Yared (2014). These papers characterize optimal
uncoordinated fiscal rules, which are chosen independently by each government
taking global interest rates as given. We depart by studying coordinated fiscal
rules, which are chosen by a central authority representing all governments, taking
into account the impact that fiscal rules have on global interest rates. Coordinated
rules internalize the fact that lowering flexibility affects countries not only directly
by limiting their borrowing and spending, but also indirectly by reducing interest
rates.6

(1994), Lizzeri (1999), Tornell and Lane (1999), Battaglini and Coate (2008), and Caballero and
Yared (2010). Our formulation of governments’ preferences corresponds to the quasi-hyperbolic
consumption model; see Laibson (1997).
   6
     In our model, a government’s debt exerts an externality on other governments solely through


                                               2
     An optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule is a deficit limit such that, on average,
the distortion above the limit is zero. Specifically, consider a government that,
ex post, would like to borrow more than allowed by the imposed limit. If the
government experienced a relatively low shock to the value of spending, it will be
overborrowing compared to its ex-ante optimum, as the government is present-
biased ex post. On the other hand, if the government experienced a relatively high
shock, it will be underborrowing, as the government is constrained by the deficit
limit. For a fixed interest rate, an optimal deficit limit equalizes the marginal
benefit of providing more flexibility to underborrowing types to the marginal cost
of providing more discretion to overborrowing types.
     Our results contrast these uncoordinated rules with coordinated rules. Con-
sider first a situation in which governments are not present-biased, so that an
optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule grants full flexibility. The optimal coordinated
fiscal rule in this case is tighter than the uncoordinated one, and hence interest
rates are lower under coordination. The reason is intuitive: governments choos-
ing rules independently do not internalize the fact that by allowing themselves
more flexibility, they increase interest rates, thus redistributing resources away
from governments that borrow more toward governments that borrow less. Com-
mitting ex ante to tighter constraints is socially beneficial: the cost of reducing
flexibility is mitigated by the drop in the interest rate, which benefits more in-
debted countries whose marginal value of borrowing is higher. This redistributive
effect of the interest rate is also present in other models with incomplete markets,
such as Yared (2013) and Azzimonti, de Francisco and Quadrini (2014).
    Our main result, however, shows that when governments’ present bias is suf-
ficiently large, the optimal coordinated fiscal rule is slacker than the uncoordi-
nated one, and hence interest rates are higher under coordination. The reason is
that interest rates also have a natural disciplining effect. Governments choosing
rules independently do not internalize the fact that by reducing their own dis-
cretion, they lower interest rates, thus increasing governments’ desire to borrow
the interest rate. Coordinated rules may differ from uncoordinated rules for reasons different
from those studied here if higher debt by some governments entails other externalities, such as
a higher risk of crisis and contagion, inflation, or future fiscal transfers. Beetsma and Uhlig
(1999) and Chari and Kehoe (2007) study settings in which the existence of a common monetary
policy generates an externality.



                                              3
and worsening fiscal discipline for all. Committing ex ante to more flexibility is
socially beneficial: the cost of increasing discretion for overborrowing countries
is mitigated by the rising interest rate, which induces everyone to borrow less.
Paradoxically, in some cases, the externality is large enough that all countries
can be made ex ante better off by abandoning their uncoordinated fiscal rules
and allowing themselves full flexibility. More generally, we show that whether the
optimal coordinated fiscal rule grants more or less flexibility than the uncoordi-
nated one depends on the relative strength of the redistributive and disciplining
effects of the interest rate, which in turn depends on governments’ present bias.
    We discuss a number of extensions of our baseline model. A natural question,
in light of our main result, is whether additional instruments can enhance welfare
when governments’ present bias is large and thus the disciplining effect of the
interest rate dominates the redistributive effect. While linear taxes have no effect
in our setting, we show that using a coordinated fiscal rule where governments
are not allowed to exceed a maximum surplus limit (in addition to a maximum
deficit limit) can improve upon using only deficit limits. Surplus limits are never
used in an optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule, as these limits force low government
types which are overborrowing to borrow even more. However, surplus limits also
serve to increase interest rates, and through this channel they can improve overall
fiscal discipline.
    This logic is in fact general, and has further implications when governments’
present bias is large. For instance, suppose a small subset of countries are able
to supplement coordinated rules with additional fiscal constraints. By increasing
their savings, this subset of countries will reduce the global interest rate and
worsen fiscal discipline in the remaining countries — a result that resonates with
the experiences of Germany and Greece mentioned above. Moreover, we show
that the optimal response of the central authority is to tighten the fiscal rule in
these remaining countries whose welfare declines. Similarly, consider an extension
of our model in which countries can borrow from an outside economy. We find
that an external supply of funds can also lower welfare by depressing interest
rates and increasing countries’ overborrowing, and lead to the tightening of fiscal
constraints. These effects arise when the optimal coordinated fiscal rule is slacker
than the uncoordinated one under a large present bias, a result that we show to


                                         4
be robust to ex-ante heterogeneity across countries and an infinite time horizon.
    This paper is related to several literatures. First, the paper fits into the
mechanism design literature that studies the tradeoff between commitment and
flexibility in self-control settings, including Athey, Atkeson and Kehoe (2005),
Amador, Werning and Angeletos (2006), and Halac and Yared (2014).7,8 Unlike
this literature, we endogenize the effective price of the temptation good — which
in our environment corresponds to the interest rate — and we show how this price
can serve as a natural disciplining device, affecting the optimal mechanism for a
group of agents. Our analysis and results can be applied to different self-control
problems; see Section 5 for a discussion. Second, the paper is related to an exten-
sive literature on the political economy of fiscal policy.9 Most closely related is
Azzimonti, Battaglini and Coate (2016), which considers the quantitative welfare
implications of a balanced budget rule when the government is present-biased.
In contrast to this work, we study the design of fiscal rules in a global economy
in which individual rules affect global interest rates. In this regard, our paper is
related to the literature on policy coordination across countries, including Chari
and Kehoe (1990) and Persson and Tabellini (1995).10 Whereas these papers
emphasize the benefits of coordinating policies, our interest is in the coordina-
tion of rules, namely how countries can benefit from choosing the set of allowable
policies jointly. Finally, more broadly, our paper contributes to the literature on
hyperbolic discounting and the benefits of commitment devices.11
   7
      These papers solve for the optimal mechanism, whereas for most of our analysis we restrict
attention to rules that take the form of deficit limits (exploring variations in Section 4.1).
Deficit limits can be shown to correspond to the optimal uncoordinated mechanism under weak
conditions. Characterizing the optimal coordinated mechanism, however, is difficult because
the problem is not convex.

contracts. More generally, the paper relates to the literature on delegation in principal-agent
settings, including Holmström (1977, 1984), Alonso and Matouschek (2008), Amador and Bag-
well (2013), and Ambrus and Egorov (2015).

1     Model
1.1     Setup
We study a simple model of fiscal policy in which a continuum of governments
each make a spending and borrowing decision. Our setup is the same as that
analyzed in Amador, Werning and Angeletos (2006), with the exception that we
allow for multiple governments and an endogenous interest rate.
    There are two periods and a unit mass of ex-ante identical governments.12 At
the beginning of the first period, each government observes a shock to its economy,
θ > 0, which is the government’s private information or type. θ is drawn from
                     
a bounded set Θ ≡ θ, θ with a continuously differentiable distribution function
F (θ), normalized so that E [θ] = 1.
    Following the realization of θ, each government chooses first-period public
spending g and second-period assets x subject to a budget constraint:

                                               x
                                          g+     = τ,                                         (1)
                                               R

where τ is the revenue of the government in the initial period and R is the
endogenously determined gross interest rate.
   The government’s welfare prior to the realization of its type θ is

                                     E [θU (g) + W (x)] ,                                     (2)

where U 0 (·) > 0, U 00 (·) < 0, W 0 (·) > 0, and W 00 (·) < 0. U (g) represents the
government’s utility from first-period spending g and W (x) is the government’s
continuation value associated with carrying forward assets x.13 Note that a higher
value of θ corresponds to a higher marginal benefit of first-period spending. As in
Amador, Werning and Angeletos (2006), we take θ to be a taste shock multiplying
first-period utility. This is a tractable way to introduce a value for flexibility, as
Lizzeri and Yariv (2015).
   12
      We purposely abstract away from heterogeneity in order to study differences between coor-
dinated and uncoordinated fiscal rules that are not due to countries having different character-
istics. We show the robustness of our results to ex-ante heterogeneity in Section 4.4.
   13
      Here W (·) is simply taken to be the second-period utility of assets, including any discount
factor. In Section 4.5, we provide a microfoundation for W (·) in an infinite horizon economy.



                                                6
we explain subsequently. Flexibility is also valuable if instead the shock is to the
government’s revenue τ . Indeed, such a revenue shock yields the same welfare
representation as in (2) if U (·) is exponential (see Section 5.4 of Amador, Werning
and Angeletos, 2006).
   The government’s welfare after the realization of its type θ, when choosing
spending g and assets x, is
                                    θU (g) + βW (x),                             (3)

where β ∈ (0, 1].
    Because the world consists of a continuum of governments which can only
borrow and lend from one another, total spending in the aggregate must equal
the value of total resources available. Let g (θ, R) be the level of first-period
spending chosen by a government of type θ when the interest rate is R. Note that
since governments are ex-ante identical, the distribution of realized types across
governments is the same as the distribution of types for each government. Thus,
given that the density function is f (θ) and each government has resources τ , the
global resource constraint in the first period is
                                Z       θ
                                            g (θ, R) f (θ) dθ = τ .                     (4)
                                    θ


The interest rate R must adjust so that governments’ spending decisions satisfy
(4). Equations (1) and (4) imply that the global resource constraint is satisfied in
the second period, in the sense that assets held globally equal zero. That is, letting
x (θ, R) be the level of assets chosen by a government of type θ when the interest
                                                           Rθ
rate is R, the second-period resource constraint holds: θ x (θ, R) f (θ) dθ = 0.
    We note that our setting does not allow for cross-subsidization across types.
Specifically, the net present value of spending and assets cannot be different for a
lower type relative to a higher type,14 and hence fiscal transfers across countries
are ruled out. Also, to simplify the exposition and without loss of generality, we
have abstracted away from borrowing and lending of the household sector.15
  14
     This is in contrast to other models such as Thomas and Worrall (1990) and Atkeson and
Lucas (1992).
  15
     Our model is identical to one in which households in an economy do not have access to
external financial markets, and the government can borrow and lend on their behalf. The
model can be extended to introduce a subset of households that can access external financial


                                                    7
1.2     Fiscal Rules
There are two frictions in our setting. First, if β < 1, a government’s objective (3)
following the realization of its type does not coincide with its objective (2) prior
to this realization. In particular, the government is present-biased: its welfare
after θ is realized overweighs the importance of current spending compared to
its welfare before θ is realized. As mentioned in the Introduction, this structure
arises naturally when the government’s preferences aggregate heterogeneous cit-
izens’ preferences, even if the latter are time consistent (see Jackson and Yariv,
2015, 2014). This formulation can also be motivated by political turnover; for
instance, preferences such as these emerge in settings with political uncertainty
where policymakers place a higher value on public spending when they hold power
and can make spending decisions (see Aguiar and Amador, 2011).
      The second friction in our setting is that the realization of θ — which affects
the marginal social utility of first-period spending — is privately observed by the
government. One possible interpretation is that θ is not verifiable ex post by a
rule-making body; therefore, even if it is observable, fiscal rules cannot explicitly
depend on the value of θ. An alternative interpretation is that the exact cost
of public goods is only observable to the policymaker, who may be inclined to
overspend on these goods.16
      The combination of these two frictions leads to a tradeoff between commitment
and flexibility. Specifically, note that ex ante, as a function of its type θ and
the interest rate R, each government would like to choose first-period spending
g ea (θ, R) and second-period assets xea (θ, R) satisfying

                            θU 0 (g ea (θ, R)) = RW 0 (xea (θ, R))                          (5)

under the budget constraint (1). However, this ex ante optimum cannot be imple-
mented with full flexibility: if the government were given full flexibility to choose
spending and borrowing, ex post it would choose g f (θ, R) and xf (θ, R) satisfying
                                                           
                           θU 0 g f (θ, R) = βRW 0 xf (θ, R) ,                              (6)
markets without affecting our main results. Details are available from the authors upon request.
  16
     A third possibility is that citizens have heterogeneous preferences or information on the
optimal level of public spending, and only the government sees the aggregate. See Sleet (2004).


                                               8
and hence a present-biased government would overborrow relative to (5). In addi-
tion, the ex ante optimum cannot be achieved with full commitment: a spending
plan cannot be made explicitly contingent on the realization of the government’s
type θ, and hence (5) cannot be implemented by fully committing the government
to a contingent plan. Therefore, a tradeoff between commitment and flexibility
arises, and the optimal mechanism is then not trivial.
    We define a fiscal rule as a cutoff θ∗ ∈ [0, θ] such that if the government’s
type is θ > θ∗ , its first-period spending and second-period assets are g f (θ∗ , R)
and xf (θ∗ , R) respectively, whereas if the government’s type is θ ≤ θ∗ , spending
and assets are g f (θ, R) and xf (θ, R) (where g f (·) and xf (·) are given by (1)
and (6)). This fiscal rule can be implemented using a maximum deficit limit,
spending limit, or debt limit. Under such an implementation, all types θ ≤ θ∗
can make their full-flexibility ex-post optimal choices within the limit, whereas
types θ > θ∗ are constrained and thus choose spending at the limit. Deficit limits
capture aspects of many of the fiscal rules observed in practice. Moreover, under
weak conditions on the distribution function F (θ), deficit limits correspond to
the optimal mechanism when the interest rate is exogenous (see Amador, Werning
and Angeletos, 2006).
    Our interest is in comparing the case in which the fiscal rule θ∗ is uncoordi-
nated — chosen independently by each government — and the case in which this
rule is coordinated — chosen by a central authority representing all governments.
Whereas each government takes the interest rate R as given when choosing its
optimal uncoordinated rule, the central authority takes into account the impact
of θ∗ on the interest rate R when choosing the optimal coordinated rule.
    Throughout our analysis, we assume non-increasing absolute risk aversion:

Assumption 1. −U 00 (g) /U 0 (g) and −W 00 (x) /W 0 (x) are non-increasing in g
and x respectively.

    Let R (θ∗ ) denote the level of the interest rate when fiscal rule θ∗ applies to
all governments. The next lemma follows from Assumption 1.

Lemma 1. R (θ∗ ) is strictly increasing in θ∗ for all θ∗ < θ.

    Lemma 1 describes how the tightness of fiscal rules impacts the level of global
interest rates. The higher is the value of the cutoff θ∗ , the more flexible is the

                                         9
fiscal rule, so the higher is the level of borrowing and, as a result, the higher is
the interest rate. This relationship between the fiscal rule and the interest rate
plays a central role in our analysis of coordinated versus uncoordinated rules.
    Regarding implementation, it is worth noting that when the interest rate is
endogenously determined, the mapping from θ∗ to a spending or borrowing limit
need not be monotonic. To see why, consider a fiscal rule θ∗ , associated with a
maximum allowable level of public spending g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )). Holding the interest
rate fixed, the direct effect of an increase in θ∗ is to increase g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )). But
there is also an indirect effect: when θ∗ increases, R (θ∗ ) increases, and depending
on the relative strength of income and substitution effects, g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )) can
decrease. For some cases — like the case of log preferences that we study in some
of our extensions — one can ensure that the direct effect outweighs the indirect
effect, so that g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )) is monotonically increasing in θ∗ .


2     Uncoordinated Fiscal Rules
We begin by analyzing uncoordinated fiscal rules. Each government indepen-
dently chooses a fiscal rule to maximize its expected welfare, subject to the budget
constraint and taking the interest rate as given:

                               θ∗

                                       subject to (1) and (6).

This program takes into account that, given a fiscal rule θ∗ , all types θ ≤ θ∗ exert
full discretion and thus choose spending g f (θ, R) and assets xf (θ, R) (defined by
(1) and (6)), whereas all types θ > θ∗ have no discretion and thus choose g f (θ∗ , R)
and xf (θ∗ , R).
    Note that program (7) allows for any positive cutoff θ∗ ≤ θ, and given this,
one can show that the solution is a cutoff θ∗u > 0 that satisfies the first-order


                                                 10
condition with equality. This condition yields

               Zθ
                                                          
                     θU 0 g f (θ∗u , R) − RW 0 xf (θ∗u , R) f (θ) dθ = 0,            (8)
               θ∗u


where f (θ) = 0 for θ < θ. Equation (8) shows that the optimal uncoordinated
fiscal rule sets a cutoff θ∗u such that the average distortion above this cutoff is zero.
Specifically, given the cutoff, there exists b  θ > θ∗u such that if the government’s
type is θ ∈ [θ∗u , b
                   θ), then
                                                              
                         θU 0 g f (θ∗u , R) < RW 0 xf (θ∗u , R) ,

and hence the government overborrows relative to its ex-ante optimum (defined
in (5)). If instead the government’s type is θ ∈ (b
                                                  θ, θ], then
                                                              
                         θU 0 g f (θ∗u , R) > RW 0 xf (θ∗u , R) ,

and hence the government underborrows relative to its ex-ante optimum. The
optimal uncoordinated rule specifies θ∗u so that the marginal benefit of providing
more flexibility to types θ > b
                              θ which are underborrowing is equal to the marginal
cost of providing more discretion to types θ < bθ which are overborrowing.
   By substituting (6) into (8), we obtain the following result.
Proposition 1. For any given interest rate R, the optimal uncoordinated fiscal
rule specifies a cutoff θ∗u satisfying

                                   E [θ|θ ≥ θ∗u ]  1
                                         ∗        = .                                (9)
                                        θu         β

    Equation (9) shows that the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule is independent
of the form of the utility functions and the level of the interest rate. If β =
1, (9) implies θ∗u = θ, so the optimal uncoordinated rule entails full flexibility.
Intuitively, in the absence of a present bias, there is no benefit to the government
from constraining its borrowing and spending. At the other extreme, if β ≤ θ,
(9) implies θ∗u ≤ θ, so the government grants itself minimal discretion. That
is, all types are bunched at the same spending level, which corresponds to what

                                           11
would be the government’s flexible spending level if its type were θ∗u . Finally, if
β ∈ (θ, 1), (9) implies that the optimal uncoordinated rule is bounded discretion
with a cutoff θ∗u ∈ (θ, θ).
    Under mild restrictions on the distribution function F (θ), Proposition 1 yields
that the level of discretion in the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule is monotoni-
cally decreasing in the government’s present bias:

Corollary 1. If F (θ) satisfies

                              d log E [θ|θ ≥ θ∗ ]
                                                  < 1 for all θ∗ ≤ θ,                                 (10)
                                   d log θ∗

then θ∗u is strictly increasing in β.

    Condition (10) is satisfied by all log-concave densities, which includes several
familiar distributions (Bagnoli and Bergstrom, 2005).
    Proposition 1 characterizes the fiscal rule θ∗u that each government chooses
when taking the interest rate as given. At the same time, note that this rule
effectively determines the level of the interest rate: as described in Section 1, R
must adjust so that the global resource constraint (4) is satisfied. If β = 1 and
                                               Rθ
thus θ∗u = θ, the interest rate is such that θ g f (θ, R) f (θ) dθ = τ . At the other
extreme, if β ≤ θ and thus θ∗u ≤ θ, each government runs a balanced budget, so
the first-order condition (8) implies an interest rate R = U 0 (τ )/W 0 (0).17 Finally,
if β ∈ (θ, 1) and thus θ∗u ∈ (θ, θ), the interest rate is pinned down by
                     ∗
                 Zθu                           Zθ
                    g f (θ, R (θu )) f (θ) dθ + g f (θ∗u , R (θ∗u )) f (θ) dθ = τ ,
                                ∗

                 θ                                 θ∗u


where recall θ∗u is independent of R.18 Lemma 1 implies that if governments
are present-biased (i.e. β < 1), then the interest rate that is induced by the
uncoordinated fiscal rules θ∗u is lower than the one that would prevail were all
governments granted full flexibility.
  17
    If θ∗u ≤ θ, all types’ first-period spending is g f (θ∗u , R), and so by (4) we have g f (θ∗u , R) = τ .
  18
    As for implementation, on the other hand, note that θ∗u is associated with a maximum
allowable spending limit g f (θ∗u , R (θ∗u )) which does depend on R.

3       Coordinated Fiscal Rules
We now proceed to the main part of our analysis, which considers the optimal
coordinated fiscal rule. This rule is chosen by a central authority that represents
all governments and takes into account the impact that rules have on the interest
rate, as characterized in Lemma 1.


3.1      Solving for the Optimal Coordinated Fiscal Rule
An optimal coordinated fiscal rule maximizes total expected welfare subject to
each government’s budget constraint and the global resource constraint:

This program is identical to program (7) which solves for the optimal uncoordi-
nated fiscal rule, with the exception that (11) takes into account that the interest
rate is a function of the cutoff θ∗ . That is, given g f (θ, R (θ∗ )) and xf (θ, R (θ∗ ))
defined by (1) and (6), the interest rate R (θ∗ ) is defined by the global resource
constraint (4), and is characterized in Lemma 1.
    The first-order condition of the coordinated program yields:

    Comparing Lemma 2 and Proposition 1 shows how the optimal coordinated
fiscal rule θ∗c differs from the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule θ∗u . The difference
is that the second term in (12) does not appear in expression (9). This term is
associated with two factors, ρ and λ, which capture the effects that the interest
rate has on the allocation. As we explain subsequently, ρ captures the redistribu-
tive effect of the interest rate, while λ is the disciplining effect. These effects are
internalized by a coordinated rule but not by an uncoordinated rule.
    The redistributive effect of the interest rate, ρ, is positive. This effect captures
the fact that higher interest rates hurt first-period borrowers by increasing their
debt in the second period. Countries of higher type θ borrow more in the first
period and therefore benefit more from a reduction in the interest rate than
countries of lower type. Moreover, because of their higher spending in the first
period, higher type countries also have a higher marginal cost of debt in the second
period than lower type countries. Hence, the central authority (which cares about
average welfare) weighs higher type countries by more, and as a result finds it
optimal to commit to a lower interest rate to redistribute resources from lower
type to higher type countries.
    To understand the consequences of the redistributive effect, suppose that con-
dition (10) holds, so that the left-hand side of (12) is decreasing in θ∗c . Then
holding all else fixed, (12) shows that a higher value of ρ implies a lower value
of θ∗c .19 That is, the redistributive effect puts downward pressure on the optimal
level of discretion: by lowering flexibility, the coordinated rule induces a lower in-
terest rate, thus redistributing resources from countries that borrow less to those
that borrow more. This redistribution is ex-ante beneficial for all countries.
    The redistributive effect of the interest rate arises even in the absence of a
present bias, i.e. even if β = 1. As mentioned in the Introduction, this effect
is present in other models that abstract from self-control issues and consider in-

stead incomplete market economies with heterogenous agents. The redistributive
channel reflects the fact that, absent perfect insurance markets, distortions such
as deficit limits can improve social welfare.
    Consider next the disciplining effect of the interest rate, λ. This effect captures
the fact that the level of the interest rate affects the level of borrowing and
spending that governments choose when given discretion. As shown in (14), λ may
be positive or negative; its sign depends on how borrowing and spending change
with R and how this in turn affects low versus high θ types. For intuition, suppose
dg f (θ, R) /dR < 0, so that higher interest rates induce governments to borrow
less. A higher interest rate in this case is beneficial for countries whose type is
relatively low, as these countries overborrow relative to their ex-ante optimum.
On the other hand, a higher interest rate harms countries whose type is high
because these countries underborrow relative to their ex-ante optimum.
    To understand the consequences of the disciplining effect, suppose again that
condition (10) holds, so the left-hand side of (12) is decreasing in θ∗c , and maintain
the assumption that dg f (θ, R) /dR < 0. It can be verified that if θ∗c in expression
(14) were to take the value of θ∗u given in (9), then λ would be negative. Intu-
itively, if the cutoff is chosen at the uncoordinated optimum θ∗u , then as discussed
in Section 2, the average distortion above the cutoff is zero: on average, the
constrained types θ > θ∗u are neither overborrowing nor underborrowing relative
to the ex-ante optimum. This means that the disciplining effect is determined
by the unconstrained types θ ≤ θ∗u , and since these types are overborrowing, a
higher interest rate can improve welfare by increasing discipline. It follows that
λ is negative, and by (12) this effect increases the cutoff θ∗c . That is, a nega-
tive disciplining effect puts upward pressure on the optimal level of discretion:
by increasing flexibility, the coordinated rule induces a higher interest rate, thus
improving fiscal discipline for overborrowing governments. This higher level of
discipline is ex-ante beneficial for all countries.

Example. As an illustration, suppose W (x) = x. This example does not satisfy
our assumption that W (x) is strictly concave and hence it is not covered by our
model; yet, we find it instructive to show the extent of the disciplining effect of
the interest rate. The optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule in this case is still a cutoff


                                          15
θ∗u that satisfies (9), so that θ∗u < θ for β < 1. However, note that since assets
held globally equal zero, the ex-ante optimal allocation maximizes
         Z    θ                                            Z   θ
                  (θU (g(θ, R)) + W (x(θ, R))) f (θ)dθ =           θU (g(θ, R))f (θ)dθ,
          θ                                                θ


and thus it equalizes the marginal utility of first-period spending across all gov-
ernment types. Moreover, by (6), this allocation can be implemented by granting
full flexibility to all governments, so that each type θ chooses g f (θ, R) satisfying
θU 0 (g f (θ, R)) = βR. It follows that the optimal coordinated fiscal rule is a cutoff
θ∗c = θ for all β ≤ 1. Intuitively, since the marginal utility of assets is constant
when W (x) = x, the redistributive effect of the interest rate ρ is zero, whereas
the disciplining effect λ is negative and large enough that full flexibility is always
optimal. As a result, in this stark example, the optimal coordinated fiscal rule is
slacker than the uncoordinated one whenever β < 1.

    More generally, we find that the level of discretion in the optimal coordinated
fiscal rule, and how it compares to that in the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule,
depends on the relative strength of the redistributive and disciplining effects of
the interest rate. The next section shows that which of the two effects is dominant
depends on governments’ present bias.


3.2    Coordination and Present Bias
The following proposition states our main result.

Proposition 2. There exist β, β ∈ [θ, 1], β > β, such that if β ≥ β, then θ∗c < θ∗u ,
whereas if β ≤ β, then θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ. That is, the optimal coordinated
fiscal rule provides less flexibility than the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule if
governments’ present bias is small enough, but it provides more flexibility than
the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule if governments’ present bias is large enough.

   When governments’ present bias is small, the optimal coordinated fiscal rule
is more stringent than the uncoordinated one, and hence the interest rate is
lower under coordination. To see the logic, take β = 1, so that governments
are not present-biased. The optimal uncoordinated rule in this case entails full

                                             16
flexibility, with a cutoff θ∗u = θ. In fact, there is no disciplining effect of the
interest rate, as no government overborrows relative to the ex-ante optimum.
Since the redistributive effect of the interest rate is positive, it follows that social
welfare can be improved by imposing a tighter fiscal rule, θ∗c < θ∗u , which reduces
the interest rate. This tighter rule lowers flexibility, but it benefits all countries
from an ex-ante perspective by redistributing resources from lower types to higher
types which borrow more and are harmed by high interest rates.
    In contrast, when governments’ present bias is large, the optimal coordinated
fiscal rule is more lax than the uncoordinated one, and hence the interest rate is
higher under coordination.20 To see why this is the case, take some β ≤ θ. The
optimal uncoordinated rule then entails minimal discretion, with a cutoff θ∗u ≤ θ.
Given the endogenous interest rate, it follows that any rule θ∗c = θ∗u ≤ θ yields
the same allocation as θ∗c = θ,21 and thus, to prove the claim, it suffices to show
that setting θ∗c = θ is not optimal. The proof of Proposition 2 rests on showing
that at θ∗c = θ, increasing flexibility is socially beneficial.
    To illustrate, combine (13) and (14) to write the sum of the redistributive and
disciplining effects of the interest rate as

    The first integral corresponds to the redistributive and disciplining effects on
government types whose spending is unconstrained; the second integral corre-
sponds to these effects on types that are constrained by the fiscal rule. Suppose
the cutoff is chosen at the uncoordinated optimum, θ∗c = θ∗u , and, for intuition,
take β approaching θ from above, so that θ∗u and θ∗c also approach θ from above.
As explained in Section 3.1, the disciplining effect on constrained types is zero at
θ∗c = θ∗u ; moreover, as β goes to θ, the redistributive effect goes to zero because all
     For some parametric examples, we find that there exists a unique β ∗ ∈ (θ, 1) such that
      20

θ∗c< θ∗u if β > β ∗ whereas θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ if β < β ∗ .
  21
     Analogous to the discussion in Section 2, if θ∗c ≤ θ, then all types’ first-period spending is
 f ∗
g (θc , R) = τ .



                                                17
types’ assets go to zero. As for the unconstrained types, their mass goes to zero
as β approaches θ; however, the redistributive and disciplining effects on these
types differ in this limit: the redistributive effect vanishes, but the disciplining
effect is strictly negative.22 Thus, it is possible to induce governments of type θ
close to θ to save more at little interest cost to higher government types.
    Proposition 2 shows that when the present bias is large, governments indepen-
dently prefer tight rules. Governments do not internalize the fact that by allowing
themselves less flexibility, they reduce interest rates. By increasing discretion and
therefore raising R, the central authority can provide flexibility while at the same
time guaranteeing more discipline as a consequence of the higher interest rate
that induces governments to borrow less. We find that in some cases, in fact, the
externality is large enough that all countries can be made ex ante better off by
jointly abandoning their uncoordinated rules and allowing themselves full flexi-
bility. This is true, for example, for many parameter values under log preferences
and a uniform distribution of types.23
    As for the magnitude of the welfare gains, note that the benefits of coordi-
nation when governments’ present bias is large are bounded from above by the
benefits of stabilization. That is, the welfare gains from allowing greater flexibil-
ity stem from the ability to smooth out macroeconomic fluctuations; as observed
by Lucas (1987), these gains are thus quantitatively small. On the other hand,
it is worth noting that coordination can have quantitatively large effects on the
interest rate. For instance, suppose governments’ present bias is sufficiently large
so that β ≤ θ. Then under the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule the interest
rate is R = U 0 (τ )/W 0 (0), whereas under the optimal coordinated fiscal rule it is
R > (U 0 (τ )/W 0 (0)) θ/β, which grows without bound as β goes down.
  22
     Note that in this limit, the unconstrained types’ first-period spending is decreasing in R as
their assets are zero and hence there is no income effect of the interest rate.
  23
     E.g., when U (g) = log(g), W (x) = log(τ + x), Θ = [0.5, 1.5], f (θ) = 1, and β = 0.5. The
claim of course is also true in the quasi-linear case described in Section 3.1.

4     Discussion
4.1     Other Instruments
We have shown in Section 3 that if governments’ present bias is large enough,
the optimal coordinated fiscal rule provides more flexibility than the optimal
uncoordinated fiscal rule. By increasing flexibility, the coordinated rule induces
some government types to spend and borrow more, which increases the interest
rate and therefore leads other types to spend and borrow less. A natural question
in light of this result is whether other instruments can achieve a similar effect.
     In particular, can it be optimal to force some government types to spend and
borrow more? Within our framework with no transfers, consider using a fiscal
rule that imposes a maximum surplus limit in addition to a maximum deficit
limit. The rule specifies two cutoffs, θ∗ ∈ [0, θ] and θ∗∗ ∈ [0, θ∗ ], such that: for
types θ < θ∗∗ , the levels of first-period spending and second-period assets are
g f (θ∗∗ , R) and xf (θ∗∗ , R); for types θ ∈ [θ∗∗ , θ∗ ], these levels are g f (θ, R) and
xf (θ, R) ; and for types θ > θ∗ , these levels are g f (θ∗ , R) and xf (θ∗ , R). Hence,
only types θ ∈ [θ∗∗ , θ∗ ] have full discretion; all other types are constrained by the
rule and therefore choose spending either at the maximum deficit limit — thus
spending less than in their flexible optimum — or at the maximum surplus limit
— thus spending more than in their flexible optimum.
     It is immediate that an optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule always sets θ∗∗        u ≤
θ, so the government is not constrained by a maximum surplus limit. For an
individual government that takes the interest rate as fixed, the only effect of
setting a surplus limit is to force low types to borrow more. Since these types
are already overborrowing relative to the ex-ante optimum in the absence of a
surplus limit, a binding limit can only reduce the country’s expected welfare.
     In contrast, an optimal coordinated fiscal rule may set θ∗∗   c > θ, so the govern-
ment is constrained by a maximum surplus limit. A coordinated rule takes into
account not only the direct effect of surplus limits on borrowing by low types, but
also the indirect effect that operates through the interest rate. By increasing R,
a surplus limit has a disciplining effect, and this effect can more than compensate
for the distortions caused by the increased overborrowing by low types.

Proposition 3. Consider fiscal rules consisting of a maximum deficit limit and
a maximum surplus limit, given by cutoffs θ∗ ∈ [0, θ] and θ∗∗ ∈ [0, θ∗ ] respectively.
                                                                                             

such that an optimal coordinated fiscal rule sets θ∗c > θ∗u , θ∗c > θ, and θ∗∗c > θ.


    If governments’ present bias is large enough, then for some specifications of
our model, the optimal coordinated fiscal rule will set a strictly higher maximum
deficit limit and a strictly lower maximum surplus limit than the optimal uncoor-
dinated fiscal rule. To see the idea, combine the first-order condition for θ∗c given
in (12) with the analog of that condition for θ∗∗                      ∗        ∗∗

The left-hand side is the average distortion due to overborrowing by low types;
the right-hand side is the average distortion due to overborrowing by high types.
The optimal coordinated rule specifies (θ∗c , θ∗∗
                                               c ) to equalize these costs. Thus,
under a large present bias, committing to overborrowing by low types can boost
welfare by increasing the interest rate and reducing overborrowing by high types.
    Maximum deficit and surplus limits are simple policy instruments which do
not require the use of transfers.24 More broadly, one could depart from our
setting to allow for other instruments that imply transfers, like (interior) taxes.
We make two observations. First, one may conjecture that a Pigouvian tax on
borrowing or the associated interest income could be used by the central authority
to increase fiscal discipline. However, in a closed economy with only one asset
like ours, a linear tax would have no effect on the equilibrium allocation (see,
e.g., Diamond, 1967; Hart, 1975; Stiglitz, 1982; Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis,
1986). Intuitively, since the endogenous interest rate adjusts, a linear tax would
only result in a proportional change in R so that the effective cost of borrowing
and the allocation are kept unchanged.25 Second, one can show that the use of
  24
     As noted previously, solving for the optimal coordinated mechanism without transfers in
full generality is difficult, as the problem is not convex when the interest rate is endogenous.
This is in contrast to the uncoordinated problem, which, as shown in Amador, Werning and
Angeletos (2006), can be ensured to be convex under weak conditions.
  25
     That is, consider a linear tax φ on borrowing, which raises no revenue since aggregate net


                                                        20
non-linear taxes, on the other hand, can enhance welfare. This is not surprising:
deficit and surplus limits are extreme forms of non-linear taxes which induce a
particularly large distortion on the highest and lowest government types. This
distortion can be reduced, for example, by allowing governments to exceed a limit
by paying an interior tax fee. Since a general study of mechanisms with transfers
would give rise to a whole new set of issues that are beyond the scope of our
paper, we leave these questions for future work.


4.2     Interaction of Coordinated and Uncoordinated Rules
Our analysis so far has considered two extreme cases: either all countries choose
fiscal rules independently, or a central authority chooses a fiscal rule that applies
to all countries. However, as discussed in the Introduction, reality may be in
between these two extremes. Examples like that of the European Union and Ger-
many suggest that even when a group of countries agree on a common rule, some
of these countries may be able (and want) to enforce additional fiscal constraints.
We investigate this possibility in this section.
    Consider a coordinated fiscal rule θ∗c and, to fix ideas, assume that this rule is
implemented with a spending limit gc∗ ≡ g f (θ∗c , R(θ∗c )). Suppose that a fraction ψ
of governments can individually impose a different rule on themselves. Because
the coordinated rule is fully enforceable, governments cannot implement a cutoff
θ∗ > θ∗c ; that is, all countries must respect the spending limit gc∗ . However, some
governments may be able to commit to a cutoff θ∗ < θ∗c , thus restricting them-
selves to lower spending in the first period than allowed by the central authority.
Enforcing these additional fiscal constraints requires strong institutions; we are
interested in the case in which only a fraction ψ of countries have the necessary
institutional environment to set θ∗ < θ∗c .
    If governments’ present bias is small, the possibility of supplementing the
coordinated rule with additional fiscal constraints is irrelevant: by Proposition 2,
individual governments prefer slacker constraints than those optimally imposed
                                                              x
borrowing is zero. The budget constraint (1) becomes g + R     (1 − φ) = τ and flexible spending
 f                                   0  f                0  f
g (θ, R) is now given by (1 − φ)θU g (θ, R) = βRW x (θ, R) . Because R adjusts so that
the global resource constraint (4) holds, the equilibrium cost of borrowing R/(1 − φ), and thus
the equilibrium allocation, are unchanged by φ. Note also that if governments are left to choose
their fiscal rules without coordination, the rules they would choose are invariant to R and φ.


                                               21
by the central authority. If governments’ present bias is large, on the other hand,
Proposition 2 implies that governments would want to impose stricter rules on
themselves than imposed centrally. In this case, the fraction ψ of governments
which have the ability to implement additional constraints would choose to adopt
their optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule θ∗u < θ∗c . What is the impact on the world
economy? How would the central authority respond?
    Arguments analogous to those in Lemma 1 imply that when a fraction ψ of
governments adopt tighter fiscal rules, the interest rate declines. If the coordi-
nated fiscal rule is kept unchanged, with a spending limit gc∗ , the lower interest
rate then induces higher borrowing and spending by the remaining governments
whose rules have not changed. That is, by imposing more discipline on them-
selves, the fraction ψ of governments worsen fiscal discipline everywhere else.
    In response to this, however, the central authority would optimally change the
coordinated spending limit gc∗ . Under certain conditions, we are able to solve the
central authority’s problem when a fraction ψ of governments choose their optimal
uncoordinated rule θ∗u < θ∗c , and we find that the optimal level of discretion for
the remaining fraction of countries is decreasing in ψ.

Proposition 4. Consider fiscal rules for a set of countries when a fraction ψ
can choose θ∗u if the central authority chooses θ∗c > θ∗u . There exist β ∈ [θ, 1] and
ψ ∈ (0, 1) such that if β ≤ β and ψ ≤ ψ, then θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ. Moreover, if
U (g) = log(g), W (x) = log(τ +x), and θ∗c is a unique and interior global optimum
with θ∗c > θ∗u , then a marginal increase in ψ causes θ∗c to decline.

    When the optimal coordinated fiscal rule is slacker than the uncoordinated
one, an inefficiency arises if some governments can adopt tighter fiscal rules than
those imposed centrally. As described above, the tighter rules depress global in-
terest rates and reduce fiscal discipline for the rest of the governments. Moreover,
note that under log preferences, equations (13) and (14) yield

                                     1 − R (θ∗c )
                            ρ+λ=                         ,                         (15)
                                 R (θ∗c ) (1 + R (θ∗c ))

and thus the sum of the redistributive and disciplining effects of the interest rate is
decreasing in R (θ∗c ). Intuitively, the redistributive effect is stronger on the margin
when interest rates are low: when R (θ∗c ) declines, all types shift spending towards

                                          22
the first period, implying that their marginal utility-weighted debt in the second
period increases and, as implied by (13), ρ increases. It follows that if a fraction
of governments adopt more stringent rules and thus the interest rate declines, the
redistributive effect becomes more powerful relative to the disciplining effect. As
a result, the optimal response of the central authority is to tighten restrictions
for the remaining governments, whose welfare declines.26
    In sum, if governments’ present bias is large, so that the optimal coordinated
fiscal rule provides more flexibility than the uncoordinated one, then the ability
of some countries to impose greater fiscal restrictions on themselves has clear
externalities on others. We find that these countries will adopt such restrictions,
and all countries will face lower interest rates and less flexibility as a consequence.


4.3     Open World Economy
We have studied optimal coordinated fiscal rules for an entire world economy. In
practice, though, coordinated rules are chosen by groups of countries within a
larger world system. In this section, we explore what this consideration implies
for the optimal design of rules, and how changes in outside economies affect a
group of countries which choose their rules jointly.
    Denote by E the group of countries coordinating on fiscal rules and by A the
rest of the world, where for simplicity we let countries in A have mass one like
those in E. Suppose A-countries lend an exogenous (positive or negative) amount
L to E-countries in the first period and are repaid RL in the second period,
where R is the common world interest rate. Since each individual government
in E faces the same budget constraint and the same welfare function as in our
baseline model, we define type θ’s flexible level of spending g f (θ, R) as in (6),
along with a fiscal rule θ∗ . What is different in this open world economy is that
the interest rate must reflect borrowing and lending between countries in E and A.
The first-period global resource constraint (4) under a common rule θ∗ therefore
  26
    Note that θ∗u is independent of θ∗c , and hence setting θ∗u < θ∗c is a best response for the
fraction ψ of countries.

    Proposition 1 applies to this setting by analogous arguments as those in our
baseline model: taking the interest rate as given, each individual government in
E chooses an optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule θ∗u satisfying (9). The implied
allocation, of course, depends on the value of external lending L. For example,
if β ≤ θ, all governments in E allow themselves no flexibility and thus choose
second-period assets x = −RL, i.e. they borrow L in the initial period. By the
same logic as in Section 2, the interest rate then satisfies R = U 0 (τ +L)/W 0 (−RL).
    Regarding the optimal coordinated fiscal rule, results analogous to those in
Proposition 2 also apply to this open world economy. In particular, provided that
initial lending from A-countries is not too high, we can show that the optimal
coordinated rule is slacker than the uncoordinated one when governments’ present
bias is large, since then the disciplining effect of the interest rate outweighs the
redistributive effect. The result relies on lending L being below a level L > 0 as
there is now an additional redistributive effect of the interest rate: a decline in R
redistributes resources from creditor A-countries to debtor E-countries.28
    Now given a large present bias, how do changes in external funds from A
affect countries in E? An increase in lending L has a depressing effect on global
interest rates, which not only worsens fiscal discipline but can also lead to reduced
flexibility in E.

     We focus here on the large present bias case. Our baseline results under a small present
bias also apply to this open world economy provided that L is above a level L < 0.

Proposition 5. Consider fiscal rules for a set of countries that borrow an initial
amount L from external sources. There exist β ∈ [θ, 1] and L > 0 such that
if β ≤ β and L ≤ L, then θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ. Moreover, if U (g) = log(g),
W (x) = log(τ + x), and θ∗c is a unique and interior global optimum with θ∗c > θ∗u ,
then a marginal increase in L causes θ∗c to decline.

    As discussed in the previous section, under log preferences, the redistributive
effect of the interest rate becomes more powerful relative to the disciplining effect
as the interest rate declines. As a result, if lending from A increases and thus
R goes down, the optimal response of a central authority in E is to tighten
restrictions for E-governments. Countries end up with lower interest rates, less
flexibility, and lower welfare as a consequence of the increase in external funds.


4.4     Heterogeneity
In order to identify differences between coordinated and uncoordinated fiscal rules
which would not be due to countries having different characteristics, we considered
homogenous countries in our analysis. In this section, we show that our results
are robust to ex-ante heterogeneity across countries.
    There are two main factors that complicate the analysis of heterogeneity.
First, the program in (11) that solves for the optimal coordinated fiscal rule need
not always admit a unique global optimum, and thus global comparative statics
are difficult to establish using implicit differentiation.29 Second, even in the pres-
ence of a unique global optimum, the competing redistributive and disciplining
effects of the interest rate in (12) become analytically intractable when countries
are heterogeneous. Thus, while in principle heterogenous countries may optimally
be subject to heterogeneous rules under coordination, a general analysis of such
rules is difficult.
    To make progress, we consider an environment in which countries are ex-ante
heterogeneous but must adopt a common spending limit g ∗ when coordinating
their rules. Our motivation stems from real-world fiscal rules: in practice, supra-
national rules typically apply uniformly across countries, even if countries have
  29
    More generally, the welfare function need not be globally concave; for example, if β ≤ θ,
then this function is convex at θ∗ = θ. Without a unique global optimum for all parameters,
the Implicit Function Theorem cannot be applied to large perturbations in parameters.


                                             25
different ex-ante characteristics. To simplify the exposition, we model hetero-
geneity by allowing for two groups of countries, labeled N and S, which differ
along some dimension, as we describe next. A fraction ψ ∈ (0, 1) of countries are
in group N and the remaining fraction 1 − ψ of countries are in group S.
    Suppose first that the two groups of countries N and S have different distribu-
tions of shocks θ, with density functions fN (θ) and fS (θ) respectively. Maintain
the assumption that EN [θ] = ES [θ] = 1, and define g f (θ, R) as in (6). The
arguments in Proposition 1 apply without change, and yield that a government’s
optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule satisfies (9) with the expectation taken under
fN (θ) or fS (θ) depending on the government’s group. Moreover, to solve for
the optimal coordinated fiscal rule, note that the problem of a utilitarian central
authority is analogous to (11), with the only difference that the density function
is now ψfN (θ) + (1 − ψ)fS (θ) instead of f (θ). The same proof strategy as in
our baseline model therefore applies, implying that the results in Proposition 2
extend to countries which are heterogeneous in their shock distributions.30
    Suppose next that the two groups of countries N and S have different levels
of present bias, denoted by β N and β S respectively, in addition to potentially
different shock distributions. The optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule for a govern-
ment in group i = N, S solves equation (9) with present-bias parameter β i and
the expectation taken under fi (θ). To study the optimal coordinated fiscal rule,
define the variable γ to take the value θ/β i if the government is of type θ and
belongs to group i. The flexible level of spending for a type γ, g f (γ, R), is then
given by
                                                        
                         γU 0 g f (γ, R) = RW 0 xf (γ, R)                       (17)

under the budget constraint (1). For i = N, S, define θi (γ) ≡ β i γ and hi (γ) ≡
 1
   f (β i γ), where the support of γ in group i has limits γ i ≡ θi /β i and γ i ≡ θi /β i .
βi i
Note that the optimal uncoordinated rule for a government in group i can be
written as γ ∗ui solving Ei [θi (γ) |γ ≥ γ ∗ui ] = γ ∗ui , with the expectation under hi (γ).
    We follow similar steps to those above to solve the central authority’s problem
under coordination. Let γ ≡ min{γ N , γ S }, γ ≡ max {γ N , γ S }, h (γ) ≡ ψhN (γ) +
(1 − ψ)hS (γ), and θ (γ) ≡ (ψhN (γ) θN (γ) + (1 − ψ)hS (γ) θS (γ)) /h (γ). The

    If the expectation of θ also varies across countries, then our main result under a large
present bias continues to hold provided that this variation is not too large.

The solution yields analogous results to those in Proposition 2, showing that our
findings are robust to heterogeneity in shock processes and present biases.

Proposition 6. Consider fiscal rules for a set of heterogeneous countries: a
fraction ψ ∈ (0, 1) of countries have parameters {fN , β N } and the remaining
fraction 1 − ψ have parameters {fS , β S }, where EN [θ] = ES [θ] = 1. There exist
β, β ∈ [θ, 1], β > β, such that if min {β N , β S } ≥ β, then γ ∗c < min {γ ∗uN , γ ∗uS },
whereas if max {β N , β S } ≤ β, then γ ∗c > max {γ ∗uN , γ ∗uS } and γ ∗c > γ.


4.5     Infinite Horizon
We have studied a two-period model in which a government’s continuation wel-
fare as a function of assets, W (x), is exogenously specified. In practice, this
continuation welfare depends on future fiscal rules, policies, and interest rates,
where the interest rates in turn depend on the policies adopted across countries.
Consider an infinite horizon setting with independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) shocks, where the government’s utility of spending in period t ∈ {0, 1, . . .}
is θt U (gt ). The analysis of uncoordinated fiscal rules in such a setting is still
simple, as one can subsume within the function W (·) the future sequence of fiscal
rules and interest rates. Analogous to the results in Amador, Werning and An-
geletos (2006), we show in the Online Appendix that the optimal uncoordinated
fiscal rule in fact coincides with that in our two-period setting. Specifically, in
each period t, each government implements a time invariant cutoff θ∗u satisfying

                                                 27
(9), such that all types θt ≤ θ∗u have full flexibility at t and all types θt > θ∗u
spend at the flexible level corresponding to type θ∗u at t.
    Under coordination, on the other hand, countries must take into account how
fiscal rules affect the interest rate, which is non-trivial with an infinite horizon. To
see why, suppose countries use a time-invariant rule θ∗ . For a given deterministic
sequence of interest rates, the rule can be implemented as a sequence of history-
dependent borrowing limits for each country, inducing a wealth distribution across
countries at every date. The difficulty is that in equilibrium, the sequence of
interest rates must be such that the net world wealth is zero in each period, and
this implies a fixed point problem that in general cannot be solved analytically.
    To make the problem tractable, we follow Halac and Yared (2014) by assuming
that the government’s utility of spending in period t is θt U (gt ) = θt log(gt ), and
considering the limit of a T -period economy as T → ∞. These assumptions imply
that if countries adopt a time-invariant rule θ∗ , then the interest rate is constant
over time and increasing in θ∗ . Of course, in principle, countries may choose
a time-varying rule that depends in a complicated manner on the sequence of
assets in each country and the sequence of world wealth distribution. However,
we show in the Online Appendix that if countries restrict themselves to rules
θ∗ (t) that apply to all countries symmetrically (independently of their assets),
then a time-invariant cutoff θ∗c is optimal under coordination. This allows us to
extend our analysis of coordinated rules to an infinite horizon, and to show that
our results are robust: as described in the Online Appendix, we find that in an
infinite horizon setting with i.i.d. shocks and log preferences, θ∗c < θ∗u if β is high
enough whereas θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ if β is low enough.31


5     Conclusion
This paper presented a theoretical framework to compare coordinated and un-
coordinated fiscal rules. We established that whether the optimal coordinated
  31
     Given an infinite horizon setting, one could also study the self-enforcement of fiscal rules.
That is, while we have assumed throughout our paper that governments are able to commit
to abiding a given rule, in a dynamic setting, rules may be respected even in the absence of
such commitment power. As discussed in Halac and Yared (2014, pp. 1582–83), if governments
place a sufficiently high value on the future, a deficit limit can be self-enforced in equilibrium
by using the threat of reversion to full flexibility upon a violation of the limit.


                                               28
fiscal rule is more or less constraining than the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule
depends on governments’ present bias. In particular, if the present bias is large,
a central authority optimally imposes a slacker deficit limit than that chosen by
individual governments: by increasing flexibility, the coordinated rule leads to a
higher interest rate, which naturally increases fiscal discipline in all countries. We
showed that imposing a maximum surplus limit in addition to a maximum deficit
limit can boost welfare by increasing interest rates further and harnessing the
power of their disciplining effect. Finally, we studied the effects of some countries
being able to supplement coordinated rules with additional fiscal constraints, as
well as the effects of an external supply of funds, showing how they influence
governments’ deficits and the optimal level of discretion.
    Although our focus has been on fiscal policy, our analysis applies more gener-
ally to any group of households, firms, or countries that face a tradeoff between
commitment and flexibility. For instance, households choose forced savings plans
as a means to commit to not overspend; firms impose investment rules on them-
selves to prevent over-expansion; and countries set environmental quotas to limit
pollution. These parties face a commitment-versus-flexibility tradeoff, as they
also value having discretion to respond to possible contingencies. Furthermore,
in all these circumstances, the price of the temptation good — the interest rate
for households, the price of investment goods for firms, and the price of polluting
materials for countries — is endogenous to the rules that parties choose. Specif-
ically, the more flexible are the rules, the higher is the price of the temptation
good. As such, an ex-ante commitment to flexibility, while not necessarily pri-
vately beneficial for the parties involved, can allow to increase overall discipline
and lead to higher social welfare.

A      Appendix
A.1      Proof of Lemma 1
Consider a fiscal rule θ∗ applying to all governments. Type θ’s first-period spend-
ing is g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )) if θ > θ∗ and g f (θ, R (θ∗ )) if θ ≤ θ∗ . Substituting into the
first-period global resource constraint given in (4) yields

               Zθ∗                        Zθ
                   f        ∗
                  g (θ, R (θ )) f (θ) dθ + g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )) f (θ) dθ = τ .                            (19)

Differentiating this equation with respect to θ∗ , we obtain
                                                                           f       ∗

where the strict inequality follows from the fact that U (·) and W (·) are strictly
increasing and concave. Equation (21) implies that the numerator on the right-
hand side of (20) is strictly negative for θ∗ < θ.
    To sign the denominator in (20), differentiate (6) with respect to R and follow
similar steps as above to obtain

                µ (θ, R (θ∗ )) ≡                                                                        .

The first term in (22) is strictly negative whereas the sign of the second term is
ambiguous and depends on the sign of τ − g f (θ, R (θ∗ )). Since the denominator
in (20) is equal to the integral of (22) over θ, this denominator therefore consists
of a strictly negative term plus the following term:
                             ∗
                      1 Rθ                                         
                       ∗       µ (θ, R (θ∗ )) τ − g f (θ, R (θ∗ )) f (θ) dθ
                   R (θ ) θ
                                                                                                                 (23)
                     1 Rθ                                            
                 +     ∗      µ (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )) τ − g f (θ∗ , R (θ∗ )) f (θ) dθ.
                   R (θ ) θ∗

To determine the sign of (23), note that if θ00 > θ0 , then (1) and (21) imply
g f (θ00 , R (θ∗ )) > g f (θ0 , R (θ∗ )) and xf (θ00 , R (θ∗ )) < xf (θ0 , R (θ∗ )). Moreover, by




                                                     36
Assumption 1, it follows that
                                                                                    
 U 00 g f (θ00 , R)    U 00 g f (θ0 , R)          W 00 xf (θ00 , R)    W 00 xf (θ0 , R)
− 0 f 00             ≤− 0 f 0             , and −                    ≥− 0 f 0            .
 U (g (θ , R))         U (g (θ , R))              W 0 (xf (θ00 , R))   W (x (θ , R))

Hence, we obtain that if θ00 > θ0 , then τ − g f (θ00 , R (θ∗ )) < τ − g f (θ0 , R (θ∗ )) and
µ (θ00 , R (θ∗ )) ≥ µ (θ0 , R (θ∗ )). It follows that τ − g and µ are weakly negatively
correlated, and given (19) the expected value of τ − g is equal to zero. Therefore,
the sign of (23) is weakly negative, implying that the denominator in (20) is
strictly negative. Since we had established that the numerator in (20) is also
strictly negative for θ∗ < θ, we obtain R0 (θ∗ ) > 0 for θ∗ < θ.


A.2      Proof of Proposition 1 and Corollary 1
The proof of Proposition 1 follows from the claims in the text and the fact that
θ∗u < θ for β < 1. To see the latter, note that the second derivative of the objective
evaluated at θ∗ = θ is

               ∂g f (θ∗ , R)                                       
           −          ∗      |θ∗ =θ θU 0 g f θ, R − RW 0 xf θ, R     f θ ,
                   ∂θ

which is strictly positive for β < 1.
      To prove Corollary 1, note that to establish that θ∗u is strictly increasing in
β, it is sufficient to show that the left-hand side of (9) is strictly decreasing in
θ∗u , since the right-hand side is strictly decreasing in β. The derivative of the
left-hand side of (9) for a cutoff θ∗ is
                                                                              
               d (E [θ|θ ≥ θ∗ ] /θ∗ )   1       dE [θ|θ ≥ θ∗ ] E [θ|θ ≥ θ∗ ]
                           ∗          = ∗                     −                    .    (24)

Substitution of (1) and (6) and simple algebraic manipulations yield (12)−(14).


A.4      Proof of Proposition 2
To prove the first part of the proposition (β ≥ β), take β = 1. By Proposition 1,
θ∗u = θ. Now consider θ∗c . By Lemma 1, R0 (θ∗ ) > 0 for θ∗ < θ, implying that
there is no loss of generality in maximizing (11) with respect to the interest rate.32
Given β = 1 and using the Implicit Function Theorem, first-order conditions yield

which holds with equality if θ∗c is interior. Suppose now that θ∗c = θ. Note that
using (20), we can rewrite the first term on the left-hand side of (25) as
                                ∗
                                                                                                      

                             θ                                       θ∗c
                                                                  

  32
     The same analysis holds by taking the derivative with respect to θ∗c ; we pursue this route
to simplify the steps.


                                                            38
which is equal to zero at θ∗c = θ (as the expectation is equal to zero given β = 1).
To sign the second term on the left-hand side of (25), note that by (1) and (21),
g f (θ, R) is strictly increasing in θ whereas xf (θ, R) is strictly decreasing in θ.
                                                        
This implies that W 0 xf (θ, R) and τ − g f (θ, R) are negatively correlated.
Given (19), the expected value of τ − g is equal to zero; thus, it follows that the
second term on the left-hand side of (25) is strictly negative. This implies that if
θ∗c = θ, the left-hand side of (25) is strictly negative, a contradiction. Therefore,
we must have θ∗c < θ = θ∗u .
     To prove the second part of the proposition (β ≤ β), take β ≤ θ. By Propo-
sition 1, θ∗u ≤ θ. Note that any rule θ∗c ≤ θ would yield the same allocation and
hence the same welfare as a rule θ∗c = θ. Therefore, to prove the proposition, it
suffices to show that θ∗c = θ is not optimal. This is what we prove next.
     Consider a fiscal rule θ∗ = θ with associated interest rate R = R (θ∗ ). Welfare
under this rule is given by (11). The first derivative with respect to θ∗ is

    If θ∗ = θ, then g f (θ∗ , R) = τ and xf (θ∗ , R) = 0, and it can therefore be
verified that each of the two lines in (26) equals zero at θ∗ = θ. This means that
welfare is at a local maximum or a local minimum. We will now establish that
the second derivative of the objective at θ∗ = θ is strictly positive, implying that
the objective is at a local minimum at this point.
    Before taking second-order conditions, note that substituting with θ∗ = θ in
(20) yields

since the marginal type θ∗ = θ overspends by more than average. Hence, (28) is
strictly positive, implying that θ∗ = θ is a local minimum.

B     Online Appendix
In this Online Appendix, we provide proofs for the results in Section 4 of the
paper. Since several of our claims are for the case of log preferences, we begin by
restating our problem under this preference structure.


B.1     Log Preferences
Take U (g) = log(g) and W (x) = δ log(τ + x) for δ > 0. Equations (1) and (6)
imply

                                             θ      τ
                              g f (θ, R) =        τ+     ,                                               (29)
                                          θ + βδ     R
                                            βδ        τ
                              xf (θ, R) =        R τ+      .                                             (30)
                                          θ + βδ       R
                                  βδ
Equivalently, letting sf (θ) = θ+βδ   be type θ’s savings rate under full flexibility,
we have
                                                     τ
                         g f (θ, R) = 1 − sf (θ) τ +       .
                                                       R
For a given rule θ∗ ∈ [0, θ], the aggregate savings rate in the economy is
                              Z    θ∗                          Z       θ
                      ∗                   βδ                                 βδ
                 S (θ ) =                      f (θ)dθ +                     ∗    f (θ)dθ.
                               θ        θ + βδ                     θ∗      θ + βδ

The uncoordinated program in (7), on the other hand, reduces to the first two
lines of (31).
    As explained in the paper, the difference between the optimal coordinated

                                                         41
fiscal rule and the optimal uncoordinated fiscal rule can be expressed as a func-
tion of the redistributive and disciplining effects of the interest rate. Under log
preferences, the sum of these two effects is

                                             1 − δR (θ∗c )
                                     ρ+λ=                         .                                 (32)
                                          R (θ∗c ) (1 + R (θ∗c ))

Equation (32) is the same as equation (15) but allowing for any δ > 0. This
equation shows that the redistributive effect of the interest rate dominates the
disciplining effect if and only if R (θ∗c ) < 1/δ. As discussed in the paper, the
redistributive effect is stronger on the margin when interest rates are low.33


B.2          Proof of Proposition 3
We prove the results by example. Take log preferences. Analogous to the expres-
sions in Section B.1 above, given cutoffs θ∗ ∈ [0, θ] and θ∗∗ ∈ [0, θ∗ ], the aggregate
savings rate in the economy is
                    Z     θ∗∗                      Z   θ∗                      Z   θ
         ∗    ∗∗                    βδ                        βδ                         βδ
  S (θ , θ ) =                   ∗∗    f (θ)dθ +                   f (θ)dθ +            ∗     f (θ)dθ,

Since   θ∗c
         is the unique global optimum, we can determine its comparative statics
with respect to ψ by implicit differentiation of (35). Since the program is locally


                                                           44
concave, the derivative of the left-hand side of (35) with respect to θ∗c is negative.
If we can establish that the derivative of the left-hand side of (35) with respect
to ψ is negative, then this implies that θ∗c is locally decreasing in ψ. We find that
this is indeed the case: the derivative of the left-hand side of (35) with respect
to ψ is

where we have taken into account that dS (θ∗c , ψ) /dψ > 0 since θ∗u < θ∗c .


B.4       Proof of Proposition 5
To prove the first part of the proposition, we follow the same steps as in the proof
of Proposition 2 for the case of β ≤ θ, taking into account that (4) is now replaced
by (16). We show that setting a coordinated cutoff θ∗ = θ is not optimal. Note
that R0 (θ∗ ) continues to satisfy (20), and it satisfies (27) when θ∗ = θ. The first-
order condition of the coordinated problem must therefore satisfy equation (26).
If θ∗ = θ, then g f (θ∗ , R) = τ + L and xf (θ∗ , R) = −RL, so that (26) becomes
                                         Z                                   !
                                              θ                   
                         −R0 (θ)                  W 0 xf (θ∗ , R) f (θ) dθ L.
                                          θ


Recall that R0 (θ) > 0. Thus, if L < 0, the expression above is strictly positive,
implying that θ∗ = θ is not optimal as an increase in θ∗ would increase welfare.
If instead L = 0, then by the proof of Proposition 2, θ∗ = θ is not optimal either.
Hence, given β ≤ θ, we obtain θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ for L ≤ 0. Finally, since the
objective function of the coordinated problem is continuous in θ∗ and L, it follows
that for L = ε, ε > 0 arbitrarily small, θ∗ = θ is not optimal either. Therefore,
given β ≤ θ, there exists L > 0 such that if L ≤ L, then θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ.
    To prove the second part of the proposition, we consider the problem under
log preferences as in Section B.1, but with (4) now replaced by (16). The program
in (31) becomes (we allow here for any δ > 0; the statement of Proposition 5 takes

Since by assumption         θ∗c

its comparative statics with respect to L by implicit differentiation of (36). Since
the program is locally concave, the derivative of the left-hand side of (36) with
respect to θ∗c is negative. If we can establish that the derivative of the left-hand
side of (36) with respect to L is negative, then this implies that θ∗c is locally
decreasing in L. We find that this is indeed the case: the derivative of the left-
hand side of (36) with respect to L is

B.5       Proof of Proposition 6
Define γ ∗ui as the optimal uncoordinated rule for country group i with parameters
{fi , β i }, and let γ ∗c be the optimal coordinated rule for both country groups,
given {fN , β N , fS , β S , ψ}. We begin by proving the first part of the proposition
(β ≥ β). By analogous reasoning as in the proof of the first part of Proposition 2,
if β S = β N = 1, then
                                   γ ∗c < min {γ ∗uN , γ ∗uS } .                  (37)

      To prove the second part of the proposition (β ≤ β), take β i ≤ θi for i = N, S.

                                                               46
By Proposition 1, θ∗ui ≤ θi for i = N, S, implying γ ∗ui ≤ γ. Note that any rule
γ ∗c ≤ γ would yield the same allocation and hence the same welfare as a rule
γ ∗c = γ. Therefore, to prove the proposition, it suffices to show that γ ∗c = γ is not
optimal. To prove this, consider a fiscal rule γ ∗ = γ with associated interest rate
R = R (γ ∗ ). Welfare under this rule is given by (18). The first derivative with
respect to γ ∗ is

B.6     Infinite Horizon

T → ∞, and discount factor δ ∈ (0, 1). The government’s welfare at t before the
realization of its type θt is

                                            k=1


The government’s welfare at t after the realization of θt , when choosing spending
gt , is                              "∞                     #
                                      X

                                             47
Spending gt satisfies the government’s dynamic budget constraint:

                                             xt+1
                                      gt +        = τ + xt ,                                   (40)
                                             Rt+1

where xt is the level of assets with which the government enters period t and we
set x0 = 0. The sum of total assets across all governments must sum to zero
in each period. We assume that θt is i.i.d. across countries and time with an
expected value E [θt ] = 1. Because there are no aggregate shocks, it follows that
the sequence of interest rates {Rt }∞t=0 is deterministic, with R0 = 1. We focus
on fiscal rules at t which depend only on payoff-relevant variables: xt and the
sequence of future interest rates {Rt+k }∞k=1 .

as the continuation welfare at t + 1 associated with assets xt+1 and the continu-
ation sequence of interest rates and fiscal rules. Taking this continuation welfare
as given, a fiscal rule at t can be represented as a cutoff type θ∗ , where the gov-
ernment has full flexibility if θt ≤ θ∗ and no flexibility if θt > θ∗ . An individual
government’s optimal choice of fiscal rule is analogous to that in the two-period
setting:

Proposition 7. In an infinite horizon economy with i.i.d. shocks, the optimal
uncoordinated fiscal rule is a time-invariant cutoff θ∗u satisfying (9).

Proof. Given a deterministic sequence of interest rates, an uncoordinated fiscal
rule can be represented as a cutoff sequence θ∗u (t, xt ), which depends on time t
and the assets xt with which a government enters the period. The dependence of
the rule on time captures the fact that time indexes the future path of interest
rates. Moreover, with some abuse of notation, we can let g f (θt , t, xt ) correspond
to type θt ’s flexible level of spending given time t and assets xt . The government’s

    If countries do not coordinate on rules, then rules of this form are optimal under i.i.d. shocks.

                 g f (θt , t, xt ) = arg max {θt U (g) + Wt+1 (Rt+1 (τ + xt − g))} .
                                                       g


Standard arguments imply that Wt+1 is a concave and continuously differentiable
function of xt+1 . Hence, this problem is isomorphic to that of the two-period
model, and by Proposition 1 the optimal choice of θ∗u (t, xt ) satisfies (9).

    We next study the implications of a time-invariant coordinated rule θ∗ for the
interest rate.

Lemma 3. Consider an infinite horizon economy with i.i.d. shocks and U (gt ) =
log(gt ). If all countries are subject to a time-invariant rule θ∗ in each period, the
interest rate Rt is constant over time and satisfies

From (45), it is clear that if given full flexibility in all periods, then a government
would choose in every period a savings rate equal to

                                                             βδ

                                                          θt + βδ

which is a function of θt and does not depend on future interest rates or current
assets. Now consider a time-invariant fiscal rule θ∗ in a T -period economy. The
analog of (45) in a finite horizon setting implies that at date T − 1, a country
chooses its flexible savings rate if θT −1 ≤ θ∗ and the flexible savings rate that
would correspond to type θ∗ if θT −1 > θ∗ . It then follows by backward induction
                          
that s (θt , t, xt ) = max sf (θt ) , sf (θ∗ ) at each t ∈ {0, . . . , T − 1}. Taking the
limit of the T -period economy as T → ∞, the global resource constraint at t can
therefore be written as

where we have taken into account that savings rates are independent of assets
and the sum of assets across countries is zero in each period. The fact that this


                                                     50
equation holds for all periods t implies (42).

    Consider now the class of rules θ∗ (t) which are possibly time-varying but apply
to all countries symmetrically, independently of their assets. We show that there
is an optimal coordinated fiscal rule within this class which is time-invariant.
Moreover, this rule satisfies our results in Proposition 2.

Proposition 8. Consider an infinite horizon economy with i.i.d. shocks and
U (gt ) = log(gt ), and take fiscal rules that apply symmetrically to all countries.
There exists an optimal coordinated fiscal rule θ∗c that is time-invariant. More-
over, there exist β, β ∈ [θ, 1], β > β, such that if β ≥ β, then θ∗c < θ∗u , whereas if
β ≤ β, then θ∗c > θ∗u and θ∗c > θ.

Proof. Using the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 3, s (θt , t, xt ) =
    
max sf (θt ) , sf (θ∗ (t)) under a rule θ∗ (t). Define

                                                                                  f (θ) dθ   

Note that the term in the bracket is the same for every t, which implies that there
exists a solution with a time-invariant cutoff θ∗ (t) = θ∗c . Moreover, this bracket
                                                                                  δ
is identical to the two-period program in (31) except that δ is replaced with 1−δ
(and there is the last term which is a constant). The results therefore follow from
Proposition 2.
