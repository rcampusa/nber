                                           ABSTRACT

We examine an untested hypothesis that posits that null results in early studies examining the
economic impacts of smoking bans were driven by sample selection. Early adopters could better
absorb the shock of bans, but among worse selected late adopters bans would adversely impact
bars and restaurants. We exploit variation in the timing of ban institution among Texas
municipalities and track their impact over time. We find similar adjustments trajectories between
late and early adopters, but late adopters appear unaffected by bans in the long-term. Consistent
with earlier studies, bans do not significantly affect bar and restaurant sales or establishment level
alcohol tax expenditures.

                                         I.     BACKGROUND

          Currently, 77.6% of the US population is protected by smoke free legislation in bars and

restaurants, but the state of Texas lags behind with roughly half of the population of the state

being protected by these same provisions 1. The lack of comprehensive state legislation in Texas,

has led to a patchwork of local ordinances with only 80 2 out of 1,209 Texas municipal

governments having adopted smoke free ordinances in bars and restaurant as of 2016. A

growing literature documents that smoking bans are linked to significant and large reduction in

second hand smoke (SHS) exposure (IARC 2009.)

          The literature that estimates the impact of smoking bans on the profitability of bars and

restaurants across the US find that such bans do not adversely affect restaurants and bars

(Eriksen and Chaloupka 2007; IARC 2009; Scollo et al. 2003.) Studies from the state of Texas

suggest similar results (CDC 1995; Hayslett and Huang 2000; CDC 2002; Loomis, Shafer, and

van Hasslet 2013; MGT of America, 2006.) However, several studies find that smoking bans

may adversely affect bar employment and alcohol sales among bars and restaurants (Adams and

Cotti 2007; Clower and Weinstein 2004.)

          One of the more carefully conducted studies in this literature is a 2008 study by Fleck

and Hanssen, who investigate the impact of smoke free legislation on restaurant sales in

California. The authors highlight two important threats to identifying the causal impact of

smoking bans in the current literature. First, the authors find that that treating municipality,

county, and state level bans as homogenous is incorrect, because municipalities that adopt such

policies are likely different from municipalities that have bans forced upon them by a state

                                                                                                      2
mandate. For example municipal smoking bans may be adopted during periods of robust bar and

restaurant sales 3. In contrast, state level bans are more likely to be exogenous at the municipality

level, since they affect a large set of municipalities with varying levels of restaurant and bar

sales. Second, failure to control for trends in the outcome prior to policy adoption may lead to

spurious results. The authors show that negative trends in restaurant sales prior to the

implementation of the statewide ban in California could account for a share of the negative

impact that was erroneously attributed to the ban.

        Meyer (1995) details additional threats to identification in differences-in-differences

estimation, even when there is variation in the timing of policy adoption. First, the treatment

effect may be biased by other shocks that take place concurrently with policy adoption.

Secondly, secular trends in outcomes, which are a function of time, could confound estimates of

the policy intervention, a point also raised in Fleck and Hansen (2008). Third, the treatment

group may be much different than the control group, producing results that are not generalizable

to the extended set of localities. Fourth, significance in results may be overstated because of how

researchers handle standard errors in the presence of serial correlation. And finally, there may be

interactions of treatment within different policy settings and over time. Additional critiques in

the literature also highlight the importance of careful treatment of policy interventions in panel

data (Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan 2004; Besley and Case 2000; Fleck and Hanssen 2008.)

        In this paper we investigate the impact of smoke free ordinances on restaurant and bar

sales in Texas. We are able to address concerns over heterogeneity in bans, because we only

consider bans taking place at the municipality level. Our paper departs from other analyses, in

three ways. First, our study estimates the impact of smoke free bans by measuring the impact of


3
 For example restaurant owners in cities which exhibit robust sales may be less likely to lobby against
such bans (Fleck and Hanssen 2008).

                                                                                                          3
such legislation on alcohol sales tax expenditures for establishments which became smoke free

from a municipality level ordinance. To our knowledge only one prior study conducts such

analyses at the establishment level (Lopez et. al, 2011), and most previous studies uses aggregate

city or county level data to measure the impact of the legislation. We consider this analysis an

improvement to previous studies, because we are able to control for establishment level

unobservables that could drive our results. Since our analysis is at the establishment level, we are

able to provide more precise estimates of the effect of smoking bans. In addition, because our

establishment level analysis estimates the impact of smoke free air ordinances on the tax revenue

generated by alcohol sales, we are able to track the impact of such legislation on alcohol use, a

variable that is believed to be most affected by the legislation 4.

        Second, with our data we are able to capture impacts of such policies up to several

months after implementation. With the exception of Adams and Cotti (2007), who estimate the

short and intermediate-term effects of bans on employment, no previous studies estimate the

impact on restaurant and bar revenue over time. Finally, we address an untested hypothesis in the

literature which posits that the null results in numerous studies estimating the impact of smoke

free ordinances were due to selection bias. This hypothesis suggests that early adopters of smoke

free policies could better weather any potential losses in profitability linked to the policy, as

such, if smoke free policies were extended to all bars and restaurants later adopters would likely

fare worse and experience larges losses in profitability (Adams and Cotti, 2007.) Nonetheless,

some evidence suggests that policy adoption may shift preferences among restaurant and bar

  Between 80 and 95 percent of alcoholics smoke cigarettes, a rate that is three times higher than among
the population as a whole. And 70 percent of alcoholics are more than a pack a day smokers compared
with 10 percent of the general population. See: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, No.

patrons; with currently, a majority of Americans supporting smoking bans in public places 5. The

selection and shift in preferences arguments, work in opposite directions, thus the impact of

smoking bans on late adopters is ambiguous a priori.

        Like previous studies, we exploit variation in timing that smoke free ordinances took

effect to identify the impact of smoking bans. However, we do not assume the timing of adoption

is exogenous, but employ a methodology that addresses the threats to identification outlined by

Meyer (1995) and Fleck and Hansen (2008). We test the exogeneity of the timing of adoption by

tracking changes in sales and tax expenditures immediately prior to policy implementation. We

find evidence supportive of policy exogeneity for restaurant sales. We also find evidence that

early adopters of smoking bans adopted during periods where bar sales are robust, but this effect

is not present among late adopters. We subject the data to different robustness checks to make

sure that our effects are not spurious and do not depend on model specification or choice of

control group. When using aggregate data, we find that smoke free laws do not reduce bar and

restaurant sales. Our analysis at the establishment level suggests losses in mixed beverage tax

expenditures are small. We find that smoking bans reduce alcohol tax expenditure by 1.1% with

the effect being significant only at the 10% level. Among municipalities that adopt smoking bans

late in the study period, we largely find neutral effects to such policies on tax expenditures. Our

contribution to the literature is that we conduct the analysis at the establishment level and are

able to control for establishment unobservable characteristics that may affect the outcome of

 Majority support for smoking bans in all public places is a recent occurrence. The first year that Gallup
provides evidence that 59% of Americans support smoking bans in all public places is 2011. The trend
has not changed since, with a majority of Americans supporting such bans in 2015. See: “For First Time,
Majority in US Supports Public Smoking Ban” http://www.gallup.com/poll/148514/first-time-majority-

interest. Finally, to our knowledge we are the first study to estimate the ordinances’ effects many

quarters after implementation.

                           II.     DATA AND EMPIRICAL STRATEGY

       We obtain quarterly municipality-level restaurant and bar sales data from the State of

Texas beginning with the 1st quarter of 2002 through the 4th quarter of 2011. The establishment

level data includes monthly data on mixed beverage tax paid by all establishments authorized to

sell mixed beverages on premises for the period January 2002 through December 2011.

       Table 1A provides municipalities in Texas that have adopted a smoking ban in bars or

restaurants along with effective implementation dates. The smoking ban data comes from

Americans for Nonsmoker’s Rights Foundation. The first municipality to adopt a smoking ban

in Texas was Rollingwood, a small city in the Austin-Round Rock metro area. Several large

cities followed suit, including Dallas, Austin, and Corpus Christi. These were among the first

adopters of such policies, and most – but not all - banned smoking in both restaurant and bars.

Several cities only adopted bans for restaurants. For example, Fort Worth, the second largest city

in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, only bans smoking in restaurants. We only have two cities

in our data, during our study period, that ban smoking only in bars but not restaurants, Alpine

and Kerrville. One nice characteristic of the Texas data is that it covers cities of small, medium,

and large sizes. Thus our results are not representative of solely large municipalities, but cover a

diverse group of plausible adjustments to the policy.

       Table 1B presents summary statistics of the data utilized in our analysis. The average

municipality records roughly $2.8 million in bar sales and $9.5 million in restaurant sales each

quarter. Adopting cities have higher bar and restaurant sales and tend to be more populous, on

average. Bars are located in municipalities with more access to alcohol.



                                                                                                      6
         We also present summary statistics from the establishment level data. Our establishment

level data is at the establishment-month level and present the average alcohol tax expenditures

incurred by each establishment. On average each establishment paid $4,593 in alcohol tax per

month to the State of Texas. Unlike our aggregate data, our establishment level data come from

cities that are larger in population. This result is not surprising; most establishments selling

alcohol are likely located in municipalities where alcohol is accessible. This is corroborated by

the higher scores on the index for availability of alcohol. The group of late adopters is

comprised of municipalities with smaller populations.

        We estimate a difference-in-differences model below:

                             𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑆𝐹𝑂𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝑐𝑖 /𝑒𝑖 + 𝜏 + 𝜀

Our outcome variables(𝑌𝑖𝑡 ) are inflation adjusted log restaurant sales, log bars sales, or log mixed

beverage tax revenue. 6,7 For the aggregate data the smoke free ordinance (𝑆𝐹𝑂𝑖𝑡 ), takes the value

of 1 if a municipality has implemented a smoke free ban during a given quarter-year and zero

otherwise. For the establishment level tax data where tax revenues are reported on a monthly

basis, we redefine the variable to be equal to 1 if in a given month-year the establishment was

smoke free and zero otherwise. Some municipalities institute such policies throughout a given

quarter/month the smoke free variable takes decimal values equal to the percentage of the

quarter/month that the policy was in effect. For example if a policy was introduced during the

15th day of February 8 our variable takes the value of 0.5 for the first quarter and 1 for the second

quarter and subsequent quarters thereafter, a value of 0 was in effect prior to policy adoption.

  All sales and tax data are expressed in 2012 dollars. Box-Cox tests were conducted to determine if

For the establishment level data the variable would take the value of 0.5 for the month February

and 1 for each month thereafter.

        Our control group includes all municipalities that have no bans in bars and restaurants

and municipalities that have only instituted non-comprehensive policies. Thus the interpretation

of our results measures the difference in sales or taxes between municipalities that instituted

smoke free policies comprehensively and municipalities with either non-comprehensive bans or

no bans.

        In order to capture differences in economic activity between municipalities and within

municipalities over time we include log sales for general merchandise in each municipality for

each quarter-year or month-year. To account for changes in demand that arise due to changes in

population we include yearly log municipality population as a control in our estimation. To

capture the degree of availability of alcohol, we include an index which takes the value of 0

through 7, with 0 being dry jurisdictions, and 7 being jurisdictions where alcohol is easily

accessible 9.

        We include municipality fixed effects/establishment fixed effects (ci/ ei) to address

differences in sales/taxes expenditure that are municipality/establishment specific. We account

for quarter-by-year/ month-by-year 10 fixed effects, (𝜏), to address secular changes in restaurant

and bars sales and alcohol tax expenditures over time. We also address some of the threats to

identification highlighted by Meyer (1995). First, to account for secular trends in outcomes,

which are a function of time, and could confound the estimates of policy impact, we include


9
  We were also concerned that smoke free ordinances may be instituted concurrently with more
permissive alcohol sales ordinances. To address this concern we include any changes over time in the
alcohol index. The index construction is discussed in detail in Appendix A.
10
   We have a total of 40 quarter-by-year fixed effects, of which 39 are utilized in the analysis. For the
establishment level data we have data from January 2002 through September 2012, which produces a total
of 129 month-by-year dummies, where the 129th dummy is excluded.

                                                                                                       8
municipality specific linear and quadratic time trends and establishment specific linear time

trends. The methodology allows each municipality and each establishment to have different

trends in the outcome, reducing the likelihood that these trends are attributed to the policy

change.

       Even though we exploit the variation in timing of adoption of smoke free ordinances to

measure the impact of smoke free ordinances on restaurant and bar sales, the choice of adoption

may be endogenous. If municipalities choose smoke free ordinances when they experience

robust restaurant and bar sales or if they believe that the expected impact on bars and restaurants

to be trivial, then events immediately prior to implementation may be driving our results in the

difference-in-differences specification. To address concerns over endogeneity, we include a

series of dummy variables that capture differences in preexisting trends in restaurant and bar

sales and alcohol tax expenditures between our treatment and control groups.

       Another concern with difference-in-difference estimates is that the treatment group may

be much different than the control group, producing results that are not generalizable to the

extended set of municipalities. To address this concern, in addition to including our several

layers of controls for unobservable effects, we estimate our results across different samples in

order to uncover any spurious effects in results. First we estimate our results using our full

sample, then limit the analysis only to municipalities that at some point adopt such policies, and

finally compare municipalities that adopt in later periods with the extended set of municipalities.

We also think that differences in treatment and control groups may be less of a concern in our

data. Because we utilize the variation in timing of adoption, many of the early adopters have

controls in similar municipalities that adopt later in the study period.




                                                                                                     9
       We would like to control for changes in cigarette taxes, alcohol taxes and prices, and

other factors that could affect our outcome or could confound the effect of smoke free

legislation. Alcohol taxes in Texas have not changed during the period of the study. The mixed

beverage tax remained constant at 14% of the sales generated throughout the entire study period,

and beer and wine taxes were last changed in the 1990s. While there were several changes to the

cigarette tax during the study period these changes are perfectly collinear with other controls

from estimation. All standard errors are clustered at the municipality level to allow for

correlation in errors across units. In our aggregate estimates the standard errors are block

bootstrapped to remove any concerns over spurious results.

                                           III.    RESULTS

A.     Aggregate Results

       The baseline results for restaurant sales are presented in Table 2. Even though we exploit

the variation in timing of adoption of smoke free ordinances in our analysis, the choice of

adoption may be endogenous. More robust restaurant and bar sales can lead municipalities to

adopt such bans. Unfortunately the difference-in-differences estimator assumes these differences

in group trends to be zero, even though differences in sales before policy implementation

between treatment and control groups could contaminate the impact of smoking bans. To address

concerns over endogeneity, we include a series of dummy variables that capture any differences

in preexisting trends in restaurant and bar sales between our treatment and control groups. More

particularly, we include dummy variables for every quarter before implementation, up to 8

quarters prior 11. If these pre-implementation trends are positive and significant they would




11
  We conducted this analysis by including fewer than 8 and 12 dummies prior to implementation and our
results did not change.

                                                                                                   10
imply that cities adopt policies during periods of time when sales are robust, and would suggest

that policy adoption is in fact endogenous.

       Columns 1-3 summarize results for the whole sample and include different levels of

controls (city fixed effects, quarter-by-year fixed effects, and city specific linear and quadratic

trends). Looking at column 1, which does not include linear or quadratic trends, the pre-

implementation dummies are all close to zero and not statistically significant, suggesting that,

differences in pre-trends between adopting and non-adopting municipalities do not drive our

results for restaurants. On average the effect of smoking bans on restaurant sales is negative, but

insignificant (column 1). Controlling for city specific linear and quadratic time trends, makes the

result switch signs, and become positive but still insignificant. Our all sample results suggest that

smoking bans did not affect restaurant sales.

       To probe the validity of our results in the baseline specification and make sure they are

not subject to choice of control group, we estimate the impact of smoking bans only among

municipalities that adopted such ordinances. These municipalities are likely more similar to one

another in unobservables, which we are concerned could be driving our results. Thus, treatment

municipalities that adopt early in study periods are compared to other municipalities, which will

at some point in the future adopt such policies, but have not done so just yet. The results are

summarized in table 2, columns 4-6. The pre-implementation dummies suggest that cities may

be adopting policies during times when restaurant sales are robust, but the effect of the ban is

zero. Inclusion of trends in subsequent columns does not alter our results in a meaningful way.

       Table 2 (columns 7-9) summarizes results among late adopters. We define late adopters

(treatment) to be municipalities that instituted smoke free ordinances beginning in 2008 and




                                                                                                      11
later 12. The control group includes all other Texas municipalities that lack comprehensive bans.

We conduct an additional robustness check to test whether there is a differential impact of the

policy among late adopters. The results that do not contain city specific time trends, suggest a

reduction in revenue of approximately 10% (column 7). But inclusion of time trends suggests

that the effect of such policies on late adopters is zero (columns 8 and 9).

        The other controls have the expected signs. Higher levels of economic activity are

associated with higher restaurant sales. A higher population is associated with higher restaurant

sales, but increased alcohol availability is not linked to increased restaurant sales – in the

aggregate.

        Table 3 summarizes results for bar sales. We summarize results for the entire sample (1-

3), only adopters (columns 4-6) and late adopters (columns 7-9). In our entire sample results, it

appears that counties that adopt a smoking ban experience higher relative bar sales two quarters

before ban implementation. If we did control for pre-trends we would be wrongly attributing the

drop in sales to the policy. The effect of the policy moves from negative and insignificant to

positive and insignificant as we include more controls. When comparing among only cities that

adopt, we find no strong pre-implementation trends, and the effect of the policy is once again

close to zero. Among late adopters (columns 7-9) we find some evidence of relatively higher

sales up to 3 quarters before implementation and the effects of smoking bans are not different

from zero.

        Overall our aggregate results suggest that there is some selection into smoking bans and

that municipalities are more likely to adopt such policies during times when restaurant and bar

  Several robustness checks using different years of implementation for late adopters (2007 and 2009)
produce qualitatively similar results.

                                                                                                        12
sales are higher. But overall, the effect of smoking bans, conditional on observables and

unobservables is zero.

       We conduct an additional robustness check for our results by tracking what happens to

liquor store sales once smoking bans go into effect. Liquor stores are a substitute to drinking in

bars and restaurants. If smokers flee bars and restaurants due to bans, then demand for liquor

store alcohol purchases should increase. In appendix B, we show that, liquor store sales do not

change after smoking bans take effect; further strengthening our previous results.

B.     The Impact of Smoke Free Ordinances Over Time

       Up to this point our analysis has measured the average impact of smoking bans.

However, the average effect of the policy can disguise plausible adjustment to the policy. For

example, the null effects could arise if losses in revenue in the first quarter of implementation are

followed by gains in revenue in subsequent quarters. Alternatively, it could be that case that the

policy generates no effects at all. The average effect produced in both cases would be identical,

but the policy implications may be different. If losses in revenue in the short-term are followed

by increase in revenue in the intermediate- or long-term, then this information may reduce

uncertainty regarding policy impacts to businesses which may wish to ban smoking on premises.

To capture the impact of smoke free ordinances over time we replace our smoke free variables

with a dummy for the quarter of adoption and a series of dummies variables for up to three years

after policy implementation. The last category, 14th quarter also includes impacts in subsequent

quarters after the 14th. If smoking bans exert any impacts over time, then these post

implementation dummies will be statistically different from zero. The results are summarized in

table 4 and include pre-implementation dummies from tables 2 and 3, and the full set of controls

including city specific linear and quadratic time trends.



                                                                                                     13
       The results over time, suggest that smoke free air ordinances have no effect on restaurant

and bars sales over time. This effect is consistent throughout all different samples. Most

importantly these results suggest that adjustment trajectories among late and early implementers

of such policies are very similar.

C. Establishment Level Results

       Our establishment level analysis extends the aggregate analysis but looks at the real

alcohol tax paid by individual establishments. These establishments can be either bars or

restaurants which are licensed to sell mixed beverages for on premise consumption. Both bars

and restaurant can have a mixed beverage permit. We have information on roughly 28,000

establishments in the period 2002-2011. Our control variable is coded 1 for municipalities that

have a comprehensive ban in bars, restaurants, and both bars and restaurants. Most municipalities

in our sample institute both a restaurant and bar ban at the same time, many municipalities only

ban smoking in restaurants, and some municipalities institute bans in bars only. We have four

municipalities that adopt restaurant bans before bar bans - Dallas, Corpus Christi, Victoria, and

Brownsville. For these municipalities we consider only the first of the two policies adopted. We

ran results by excluding these municipalities and the effects are similar to the sample that

includes them.

       We considered two other approaches before we settled on the current one. An alternative

to including only one ban variable would be to include two variables; one for bans in bars and

one for restaurant bans. One concern with this approach is that in places that institute bans in

both restaurants and bars at the same time, it would not be possible to separate the effect of a

restaurant ban from that of a bar ban. Alternatively, we could have included variables for

municipalities with both bans, restaurants bans only, and bar bans only. However, we felt this



                                                                                                   14
approach made some of the smaller cells (i.e. the group with only bar adopters) non-

representative of the population, and plausible extension to the rest of Texas municipalities. We

estimated results using these other approaches and the results were similar.

         We first run difference-in-differences models of establishment level log mixed beverage

tax expenditures on the ban variable while controlling for sales and population at the

municipality level, establishment fixed effects and month-by-year fixed effects. We then use

several levels of locality fixed effects. More particularly, we include establishment linear and

quadratic time trends. The establishment and establishment time trends allow us to control for

establishment level unobservables and secular time trends at the establishment level that could

affect the sale of mixed beverages and as a result mixed beverage tax expenditures. It should be

noted, that the mixed beverage tax rate has not changed in the study period and it is 14 percent of

all taxable sales 13.

        Columns 1-3 report results for the full sample, and as we move from columns 1 through 3

we add additional levels of controls for unobservables. Establishments in municipalities that

institute bans on smoking appear to experience a reduction in alcohol expenditures of 2.7%. The

results among only adopters (columns 4-6) and late adopters (columns 7-9) largely mirror the

impact among the full sample. Among late adopters, municipalities that adopt smoking bans

experience an average 2.2% reduction in alcohol tax expenditures. The other controls have the

expected signs; higher overall economic activity is linked to higher alcohol tax expenditure,

while the effect of log population is not statistically different from zero.

        As the previous section suggests there may be reason to believe that these policies are

more likely to be adopted during time of high economic activity. One concern when policies are


13
  The mixed beverage tax changed in Texas starting January 1st, 2014, which is outside of the study
period.

                                                                                                      15
adopted during times of high expenditures could be that maybe alcohol tax expenditures would

have fallen even absent policy intervention. Unfortunately, the difference-in-differences

estimator does not account for this type of mean reversion (Autor, Donohue, and Schwab 2006).

To address this concern we utilize a lagged dependent variables model, which allows for this

type of mean reversion in outcomes. Results are summarized in table 6. The results suggest that

the effect of such policies is about half of what we find in our baseline estimate that of table 5,

which do not account for mean reversion. Among the full sample of municipalities, we find that

smoking bans reduce tax expenditure by 1.5%. The results for late adopters appear to be smaller

and suggest a reduction of approximately 1.3%. Since we are interested on the magnitude, and

not just simply the sign of smoking bans on the outcome, for the remainder of the analysis we

present both results that account for mean reversion and results that do not.

       In the aggregate analysis we discovered that municipalities adopt smoking bans during

times when restaurant and bar sales were high. To account for some of the dynamics before

implementation we re-estimate results but include dummies to account for pre-implementation

trends. The results are summarized in table 7A. First, we notice that two quarters before ban

implementation alcohol tax expenditures are rising but fall the period before implementation and

continue to do so after implementation. In fact, simply accounting for pre-implementation trends

reduces the average impact and significance of the ban effect. The results among late adopters

now suggest little evidence of a policy effect, even though the policy continues to matter in the

full sample results with a reduction in alcohol tax expenditure of 2.5%. Table 7B presents the

lagged dependent variable models. Once we account for mean reversion and also pre-

implementation trends, the effects get smaller, all less than 1.5%, and in either insignificant, or

only significant at the 10% level. Thus the results that for both pre-implementation trends and



                                                                                                      16
mean reversion would suggest no significant impact of smoking bans on alcohol tax

expenditures.

D. The Impact of Smoking Bans Over Time at the Establishment Level

         To estimate the impact of smoke free ordinances over time, we replace our ban variable

with a series of dummies tracking the quarter of implementation and several quarters post

implementation. We include dummies for up to three years after ban implementation, beginning

with the first quarter through the 13th quarter of implementation. The dummy for 13th quarter

after implementation includes any subsequent periods after that (i.e. for more than three years).

All specifications include different levels of fixed effects as the results in tables 5 and 6 as well

as pre-implementation trends for the 4 quarters prior to policy adoption.

         Results are summarized in Tables 8A and 8B. We interpret the results from the

specification which includes establishment specific linear and quadratic time trends, as these

specifications likely pick up several unobservable effects that may matter in determining the

outcome. Overall the results suggest that the effect of the policy is immediate and it persists over

time for the full sample and the sample of adopting municipalities. However, the effects for late

adopters suggest a different pattern of adjustment. Among late adopters group, periods of

negative effects are followed by periods of no effect.

         Table 8B accounts for mean reversion and includes the lagged dependent variable. We

find that the pattern of coefficients resembles that of table 8A, but the results are much smaller.

One significant difference is the lack of impact after the 6th quarter post implementation for late

adopters. Among late adopters the policy experts an effect up the 6th quarter, but it fails to

produce additional impacts after that.

   IV.      DISCUSSION



                                                                                                    17
        In this paper we use both aggregate and establishment level data to measure the impact of

smoke free ordinances on restaurant and bar sales and mixed beverage tax expenditures among

Texas municipalities and establishments. We utilize the fact that different municipalities adopt

smoking bans at different points in time, but do not assume that such bans are exogenous. Instead

we test the exogeneity of policy adoption by tracking trends in the outcome right before policy

implementation. We find that municipalities that adopt smoking bans exhibit higher than average

sales prior to policy adoption, suggesting that studies that do not account for policy selection

likely produce biased estimates of the true impact.

        Our aggregate analyses suggest no adverse impact on sales due to the institution of

comprehensive smoking bans in bars and restaurants. We then turn our attention to alcohol tax

expenditures at the establishment level, and conduct analyses among a sample of 28,000

establishments. Our establishment level analyses account for establishment fixed-effects and

time trends, thus reducing concerns over omitted variable bias and because of the large sample

generate very precise estimates of the impact of smoking bans. Even though alcohol tax

expenditures are expected to be affected disproportionally from smoking bans (Adams and Cotti,

2007, 200814), we find that reductions in mixed beverage tax expenditures from smoking bans

are small. More particularly, when we account for threats to identification in difference-in-

differences estimation we find the effects of smoking bans have no significant effects on alcohol

tax expenditures based on a two-tailed test at conventional significance levels of 5%. Our results

are only significant at the 10% significance level, a finding that is surprising given the large

sample size. Taken together our aggregate and establishment level results imply smoking bans do

not adversely affect restaurants and bars.


14
  Adams and Cotti (2008) find that alcohol related fatal accidents increase following bans of smoking in
bars as smokers drive longer distances to bars that allow smoking indoors.

                                                                                                      18
         We also test the hypothesis that early adopters were better able to adjust to the effects of

smoking bans. We find no support for this hypothesis. On the contrary, we find that late adopters

were able to adjust to changes in policy better, with no long term impacts due to policy adoption.

One implication of our over-time analysis is that the many municipalities that are currently

considering joining the group of adopters will not experience negative impacts due to adoption.

To our knowledge our analysis is the first to look at the long term impacts of such policies on bar

and restaurant sales, and it is only the second study that estimates results at the establishment

level.

Definition and Construction of Alcohol Accessibility Index Variable

Definitions                                                           Index
                                                                      Value
Dry: The term "dry" means the jurisdiction is dry throughout. No      0
type of alcoholic beverage sales is permitted.
Wet: The term “wet” describes a jurisdiction where a type of          1-7
alcoholic beverages is permitted.


Texas jurisdictions allow for the sale/consumption of alcoholic beverages under the following rules:
   1. B-On: Sale of Beer for on premises consumption authorized.
   2. B-Off: Sale of Beer for off-premises consumption authorized.
   3. W-On: Sale of Wine for on-premises consumption authorized.
   4. W-Off: Sale of Wine for off-premises consumption authorized.
   5. DS-Off: Sale of distilled spirits for off-premises consumption authorized.
   6. MB: Sale of mixed beverages authorized. Not used to describe areas where sale of mixed beverages
       only authorized in restaurants.
   7. RM: Sale of mixed beverages authorized but only in restaurants.

We define and index as the summation of all the possible options of sale/consumption in a jurisdiction in a year.
For example, a jurisdiction that allows beer and wine off premises would have an index value of 2. In contrast,
a jurisdiction that allows beer and wine both on and off premises and the sale of distilled spirits for off premise
consumption would take a value of 5.


Appendix B

         Theoretically, if smoking bans in bars reduce clientele among smokers, but do not affect clientele among
non-smokers, then we should observe that smokers are pushed to substitutes for bars – such a liquor stores. In
our case, this would suggest that demand for alcohol in liquor stores increases after ban implementation. Table
B1 summarizes results of what happens to log liquor sales in municipalities with a 100% smoking ban in bars.
The fully specified results suggest no change in alcohol sales. Even though the parameter is negative, it is
statistically insignificant. We also estimate the results for restaurant bans, another venue where alcohol is
consumed, and find that smoking bans in restaurants do not lead to changes in economic activity for liquor
stores. Table B3 presents results over time. We find that these results reinforce our findings from those in
tables B1 and B2. Restaurant bans do not affect liquor store sales. Bar results also suggest zero effect. Column
1 results find that bar bans increase clientele – nonsmokers now may be more likely to go out to bars. However,
this effect goes away once we account for non-linear time trends.
