This article examines the relationship between Research & Development (R&D) funding and the production
of knowledge by academic chemists. Using articles published, either raw counts or adjusted for quality,
we find a strong, positive causal effect of funding on knowledge production. This effect is similar
across subsets of universities, suggesting a relatively efficient allocation of R&D funds. Finally, we
document a rapid acceleration in the rate at which chemical knowledge was produced in the late 1990s
and early 2000s relative to the financial and human resources devoted to its production.

       In 2011 the federal government supported nearly $40 billion dollars of

university research and development (R&D) activities. Other sources of funding –

including industry, state government and the universities themselves – provided

over $22 billion in support for university R&D. It is natural to wonder what these

investments produce or, put slightly differently, what is the return on this

investment?1 In large part, public investments in R&D are motivated by the

conviction that advances in scientific understanding will contribute to the nation’s

economic growth. Yet, we still have relatively limited knowledge about the

relationship between R&D funding, the production of scientific knowledge, and the

effects of this knowledge on socioeconomic outcomes. The first step in linking

federal R&D funding to economic growth is to identify whether funding affects

knowledge production. Thus, our study examines the effect of federal and non-

federal R&D funding for chemistry research on knowledge production in these

fields, measured by publications and citations. After controlling for the endogeneity

of research funding, we find that that federal and non-federal chemistry research

funding increases chemistry publications and citations.

       We focus on academic chemistry and chemical engineering in this study

because basic and applied chemistry account for a substantial share—slightly more

than 4%—of all federal R&D expenditures. Moreover, the chemical sciences are

large, well-established and widely represented across the spectrum of U.S.

universities and they include a breadth of research topics from basic science to

highly applied topics. As such, they offer an excellent opportunity to explore the
                                                                                     3


impact of federal and other sources of funding on scientific productivity. In

addition, discoveries in chemistry are more likely to result in patents and other

forms of commercialization. Thus identifying the effect of federal R&D chemistry

funding on knowledge production is the first step in linking federal R&D

expenditures to product innovations resulting in economic growth and

development.

       This article contributes to a greater understanding of these relationships

through an examination of the relationship between R&D funding and the

knowledge outputs produced by academic chemists receiving this funding over the

20 years from 1990 to 2009. Measuring knowledge outputs either by the raw

number of articles published or adjusting for the quality of publications by

weighting each by the number of citations it received, we document a strong,

positive causal effect of funding on knowledge production. At the same time, our

analysis also reveals that there was a rapid acceleration in the production of

chemical science knowledge in the late 1990s and early 2000s relative to the

quantities of both financial and human resources devoted to its production. In

contrast to earlier research, which found that numbers of publications grew at

roughly the same rate as funding inputs in the 1980s, we find that the number of

articles produced grew much more quickly than either financial or human inputs

into knowledge production after 1990. Put somewhat differently, we show that the

cost per article written fell substantially in these years. Moreover, this trend toward

declining costs occurred across a broad spectrum of institutions of higher education.
                                                                                       4


       We begin, in the next section, with a discussion of previous research on the

relationship between funding and knowledge production. Next we discuss our data

sources and provide an overview of sample characteristics. We then examine

aggregate characteristics before turning to an econometric analysis of the

relationship between knowledge production and R&D funding.



The Relationship between Research Funding and Knowledge Production

       We are not the first to investigate the relationship between R&D funding and

knowledge production, but the research is rather limited. Previous work has taken

a number of different approaches to this problem, reflecting different conceptions of

the appropriate unit of measurement. One approach, exemplified by a recent study

by Jacob and Lefgren (2011), looks at the impact of receiving a grant on the

productivity of an individual researcher. Utilizing administrative data from the

National Institutes of Health (NIH) on all training and standard grant proposals

submitted between 1980 and 2000, Jacob and Lefgren estimate the effects of being

awarded a grant versus not receiving the grant on a scholar’s subsequent

publication. To control for project quality they estimate the causal effects of a

successful grant application through a regression discontinuity design that exploits

the fact that funded and unfunded proposals with similar priority scores are

comparable in quality. Although they do find a positive effect of funding on

subsequent publication, the size of this effect appears quite modest, resulting in

approximately one additional publication in the subsequent 5 years.2
                                                                                          5


       These results are intriguing, but as Jacob and Lefgren acknowledge, they are

subject to important limitations. Most importantly, it is not possible, given their

empirical set up, to determine whether investigators placed in the control group

because they did not receive funding in a particular funding round may have been

successful in a later resubmission or were able to obtain resources for their

research from another source. To the extent that the control-group includes

investigators who subsequently obtained funding, the estimated effects of receiving

a grant will be biased downward.

       Another factor that will produce a downward bias in estimates at the

individual level is the likely effect of leakages and spillovers in the effects of funding.

Research support to individual academic researchers includes the direct costs of the

research and sizeable payments to their university employers in the form of “over

head” or indirect costs (Facilities & Administration) in order to support the broader

scientific enterprise. These resources presumably support a broader set of

researchers and research infrastructure. Further, the activity and resources of

funded investigators may indirectly encourage research output by unfunded

colleagues by providing a foundation of support for these investigators and

supporting the institutional resources that benefit the research activities of their

graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

       To better capture the effect of these spillovers, several researchers have

examined how R&D funding affects outputs at the level of universities and the

university system as a whole. Blume-Kohout, Kumar and Sood (2009) investigated

whether federal R&D life science funding was a complement or a substitute for non-
                                                                                         6


federal R&D funding. They found that federal and non-federal funding were

complements. Adams and Griliches (1998) examined the relationship between

R&D funding and research publications at 109 universities in the period 1981-1993

by analyzing aggregate spending and publications in 8 broad disciplinary categories.

Relying on an informal analysis of graphs showing the growth of R&D expenditures

and publications or citations in each discipline, they concluded that at the aggregate,

university-system level, the levels of funding and scholarly outputs grew roughly in

parallel with one another in most of the disciplines they considered. They then used

panel regressions for a subset of universities with complete data to estimate the

elasticity of publications or citations relative to funding. In contrast to the elasticity

near one suggested by the aggregate data, they found cross-section elasticities in the

range of about 0.4, up to a high of 0.9. They suggested that this discrepancy might

be attributable to the leakages and spillovers alluded to earlier.

       More recently Payne and Siow (2003) have examined the connections

between federal R&D funding and research output. Their analysis is more

aggregated than Adams and Griliches, however, reporting a single aggregate

estimate for all disciplines of the effect of federal R&D funds on research output

using a panel of 57 universities for the period 1981-1998. Payne and Siow

recognized that because R&D funding is not allocated randomly across institutions,

OLS regression results cannot be interpreted as reflecting the causal effect of

funding on output. To resolve this latter problem, they proposed an instrumental

variables approach that relies on the effect of university alumni representation on

key congressional appropriations committees. Using this instrument they found
                                                                                      7


that an additional $1 million in federal R&D funding results in an increase of

approximately 10 publications. Further, they concluded that there was no

relationship between the level of funding and the number of citations per article.

Payne and Siow’s instrument lacks power, however, and the impact of congressional

representation on the award of merit-based scientific R&D awards might be

questioned a priori.

       Finally, Whalley and Hicks (2014) examined the relationship between

university research expenditures and knowledge production measured by

publications, citations and patents for a panel of 96 research universities between

1985-1996. Like Payne and Siow, their analysis aggregated knowledge outputs and

funding across different disciplines. However, they controlled for the endogeneity

of funding by using changes in university endowment values as a source of

exogenous variation in research expenditures. They foundnd that increases in

research expenditures increased the number of publications but had no causal

impact on the average citations per paper, nor the number of patents.

       The previous literature described above is dated, examining the impact of

research funding on knowledge production through the mid-1990s. Given the

changes in technology including the personal computer and Internet revolutions,

the relationship between federal R&D funding and knowledge production has likely

changed. These studies also miss important changes in federal funding priorities

such as the NIH budget doubling (1998-2003) (Couzin and Miller 2007) as well as

substantial increases in the NSF budget during the same period.3 Furthermore,

Payne and Siow (2003) and Whalley and Hicks (2014) combine R&D funding and
                                                                                       8


aggregate publication and citation counts across all disciplines at the university

level. In addition, their high level of aggregation would likely “average out”

important shifts in federal funding priorities in previous decades.

       Like these previous studies, we exploit variations in funding levels over time

across a panel of universities. Focusing on the behavior of the university-system

broadly and on the output of individual universities is more likely to capture the

ways in which research funding supports the broader scientific system. Yet unlike

these previous studies, we believe it is important to look at these effects at the level

of individual disciplines because of differences across the disciplines in knowledge

production, citation patterns, and the uses of funding. This approach is supported

by the differences in the funding-output relationship documented by Adams and

Griliches in their earlier study.



Data

       We have collected data on the levels of research funding along with

publication and citation data in chemistry and chemical engineering (for brevity we

will refer to these combined fields as chemistry) for a sample of 147 universities

over twenty years, from 1990 through 2009. Although there are likely to be

differences in research practices and professional culture between chemistry and

chemical engineering, it is not practical to cleanly distinguish between these two

fields in the allocation of R&D funding or publications.4

       Our sample was selected to include those universities that accounted for the

bulk of sponsored Research & Development expenditures in Chemistry. To identify
                                                                                          9


our sample institutions, we aggregated federally funded chemistry R&D

expenditures (in constant dollars) for the 20 years from 1990 through 2009 and

ranked them on the basis of this total. Initially we selected the top 150 institutions,

but later concluded it was necessary to drop three of these for which the data were

incomplete or appeared inconsistent.5 After identifying the sample, we collected

additional data on inputs in the knowledge production process, including degrees

awarded, graduate student enrollment, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from

publicly available sources, and merged these with the R&D expenditure data. Data

on publications and citations were provided by Thomson Reuters, Research

Analytics group from the Web of Science citation data base. We worked closely with

Thomson Reuters to identify and match publications to our sample institutions.6

       A list of each of the institutions included in our sample is provided in Table 1,

which also summarizes a number of key dimensions of real R&D expenditures and

outputs. As this table illustrates, our sample exhibits a considerable degree of

institutional variation. At the top of the list are institutions such as the MIT, Cal

Tech, and the University of California Berkeley, with average annual R&D

expenditures in the $20-$30 million range, employing more than 100 postdoctoral

researchers, training more than 50 doctoral recipients per year and producing many

hundreds of publications. At the bottom of our list are institutions such as Cleveland

State University or North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, with

total R&D expenditures of little more than $1 million per year, with few or no

postdoctoral researchers and doctoral recipients, and producing just tens of

publications.
                                                                                        10


       Although the 147 institutions we study do not comprise the full extent of

academic research in chemistry, they account for the vast majority of the

measurable research and training activities in the United States. As Figure 1

illustrates, their shares of total U.S. research expenditures, Ph.D.s awarded and

postdoctoral researchers hovered around 90-95 percent, although their share of

non-federally funded research expenditures was somewhat lower at about 87

percent. In comparison to R&D expenditures and graduate education, the number of

publications is relatively less concentrated. Our sample institutions produced

between 70 and 75 percent of chemistry publications in most years. These

publications, however, received 80 to 85 percent of citations to U.S. publications

over this period, suggesting that researchers affiliated with these institutions

produced a greater proportion of the more important publications.

       It should be noted that while the institutions in our sample accounted for a

stable or slightly rising share of U.S. publications and citations, the United States

share of total global publications in chemistry appears to have been declining

somewhat over time. Based on data provided by Thomson Reuters from their Web

of Science database, from 1990 through the early 2000s, U.S. publications accounted

for about 30 percent of all chemistry publications, but after 2003, this figure began

to drop, falling closer to 25 percent by 2009. U.S. publications do, however, receive

a greater proportion of total citations, suggesting that they remain more important

in global chemistry than the raw publication count would indicate. This share share

was also declining, however, over the last decade or so.
                                                                                     11


       Table 2 provides additional details about the characteristics of both the full

sample and several important subsets of universities, reporting average annual

values of key variable for the periods 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Across all

universities, average annual chemistry R&D expenditures increased from an

average of about $8 million in the 1990s to almost $11 million in 2000s. Federal

sources supported just under two-thirds of R&D spending in both periods, and grew

at roughly the same rate as overall R&D spending. In contrast to this growth in

expenditures, average numbers of graduate students enrolled, Ph.D.s awarded and

employment of postdoctoral researchers held relatively steady across the two

decades. On the other hand, the average number of publications produced and the

number of citations to those publications both nearly doubled. The growth in the

number of publications reflects both a rapid increase in the number of chemistry

journals included in the Web of Science database, which increased from 244 in 1990

to 568 by 2009, and an approximately 80 percent increase in the number of

publications in already established journals.

       We categorized universities based on their Carnegie ranking and public or

private status. Comparing across categories, important differences emerge in Table

2. As we might expect, all of the indicators of both inputs and outputs of the

chemical sciences are much larger at those universities in the Carnegie Research I

classification than at the other, non-Research I institutions in our sample. The

Research I universities accounted, on average, for about 2.5 times the research

expenditures and produced nearly three times as many doctorates as the non-

Research I universities. They also employed more than three times as many
                                                                                    12


postdoctoral researchers and produced more than three times as many publications.

The imbalance in citations to publications was even more striking: for 2000-2009,

publications produced by the Research I institutions received almost 4.5 times as

many citations as those produced by the non-Research I group, down from a ratio of

more than 6 in the 1990s.

       Although average research expenditures at public and private universities

were similar in the 1990s, their composition was somewhat different, with non-

federal funding making up almost 40 percent of total expenditures at public

universities, compared to less than 30 percent at the private universities. These

differences persisted over time, but funding received by the public universities grew

more quickly than did funding at the private universities. Average numbers of

graduate students enrolled were also higher at the public universities, but the

numbers of doctorates awarded and postdoctoral researchers were comparable

across the two groups. The average number of publications produced by public and

private universities was quite similar, but private university publications received

on average more citations than did those produced by the public universities. If

citations provide a measure of the significance of publications, this result suggests

that private universities were, on average, producing research of somewhat higher

quality than their public counterparts.



Aggregate Trends in Chemistry Research and Funding

       Before exploring the causal effect of funding on knowledge production, we

consider some of the aggregate characteristics of research funding and scholarly
                                                                                     13


outputs of academic chemistry over the last two decades. We begin with the growth

of funding and personnel. Figure 2 compares the growth of R&D expenditures

(federally financed and total) with the number of doctorates awarded and numbers

of full-time faculty and postdoctoral researchers employed.7 To facilitate

comparison, each series is graphed as an index (set equal to 100 in 1990). Over

most of the period, federal and non-federal funding grew at comparable rates, but

since 2006, federal funding has stabilized while funding from non-federal sources

has continued to increase.

       In comparison to the nearly 70 percent increase in total R&D funding, faculty

numbers were essentially flat over this 20 year period, while the number of

postdoctoral researchers increased only modestly. The number of postdoctoral

researchers did increase somewhat after 1996 and had grown by about 20 percent

by the end of our study period in 2009. The number of doctorates awarded

fluctuated with no clear trend until the early 2000s when it also began to rise

slowly. Again, however, this increase was modest compared to the increase in R&D

expenditures.

       In Figure 3 we shift the focus to measures of research output, graphing the

growth in numbers of publications and citations for our sample institutions. As in

Figure 2, we have plotted each series as an index with 1990 set equal to 100, and we

have included the indexes for federally-funded and total R&D expenditures for

comparison. It is apparent that academic chemistry publications and citations

increased much more rapidly than did funding in this period. The index of

publication numbers increases consistently and reaches a value of 268 by 2009,
                                                                                      14


nearly a threefold increase. Meanwhile the index of citations to these publications

grows even more quickly, achieving a value of 422 in 2008 (the last year for which

we can calculate a three-year citation count).

       The relationships in Figure 3 can be compared with those reported by Adams

and Griliches (1998, p. 136). They found that between 1981 and 1993 publications

and R&D expenditures in chemistry increased at very nearly the same rate; both

increasing approximately 50 percent. Thus there appears to be a change in the

knowledge production function at aggregate level for the chemistry fields in the

more recent period.

       The data on outputs and expenditures shown in Figure 3 make it clear that at

the aggregate level the cost per publication was declining over time. In Figures 4

and 5, we use the university-level data to look more closely at the relationship

between inputs and outputs over time. Dividing total chemistry R&D expenditures

at each institution by the number of chemistry publications attributed to that

institution yields an average cost per publication. Figure 4 plots the mean and

median of the resulting distribution in each year. Both measures fell appreciably

between 1990 and 1998 then leveled off. The median fell from just under $60,000

per article to around $30,000 per article. The divergence between the mean and the

median reflects the impact of a few extremely high-cost universities, and the

convergence of these two measures over time suggests that costs per publication

were becoming somewhat less skewed over time.

       In Figure 5 we compare the median cost of publications across subsets of

universities defined by their research intensity and control (i.e., public or private).
                                                                                     15


In each group the time trends are similar and the differences in levels appear

reasonable: costs are lowest at the more research-intensive universities and the

public universities. Perhaps of greater interest, however, is the apparent

convergence of costs across the different groups over time. Median costs fell much

more sharply at less research-intensive and private universities producing a

considerable convergence of costs by the late 1990s. Costs per publication appear

to have risen again at the non-Research I universities during the early 2000s, but

then began to fall after the early 2000s.



Knowledge Production and Research Funding at the University Level

       As a rule, universities produce new scientific knowledge by combining labor

(faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students), with capital (buildings,

laboratories, infrastructure, and specialized equipment), and other purchased

inputs. While faculty salaries are supported primarily from institutional sources,

support for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and most purchased inputs

comes primarily from externally-sponsored research funding from either federal or

non-federal sources. Structures and other long-lived capital equipment used in

knowledge production may be treated as an institution-specific fixed effect.8

Formally, we can express this relationship in the following knowledge production

function:

(1)    yit = f(t , Lit-1 , Rfit-1, Rnit-1, i,)

Where i indexes institutions, t denotes time periods, L is faculty labor input, Rf and

Rn denote, respectively, federal and non-federal funding,  is an institution specific
                                                                                          16


effect, and  is included to capture technical changes (and other factors) that are

common across all universities at a point in time. The time subscripts on the input

variables are all denoted as t-1 to reflect the fact that there is typically a time lag

between the input of resources and the publication of research results.9

       Theory offers no guidance about the specific functional form that the

relationship in equation (1) takes. In what follows, we estimate a simple linear

approximation to this function:

(2)    yit = i + t + fRfit-1 +nRnit-1 + Lit-1 +it

where  is a stochastic error term that is assumed to be independently distributed

over time for each institution. In our estimation we use faculty numbers and

research funding from the prior year. It is certainly true that some publications are

the result of efforts expended much longer than one year ago, but research

expenditures and faculty numbers are highly serially correlated and

experimentation with a number of different approaches to approximating the

production lags all yield quite similar results.10

       We measure knowledge outputs in two ways. The first is a simple count of

the number of publications in year t that are attributed to the institution based on

the affiliations recorded for each author.11 The second counts the number of

citations that articles published in year t receive during a three-year window

beginning in the publication year.12 To the extent that citations may be interpreted

as a reflection of the significance of each publication, we can treat the citation count

as a relative quality adjusted measure of knowledge production.13
                                                                                        17


OLS Fixed Effect Results

       We begin by reporting OLS estimates of equation (2). Table 3 reports

coefficient estimates for the key explanatory variables in equation (2) for three

dependent variables: the number of publications, the number of citations received

by those publications, and the average number of citations per publication. For both

total publications and citations, the coefficients on both lagged federal and non-

federal funding are positive, statistically and economically significant, and of

approximately the same size. Since the funding variable is measured in $1000s,

they imply that an additional $1 million in funding results in between 6 and 7 more

publications in the following year, and 60 to 70 more citations to those publications.

This implies a marginal cost per publication in the range of $150,000. For

comparison it is worth noting that in the previous section we found that the average

cost per publication fell from around $80,000 in 1990 to about $40,000 by the early

2000s. Given the relatively small changes in the number of full-time faculty in the

years being considered, it is not surprising that the coefficient on this variable is

consistently small and statistically insignificant. Any effects of faculty size must be

absorbed in the university fixed effects or in variations in the scale of funding.

Overall, the model does a reasonably good job of accounting for the observed

patterns of variation in publications and citations, explaining over half of the

observed variation in the dependent variables. It should be pointed out that this is

not simply a result of cross-sectional variation across institutions, as the R-squared

values for within variation are also relatively high, indicating that temporal
                                                                                        18


variations in funding at a university account for a good deal of the temporal

variation in research output.

       The third specification, which examines the relationship between research

funding and the average number of citations per publication, allows us to consider

whether there is an effect of funding on the quality of publications independent of

their quantity. As the estimates for this dependent variable indicate, none of the

included explanatory variables contributes significantly to the average publication

quality.

       In Table 4 we disaggregate the sample of universities to explore whether the

effects of funding on knowledge production vary by control (public vs. private) or

research intensity (Carnegie Research I institutions vs. non-Research I institutions).

The effects of federal R&D funding are statistically significant across all of the

different subsets, and while the point estimates vary somewhat, the differences in

these coefficients are not large enough to be significant. In contrast, there is marked

variation in the effects of non-federal research funds. For both private universities

and non-Research I institutions, non-federal funds appear to have a much smaller

effect and one that is not significantly different from zero. For the average number

of citations per publication, the effects of funding in the disaggregated regressions

remain small in magnitude, however, there is a small, positive, and statistically

significant effect on average citations for public universities and for the non-

Research I universities.

       In Figure 6 we have plotted the estimated year effects (t ) which measure

technological change for each subset of universities, along with the results for the
                                                                                       19


full sample. These estimates indicate that a technological shock improved chemistry

productivity starting in the 1990s. The rising numbers of publications and citations

to those publications was common across all of the different categories of

universities we consider. However, the number of publications produced and the

number of citations to those publications grew considerably more at the Research I

universities than the non-Research I universities. Trends in the number of

publications were quite similar between public and private universities, but the

number of citations received grew more rapidly at the private universities than at

the public ones. The difference was not enough, however, to cause any meaningful

variation in the time trends of average citations per publication.

       Because all of the explanatory variables used in the regressions reported in

Tables 3 and 4 are lagged relative to the dependent variable, they are temporally

exogenous. These regressions confirm that there is a positive and relatively strong

association between both the quantity of federal and non-federal R&D funding an

institution receives and the subsequent production of chemical knowledge.

Moreover, the relative similarity of the effect sizes across different categories of

universities suggests that there is no apparent inefficiency in the distribution of

funding between public and private or between more and less research-intensive

institutions. These results should be reassuring to funders supporting chemical

research as they indicate an effective allocation of funds.
                                                                                      20


Instrumental Variable Estimation

       The OLS results are not sufficient to fully identify the causal effects of funding

on knowledge production. While it is not possible for future publications to directly

cause past funding, these two variables may be related through a third, and

unobserved variable. In particular we know that funding is allocated purposefully.

Thus, investigators with more promising research programs may be more likely to

be successful both in seeking funding and in publishing their research results. If this

is the case, then the positive correlations revealed by the OLS regressions could

simply reflect this unobserved variation in investigator quality, which is positively

selected by universities in our sample.

       Put somewhat differently, the OLS results are not sufficient to answer the

policy-relevant question: how would the quantity of knowledge produced change if

an additional $1 million was allocated to chemistry research? Ideally, to answer this

question we would want an experimental setting in which additional research funds

could be randomly assigned to some universities and not to others. By comparing

the impact of funds on the treatment and control groups we could identify the

impact of additional research funding on scientific output. We cannot conduct such

an experiment, but we can use instrumental variables to obtain estimates of the

effects of such truly random variations in funding levels

       The requirement for a good instrumental variable is that it be correlated with

the explanatory variable of interest, but uncorrelated with the error term. There are

a number of candidate instruments available that we can employ. After exploring a

number of possible candidates we settled on three: federally funded R&D
                                                                                        21


expenditures for math and physics research, non-federally funded R&D

expenditures for math and physics research, and the fall student enrollment

numbers. The first two of these instruments should capture important variations in

the larger funding environment as well as more institution specific effects such as

major fundraising campaigns or faculty recruitment efforts that increase a

university’s overall research competitiveness. The last instrument is included to

capture effects of tuition revenue as a source of faculty recruitment that should be

associated with changes in levels. A priori, there is no reason to expect that any of

these instruments should be correlated with random shocks in the quality of

research funding proposals submitted by chemistry faculty at an institution.

       Table 5 reports the first stage regression results from the two stage

instrumental variable panel regressions for each of the two endogenous explanatory

variables—federally-funded chemistry R&D expenditures, and non-federally-funded

chemistry R&D expenditures. Overall, the model appears to do a good job of

accounting for variation in the endogenous variables, and we see a strong positive

effect of enrollment in both equations, while each of the math and physics

expenditure variables exerts a strong positive effect in the regression for the

corresponding chemistry variable. The F statistics in Table 5 indicate that we do not

have a problem with weak instruments.

       In Table 6 we report the second stage coefficient estimates for the knowledge

production function for the full sample and for each subset of institutions. Given the

poor fit of the OLS regressions for the average number of citations per article, we

have dropped this variable from the IV analysis and focus only on publications and
                                                                                       22


citations received. For the full sample, we find that the effect of federally funded

R&D expenditures has increased by a factor of approximately 3 for publications and

3.5 for citations. On the other hand, the effect of non-federally funded R&D

expenditures has fallen substantially in magnitude and is no longer statistically

significant for either publications or citations. The Sargan-Hansen statistic indicates

that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of over-identified instruments.

       Results are broadly consistent across the different categories of institutions

we have identified, although coefficient magnitudes vary. When we split the sample

between private and public institutions, the effect of federally-funded R&D

expenditures is larger for private universities (for both publications and citations),

and we find that public universities’ non-federally funded R&D expenditures do

have a positive and significant, though significantly weaker, effect on research

outputs. Given the low level of non-federal R&D expenditures at private

universities, it is hardly surprising to find that this category of research funding has

no effect for them. When the sample is split between Research I and non-Research I

universities, the effect of federally-funded R&D expenditures is much weaker for

both subsets of universities than it is for the whole sample and is statistically

significant only for the non-Research I universities. This suggests that much of the

effect observed in the full sample is coming from variations in the level of federally

funded R&D expenditures and research outputs between the two groups, rather

than within either group.

       The year effects, which measure the impact of technological change from the

instrumental variable regressions, are summarized in Figure 7. Once again we see
                                                                                       23


that there remains a significant unexplained positive time trend for both

publications and citations. This growth is most pronounced for the Research I

universities, and weakest for the non-Research I institutions. As was true in the OLS

regressions, the trend growth was also larger for private universities than for the

publics.



Discussion

       Two results emerge from the regressions described in this section. The first

is confirmation of a positive relationship between research funding and knowledge

production, whether measured by raw publication numbers or weighting

publications by the number of citations that they receive. Universities that receive

more funding produce more articles and receive more citations to those articles.

While the OLS results cannot demonstrate a causal effect of funding on knowledge

production, they do confirm that the purposeful allocation of funding across

institutions does correspond to the presence of more productive investigators who

make collectively larger contributions to chemical knowledge. The IV estimates

suggest that there is a causal effect of funding on knowledge production, at least for

federal funding. If true, this implies that the marginal effect of increased funding

would be relatively large. Using the coefficients from the full sample, they imply

that an additional $1 million would lead to the publication of 19 more articles and

an additional 260 citations to those articles. This places the marginal cost of an

additional article (a bit more than $50,000) roughly in line with the average cost per

article across all institutions.
                                                                                     24


       The second striking result to emerge from our analysis is the rapid growth in

knowledge production in chemistry over the 20 years from 1990 through 2009. At

the moment this increase appears in our analysis as a residual time effect. In other

words, it is unexplained by any of the measurable input variables, but can be

considered a proxy for technological change (Solow 1957). Compared to the

analysis in Adams and Griliches (1998) for the 1980s, this appears to be a departure

from past experience. Given the coincidence of its timing with the spread of

automatic laboratory data collection and analysis using personal computers and the

internet, it is possible that the growth in the number of articles published relative to

measured inputs reflects an IT mediated increase in the efficiency of academic

chemistry. Alternatively, given the greater emphasis on publications and

bibliometric measures of influence, it is possible that rising numbers of publications

and citations to those publications reflect changes in the ethos of academic

chemistry that have reduced the knowledge content of individual publications.

Lacking a direct measure of the knowledge contributions of individual articles, we

cannot at present distinguish between these alternative mechanisms or apportion

the sources of the increase between them.



Conclusion

In light of the substantial investments made by both federal and non-federal sources

in supporting university R&D activities, it is quite reasonable to wonder whether

these investments are productive. Only a few previous studies have sought to

elucidate these relationships. Several have focused on the level of individual
                                                                                     25


investigators and grants, a perspective that we believe neglects significant spillover

effects across researchers. As we have argued, we believe that it is most

appropriate to consider relationships at the level of the discipline and to

concentrate on aggregate and institution-level variations.

       As we have shown here, for the case of academic chemistry, analysis at this

level yields important insights about knowledge production and its relationship to

sponsored research funding from both federal and non-federal sources. While we

have documented the fact that funding goes to those institutions that are most

productive, and that there appears to be a causal effect of funding on subsequent

knowledge production, we have also documented a puzzling increase in scholarly

output among academic chemists in the years we have selected for study. This

suggests that technological change may have shifted the production function,

increasing the federal government’s return on investment. Resolving the sources of

this increase will require further effort to refine measurements of the knowledge

embodied in academic publications.

DATA Appendix



The analysis in this paper rests on merging several different sources of data. We

describe the sources and key characteristics of each briefly.



Research & Development Expenditures

       These data are derived from the National Science Foundation’s Survey of

Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges/Higher

Education Research and Development Survey (http://webcaspar.nsf.gov). Data are

available annually since 1973 for total and federally funded R&D expenditures by

discipline. They are obtained from survey responses completed by institutions of

higher education, which are responsible for classifying all research expenditures by

discipline. We computed non-federally funded R&D expenditures as the difference

between total and federally funded R&D expenditures.

       Sample institutions were selected from the universe of institutions

represented in this data by summing real federally funded R&D expenditures (in

prices of 2000) for chemistry and chemical engineering between 1990 and 2009

and then ranking institutions in descending order. We initially selected the top 150

institutions but were obliged to drop three of these from the analysis because of

inconsistencies in coverage. Before adopting this sampling strategy, we examined

several other rankings, using total R&D expenditures and using nominal rather than

real expenditures. The lists produced in each case were quite similar.
                                                                                       27


       Institutions report these data for the fiscal year corresponding most closely

to the federal fiscal year. In most cases this is likely to run from July of one year to

June of the following calendar year. Data are labeled with the calendar year in

which the fiscal year ends. Hence data for 2009 most likely cover expenditures from

July 2008 through June 2009.

       In addition to the expenditures data, this source also contains information on

type of control (private or public) and standardized Carnegie Classifications that we

use to categorize university types.



Graduate Students, Doctorates Awarded and Postdoctoral Researchers

       These data are derived from the National Science Foundation and National

Institutes of Health Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and

Engineering (graduate student survey) which is conducted annually by the National

Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. The survey is conducted in the fall

semester of each academic year and data are collected at the department level.

These data are available from http://webcaspar.nsf.gov .

       The level of institutional detail provided in this survey is greater than in the

R&D expenditure data. In the latter survey a number of multi-campus state systems

report a single aggregated number. To link the data sets, we were obliged to

aggregate the data in the student survey to match the level of aggregation of the

R&D data.
                                                                                    28


Publications and Citations

       Publication and citation data were computed by Thomson Reuters, Research

Analytics from the data underlying the Web of Science publication and citation

database. Thomson Reuters subject area experts categorize journals into subject

classes based on detailed analysis of the content and focus of the journals. Our

research began with the full set of journals that Thomson Reuters categorizes as

Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. We also conducted an analysis of all journal

titles indexed by Thomson Reuters and added a small number of additional journals

that contain significant chemistry content.

       We then worked closely with Thomson Reuters staff to match publications by

author affiliation to universities in our sample. In addition to institution name, we

considered city, state and zip code information associated with authors to verify the

accuracy of article linkages.

       After verifying the full list of publications, Thomson Reuters analyzed them

to produce summary statistics describing the number of publications each year

produced by each institution, the number of citations that those publications

received in 3 and 5 year windows beginning with the publication year, and a variety

of other citation related metrics.

Endnotes


1   A recent National Science and Technology Council (2008, pp. 6, 14) report, for

example, observes: “The pragmatic reality facing Federal agencies is that the

resources available for investing in research are limited…” and argues that there is a

need for more systematic, quantitative models relating funding inputs to a variety of

significant scientific outputs.

2   Although it remains unpublished, work by Arora and Gambardella (1998) adopts a

similar methodology in examining the effects of grants from the National Science

Foundation’s (NSF) Economics program. Like Jacob and Lefgren, they find a

relatively modest effect of funding on subsequent productivity, although this effect

varies by researcher seniority.

3   From 1998 to 2004, NSF R&D obligations increased from $2.3 billion to $3.8

billion, measured in current dollars. While not as impressive at the increase in NIH

budgets, this represents a significant infusion of funding and a departure from the

relatively stable funding in the years before and after these dates (NSF Survey of

Federal Funds for Research and Development; http://webcaspar.nsf.gov; accessed

9/25/2014).

4   To illustrate this point, of the 150 institutions we initially examined, there were

102 chemical engineering departments that reported faculty numbers in the

American Chemical Society directory and 48 that did not. However, only 22

institutions reported zero amounts of federally funded R&D expenditures for

chemical engineering research in every year, and there are no institutions for which
                                                                                        33



Web of Science recorded zero chemical engineering publications in all years. The

mismatch in classification across the different sources used in our analysis suggests

that attempting to analyze these fields separately would likely cause more problems

than it solves. Numerically, chemistry accounts for the bulk of publications, R&D

expenditures and faculty, and results that are restricted to chemistry look similar to

those we report below. Results for chemical engineering resemble in sign and

magnitude the results for chemistry, but effects are not significant, possibly because

of the smaller sample and likely discrepancies in classification across the different

data sources.

5   The three institutions dropped from our sample included two academic medical

centers—the University of California San Francisco and the University of Texas M.D.

Anderson Cancer Center—which reported no chemistry faculty, graduate students

or postdocs for much of the study period, and the Oregon Institute of Science and

Technology, which disappears from the data after 2001.

6   Additional details on the construction of the dataset used in our analysis are

provided in the appendix to this paper.

7   Aggregate faculty numbers were essentially constant over these 20 years. We are

in the process of hand collecting data from biannual faculty directories produced by

the American Chemical Society, but because individual departments are not

represented in all years, the data are not yet of sufficient quality to be reported here.

Nonetheless, we can rule out the possibility that there was any significant increase

in aggregate faculty numbers.
                                                                                       34


8   For additional discussion of approaches to modeling knowledge production

functions, see Hare and Wyatt (1988). de Groot (1991), which seeks to estimate

university cost function, is also relevant.

9   For a somewhat different approach to modeling knowledge production, which

accounts for the joint production of publications and graduate student training, see

Apon et al (2014), who use a stochastic frontier production function model.

10   Initially we had hoped to directly estimate the lag-structure of the relationship by

including multiple years of lagged inputs on the right hand side of the equation. It

became apparent, however, that these variables were highly collinear, making it

impossible to precisely estimate their separate effects. When it became clear that

we could not use this strategy, we experimented with a number of ad hoc

specifications, including the average levels of inputs over the previous five years, a

declining sum of the previous five years’ inputs, and an inverted V weighting

structure. All produced essentially the same results as a one-period lag.

11   The vast majority of articles in our data have authors with only one institutional

affiliation. However, when the authors of an article have affiliations with more than

one institution, we credit each institution with the publication. Because there was a

small increase in the number of multi-affiliation articles over time, this approach

introduces a small upward bias into the time trend, but it can account at most for an

increase of perhaps 5-10% in the total number of articles over the period.

12   Increasing the citation window to five years yields very similar results.

13   We say “relative” quality because, as noted earlier, the average number of

citations per article increased substantially between 1990 and 2009, which we
                                                                                         35



interpret as a change in citation practices that may reflect the greater visibility of

publications as a result of the movement toward electronic publication and

distribution. Thus, the absolute number of citations is unlikely to reflect the

absolute quality of an article, but it will still provide evidence about the relative

quality of articles published at the same time.
