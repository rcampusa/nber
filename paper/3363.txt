            THE PROVISION OF TIME TO THE ELDERLY BY THEIR CHILDREN


                                   ABSTRACT

     This paper uses matched data on the elderly and their children to study
the provision of time by children to the elderly. It develops a Tobit model
as well as a structural model to analyze the determinants of this decision.
The main determinants of the amount of time given to parents appear to be the
parent's age, reported health, and institutionalization status, and the
children's age, health, and sex. Older parents, less healthy parents, and
non—institutionalized parents receive more time from their children, while
younger children, healthier children, and female children provide more time.
In contrast to these demographic determinants, economic variables, such as
children's wage rate and iicome levels, appear to play a rather insignificant
role in the provision of time. In addition, the evidence does not support the
hypothesis that parents purchase time from their children.

     Has support of the aged by families declined in the post war period?

While the jury is still out, there is substantial evidence pointing in that

direction. Over 60 percent of the elderly (those over 60) now live alone

compared with only 25 percent in the 1940s. For the old old (those over 85)

the fraction living alone has increased from 13 percent to 57 percent. At the

same time there has been more than a tripling of the rate of

institutionalization; today almost a quarter of the old old live in

institutions compared with only 7 percent in the 1940s (Sandefur and Tuna,

1987). In addition to not living with the elderly, the children of the

elderly rarely provide financial transfers to the elderly (Kotlikoff and

Morris, 1989) and when they do, the amounts are typically quite meager.

     One defense of the children's behavior is demographic; the current number

of children per elderly totals about half the number observed in the 1940s.

Since the elderly of today had fewer children than did their parents and have,

in some cases, succeeded in outliving their children, the current Situation

may be much of their own making. A second defense is that the relative income

position of the elderly has improved permitting them to live alone (Michael,

Fuchs, and Scott, 1980) and obviating the need for financial transfers from

their children. A variety of studies (e.g., Boskin, Kotlikoff, and Knetter,

1985 and Andrews and Hurd, 1990) have demonstrated that current poverty rates

of the elderly are close to, if not below, those of the nonelderly. Much of

the improvement in the relative incomes of the elderly is due to increases in

real social security benefits legislated in the l970s. A third point to

consider in assessing child support of the elderly involves payment for

nursing home care. A good fraction of the elderly in nursing homes are

private pay patients. Some of these payments are being made directly by
                                      —2—


children. While we are not aware of time series data on nursing home payments

by children, ic seems plausible that such payments per child measured at

constant dollars have increased over time.

     While the elderly may need and appear to be receiving less financial help

from their children, their needs for compsnionship and physical assiatance may

well have increased in the postwar period; the increased longevity of the

elderly often means living for years in poor states of health. In addition,

those elderly who continue to live will lose a large fraction of their old

friends and even some of their children along the way. Most studies of the

increasingly separate living arrangements of the elderly conclude that these

arrangements reflect the preferences and improved financial means of the

elderly. In contrast, Kotlikof and Morris (1988) suggest that about half of

the elderly would prefer to live with their children, but continue to live

apart because of their children's preferences coupled with their children's

financial abilities to live apart from their parents.

     One reason the jury remains out on family support of the aged involves

the issue of time spent by children with their elderly parents. As Morgan's

(1984) research suggests, children's provision of time to their elderly

parents is an importsnt, if not the most important, form of economic transfer

to the elderly by their children. This paper studies the provision of time by

children to their elderly parents. We use the 1986 Hebrew Rehabilitation

Center (HRCA) for the Aged follow—up survey of Massachusetts elderly and the

1986 NBER—HRCA survey of the children of these Massachusetts elderly. While

the child survey involved an interview of only one of the children of the

elderly (the one designated by the elderly), each child was ssked a set of

detsiled questions not only about his own    circumstances,   but also about the

circumstances of each of his siblings. The combined data are unique in their
                                     —3—


detail of demographic and economic characteristics of the elderly and each of

their children.

     We use these data to answer a number of questions about the provision of

time by children to their parents. These questions include: How does the

health Status of the elderly influence the amount of time given by children?

How does the health status of the children influence their provision of time

to their parents? Do parents with more income and wealth receive more time

from their children? How does the employment status and wage rates of

children affect their provision of time? Do children free ride on their

siblings provision of time? Are home care corporations used by children as a

substitute for their own time? Do the institutionalized elderly receive more

or less time? Are daughters, other things equal, more or less likely to

provide time?

     We take two empirical approaches in studying the data. First, we

estimated Tobits for the provision of time by children. Second, we estimate a

structural model of the joint decision of children to work and to provide time

to their elderly parent. Since the opportunity cost of providing time to the

parent for working children is the wage, the structural model indicates how

wage rates influence the allocation of time by children to the elderly. The

model can account for corner solutions in the data; this is important because

some children do not work, some do not provide time to their parents, and some

neither work nor provide time.

     Our model assumes that the child is altruistic in that he (she) cares

about the utility the parent receives from their time spent together. The

model does not, however, consider the utility the child might derive from the

consumption of the parent. Including the utility of parent's consumption in

the child's utility function would require an analysis of financial transfers
                                          —4—


 from children to parents. But given thst only 2.6 percent of children in our

sample report making financial trsnsfers to their elderly parent(s), the extra

complications of modeling financial transfers seems to outweigh the potential

benefits.1 While we ignore financial transfers, the model does consider the

simultaneous decisions by siblings as to how much time each sibling should

provide the parent. The model assumes that each sibling takes time provided

to the parent as given; i.e. ,   the   siblings play non—cooperative Nash.

     Another issue not considered by the model is the possibility that

children are not altruistic, but, in effect, sell their time (a la Bernheim,

Shleiffer, and Summers, 1985) to their parents. The quid pro quo for this

sale of time is a financial payment by parents to their children. But such

transfers are also quite rare in our sample. In our sample only .9 percent of

children report receiving financial transfers from their parents. In

addition, as described below, children receiving financial transfers from

their parents are no more likely to provide time to their parents than those

not receiving transfers. While the possibility remains that parents pay for

time transfers by leaving larger future bequests, it is not clear how one

would estimate the magnitude of such contingent payments.

     Section I presents our simple structural model. Section II describes the

data and our sample selecdon. Section III presents Tobit estimates of the

allocation of time by children to their parents. Section IV presents maximum

likelihood estimates of the structural model. Section V summarizes the

paper's findings and provides suggestions for future research.

I. A Simple Structural Model of the Joint Labor Supply and Time Provision

Decisions

A. The Model

      Our   model   assumes that the child's utility is logarithmic and depends on

his consumption, leisure, and the total amount of time the parent receives

from himself (herself) and his (her) siblings. The utility function of

sibling i, U, is given by

                            +           +
(1)          Ui —   ologC       8logi       log(d+
                                                     jøi
                                                           d,+ 1)



In (1) a, , and m are constants. The terms C, 1, d, and dj (jri) stand,

respectivly, for consumption of child i, leisure of child i, time provided

to the parent by child i, and tIme provided to the parent by sibling j. There

are N siblings of child i. The unitary displacement value in the logarithm

or time received by parent ensures the possibility that child i will provide

zero time to his (her) parent even in the case that all his (her) siblings

also provide zero time.

      The child maximizes this function subject to constraints (2), (3), and




(2)         C   W(l_I_d) +

(3)          diO
(4)
            di+2.i

Equation (2) says that consumption cannot exceed labor earnings plus exogenous

income, Y. Equation (2) says that time provided to the parent cannot be

negative, and equation (3) says that the sum                of   leisure time plus time spent
                                                      —6—


with the parent cannot exceed the endowment of time which is normalized to

unity.

          Since (2) will always be binding, solutions for the values of                and d
satisfy:



(6)
                l        W(l—2—d) +
                                     oW
                                                   (l—d-2
                                                       i i)   -o

                d. +E'd+m
                    ji j



Letting         Ja and [        ]b   stand, respectively, for the values in the square

bracket in (6) and (7), we have the following four cases: 1) di+2il and d=0

                                                                        a   >0 and [   ] <;    2)

             and d>O (the child is retired and provides time) holds if                 ]a >0

and [       ]b—°; 3) d1+e<l and d1—0 (the child works and provides no time) holds

      [    1a —0 and [     ]b   <0; and 4) d+1<l and di>0 (the child works and

provides time) holds if                   ]a0 and 1

II. The Data, Sample Section Criteria, and     Data   Characteristics

A. The 1986 HRCA Elderly Survey and the 1986 NBER—HRCA Child Survey

        The 1986 HRCA Survey of the Elderly is part of an ongoing panel survey of

Massachusetts elderly which began in 1982. In addition to the 1982 and 1986

surveys, the elderly sample was reinterviewed in 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1989.

The 1986 NBER—HRCA Child Survey is a survey of the children of those elderly

interviewed in the 1986 HRCA Survey of the Elderly. One child of each elderly

respondent was interviewed and asked a set of questions concerning his (her)

household, his (her) parents, and his (her) siblings.

        The original 1982 stratified sample of 3856 elderly individuals was dra-n

from two populations. The first population, accounting for 2674 of the

elderly in the total sample, was drawn from communities in Massachusetts. In

forming the community sample the state of Massachusetts was divided into 27

home care areas. Within each home care area communities were stratified,

based on population, into large, medium, and small, and communities within

each of the three groups were selected at random. Next HRCA used

Massachusetts police records, which record the ages and addresses of all

Massachusetts residents, to stratify the elderly by age, separating those age

75 and above from those below age 75. Elderly individuals within each

subgroup were then randomly selected. The coilununity and age stratifications

produced an intentional over—representation of the old old as well as the

elderly living in rural communities.
                                      —9—


     The second population, which accounts for the remaining 1182 elderly in

the 1982 survey, was drawn from elderly participants of all 27 Massachusetts

home health care corporations. In this sample the elderly were again

stratified by age and the older old were oversampled. The sample's selection

procedures are described in more detail in Morris et. al. (1987). The 1982

sample of the elderly included only the non—institutionalized elderly, but

each subsequent survey has followed the initial sample as they changed

residences, including moving into and out of nursing homes.

     Each of the HRCA Surveys of the Elderly include detailed questions about

living arrangements and health status. The 1986 reinterview of the elderly

also contains a series of questions of the elderly about their children.

These questions include the names, sexes, frequency of contact and the type of

contact with children, the extent of financial aid given to and received from

children, and the amount of assistance given by children to their elderly

parents in performing activities of daily living. In addition, the 1986

survey contains a set of questions about the elderly respondent's income and

wealth,

     At the close of the HRCA elderly survey the elderly respondent was asked

for permission to contact one of his/her children and ask that child to

participate in our child survey. While a random selection of the child

respondents would have been preferable, it was felt that the elderly

respondents would be more cooperative if they were allowed to make the

selection. Because of funding limitations we were able to sample designated

only children of the community sample of elderly; i.e. , we were not able to

Contact children of the home care sample of elderly. As mentioned, the

community sample of elderly is a stratified random sample of non—

institutionalized elderly.
                                      —10—


     Like the HRCA Surveys of the Elderly, The NBER—HRCA Child Survey is a

telephone interview. The Child Survey is roughly 45 minutes in length.

Interviews with the child's spouse were conducted if the child was

unavailable. The questions in the Child Survey concerning the respondent's

and spouse's characteristics include age, marital status, number of young

children, work and health status, occupation, industry, education, grades in

high school, income, and wealth. These questions are also asked of the

respondent about his or her siblings. In addition, the child was asked to

indicate (1) the frequency of contact between each sibling and each sibling's

spouse and the HRCA elderly respondent parent, (2) the amount of financial

assistance each sibling and his spouse give to or receive from the HRCA

elderly respondent parent, and (3) the amount of time each sibling and his

spouse spends with the HRCA elderly respondent per month. The child is also

asked about his parents' and in—laws' health status as well as his parents'

income and net wealth.

     The sample size of the initial 1982 Survey of the Elderly is 3856. In

contrast, the 1986 completed sample size of elderly was 2889, with 22.5

percent of the attrition since 1982 due to deaths. In the 1986 data over 90

percent of the elderly are above age 70, over 40 percent are the old old

(above age 85), and over two thirds are females. The size of the NBER—HRCA

Child Survey is 850. Including siblings the number of children of the HRCA

Elderly Survey respondents for whom we have data is 1650.

B. Sample Section

       The basic sample used in our statistical analysis contains 1650 children

of 706 elderly respondents. We excluded observations in the case that data is

missing on a child's age, sex, occupation, health, education, marital status,

grades received in school, and employment status. We also excluded children

with missing information on time provided their parent, children less than 18

years of age, children whose co—residence status with the parent respondent

was not reported, and children for whom we are missing data on their parent's

age.




C. Data Characteristics

       Of the 706 elderly parents. in our sample, 24 percent are age 55 to 70, 48

percent are age 71 to 80, and 28 percent are above 81 and above. The 1650

children (including siblings of the Child Survey respondents) of these parents

range in age from 18 to 84; 20 percent are under 40, 29 percent are 41 to 50,

33 percent are 51 to 60, and 18 percent are 61 and over. Most of the elderly

parents (70 percent) are females, and most (72 percent) are not married. In

contrast, only 54 percent of children are female, and 76 percent of children

are married. On average there are 2.42 children per elderly parent. A total

of 21 percent of the elderly parents have 1 child, 32 percent have 2 children,

23 percent have 3 children, and 24 percent have 4 or more.

       Among elderly who report their total household income, mean income is

$11,247, and median income is $6,250. These and all subsequent dollar figures

are in 1987 dollars. The corresponding figures for child households are

$34,392 and $32,500. Among elderly who report total household net worth, mean

net worth is $93,396 and median net worth is $40,000. The corresponding child

net worth figures are $175,019 and $125,000.
                                          —12—


      Many of the elderly in our sample are in poor health; indeed 13 percent

 of the aample's elderly are in nuraing homes or similar inatitutions, and 15

 percent are enrolled in home care programs. In total 40 percent of the

 elderly self—report their health as fair or poor (aa oppoaed to excellent or

 good). In terms of ADL (activities of daily living) status, the fraction

reporting difficulty or inability in preparing their own meals is 44 percent;

it is 56 percent for the case of taking out garbage, 33 percent for the case

of performing house chores, 22 percent for the case of dressing one's self, 24

percent for the case of taking a bath or shower, 10 percent for the case of

getting out of a chair without assistance, 21 percent for the case of problems

maintaining bladder control, and 28 percent for the case of walking up and

down stairs without assistance.

     Not all the children of the elderly are in excellent or good health. A

total of 13 percent of the children report their health (or have their health

reported) to be either fair or poor. In the case of the 1255 spouses of these

children, 14 percent report (have reported) their health to be fair or poor.

     In addition to time demands imposed by the elderly parent respondent, the

children in our survey may need to respond to the time demands by their other

parent and their parent in—laws. The fraction of children with two parents is

30 percent. In the case of in—laws information was obtained only for the

child respondents; i.e. ,   the   survey did not ask the child respondents about

their siblings' in—laws. For child respondents the percent with one or two

parent in—laws is 43 percent, and 33 percent of these in—laws are reported to

be in fair or poor health.

     A total of 64 percent of the 1729 children in the sample report (or have

reported) that they are employed full—time, and 12 percent report (or have

reported) that they are employed part time. The average annual wages of full—
                                     —13—


time employed children for those children for whom we have information on

wages is $32,914. Unfortunately, the child survey questionnaire did not

separately ask about the wages plus salary of the child respondent and the

wage plus salary of the child respondent's spouse, but rather asked about

combined household wage and salary income. And in the case of the questions

about siblings, the survey only asks about the total income of the sibling and

the sibling's spouse; it does not separately ask about siblings' wages and

salaries.

     In the Tobit and mayimum likelihood estimation we use an imputed full—

time wage based on a regression of wages of child respondents or their spouses

who report they are working full—time and for whom we can determine their

wages plus salaries. As an example, in the case the respondent child is

married, reports that he (she) works full—time, and also reports that his

(her) spouse does not work, we know that the wages plus salaries of the couple

are those of the child respondent. In this wage regression we use education

dummies for years of education, grades in school, occupation, sex, health

dummies, and a third order polynomial in age as explanatory variables.2



III. Model Estimation.

A. Tobit Estimates:

     The Tobit model can be viewed as a test of a simpler version of the

structural model presented above. It corresponds to the case that the amount

of work the child does (which may be zero) is exogenously given, and the child

simply divides his (her) non—work time between leisure and time spent with his

(her) parent. In this simpler model consumption is exogeneously determined by

the sum of exogenous non—labor plus labor income, so the child maximizes U —

            +                  subject to diO, where     stands for 1 minus
                                            —14—


the exogenously determined supply of labor. For this model equation (7) is

modified to:


                     I
    7•                            ___L_ di —o
                                        i
'
                         N.        A.—d
                                    t
               di +Etd.+m
                              J
                     i_i


The provision of time is positive if the square bracket in (7') equals zero,

and it ia zero if the square bracket is negative; i.e., d—O if

O>[—$(Zjøidj+m)+A]/(l—fl) holds, otherwise di—[--fi(Sj0d+m)+A]/(l_fi). Let the

right hand side of this last equality equal xi'y +      €, where   x is a vector of

characteristics of child i and his (her) parent and includes the amount of

time provided to his (her) parent by his (her) siblings (Ej0id). and          is a

standard normal error. Then d equals zero if the indicator function           —

         +    is   negative and equals I if the indicator is positive. But this is

the standard Tobit model. Using data on all child respondents and their

siblings and taking, for each observation, the time provided by all the other

siblings as one of the x's in the Tobit regression appears to be appropriate

provided the error terms, the €j's are uncorrelated across siblings.

         Our actual Tobit model is a slight modification of the standard Tobit

specification to take account of the 29 percent of children in our sample

whose parents live with them. In these cases it is obvious that the child

spends time with the parent, but we are not sure how to assess the amount of

time. To accommodate these data we treat these observations as observations

for which time provided by the child is positive, but the exact amount of time

is unknown. The standard Tobit has two pieces of the likelihood function

corresponding to the probability of no time provided and the probability of a

specific amount of time provided. We add to the standard likelihood function
                                     —15—


a statement for the probability of providing positive time, which is simply 1

minus the probability of providing zero time.

     The time question in the Child Survey that provides the dependent

variable for our analysis is: "In the last month, how many hours did you (and

your spouse) spend with your parents, visiting, going out together, and/or

helping him/her/them?" Of the 1179 children in the Tobit sample who are not

living with the elderly respondent parent, 29 percent report (or have

reported) spending zero time per month with their elderly parent. Another 31

percent report spending 1—10 hours per month; 18 percent report spending 11—20

hours per month, 9 percent report 21—30 hours per month, 5 percent report 31—

40 hours per month, and 8 percent report spending 41 or more hours per month.

     Excluding children living with their parents, the average number of hours

provided per month is 15, and the median number is 8. Within this subsample

of non—co—resident children, average and median hours provided by only

children are 24 and 16; average and median hours (per child) provided by

children with one sibling are 16 and 9; and average and median hours (per

child) provided by children with two or more siblings are 12 and 5.

     Tables 1 through 4 report results from four Tobit regressions. The first

regression includes a set of 33 regressors (excluding the intercept). It does

not, however, include the sum of time provided by siblings as a regressor. In

considering the results it is important to keep in mind first, that time spent

with the parent, d, is a censored variable, and second, that the change in

expected time spent in response to a unit change in one of the regressor

variables is the change in the unconditional expectation E(d]; i.e., the

reported coefficients correspond to the product of Tobit coefficients times

the probability that time spent is positive.
                                      —16—


      The first Set of regressors in Table 1 (mr2—mr4) are dummies for the

 child's marital status. The dummy for married child (mrl) was excluded. AS

would be expected, separated/divorced, widowed, and never—married children

provide more time to parents. Of these separated/divorced children provide

very little additional time as compared to married children. Widowed children

provide the most time to parents. The coefficients on all three dummies are,

however, insignificant.

     The dummy for married parents (pml) was ommitted from the regression.

The coefficients on parent's marital Status indicate that as compared to

married parents, divorced/separated parents (pm2) receive less time, but the

standard error here is very large. In contrast, widowed parents' (pm3)

receive substantially more time; and the coefficient is quite significant.

     The next set of dummies (em2 and em3) are coded 1 when the child

employment status is part—time (960 hours per year), and not—working. The

dummy for children who have full—time (1920 hours per year) employment status

(eml) was excluded. As can be expected, children who are working part—time

provide marginally more time as compared to children working full—time.

However, contrary to expectations, those who are not working provide

substantially less time to parents as compared to children who are employed

full—time. The former coefficient is insignificant while the latter is very

close to significant. The dummy for child's spouse being employed either

full—time or part—time (sempi) is positive. The coefficient, however, is

insignificant.

     The next variable (ns) indicates the number of siblings. A larger number

of siblings may be expected to reduce the amount of time provided by each

child since parent dependence on any one child would be lower. Moreover, if

siblings free—ride on each other's time provision to the parent, a larger
                                      —17—


number of siblings would provide additional scope for such free—riding

behavior. The regression shows that, after controlling for other influences,

the presence of additional siblings reduces the provision of time to parents

by about 1 hour per month for each additional sibling. The coefficient on

this variable is significant at the 10 percent level, but not the 5 percent

level.

     The dummy for the child's sex (sx) was set to equal 1 for male children.

The coefficient suggests that male children who spend time, spend about 7

hours less per month than female children who spend time. The parent's sex

dummy (psx), which also has a value of one for males, has a negative

coefficient of —0.62 hours, but is not significant.

     As expected, the dummy for, child's self—reported health being 'poor'

(h14) shows a large negative effect on time spent with parent, and the

coefficient is significant.   'Poor' health of spouse (sph4) may be expected to

curtail the amount of time spent by the child with the parent. However, the

opposite result is obtained from the regression. The coefficient on sph4 is

positive, but insignificant. The variable (ph4) is a dummy for parent's self—

reported health status being 'poor'. As expected, the time provided by

children is higher for parents whose health status is 'poor', but the

coefficient is not significant.

     The variable padl is a sum of 14 dummies, each having a value of one if

the parent is unable to preform specific tasks, and a value of zero

otherwise.3 A larger value of padi thus represents a higher degree of parent

disability. The coefficient on this variable is positive and significant.

Ita value is close to one, indicating that for every additional count of

disability the child spends an additional hour per month with the parent.
                                     —18—


     The coefficient on the dummy indicating whether the parent is in a

nursing home or similar institution (ply), is large, negative, and quite

significant. The result suggests that such parents receive substantially less

time from their children. A large, negative, and significant impact on

child's time also arises in the case the parent receives services from a home

care corporation (phc). Parents receiving 'Meals on Wheels' are represented

as 1 in the next dummy variable (pwh). The coefficient is negative, but not

significant. These results suggest that children substitute for their own

time by using institutions, home care corporations, etc. to care fro their

eldelry parents.

     Older children spend less time with parents, but the coefficient on

child's age (ag) is not significant. Older parents receive substantially more

time, and the coefficient on parent's age (pag) is significant.

     The next two dummies (milh4 and filh4) have a value of one if mother—in—

law's or father—in—law's health, as reported by the child is 'poor', for

children who have either of these parents—in—law, Surprisingly, the

coefficient on the former is highly positive and quite significant.2 The

coefficient on father—in—law's health is negative and insignificant.

     Do children substitute financial transfers for time transfers to parents

and do parents buy time from children? The variable (fhlpl) is a dummy that

assumes a value of one if the child made positive financial transfers to the

parent within the past year. According to the coefficient on fhlpl, children

who make such transfers spend about 11 hours more per month with parents than

children who do not. The coefficient on this variable is significant. The

dummy indicating whether the parent made a financial transfer to the child

(phlpl) has a large negative coefficient, and this too is significant. Both

parts of the question posed above are thus answered in the negative.
                                      —19—


      Higher total income of the parent (pyv) when parent income is reported ia

 associated with aubstantially less time devoted by the child to the parent,

but the coefficient is not significant. Higher total income of the child

 (kyv) is also associated with less time spent by the child with the parent,

but again the coefficient is insignificant. The signs on both these

coefficients are plausible: Parents with larger income can afford to buy

supervisory and care services, and are, therefore, less dependent on their

children, and children with higher incomes would be expected to have a higher

opportunity cost of time.

     If expectations of bequests are important determinants of parent—child

relationships one would expect richer parents to receive more time from their

children and richer children to provide less time to parents. The regression

indicates that parents with higher net worth (pwlv) receive more time from

children, and children with higher net worth (kwlv) spend less time with

parents. The coefficients on both these variables are, however,

insignificant.

     Children with m higher wage rates (wage) spend somewhat less time with

their parents. The coefficient on the wage rate is quite significant.

     Table 2 repeats the Tobit of Table I, but also includes the totml amount

of time provided by siblings (sibtm) as a regressor. The introduction of this

extra regressor does not substantially alter the estimated coefficients and

standard errors for the rest of the variables. More time provided by siblings

(sibtm) is associated with a very small reduction in the amount of time

provided by the child and the coefficient is insignificant.

     Table 3 reports Tobit results for the subsample that excludes children

who live with their parents. In this-subsample the intercept is much lsrger.

Coefficients on two out of the three dummies for child's marital status have
                                     —20—


the opposite signs as compared to those in Table 1. Now children who are

divorced/separated or never—married spend less time with parents as compared

to married children, s result that seems implausible. The coefficients on all

three child marital—status dummies are, however, insignificant. Unlike Table

1, Table 3 shows that children who are employed part—time (em2) spend less

time with parents as compared to children employed full—time, though the

coefficient is sgain not significant. Non—working children (em3) still spend

less time with parents than those employed full—time, but the coefficient is

now clearly significant.

     The variable for number of siblings (ns) is significant and larger in

absolute value in Table 3 as compared with Table 1. The coefficient on the

dummy for parents receiving home—care services is now a much smaller negative

number and is insignificant.   Table 3 shows a much smaller though still

positive coefficient on the index for parent disability (padl), and the

coefficient is now insignificant. This indicates that in the subsample of

non—co—resident parents and children, children seem to spend very little

additional time with parents when the degree of parent disability is higher.

     Table 4 repeats Table 3, but also includes the total amount of time

provided by siblings (sibtm) as a regressor. Surprisingly the coefficient on

time spent by siblings enters with a positive sign though it is still not

significant. The coefficient on the number of siblings variable (ns) in Table

4 is negative and significant. This seems to suggest that in the subsample

under consideration siblings divide the total time spent with the parent

amongst themselves. However, for any given family size, increased time spent

by one child seems to induce additional time transfers from siblings. This

interpretation must however be viewed with caution given that the coefficient

on time spent by siblings is not significant.

B. Estimates for the Structural Model:

     Tables 5 and 6 present maximum likelihood regression results for the

structural model presented in Section I.     The data used for this estimation is

a subsample of 415 respondent children who do not live with their parent, and

for whom valid data on labor and non—labor income are available.4       Table 5

presents estimated values for the coefficient vectors 9 and      contained in the

regression equations used to model the parameters of the utility function (1),

viz, 1oga —   x'9   + pj (equation 1 in the table) and log —   x1' +    Ui

(equation 2 in the table). For this analysis, total disposable time available

for an individual per year was taken to be 4380 hours (assuming 12 hours of

disposable time per day). The estimation procedure assumes that         and

(i—IN) are independently and identically distributed. The vector of child

and parent characteristics, x, contains a subset of the variables used as

regressors in the Tobit model.

     The structural estimates are somewhat disappointing. With the exception

of the intercepts and the coefficient on the number of siblings (ns) in column

1, all of the coefficients of the structural estimates that are significant.

Using the estimated values    and 3 and a given configuration of the vector x

we can obtain the individual—specific preference parameters a and fi.     The

optimal choices of the time transfer to parent (d) and the amount of leisure

(i) can then be inferred by setting the terms within the square brackets of

(6) and (7) to equal zero and simultaneously solving the two resultant

equations. If the optimal choice of d turns out to be negative, a corner

solution is imposed by setting d to zero and recomputing the optimum amount of

leisure.
                                      —22—


     The first row of Table 6 presents the choices of d and 1 for a

hypothetical individual assuming mean values of the characteristic vector x

computed over the 415 observations used in the estimation.5 Subsequent rows

of Table 6 present the the choices of d and .2 that result from changing the

value of one of the elements in vector x (as indicated) while maintaining the

others at their mean values. The columns labeled d and ai indicate the

change in d and .2 from their respective values in the first row of the table.

The results in Table 6 indicate that out of a total of 4380 hours per year a

hypothetical individual with mean characteristics spends 50 hours per year

with the parent, conaumes 3368 hours of leisure per year, and works for the

remaining 962 hours.

     Divorced/separated children (mr2) and widowed children (mr3) spend more

time with their parents than do married children (the dummy for which (mrl)

was excluded). A corner solution on time spent with the parent is obtained

when the value of the dummy for never—married children (mr4) is set at unity.

All non—married children consume less leisure than married children. These

results confirm those of Table 4 (which is also based on a sample of non—co—

resident parents and children): Widowed children spend the most, and never—

married children the least, amounts of time with their parents.

     A corner solution is also obtained when the parent's marital status is

separated/divorced (pm2) rather than married (the dummy for which (pml) was

excluded). Compared with children whose parents are married, children with a

widowed parent (pm3) spend more time with the parent and also consume slightly

less leisure.

     Children whose spouses work full—time or part—time (sempl) spend more

time with parenta and consume a slightly lower amount of leisure. This is

also consistent with the results of Table 4.
                                      —23—


     The larger the number of siblings (ns), the greater the amount of time

spent by the child with parent and the lower the amount of leisure consumed.

This effect is surprisingly large. The Tobit specification showed that a

larger number of siblings reduces the time spent by the child with the parent.

Unlike the Tobit model, however, the leisure decision is endogenous in the

structural model. A possible explanation of this result is that with fixed

time spent by siblings, a larger number of siblings implies smaller lengths of

visits to parent by each sibling. To compensate the child reduces his

consumption of leisure and increases the time spent with parent.

     Changing the value of the child's sex dummy (sx) to 1 results in a sharp

decline in the amount of time spent with the parent and the amount of leisure

consumed decreases by 384 hoursper year. A similar, though much smaller,

reduction is obtained in both time spent and consumption of leisure when the

parent's sex dummy is set to unity.

     Corner solutions are obtained for both the endogenous variables when

child's health (hl4) or child's spouse's health (sph4) dummies are

alternatively set to unity. A substantially larger amount of time transfer is

induced when the parent has 'poor' health (ph4). Children with parents

residing in a nursing home or similar institution (ply) spend less time with

the parent and consume substantially more leisure. There is a substantial

decline in time spent by children when the parent receives home care services

(phc), although the increase in the child's consumption of leisure is slight.

These results are consistent with those of Table 4. Contrary to the results

of Table 4, the child seems to spend much more time when the parent is

receiving 'Meals—on—Wheels' (pwh).

     Surprisingly, and in contradiction to earlier results, Table 6 shows that

the time spent by children declines, and the amount of leisure consumed
                                     —24—


increases, with increasing degree of disability (padi) of the parent. Another

surprising and puzzling result is that children with a mother or father—in—law

with poor health make large time transfers to the parent.

     The results obtained by perturbing values of child and parent ages,

child's non—labor income, child's wage rate, parent's income, and child and

parent wealth variables are all consistent with those of Table 4. The

negative effect of time spent by siblings on the time spent by the child is

not consistent with the result in Table 4. However, it is the "built in"

prediction of the structural specification which assumes that siblings play

non—cooperative Nash.



IV. Conclusion

     The data reveal some clear patterns of time transfers from children to

their elderly parents. Children appear to use institutions and home care as a

substitute for their own provision of time. Parents who reside in nursing

homes or are enrolled in home care programs receive, ceteris paribus, less

than half the amount of time received by those in the community. The

provision of time is strongly correlated with the age of the elderly parent;

other things equal, the old old receive over twice the time of the young old.

     The sex, age, and health status of children are additional important

determinants of time provided to the elderly. Male children and younger

children spend relatively little time with their parents. Children with poor

health spend almost no time with their parents. If the spouse of the child is

in poor health, the child also gives very little time, at least according to

the structural model's results.

    Other things equal, those elderly who self—report their health to be

'poor' appear to receive over twice the amount of time received by elderly
                                        —25—


with better self—reports of health. Surprisingly, the degree of elderly

disability does not appear to affect the amount of time provided to those

elderly not living with their children, although it is a significant

determinant in the larger sample that includes elderly living with their

children.

     The Tobit results for the entire sample of children, including those

living with their elderly parents, indicate that more time is provided by

single children and more time is received by single elderly, at least those

who are widowed. In the structural model the effects of the child's and

parent's marital status on time provided to the elderly are less clear, but

there is strong evidence that widowed children spend substantially more time

with their elderly parents.

     The structural model predicts that more time provided by siblings will

lead to substantially less time provided by the child in question. However,

this prediction is, to a large extent, simply the implication of the form of

the structural model we have adopted. In the less constrained Tobit

estimation there is no evidence that siblings free—ride on each others'

provision of time.

     Both the Tobit and the structural estimates indicate a small effect

associated with higher children's wage rates; children with higher wage rates

provide somewhat less time to their elderly parents than other children.      In

contrast to the modest effect of higher wage rates, the effect of larger

values of children's wealth is quite sizable. Wealthier children and children

with higher incomes appear to provide less time than poorer children, but the

standard errors around these effects are quite large.

     The standard errors on the effects of parent's wealth and income are also

sizable. One   might   summarize the findings here by saying that there is
                                          —26—


certainly no strong evidence thst richer psrents receive more time than poorer

parents; i.e. ,   the   paper provides little, if any, support for the Bernheim,

Schleiffer, and Summers (1986) view that richer parents, in effect, purchaae

more time from their children.

     To summarize, the results indicate that the main determinants of the

amount of time given to parents are demographic. Economic variables, such as

wage rate and income levels, appear to play a rather insignificant role in the

provision of time.

Note:
      a) The variables knly, sibtm, and wage are part of the structural
         specification and have therefore been omitted from x, the vector of
         characteristics.
     b) Work—time is endogenous and therefore cml and em2 have been omitted
         from vector x.
      c) This subsample has no observation with parent making a financial
         transfer to the child. Hence the variable phlpl was omitted from
         vector x.
     d) Asymptotic Standard Errors (S.E.) and t—Statistics are tabulated.

$2159 per year.

2. It was confirmed that the high positive and significant coefficient on the
mother—in—law health dummy was not due to outliers in the data.

3. There are 157 of observations in the wage regression. The R2 from the wage
regression is .61. The coefficients (standard errors) from this regression
