Confirmatory Bias in Health Decisions: Evidence from the MMR-Autism Controversy

                                         ABSTRACT

Since Wakefield et al. (1998), the public was exposed to mixed information surrounding the
claim that measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism. A persistent trend to delay the
vaccination during 1998­2011 in the US was driven by children of college-educated mothers,
suggesting that these mothers held biases against the vaccine influenced by the early unfounded
claim. Consistent with confirmatory bias, exposures to negative information about the vaccine
strengthened their biases more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. Positive
online information, however, had strong impacts on vaccination decisions, suggesting that online
dissemination of vaccine-safety information may help tackle the sticky misinformation.

18   Mass media health information, especially in the form of information campaigns which of-
19   tentimes convey a homogeneous message, has been documented to be successful in effecting
20   desirable changes in health behavior.1 Less is known about the effects, however, when the
21   media presents mixed or even conflicting health information to the public. A case in point is
22   the media coverage on the safety of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Psychologists
23   have documented in the laboratory that, when presented with ambiguous or mixed evidence,
24   people tend to select and interpret information in a way that confirms their existing posi-
25   tions, a tendency termed confirmatory bias (e.g., Oskamp, 1965; Darley and Gross, 1983). In
26   this paper, we utilize the controversy over the link between the MMR vaccine and autism as
27   a natural experiment to investigate how health decisions respond to mixed information and
28   whether there is evidence that they are affected by confirmatory bias.
29        The MMR-autism controversy was initiated by Wakefield et al. (1998). Based on a self-
30   selected sample of 12 children, the study claimed to have found a connection between the
31   measles virus and the inflammatory bowel disease found in autistic children. The connection
32   was somehow promoted as an evidence linking the MMR vaccine to the risk of developing
33   autism. A substantial body of subsequent studies based on more rigorous research protocols
34   and larger samples consistently reached an opposite conclusion (e.g., Taylor et al., 1999;
35   Madsen et al., 2002). In 2004, based on a systematic review of research studies, the Institute
36   of Medicine (IOM) issued its final report concluding that no convincing evidence exists for the
37   casual MMR-autism link.2 In the same year, Wakefield et al. (1998) was partially retracted,
38   followed by a complete retraction in 2010 in which the journal's editor noted that "it was
39   utterly clear, without any ambiguity at all, that the statements in the paper were utterly
40   false." While by 2004 the issue was beyond debate in the scientific community, the public was
41   still presented with conflicting messages, ranging from celebrities' anti-vaccination speeches
42   to emotional stories from parents of autistic children to assurances of vaccine safety from
43   authorities.

           Wakefield et al. (2010) surveyed evidence on the outcomes of mass media health campaigns and concluded
     that they could result in positive changes or prevent negative changes in health behavior. For example, they
     documented that campaigns aimed at reducing tobacco use and preventing cardiovascular diseases could
     produce measurable health benefits. See also Jacobsen and Jacobsen (2011) who documented the effectiveness
     of awareness campaigns in promoting earlier detection of diseases.

           The IOM was the predecessor of the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences,
     Engineering, and Medicine. At the request of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National
     Institutes of Health, the Immunization Safety Review Committee was formed by the IOM to examine the
     safety of vaccines. The committee issued in total eight reports. The first report on the MMR-vaccine link
     appeared in 2001. While ruling out the link at the population level, this first report recommended further
     research to investigate rare individual cases. The 2004 report reached the conclusion that the existing body
     of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal effect between the MMR vaccine and autism and that
     the potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism proposed so far are sheer theoretical.

45   19 and 35 months of age whose immunization records indicated delay in the MMR immuniza-
46   tion. The percentage, which represents our outcome variable, the MMR vaccine non-uptake
47   rate, increased after Wakefield et al. (1998) was published. It went back down as studies
48   disapproving the MMR-autism link were accumulating. Interestingly, the rate climbed back
49   up drastically after 2004, the year when the IOM issued its final report and when the public
50   began to receive increasingly more mixed information about the safety of the vaccine.
51       Prior studies using UK data indicated that more educated parents held stronger biases
52   against the vaccine. The increase in the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the UK in response
53   to Wakefield et al. (1998), from 1997 up to 2005, was found to be driven by children of more
54   educated parents (e.g., Wright and Polack, 2006; Anderberg et al., 2011). A contemporaneous
55   study by Chang (2018), which covered the period from 1995 to 2006, documented a similar
56   educational gap in the US. Using 1998 as the base year, we evaluate annual changes in the
57   MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US till 2011, dividing the sample by the college-education
58   status of the mother. As the starting point of our principal investigation, we find that the
59   educational gap in the US was persistent and became even wider after the periods covered
60   by these other studies. The finding suggests that the biases held by the more educated
61   US mothers against the vaccine did not subside--in fact strengthened--after consensus was
62   reached in the scientific community that the vaccine does not cause autism.
63      We estimate the differential time trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college-
64   educated group. Interpreting the differential trend as measuring the strength of the educated
65   mothers' biases, we investigate how exposures to information with different positions about
66   the safety of the vaccine influence the biases. Our identification strategy exploits state-year
67   variations in a set of active and passive exposures to broadly defined media information.
68   We measure active exposures by the search intensity indexes of related topics obtained from
69   Google Trends. For passive exposures, we manually review and classify relevant newspaper
70   coverage retrieved from LexisNexis Academic and collect reported incidences of autism and
71   MMR from the Office of Special Education Programs and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly

                                                                                2
72    Report. We classify all information exposures in our sample into positive, ones that encourage
73    immunization, and negative, ones that discourage immunization.
74        Our main finding is the substantial asymmetry in the responses to positive and negative
75    information about the MMR vaccine. A one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to neg-
76    ative information strengthened the biases of the college-educated mothers by more than 35%;
77    by contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to positive information attenu-
78    ated the biases by no more than 10%. The college-educated group responded more strongly to
79    information consistent with their biases against the vaccine (e.g., news reports of unexplained
80    increase in autism cases) than to information that is in opposition to the biases (e.g., reports
81    citing the conclusion reached by the IOM). The finding provides population-level evidence of
82    confirmatory bias at work in the rising trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US.3
83        Our study contributes to the literature on education gradients that are observed in a
84    variety of health outcomes (e.g., Currie and Moretti, 2003; Lleras-Muney, 2005; de Walque,
85    2007; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). The study that is closest to ours in this literature is
86    Chang (2018). We both documented an extended educational gap in the US in the responses
87    to the MMR-autism controversy, partially corroborating the previous UK findings.4 Chang
88    (2018) also studied the impacts of the media, focusing on newspapers, radio, and television.
89    She found that the educational gap increased with greater media attention to the controversy.
90    We differ in a number of ways. Some of the less crucial differences are the longer periods we
91    cover and our different media data, which include traditional newspaper coverage as well as
92    online searches. With online information becoming an indispensable source of information for
93    many people, our inclusion of this type of media provides a fuller picture of the information
94    that may influence vaccination decisions.
95        The primary difference between the two studies, however, lies in the different questions
96    addressed. While Chang (2018) did not distinguish between positive and negative media
97    coverage, our principal inquiry concerns the different impacts of information with alterna-
98    tive positions about the MMR vaccine. A common explanation for health-related education
99    gradients is that education allows more effective absorptions of medical information, which
100   are reflected in health behavior (Grossman, 1972). Our findings point to a downside associ-
101   ated with this better ability to absorb information: the initially absorbed information may
         3
            Using a randomized controlled trial, Nyhan et al. (2014) obtained a complementary finding in which they
      showed that the effectiveness of pro-vaccine messages may vary depending on parents' existing attitudes.
          4
            Covering the period 1993­2004, Wright and Polack (2006) found that the MMR non-uptake rate increased
      significantly in almost all areas of England since 2000, where the non-uptake rate increased more slowly in
      areas with higher proportion of population with lower education. Anderberg et al. (2011) covered the period
      1997­2005 and similarly documented an educational gradient since 1999. They, however, found that the UK
      educational gap vanished by the end of the period covered, whereas both Chang (2018) and our study found
      that in the US the gap persisted well into 2005 and beyond. A US study preceding our studies is Smith et al.
      (2008). They found a decline in MMR immunization in 1999 and 2000 and a limited influence of newspaper
      coverage of the controversy during that period of time.

102   hinder subsequent absorptions of more up-to-date and accurate information in the presence
103   of cognitive biases. Our finding on the asymmetric responses to information suggests that
104   the persistent decline in the MMR immunization of the more educated group, even after the
105   vaccine has been proved safe, may be a consequence of this effect. While Chang (2018) left
106   the educational gap as a puzzle and discuss possible explanations, we provide a theoretical
107   model and empirical evidence pointing to asymmetric responses to information, as would be
108   driven by confirmatory bias, as a plausible culprit.5
109       This brings us to another contribution of our study. While laboratory evidence documents
110   the existence of confirmatory bias, few studies have examined such biases in a real-world
111   setting. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the first naturally occurring evidence
112   consistent with the presence of confirmatory bias in health decisions.6
113       Our study also contributes a policy suggestion for what may be an effective channel to
114   counter the misinformation surrounding the MMR vaccine and for correct information to take
115   root. We find that among the different types of information considered online information
116   has the strongest impact on vaccination decisions, and this is true not only for negative
117   information but also for positive information. The finding suggests that online dissemination
118   of vaccine-safety information may be an effective way to tackle the adverse consequences of
119   the previously circulated misinformation that lingered under the documented biases.
120       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a more detailed account of the
121   MMR-autism controversy, bringing to view the prevalence of mixed information during the
122   period. Section 3 describes the data and the sample. Section 4 examines the differential trend
123   of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rates between children of college-educated and non-college-
124   educated mothers. The trend analysis establishes the biases held by the more educated group
125   against the vaccine. Section 5 analyzes, both theoretically and empirically, the asymmetric
126   responses to mixed information about the MMR vaccine. Section 6 concludes with discussion
         5
             Our findings should not, however, be interpreted as suggesting that education contributes or leads to
      confirmatory bias. Psychologists consider confirmatory bias as a fundamental trait of human reasoning, and
      cognitive psychological studies provide no clear evidence that education levels are associated with higher or
      lower degree of the bias (e.g., Griggs and Ransdell, 1986; Jackson and Griggs, 1988; Calikli and Bener, 2015).
      This common human bias may or may not manifest in observed decisions. Education, by potentially creating
      differential absorptions of information among the more and the less educated, provides a medium through
      which the bias can be registered in naturally occurring data, in a sense not too dissimilar to psychological
      studies using controlled laboratory tasks to detect the bias in experimental data. The interpretation of our
      findings in this regard should be limited to that the documented asymmetric responses to positive and negative
      information by the college-educated group relative to the non-college-educated group provide evidence that
      different education levels allow confirmatory bias to exert different influences on them.
           6
             Since we do not observe actual information exposures at the individual level, our empirical method
      has relied on the assumption of homogeneous information exposures within states. The results we obtain
      are therefore "intent-to-treat" estimates, and our finding supporting the presence of confirmatory bias in
      vaccination decisions is a population-level evidence. Given that individual data on information exposures are
      unlikely to be available short of a controlled environment, this is probably the farthest one can go for studies
      relying on naturally occurring data. Andrews et al. (2018) presented evidence on confirmatory bias in the
      Associated Press Top 25 College Football Poll in which expert pollsters are tasked with assessing team quality.

131   period 1998 to 2011. We classify an event according to the perspective that it conveys to
132   the public about the safety of the vaccine, whether it is positive (encouraging vaccination) or
133   negative (discouraging vaccination).



                                                                    5
134       The classified events in Table 1 reveal that mixed information was prevalent during the
135   controversy. Those who sent positive information to the public included health authorities,
136   mainstream scientists, and the Office of Special Masters of the US Court of Federal Claims,
137   commonly referred to as the "Vaccine Court."7 They all refuted the claim that childhood
138   vaccines cause autism, by either conducting new and reviewing existing research, publishing
139   books, or delivering ruling decisions [events (c), (d), (e), (k), (o), (r), (s), and (t)]. The
140   outbreaks of mumps and measles in 2006 and 2008 among unvaccinated persons (Omer et al.,
141   2009) also should have reminded the public of the importance of adhering to the childhood
142   vaccine schedule [events (h) and (n)]. In fact, these outbreaks caused health organizations to
143   actively advocate the benefits of the MMR vaccine.
144       Despite the assurance from the mainstream entities, ever since the publication and the
145   media coverage of Wakefield et al. (1998), the conception that the MMR vaccine and autism
146   are related took root among certain group of parents. Through articles and books, activists
147   and celebrities promoted their views or personal experiences that the vaccine-autism link was
148   real [events (f), (g), (i), (l), (p), and (q)]. The skepticism even fueled some conspiracy theory; a
149   2005 Rolling Stone article, which purported that health agencies colluded with pharmaceutical
150   companies to cover up the risk of vaccines, almost threw the government into a trust crisis.
151   The compensation made by the Vaccine Court for Hannah Poling, who suffered from a rare
152   pre-existing disease with resulting developmental disorders that were ruled as worsened by
153   vaccines, was perceived by some parents as tacit acknowledgement by the government that
154   vaccines cause autism [event (j)]. Perhaps because there were no readily available explanations
155   for the drastic increase in autism cases during the period, the purported link to the MMR
156   vaccine was appealing to many parents and received wide publicity (Dannetun et al., 2005).
157       To appreciate the scope of conflicting information prevailed during the controversy, it is
158   useful to review two other claims about the risks of childhood vaccines. One of the claims con-
159   cerns thimerosal, a preservative that has ceased to be used in childhood vaccines since 2001.8
160   It has been suggested that the mercury-based preservative is linked to autism. Although the
161   connection has been disputed by scientists (Stehr-Green et al., 2003; Verstraeten et al., 2003;
162   Price et al., 2010), and thimerosal was never used in the MMR vaccine, the MMR-autism
163   and the thimerosal-autism links were frequently referred to together. Some even mistakenly
164   reported that the MMR vaccine contains thimerosal.
165      The other claim concerns the immunization schedule. It has been suggested that the
166   commonly followed schedule, which administers a large number of vaccines early in a child's
         7
            The Vaccine Court administers the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault compensation
      program established under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, for persons allegedly injured
      by compulsory childhood vaccines. The court provides individuals with an alternative to the often costly and
      lengthy civil court proceedings.

167   life, overwhelms and weakens the child's immune system. This, however, was also disputed by
168   scientists (Offit et al., 2002). Since most information refers to the vaccine-autism link without
169   differentiating the different hypothesized causes, these claims, though not directly related to
170   the MMR vaccine, may also affect its non-uptake rate.



171   3       Data and Sample

172   We proceed to describe our data, which consist of immunization records and a set of self-
173   constructed measures of information exposures.


174   3.1     Immunization Records

175   Our outcome variable, the MMR non-uptake rate, is obtained from the immunization records
176   of the National Immunization Surveys (NIS). The NIS are a group of phone surveys used to
177   monitor vaccination coverage among children and teens in the US. Sponsored and conducted
178   annually by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the surveys
179   randomly select phone numbers and enroll one or more age-eligible child or teen from the
180   selected households. During the phone interviews, parents or guardians are asked a series of
181   questions regarding their children's vaccinations. Demographics data are also collected. With
182   the consent of parents, a questionnaire is further mailed to each child's vaccination provider(s)
183   to collect information regarding the child's vaccination history.
184       We obtain immunization records of children between 19 and 35 months of age.9 To ensure
185   reliability of the self-reported vaccination status, we restrict our sample to those with valid
186   provider information.10 In addition to the child's current vaccination status, the immuniza-
187   tion records contain the following individual characteristics that we use in our analysis: the
188   demographics of the child and the mother at the time of the survey, the socioeconomic status
189   of the household, the type of the child's health care facility, and a state identifier.
190       The sample covers the period 1988 to 2011, with observations of 271,487 children. Table 2
191   presents the summary statistics of the whole sample and of the sub-samples of children with
192   college-educated and non-college-educated mothers. Children of college-educated mothers
193   have a lower average MMR non-uptake rate.11 The group is also more likely to be Caucasians,
          9
            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children to receive two doses of MMR
      vaccine, the first between 12 and 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years of age. We allow for
      temporary delays by using 19 months as the cutoff; children who meant to be on the immunization schedule
      would have received the first dose of the vaccine by the time they reached 19 months of age.
         10
            The NIS began to include cell phone numbers in their surveys enrollments in 2011. For consistency with
      other years, we restrict our 2011 sample to landline data.
         11
            Our focus on mothers' education is shaped by data availability, in which the immunization records contain
      only the education level of the mothers. Nevertheless, with mothers typically playing a major role in child-

195   3.2     Information Exposures

196   Using the state identifiers in the immunization records, we link the children in our sample
197   to a set of state-level measures of information exposures. These self-constructed measures,
      caregiving, this data limitation does not pose a strong restriction for our purpose.


                                                                8
198   which quantify the intensity of exposures to immunization-related information in each state
199   and year, include 1) the prevalence rates of relevant diseases, 2) the counts of relevant coverage
200   in local newspapers, and 3) the intensities of relevant online searches. We classify information
201   exposures into positive and negative: the former refer to those that would encourage vacci-
202   nations, potentially lowering the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate; the latter are expected to
203   have the opposite effect. We also distinguish between passive and active exposures. Disease
204   prevalence and newspaper coverage are considered passive exposures, while online searches
205   represent active exposures.
206       We describe in details the constructions of each of these variables, the summary statistics
207   of which are reported in Table 3. Our identification strategy exploits the variations in these
208   variables over time in each state to assess their impacts on the MMR vaccine non-uptake
209   rate. The underlying presumption is that the vaccination decisions of mothers in years with
210   more frequent onsets of the diseases, more relevant newspaper coverage, and/or more intense
211   online searches of related topics are more strongly affected. Table A.1 in the Appendix reports
212   the between- and within-state variations in each variable. There are considerable variations
213   within states over time, which serve our identification well.
214   Prevalence Rates of Relevant Diseases. We use autism and the three diseases pre-
215   ventable by the MMR vaccine as the relevant diseases for constructing measure of one set
216   of passive information exposures. We obtain data on autism from the Office of Special Edu-
217   cation Programs, which maintains state counts of children with 13 types of disabilities who
218   receive free public education under the Individual with Disability Education Act. The data
219   on measles, mumps, and rubella are obtained from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Re-
220   ports, which are compiled based on reports by state and territorial health departments to
221   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of the National Notifiable Diseases
222   Surveillance System.
223       For each state-year, we calculate the rate of autism out of the 13 disability counts to capture
224   the prevalence of the disease. We expect that a higher prevalence of autism contributes to a
225   stronger concern over the MMR vaccine; it is considered a negative passive exposure. For the
226   prevalence of MMR, we calculate the rate of the three diseases relative to the number of state
227   residents in each state-year. Philipson (1996) documented that a higher prevalence of measles
228   induced a higher demand for measles vaccine. We similarly expect that a higher prevalence
229   of the three diseases would result in a lower MMR vaccine non-uptake rate; the prevalence of
230   MMR is considered a positive passive exposure.
231   Newspaper Coverage. We search for and identify relevant newspaper coverage in the
232   LexisNexis Academic database, which contains records of 295 US newspapers and was used
233   in previous studies on media coverage of vaccines (e.g., Smith et al., 2008; Clarke, 2008).
234   We search for news articles from 1998 to 2011 that contain the following five sets of key-

     at the state-year level. The frequencies of autism are counts of the disability normalized by total counts of 13 types of disabilities at the state-year level. For
     newspaper coverage, the frequencies are counts of news of particular types (the four types of coverage are not mutually exclusive) normalized by total counts
     of identified news at the state-year level. For online searches, the statistics are search indices obtained from Google Trends for each state-year, which range
     from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating greater search volumes. The index for "measles," "mumps," and "rubella" is a summary index averaged across
     the indices obtained separately for the three diseases. Standard deviations (SD) are in parentheses.

         Figure 2: Newspaper Coverage on MMR-Autism and Vaccine-Autism Links, 1998­2011


235   words: 1)"MMR" and "autism"; 2) "vaccine" and "autism"; 3) "measles" and "autism"; 4)
236   "thimerosal" and "autism"; and 5) "mercury" and "autism." We manually review each article
237   to ensure that it covers the MMR-autism link or a more general vaccine-autism link. We
238   screen out articles that focus solely on the link between autism and a specific vaccine other
239   than the MMR (e.g., the flu and the Hib vaccine). Since these excluded articles are at best
240   indirectly related to the MMR vaccine, they presumably have little impact on the non-uptake
241   rate of the MMR vaccine. A total of 1,232 counts of news articles are identified as a result.
242       Figure 2 presents the annual counts of identified coverage on the MMR-autism and vaccine-
243   autism links.12 Two patterns are apparent from the figure. First, most coverage on the MMR-
244   autism link also covers the general vaccine-autism link. Second, although most coverage on
245   the vaccine-autism link does not cover the MMR-autism link, there is an increasing trend that
246   it does. It is plausible that coverage on the other hypothesized risks of childhood vaccines--
247   the thimerosal preservative and the intense immunization schedule--may affect the MMR
248   vaccine non-uptake rate as well.13 This observation justifies the inclusion of all 1,232 counts
249   of coverage, some of which are obtained with keywords such as thimerosal and mercury, in
250   evaluating the impacts of newspaper coverage on the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate.
251       We use four attributes to characterize the contents of the identified newspaper coverage.
252   For each coverage, we determine whether it has one or more of the following attributes and
253   assign count to the applicable attribute(s): 1) an overarching position supporting immuniza-
254   tion; 2) citing health authorities and/or scientific evidence to support immunization; 3) citing
255   anecdotal evidence against immunization; and 4) reporting increasing cases of autism and/or
256   describing hardship in taking care of an autistic child. We aggregate the attribute counts by
        12
            A news coverage is considered to be on the MMR-autism link if it mentions the MMR vaccine or the
      study by Wakefield et al. (1998). If it covers other childhood vaccines, with or without mentioning the MMR
      vaccine, it is considered to be on the vaccine-autism link.
         13
            The spillover may also work in the opposite direction, in which the MMR-autism controversy may affect
      the non-uptake rates of other childhood vaccines. As will be shown below, we find evidence for this direction
      of spillover. Chang (2018) also obtained a parallel finding.



                                                                                            11
257   the release year of the news and the location of the news outlet.14 We then construct four
258   variables by calculating the percentage of each of the four attributes in each state-year. The
259   geographical and time variations in the variables are exploited for identification. We consider
260   the percentages of news with attributes 1) and 2) as positive passive exposures and those with
261   attributes 3) and 4) as negative passive exposures.
262   Online Searches. We use the search indices from Google Trends to capture the intensity
263   of online searches of immunization-related information. Launched in 2004, Google Trends
264   compiles an index for a term after its search volume reaches a certain threshold. The qualified
265   search volumes, which exclude repeated queries from the same user in close temporal proximity,
266   are normalized by the total searches on all topics of the region and time that the data points
267   lie. The index ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher value indicating more intensive searches.
268      For each state-year, we obtain the available indices for the following terms or phrases:
269   "autism," "measles," "mumps," "rubella," "MMR autism controversy," and "vaccine and
270   autism."15 For missing values prior to 2004 or due to low search volumes, we use indices
271   predicted based on time-varying state characteristics.16 The indices for "measles," "mumps,"
272   and "rubella" are averaged to create a summary index for the diseases that the MMR vaccine
273   seeks to prevent.17 Online searches for the three infectious diseases are considered as positive
         14
             While some national newspapers, such as The New York Times, have nationwide readership, the reader-
      ship may vary across states in a way that correlates with our outcome variable, the MMR non-uptake rate. In
      our main analysis, we therefore assign geographic areas to the news articles based on the immediate locations
      of the news outlets, counting, e.g., articles from The New York Times for New York only. We supplement
      this by performing robustness checks, excluding articles from the top national news outlets, which potentially
      offers a cleaner state-level variation in news exposures.
          15
             "MMR autism controversy" is a rather specific phrase. The phrase in this exact form may not be searched
      as often as other relevant terms. Accordingly, unlike the other terms, for "MMR autism controversy" we obtain
      the index for the search topic instead of the search term. Search topics from Google Trends include all search
      terms that are related to the topic. In our analysis below, we also perform robustness check by excluding
      "MMR autism controversy" from the construction of measures of online information exposures.
          16
             We first estimate a linear regression model with the available data in and after 2004, regressing the search
      indices on a wide range of time-varying state characteristics. We then use the estimated coefficients to predict
      the values of the search indices prior to 2004 based on the state characteristics in those earlier years. The
      state characteristics (data sources) include proportions of uninsured children under 18 among all uninsured
      people (Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement), percentages of immigrants
      among state residents (Yearbook of Immigration Statistics), percentages of households with internet access
      (Current Population Reports on Computer and Internet Use in the United States), percentages of high school
      graduates (Current Population Reports on Educational Attainment in the United States), and levels of GDP
      (US Bureau of Economic Analysis). Since the extent of information seeking is likely to be affected by news
      coverage (Niederdeppe et al., 2008), the state characteristics also include passive information exposures to
      capture the search interests of each keyword. The passive exposures that are included are counts of newspaper
      articles on the MMR-autism and the vaccine-autism links, autism prevalence rates, and reported cases of
      measles, mumps, and rubella at the state and year levels. We also make allowance for flexible time effects,
      including a linear, quadratic, and cubic time trends in the estimation. For the years with available data, the
      predicted indices are highly correlated with the actual data, which suggests that the imputed values provide
      reliable substitutes for the missing data. The correlations range from 0.5163 to 0.8146, with a mean value of
      0.6817. In our analysis below, we also perform robustness check by omitting altogether the data before 2004.
          17
             The search volume for "measles" is substantially higher than those for "mumps" and "rubella" during
      the period covered. This is perhaps not surprising given that the MMR-autism controversy was initiated on



                                                              12
274   active exposures, while those for "autism," "MMR autism controversy," and " vaccine and
275   autism" represent negative active exposures.



276   4     Biases of College-Educated Mothers

277   As the first step of our analysis, we demonstrate that, relative to non-college-educated mothers,
278   the college-educated held biases against the MMR vaccine. We divide our sampled children
279   into two groups according to whether the child's mother is college educated (with a bachelor
280   degree or above) or not and estimate the following equation separately for each group:

                                        yist    Xist   st   s   t   ist,                                       (1)

281   where the outcome of interest, yist , is an indicator of delayed MMR immunization of child i
282   living in state s in year t, Xist is a vector of individual characteristics, st is a vector of time-
283   varying state characteristics, s is the state fixed effects capturing time-invariant heterogeneity
284   across states, t is the year fixed effects, and ist is the idiosyncratic error term.
285       The year fixed effects, t , are the key variable of interest. They represent the annual
286   changes in the estimated MMR vaccine non-uptake rates relative to those in 1998. The vector
287   of individual characteristics, Xist , the summary statistics of which are reported in Table 2,
288   includes the child's gender, first-born status, age, race, and medical facility type (private,
289   public, or mixed). It also includes the mother's martial status and age at the time of the
290   survey, family income, and an indicator if the child has relocated from a different state.18 The
291   vector of time-varying state characteristics, st , which is also used in estimating the missing
292   values of the Google Trends indices, includes proportions of uninsured children under 18,
293   percentages of immigrants, and state population.
294       Figure 3(a) plots the estimated coefficients of the year fixed effects for the two groups of
295   children. Figure 3(b) plots the group-differences in those coefficients. The differences indicate
296   a widening education gradient over time. The MMR vaccine non-uptake rates of both groups
297   increased after the publication of Wakefield et al. (1998). While these initial increases were
298   brief, lasting till 2001, the increase was more substantial for the college-educated group. By
299   contrast, in the following years in which the non-uptake rates of both groups declined, a more
300   substantial decrease was observed for the non-college-educated group.
301       Interestingly, the subsequent assurance of vaccine safety by the medical community in
      the connection between the measles virus and autism. While our main analysis uses a summary index covering
      the three terms, we perform robustness check by excluding "mumps" and "rubella" from the construction of
      measures of online information exposures.
         18
            Since dummy variables for mother and child age categories at the time of the survey are included in the
      regressions, the mother's age at child's birth is implicitly accounted for.

               Figure 3: Annual Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates Relative to 1998


302   2004 was met with an unfavorable response: the non-uptake rates climbed back up again in
303   2005. While the non-college-educated group showed no distinctly clear trend afterwards, the
304   upward trend perpetuated for the college-educated group. The drastic increases for this group
305   after 2006, which was not covered by Chang (2018), further deepened the difference between
306   the two education groups. The college-educated group contributed to most of the post-2004
307   increases in the overall MMR vaccine non-uptake rate as shown in Figure 1.
308      The differences in the annual changes of the non-uptake rates between the two groups
309   suggest that, relative to the non-college-educated, the college-educated mothers held biases
310   against the MMR vaccine. To evaluate the magnitude of the biases, we estimate the following
311   equation using the full sample:

        yist    rcollege ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998qs    pcollege ¢ post2004q   Xist   st   s   t   ist.                                                                              (2)

312   Equation (2) extends on (1) by including two additional interaction terms, college¢lnpt¡1998q
313   and college ¢ post2004 , where college is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the child's
314   mother is college-educated and post2004 is another dummy variable taking the value of one for
315   years after 2004.

                                                                                                                   14

          linear year effects. Regions and divisions are assigned based on the common practice of the Census. Standard errors

316       The term college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q is the key variable of interest in equation (2). It is the
317   differential time trend of the non-uptake rate of the college-educated group, in which a log time
318   trend is adopted to reflect the decreasing rate at which the differences between the two groups
319   increased over time, as is shown in Figure 3(b).19 We use this differential trend to capture the
320   biases of the college-educated group formed since 1998; its estimated coefficient is interpreted
321   as the strength of the biases. The other interaction term, college ¢ post2004 , identifies any
322   deviation from the differential trends following the release of conclusive information in 2004
323   assuring the safety of the MMR vaccine.
324       Table 4 reports the estimated coefficients of the two interaction terms under four different
325   specifications of area-specific year effects.20 The positive and significant coefficients of the time
326   trend interaction, college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q, suggest that the strength of the biases of the college-
327   educated mothers increased over time: relative to the non-college-educated, these mothers
328   were on average more and more reluctant over time to subject their children to the MMR
329   vaccine. This finding, which is robust to the different area-specific year effects, corroborates
330   the rudimentary analysis based on Figure 3 above. The coefficients of college ¢ post2004 are, on
331   the contrary, small and insignificant: the assurance of vaccine safety by the IOM, the partial
332   retraction of Wakefield et al. (1998), and the other events happened in or after 2004, did not
333   result in any meaningful deviation from the increasing trend of the MMR non-uptake rate of
334   the college-educated group.
335      We also estimate equation (2) using the non-uptake rates of other childhood vaccines and
336   obtain similar findings for hepatitis and pertussis immunizations. The result, which is reported
337   in Table A.2 in the Appendix, suggests a spillover effect of the MMR vaccine controversy to

      which are robust to alternative specifications such as linear or quadratic time trend.

339   5        Asymmetric Responses to Mixed Information

340   The differential trend of the MMR non-uptake rate of the college-educated group not only did
341   not subside but in fact strengthened after the release of conclusive evidence in 2004 proving the
342   safety of the vaccine. This raises the question of why such biases could sustain in the presence
343   of information that is at odds with the biases. It is conceivable that mothers with different
344   education levels were exposed to different information. However, meaningful responses were
345   observed from both groups in 2004, suggesting that differential availability of information is
346   unlikely to be the major explanation for the perpetuating differential trend.
347       An alternative explanation would be that the two groups of mothers responded to in-
348   formation differently. Psychologists have long documented people's tendency to interpret
349   information in ways that are partial to their existing beliefs. A consequence of this confirma-
350   tory bias is that those who are susceptible to it respond to new information differently from
351   those who are immune or less susceptible, and how the responses are different depends on the
352   orientation of the information, whether it is in line or at odds with existing beliefs.21 In this
353   section, we investigate how the documented differential trend of the MMR non-uptake rate
354   interacts with different information about vaccine safety.
355       In Section 5.1, we utilize a stylized model of vaccination decisions to articulate the linkage
356   between bias in information interpretation and asymmetric responses to positive and negative
357   information. In Section 5.2, we examine empirically how college-educated mothers' vaccination
358   decisions responded to positive and negative information asymmetrically in a way that is
359   consistent with the implications of confirmatory bias. Having established the presence of
360   these asymmetric responses to information, we further investigate from a policy vantage which
361   type of information exposures has better potential to counter the adverse consequences of
362   misinformation. Section 5.3 reports results from various robustness checks.


363   5.1      A Stylized Model of Vaccination Decisions

364   We model the initial uncertainty about the safety of the MMR vaccine by two equally likely
365   states of the world, S , which represents that the vaccine is safe, and H , which represents that
366   it is harmful. Parents make vaccination decisions for their child, fully internalizing the child's
367   interests in deciding whether to obtain the vaccine, y , or not, n. For expositional convenience,
368   we assume that there is only one child in each household and hereafter refer to "parent" and
          21
           Nickerson (1998) provides an informative review of this arguably most common bias in human reasoning
      and its manifestations in a variety of individual and social phenomena.

369   "household" interchangeably.22
370       A child receives immunization benefit, z , from taking the vaccine regardless of whether it
371   is safe or harmful. On the other hand, taking the vaccine imposes a health cost, a, if and
372   only if it is harmful. The utility from taking the vaccine is therefore upS, y q  z if it is safe
373   and upH, y q  z ¡ a if it is harmful. A child who is not vaccinated does not receive the
374   immunization benefit and also is not exposed to any health risk. The utility from not taking
375   the vaccine is therefore zero, i.e., upS, nq  upH, nq  0. We assume that a ¥ z ¥ 0, which
376   means that the immunization benefit does not justify taking the vaccine if it turns out to be
377   harmful. Health benefit and cost of vaccinations typically depend on a number of individual
378   factors such as living conditions and the child's intrinsic proneness to diseases. We further
379   assume that z and a, while satisfying the parameter restriction above, are heterogeneous across
380
                                                                             z
      households. Each household is identified by its benefit-to-cost ratio, a  r0, 1s.23
381       Households receive information about the safety of the vaccine, modeled as noisy infor-
382   mative signals about the state. To capture the historical development of the MMR-autism
383   controversy, marked by the publication of Wakefield et al. (1998) and the subsequent studies
384   drawing opposite conclusion, we assume that there are two instances of signal transmission.
385   The two signals partition the time frame of our analysis into three periods: before the first
386   signal (t  0), in-between the two signals (t  1), and after the second signal (t  2).
387       We consider two groups of households, a biased (b) and an unbiased (u) groups. In each of
388   t  0, 1, 2, a unit mass of each group of households makes vaccination decisions in that period
389   based on all previously and currently available information. We assume that the households
390
                                                                 z
      in each group, represented by their benefit-to-cost ratio, a , are uniformly distributed on r0, 1s.
391      Each of the two signals, which is independently distributed, has binary realizations, s and
392   h, with distribution Prps|S q  Prph|H q  p 1  2
                                                      , 1q. Realized signal s is interpreted as a positive
393   news and realized signal h a negative news regarding the safety of the vaccine.24 Misper-
394   ception of signal informativeness lies at the core of our model, which generates asymmetric
395   responses to positive and negative news as a Bayesian outcome. The unbiased parents always
396   objectively perceive that Prps|S q  Prph|H q  p  p 1      2
                                                                  , 1q. For the biased parents, there are
397   three possibilities: 1) if their existing beliefs are that S and H are equally likely, they are
398   objective like the unbiased parents, 2) if their existing beliefs are that S is more likely, they
         22
            The one-child assumption is innocuous. It is very likely that a household will have the same vaccination
      decisions for all its children, and the parent's altruistic preferences can then be defined over the average of the
      children's welfare.
         23
            We use the weak inequality a ¥ z ¥ 0 instead of the strict inequality a ¡ z ¡ 0 for the parameter
      restriction out of technical consideration. It allows us to have the closed unit interval as the domain for the
      benefit-to-cost ratio.
         24
            If we consider, e.g., the publication of Wakefield et al. (1998) and its subsequent retraction as the two
      signals, they are clearly not independent. Given that our objective is not on modeling the information sources
      but the responses to information, assuming the independence provides us with a parsimonious environment
      to focus on the issue of interests.


                                                              17
399   misperceive that the signal is more informative than it objectively is when signal s is received,
400   i.e., Prps|S q  Prph|H q  pI ¡ p, and less informative than it objectively is when h is re-
401   ceived, i.e., Prps|S q  Prph|H q  pP   p, and 3) if their existing beliefs are that H is more
402   likely, the opposite holds where they misperceive that Prps|S q  Prph|H q  pI ¡ p when h
403   is received and that Prps|S q  Prph|H q  pP   p when s is received. The biased parents'
404   misperception inflates or deflates the informativeness of the signals when their existing beliefs
405   assign non-uniform probabilities to the two states.25
406       Parents choose y if and only if the expected utility from choosing y is no less than that
407   from choosing n, and this reduces to the condition that the benefit-to-cost ratio is no less
408   than the probability assessment that the vaccine is harmful. In period t  0, this condition
409
                                                z
      for taking the vaccine under the prior is a ¥1
                                                   2
                                                     . Defining the proportion of parents in a group
410   who choose n as the group's vaccine non-uptake rate, N , we obtain the following baseline case
411   against which the impacts of the signals are evaluated:

412   Observation 1. In period t  0, the vaccine non-uptake rate of the biased group, Nb0 , and
                                   0               1 26
413   that of the unbiased group, Nu , coincide at 2 .

414       Upon receiving a signal, parents update their beliefs. The publication of Wakefield et al.
415   (1998) is tantamount to the realization of an h signal in t  1. Parents making decisions in
416   this period update beliefs from the uniform prior to PrpH |hq  p. The threshold for choosing
417   y becomes a z
                    ¥ p. Given that those households with a z
                                                                p choose n, we obtain the following
418   comparison:

419   Observation 2. After exposure to a signal h indicating that the vaccine is harmful, the vaccine
420   non-update rates of both biased and unbiased groups increase from N0   b
                                                                                 N0u  1   2
                                                                                            in period

422       In the empirical estimations, we interpret the size of the differential trend of the vaccine
423   non-uptake rate as the strength of the college-educated group's biases against the vaccine.
424   The model counterpart of this is a difference-in-difference, Dt  pNtb ¡ Ntb¡1 q ¡ pNtu ¡ Ntu¡1 q,
425   which we use to evaluate the impact of a signal on the biased group relative to that on the
426   unbiased group. Given that N0  b
                                        N0u  1  2
                                                  and N1b

427   The initial negative news in period t  1 has the same impact on the biased group as on
428   the unbiased group, because the biased parents making decisions in this period perceive the
429   informativeness of the h signal as objectively as the unbiased parents. This is no longer the
430   case, however, in period t  2. The biased parents making decisions in this last period of the
        25
            We use this rather ad hoc yet convenient approach to model the effect of confirmatory bias. See Rabin
      and Schrag (1999) for the pioneering theoretical work on confirmatory bias in economics.
         26
            An non-uptake rate of 50% is certainly not an accurate reflection of reality. Our focus, however, is on
      the qualitative changes in the non-uptake rates in response to new information, not their absolute levels.


                                                           18
431   model, having been exposed to all previously available information, hold non-uniform beliefs
432   about the two states, and their misperception kicks in.
          During the subsequent stage of the MMR-autism controversy, parents were exposed to
      both positive and negative information about the vaccine. For the signal in period t  2, we
      accordingly consider both s and h and examine their impacts separately.27 Consider first the
      case where the second signal is s. Having been exposed to the previous h signal, the parents'
      existing beliefs are that the vaccine is more likely to be harmful than safe. When receiving
      the second s signal, the biased group discounts the signal informativeness and updates beliefs
      according to
                                                         pp1 ¡ pP q
                                   PrpH |h, s; bq 
                                                   pp1 ¡ pP q   p1 ¡ pqpP
                                                                          .

      On the other hand, with one h and one s signals objectively perceived, the unbiased group's
      updated beliefs in period t  2 coincide with the uniform prior:

                                                              pp1 ¡ pq
                                     PrpH |h, s; uq                                 1
                                                         pp1 ¡ pq   p1 ¡ pqp
                                                                                      .
                                                                                    2

      Consider next the case where the second signal is h. The biased parents inflate the informa-
      tiveness of the signal. The updated beliefs of the two groups of parents are, respectively,

                                                                    ppI

433       Parents in period t  2 choose y if and only if a  z

440   and D2 ph, sq ¡ 0, which give us the following main result of our theoretical analysis:

441   Proposition 1. Under the misperception of signal informativeness by the biased parents in
442   period t  2, exposure to h signal raises the vaccine non-uptake rate of the biased group more
443   than that of the unbiased group, while exposure to s signal lowers the non-uptake rate of the
444   biased group less than that of the unbiased group.
         27
            One can consider a model with three or more signals, evaluating, e.g., the effect of a third h signal after
      a first h signal and a second s signal. To keep the analysis simple while bringing out the gist of the matter,
      we separately evaluate the effects of a second s and a second h signals.

                                                             19
445       Since the impact of the h signal on the vaccine non-uptake rate is an upward impact,
446   D2 ph, hq ¡ 0 means that it raises the non-uptake rate of the biased group more than that
447   of the unbiased group. On the other hand, since the impact of the s signal is a downward
448   impact, D2 ph, sq ¡ 0 means that the impact on the non-uptake rate of the biased group is
449   less negative, i.e., smaller in magnitude, relative to that of the unbiased group. There are
450   asymmetric responses to positive and negative news in that, relative to the responses of the
451   unbiased group, the biased group responds more strongly to the negative news than to the
452   positive news.


453   5.2     The Effects of Information Exposures

454   We proceed to the empirical analogue of the theoretical analysis, investigating the effects
455   of positive and negative information exposures described in Section 3.2. To promote the
456   comparability of different types of exposures measured in different ranges of values, we use
457   z -scores in our estimations.28 We average the z -scores of all exposures of the same classified
458   views to construct composite measures of positive and negative exposures for each state-year.
459   Figure 4 illustrates the geographical variations in these composite measures in 1998, 2004, and
460   2011, in which the states are colored according to the quartiles of the composite exposures in
461   the given year. The figure shows sufficient variations within states over time in the relative
462   levels of both positive and negative composite information exposures.
463       We augment equation (2) to include two additional interaction terms, college ¢ lnpt ¡
464   1998q ¢ pos inf ost and college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q ¢ neg inf ost , where pos inf ost and neg inf ost
465   are composite measures of positive and negative information exposures in state s and year t.
466   Recall that the estimated coefficient of college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q is interpreted as the strength
467   of the biases held by the college-educated group; the coefficients of the new interaction terms
468   therefore measure changes in the bias strength when the value of pos inf ost or neg inf ost
469   increases by one.
470       Table 5 reports the estimation results, which provide evidence of asymmetric responses
471   to the positive and negative information exposures. In all four specifications of area-specific
472   year effects, the coefficients of college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q ¢ neg inf ost are positive and significant,
473   whereas those of college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q¢ pos inf ost are negative, insignificant, and minimal in
474   magnitudes. In relation to the coefficients of college ¢ lnpt ¡ 1998q reported in Table 4, these
475   coefficients imply the following: a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to negative
476   information leads to at least 35.07% ( 0    .0047
                                                 0.0134

        28
           Dafny and Dranove (2008) use the same standardization to study the effects of different quality measures
      reported in HMO report cards on the enrollment choices of Medicare plans. The z -scores are variables with
      a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, obtained by dividing the difference between original variable
      value and the sample mean by the sample standard deviation.

480   college-educated group more than exposures to positive information attenuated them.
481       Confirmatory bias and the implied asymmetric responses to information contribute to
482   the persistence of misinformation. The effects of misinformation linger when people am-
483   plify incoming information that confirms their erroneous beliefs but discount information
484   that contradicts them. This could have alarming implications on many levels. In the case
485   of vaccinations, since immunizations create positive externality in building herd immunity,
486   withholding vaccinations is not simply a matter of personal choice but has immense societal
487   consequences.29
488       Given the scope of the potential impacts, a study on misinformation cannot be complete
489   without shedding some light on how to counter or mitigate the adverse consequences of mis-
490   information and the associated biases. We extend on the above findings and investigate from
491   a policy vantage which type of information exposures, traditional newspaper coverage or on-
492   line information, may provide a more effective channel to tackle the biases against the MMR
493   vaccine.30 We re-estimate equation (2) with separate sets of interaction terms for the positive
494   and negative exposures of each type of exposures considered.
495       Table 6 reports the estimation results. Online searches are found to have stronger impact
496   on the biases of college-educated mothers than does newspaper coverage. Importantly, both
497   positive and negative exposures of online searches have a significant effect, although the effect
498   of negative exposures remains dominant, about 2.29­2.45 times of that of positive exposures.
499   By contrast, for newspaper coverage, the effects of both positive and negative exposures are
500   insignificant and minimal in magnitude. The effect of the prevalence of measles, mumps, and
501   rubella as positive exposures and that of autism as negative exposure are both insignificant.
502       Echoing Smith et al. (2008), this additional finding indicates that traditional newspaper
503   coverage had limited impacts on immunization decisions. Negative coverage did not exacer-
504   bate the college-educated mothers' biases against the MMR vaccine, but neither did positive
505   coverage offer much help in reducing the biases. This is in contrast to online searches.31 While
506   negative online searches significantly strengthened the biases, our finding suggests that on-
507   line searches are a "double-edged sword": unlike the findings based on composite measures,
508   positive exposures to online searches alone did significantly attenuate the biases. The policy
        29
            Another contemporary issue that has been impacted by misinformation is global warming. Despite the
      confirmation by science that global warming is a real concern, some people including political elites still
      erroneously believe the otherwise (e.g., McCright and Dunlap, 2011). Any resulting delay in implementing
      mitigating actions could have adverse consequences not only at a societal level but also on a global scale.
         30
            Lewandowsky et al. (2012) review the cognitive factors that contribute to the stickiness of misinformation
      and recommend debiasing strategies based on cognitive psychological theory.
         31
            During the period covered in our study, newspaper readerships declined at an annual rate capped at 6%.
      The volumes of Google searches, on the other hand, increased quickly, though at a decreasing rate. In 2011,
      e.g., the growth rate was around 11%. Despite this contrast between online and traditional media exposures,
      our use of z -scores allows us to capture the relative levels of information exposures across states in a given
      year. Figures A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix present the geographical variations in the information exposures
      to newspaper coverage and online searches.

      area-specific year fixed effects: none, region-specific year effects, division-specific year effects, and state-specific log-linear year effects.
      Regions and divisions are assigned based on the usual practice of the Census. Standard errors clustered at the survey strata level
      are in parentheses. *** indicates significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level.




509   implication is that online dissemination of correct and up-to-date information about the MMR
510   vaccine, which public campaigns could target at, may be an effective avenue to counter the
511   adverse effects of the misinformation about the MMR-autism link.


512   5.3       Robustness Checks

513   We perform five sets of robustness checks. The two major ones concern the data on informa-
514   tion exposures. For the first set of robustness checks, we consider separately four alternative
515   constructions of measures of information exposures: 1) given that the search volume for
516   "measles" is substantially higher than "mumps" and "rubella," we exclude the search indices
517   for the latter two from the measure of positive active exposures; 2) since the specific phrase
518   "MMR autism controversy" has a relatively lower search volume, we exclude its search index

                                                                          23
519   from the measure of negative active exposures; 3) since national newspapers have readership
520   that spans across states, in an attempt to obtain a cleaner state-level variation in news ex-
521   posures, we exclude top four news outlets from our data on news coverage; and 4) we take
522   a further step to exclude the top ten news outlets. The estimation results under these alter-
523   native constructions are reported, respectively, in Columns (1), (2), (3), (4) of Table A.3 in
524   the Appendix. Our second robustness check concerns the missing data from Google Trends.
525   Since Google Trends was not launched until 2004, the data prior to 2004 are imputed based on
526   state characteristics. While the strong correlations between the imputed and the actual values
527   after 2004 suggest that the imputation should provide reliable substitutes for the missing data
528   before 2004, it is conceivable that some measurement errors are introduced. Table A.4 in the
529   Appendix reports estimation results from using only observations in 2004 and onwards. Our
530   main findings in Section 5.2 survive the above two sets of robustness checks.
531       We further examine the robustness of our findings with respect to three sample restric-
532   tions. First, to address the potential confound from exposures to information in a different
533   state, we exclude those who have relocated across states. Second, we restrict our full sample,
534   which includes children of all races, to non-Hispanic white and black children, thus excluding
535   Hispanic and Asian Americans. Mothers whose native language is not English may be less
536   likely to be exposed to the vaccine information we consider; to the extent that reading fluency
537   in English is correlated with education levels, our findings may be driven by variations in
538   information availability across the two groups of mothers rather than their different responses
539   to information. The sample restriction to non-Hispanic white and black children, whom we
540   consider to be the major English-speaking population in the sample, is an attempt to ad-
541   dress this potential confound. Finally, to focus more narrowly on the most relevant news, we
542   use articles that cover only the MMR-autism link to construct the measure of information
543   exposures for newspaper coverage. Our findings are robust to all three sample restrictions.32



544   6         Conclusion and Discussion

545   The study by Wakefield et al. (1998), which linked the measles virus to the inflammatory
546   bowel disease found in autistic children, initiated the infamous MMR-autism controversy and
547   fueled an ongoing anti-vaccine movement that continued through today. Consistent with the
548   findings from prior studies, we find that the persistent trend to delay the MMR immunization
549   since 1998 to 2011 in the US was driven by children of college-educated mothers. A differential
550   trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college-educated group relative to the non-
551   college-educated group was observed. More importantly, the differential trend perpetuated
552   even after scientific consensus had been reached that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.
          32
               The detailed estimation results from these three robustness checks are available upon requests.



                                                               24
553       We examine the interactions between this differential trend and exposures to information
554   about the safety of the MMR vaccine. The primary contribution of our study is the documen-
555   tation of an asymmetric response to positive and negative information. Interpreting the size of
556   the differential trend as the strength of the college-educated mothers' biases against the MMR
557   vaccine, we find that exposures to negative information about the vaccine strengthened their
558   biases more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. This finding provides
559   non-experimental evidence consistent with the implications of confirmatory bias documented
560   by psychologists. In the presence of such common bias in human reasoning, misinformation,
561   once planted, is hard to eradicate. On the policy front, we obtain further finding suggesting
562   that disseminating correct information online may present the best chance to counter the
563   sticky misinformation and erroneous beliefs about the MMR vaccine.
564       We conclude by discussing two potential issues in our empirical methods. Our policy
565   implication hinges on the finding that the isolated impacts of online information exposures,
566   both positive and negative, are significant. Yet it is plausible that simultaneity bias exists for
567   online searches, which results in an overestimation of the impacts. Parents who are uncertain
568   about the safety of the MMR vaccine may actively search for information online. As a result,
569   there may be a positive correlation between vaccination decisions and the intensity of online
570   searches, leading to the overestimation.
571       We formally test the endogeneity of positive and negative online exposures by using the
572   Hausman test to compare the estimates from an ordinary least squares (OLS) and an in-
573   strumental variable (IV) models. We use two plausible instrumental variables for the two
574   potentially endogenous variables of positive and negative online exposures. They are 1) the
575   percentage of households with internet access, and 2) the average time spent on computer for
576   leisure among individuals living in households with children under 18 years old.33 Both instru-
577   ments have a stronger relationship with developments of the internet industry and changes
578   in lifestyles rather than strengths of opinions against the MMR vaccine. Comparing the es-
579   timates from the OLS and the IV models using the Hausman test, we fail to reject the null
580   hypothesis that the positive and negative online information exposures are exogenous.34
581      In assessing the impacts of different types of information on the MMR vaccine non-uptake
582   rate, we categorize information in terms of its forms of transmission, whether it is through
583   traditional newspapers or the internet. It is equally valid to consider a taxonomy based on,
        33
            The first variable is obtained from the Current Population Reports on Educational Attainment, and the
      second variable is estimated using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Both variables are state-year level
      variables. The internet-access variables are also used in imputing the missing Google Trends indices for years
      prior to 2004, while the earliest year that the ATUS was available was 2003. Due to these restrictions, for this
      test of endogeneity we only consider observations in and after 2004.
         34
            The IV models are estimated using two-stage least squares estimators. In all four specifications of area-
      specific year effects that we adopt throughout the estimations in the paper, the power of the IV for both
      endogenous variables exceeds the conventional minimum of F  10, with a minimum value of 17.106 and a
      maximum value of 159.981. The p-values from the Hausman test range from 0.357 to 0.989.


                                                            25
584   e.g., the sources of information, whether news about vaccine safety comes officially from the
585   government or informally from social networks. To the extent that different sources of infor-
586   mation may be differentially associated with different media formats, our findings in terms
587   of the latter may in part be driven by responses to the former. Without pretending to of-
588   fer a complete answer to this potential confound, we nevertheless note that, for information
589   obtained through social networks, the vast development of social media platforms like Face-
590   book and Twitter has turned a substantial volume of social networking activities online. Our
591   measure of online information as a type of information may capture the information obtained
592   through social networks reasonably well, preserving the validity of our findings in spite of the
593   potential confound. Examining more generally the interactions between media and sources of
594   vaccine information on vaccination outcomes would be a natural step for future research.
