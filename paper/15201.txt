Anger and Regulation

NBER Working Paper No. 15201
July 2009
JEL No. D64,L4

                                              ABSTRACT

We propose a model where voters experience an emotional cost when they observe a firm that has
displayed insufficient concern for other people's welfare (altruism) in the process of making high profits.
Even with few truly altruistic firms, an equilibrium may emerge where all firms pretend to be kind
and refrain from charging "abusive" prices to their customers. Our main result is that, as competition
decreases, the set of parameters for which such pooling equilibria exist beomes smaller and firms are
more likely to anger consumers. Regulation can increase welfare, for example, through fines (even
if there are no changes in prices). We illustrate these gains in a monopoly setting, where regulation
affects welfare through 3 channels (i) a reduction in monopoly price leads to the production of units
that cost less than their value to consumers (standard channel); (ii) regulation calms down existing
consumers because a reduction in the profits of an "unkind" firm increases total welfare by reducing
consumer anger (anger channel); and (iii) individuals who were out of the market when they were
excessively angry in the unregulated market, decide to purchase once the firm is regulated, reducing
the standard distortions described in the first channel (mixed channel).

1       Introduction
Governments routinely regulate markets, particularly those where there is a tendency towards
little competition. One possible explanation is that such regulation improves e¢ ciency.
Indeed, economists have developed normative theories of regulation, explaining how social
welfare increases when such regulation adopts a particular form. For example, forcing a
monopoly to increase output might be desirable because in a monopoly equilibrium the cost
to the …rm of an extra unit is less than the value given to it by the consumer (see, Pigou,
1938, Baron and Myerson, 1982, La¤ont and Tirole, 1991, inter alia).
     Given how far the logic used in this explanation is from anything that voters voice
when they demand changes in regulation, it is useful to develop alternative theories of the
regulation of business.1 In particular, it would be valuable to develop a normative theory of
regulation that would have some connection with the rhetoric of regulation, or that at least
gives some weight to public opinion in the determination of regulation policy. Although
most existing models do not focus on such “populist dynamics”, they are central to our
paper, which emphasizes the role of emotions in the motivation of consumers (as distinct
from a material motive). Thus, we assume that a consumer’s experience and decisions
can be understood by studying total utility, constructed as the sum of a material payo¤
and an emotional payo¤. Psychologists and some economists have gathered evidence on
several emotions that are candidates to be part of the second term. One that appears to be
particularly relevant for the setting we seek to describe, whereby a monopoly might “abuse”
its market position and set “exploitation”prices, is consumer anger.
     There are several episodes where consumers appear to react with anger in the face of
price increases. The title of a recent article in a British newspaper describes one such
emotional reaction: “Fare increases of up to 15% anger rail passengers”.2 In some cases,
    1
      Actual regulation mentions fairness, but economists interpret its contents as preoccupied with direct
e¢ ciency gains and potential e¢ ciency gains from curtailing abuse of power. For example, the two key
articles on competition policy in the treaty establishing the Europen Community focus on anti-competitive
agreements and concerted practices (article 81) and on abuse of a dominant position (Article 82) often
mention “fairness” elements that are easier to intepret in our model than in a standard model concerned
only on e¢ ciency (e.g., article 82 prohibits abuse by “directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or
selling prices or other unfair trading conditions”). Several authors have argued economics has di¢ culties
in providing a comprehensive theory of regulation (descriptive or normative). For an interesting general
discussion making this point with emphasis on contract law, see Posner (2002), who argues that the failure
originates in the di¢ culties in de…ning the concept of transaction cost.
    2
      See, The Guardian, Tuesday, January 1, 2008. According to the article “passengers and rail user watch-
dogs reacted angrily yesterday to ‘outrageous’new year price increases which will see the cost of some train
tickets rise by almost 15%. The new prices were also described as “unjusti…ed and unfair”. It also reports
that one Gerry Doherty, leader of the TSSA (the union for people in transport and travel) described the
increases as “outrageous”.


                                                     2
such reactions appear to have led to violence. For example, riots and widespread anger
have been linked to price increases in Bolivia during January-April 2000, when the city of
Cochabamba witnessed a popular revolt after the newly privatized water company increased
the tari¤s. Protests included the occupation of the city’s main square on February 4 in an
incident that left 22 people wounded and 135 under arrest (See, Darocca Oller, 2004).3 In the
US, the era of the big trusts is frequently described as a period in history where consumers
experienced emotional reactions to business activities, leading to the rise of regulation.4
There are several other episodes where emotions are central in the process whereby some
form of regulation or punishment of business is put into place, including the 2008-9 subprime
crisis in the US, although economists typically dismiss them as populist episodes and often
involve indignation at actions that may be broader than price increases. The purpose of our
paper is to develop a model where we can understand the causes of these populist forces and
how regulation might help contain them.
    Psychologists have investigated several characteristics of angry emotional reactions, gath-
ering evidence capable of distinguishing anger from other negative emotions, such as sadness
or shame. For example, anger is correlated with the belief that redress is still possible and
that remedy requires (perhaps indirectly) the intervention of the self. It also indicates that
others (as opposed to the situation, or the self) were responsible for the negative event
(see, for example, Ellsworth and Smith, 1985, and Lazarus, 1991, as well as the review of
Lerner and Tiedens, 2006).5 An important …nding for our purposes is reported in Lerner
and Tiedens (2006), whereby anger makes people indiscriminately punitive (and optimistic
about their own chances of success). There is also some evidence that anger does not seem
to re‡ect only a …xed personality trait of left-leaning individuals (who are often angry with
no connection to the stimulus), as in some experiments people can be induced to feel angry
(and sometimes even provide what is the typical right wing answer). For example, Small
and Lerner (2005) found that individuals induced to feel anger choose to provide less public
assistance to welfare recipients than those induced to feel other emotions, while Bodenhausen
   3
        Conditions do not seem to have improved as a result. A report explains that “people of this high Andean
city were ecstatic when they won the “water war.” . . . .After days of protests and martial law, Bechtel - the
American multinational that had increased rates when it began running the waterworks - was forced out.
. . . Today, …ve years later, water is again as cheap as ever, and a group of community leaders runs the water
utility, Semapa. But half of Cochabamba’s 600,000 people remain without water, and those who do have
service have it only intermittently - for some, as little as two hours a day, for the fortunate, no more than
14.” See Forero (2005).

        It is remebered in these terms: the review of the book “The Muckrakers”, in Time Magazine on Friday,
December 21st, 1966 was titled “A Time for Anger”. Archives of Time Magazine, accessed October 28th

        Other negative emotions follow alternative appraisals: sadness (rather than anger) follows negative events
that are blamed on situational forces whereas shame follows personal responsibility.

et al (1994) found them to engage in more stereotyping. Less of this research has concerned
itself with emotional reactions following price increases, although Tyran and Engelmann
(2005) were able to generate experimental evidence on boycotts following increases in prices
in the lab.
    We study a model where an individual’s experience as a client of a monopolistic …rm
improves when the price paid falls and the pro…ts of those …rms perceived as unkind go
down.6 The …rst of these two terms –the material payo¤- is standard in economics, while
the second term –the emotional payo¤- captures the demand for fairness that has been
analyzed in several well-known models in economics such as Rabin (1993), Fehr and Schmidt
(1999), Falk and Fischbacher (2006), inter alia.7 In particular, we follow Levine (1998)
and Rotemberg (2008) and assume an individual’s kindness towards others depends on their
estimation of how kind others have been in relationships with them.8 This allows these
authors to have agents who are “spiteful”towards those that are perceived to have behaved
unkindly to the decision maker, a feature that plays a key role in our theory of regulation
of monopolists. Note that this specifcation naturally leads to a signaling game, since an
individuals’actions can reveal how altruistic they are. Thus, it does not require that there
be a a large fraction of truly altruistic …rms for the equilibrium to be heavily in‡uenced
by altruism. Finally, part of the attraction in applying these preferences to the demand for
regulation is that it may help explain both the amount of regulation, as well as some instances
of redistributive regulation (such as when …nes are applied by “populist”governments) and
of “ine¢ cient” regulation (i.e. types of regulation may not be optimal from a standard
economic e¢ ciency perspective).9
   6
      Anecdotal evidence suggests that anger often arises at the announcements of high pro…ts by …rms that are
under scrutiny. See, for example, “Railtrack pro…ts spark anger”, reported on BBCN ews online, Thursday,
November 4, 1999. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/504329.stm. Accessed Tuesday October 28th, 2008.
    7
      Jolls, Sunstein and Thaler (1998) provide an early discussion of how law and economics might incorporate
agents that have bounded rationality and bounded self-interest. See also the contributions in Sunstein (2000)
as well as the observations in Posner (1998).
    8
      Although there are di¤erences (Levine’s preferences are linear) in our context they lead to similar im-
plications. One reason is that, although in Rotemberg the individual is angry or not whereas in Levine
the “anger” is continuous, the tradeo¤s in Levine are linear, so the optimal amounts of regulation (or of
punishment) are corner solutions: the individual wants either no punishment or as large a punishment as
possible. Rotemberg (2008) explains how the “minimal altruism” preference relations he de…nes explain a
wide range of behavior in ultimatum and dictator games.
    9
      Another instance where anger may be the driver of regulation is the rise of political pressure on CEO pay
following the 2008-9 …nancial crisis. A report in the Financial Times explains “Gordon Brown, the prime
minister, has said he would use the government’s banking aid package to clamp down on compensation,
adding ‘the days of big bonuses are over’”. And then describes how the actions of the Financial Services
Authority re‡ected this heightened pressure. For example it states “The letter does not have the status of
mandatory guidance, but the FSA has said it would increase the regulatory capital requirements for banks



                                                      4
     We develop a model of price competition along the lines of Salop (1979), but where
consumers react with anger when they conclude that the …rm has shown low levels of altruism
towards them. Given the strength of consumer reactions to high prices by monopolistic
competitors, there is a signaling game where it often pays for …rms to act as if they were kind.
This leads to a set of pooling equilibria, where prices are relatively low and consumers are not
angry. The main result of the paper is that when competition decreases and the number of
…rms falls, the set of prices for which a pooling equilibrium can be sustained is smaller. That
is, as competition decreases, consumers are more likely to experience anger leading to higher
welfare losses. In this context, regulation might increase welfare through three di¤erent
channels. First, there is the standard channel whereby a reduction in monopoly price leads
to the production of units that cost less than their value to consumers. Second, regulation
calms down existing consumers: a reduction in the pro…ts of a …rm viewed as excessively
sel…sh increases total welfare by reducing consumer anger. Finally, there is a third (mixed)
channel arising because individuals who were out of the market when they were excessively
angry in the unregulated market, decide to purchase once the …rm is regulated, reducing the
standard distortions described in the …rst channel. Note that one of the most visible ways
that regulation a¤ects …rm pro…ts is by regulating prices, but the mechanism also allows …nes
(when their imposition is credible) to play a similar role. Our theory connects the public’s
appreciation of …rms with the extent of competition, noting that positive appraisals of big
monopolies would be harder to maintain. This connection is emphasized in the literature
on the history of public relations of large American corporations. For example, Marchand
(1998) states “The crisis of legitimacy that major American corporations began to face
in the 1890’s had everything to do with their size, with the startling disparities of scale.”
(Marchand, 1998, p. 3). Indeed, it is possible to argue that there is a parallel between our
paper’s focus on the concept of commercial legitimacy and the concept of State legitimacy
in political science.
     Closest to our paper are two studies of the determination of prices when consumers’
utility functions display psycholgically realistic features. The …rst is by Heidhues and K½oszegi
(2008), who study the role of competition when consumers are loss averse and discuss the
emergence of focal points and price rigidity. The second study is by Rotemberg (2005),
who assumes a similar set of preferences as we do (consumers get angry when …rm’s display
insu¢ cient levels of altruism), developing a new model with price rigidity and applies it to the
that do not su¢ ciently link pay with risk.”See F inancial T imes, Monday October 13, 2008. With respect to
the forms of regulation, we note that previous work has tried to explain variations over time. For example, the
growth in the size of the market plays a key role in the explanations for why private litigation is substituted
by ex-ante regulation during the progressive era in Glaeser and Shleifer (2003). Previous work has also tried
to clarify why the particular forms observed di¤er from what economists would expect: Rotemberg (2003)
is able to explain the choice of commercial policy (tari¤ vs quotas) using altruistic preferences.

analysis of monetary policy. Our model, which extends their analysis of realistic preferences
to the context of regulation, is related to theories of exploitation by big …rms. Marxist
theories emphasize how capitalist institutions (including private ownership of the means of
production and an accomplice State) lead workers/consumers to pay “surplus value” (see
Brewer, 1987, inter alia). In our theory, consumers have a simple approach to deciding
when such exploitation takes place (they measure …rm altruism), and are not alienated nor
passive (they get angry). The problem with monopoly in our model is that consumers cannot
go to other …rms when these misbehave, and because of this, …rms are more likely to do so.
    Interestingly, our approach to regulation and emotions is connected to capture theory.
The Chicago and Virginia schools argue that regulations are the product of interest group
activity (see, for example, Stigler, 1971, Peltzman, 1976, Buchanan, 1976, Djankov et al,
2002, inter alia). The basic idea is that regulations are correlated with pro…ts across indus-
tries and that this could re‡ect the interaction of groups in society, with di¤erent costs and
bene…ts of organizing to obtain favorable regulations. Indeed, noting that “the Civil Aero-
nautics Board has not allowed a single new trunk line to be launched since it was created in
1938”and other examples where the regulatory actions appear to bene…t …rms, Stigler (1971)
concludes that the most plausible explanation is …rm demand for protection and regulation.
Such demand for regulation on the part of …rms and other interest groups has occupied the
majority of positive theories of regulation. Whereas the public could in principle be treated
as an interest group, as in the generalizations of the theory (see, for example, Becker, 1983,
Baron, 1994, Grossman and Helpman, 1994, inter alia), the emphasis there is on material
payo¤s and the public typically ends up with a low in‡uence on the …nal outcome given the
well known problems of free riding in voting.10
    In section II, we introduce the basic model, while in Section III we characterize the
equilibrium in oligopoly. The main result is derived, showing that the set of pooling prices
is smaller when there are fewer …rms, so that anger is more likely as competition decreases.
In Section IV we study the welfare gains from regulation. Given that regulation has often
been discussed in situations of monopoly, we analyze the monoploy equilibrium and describe
3 channels through which regulation might increase consumer welfare. Section V, presents
a discussion, while Section VI concludes.
  10
    Rotemberg (2006) shows how altruistic preferences are helpful in explaining turnout by voters who
expect to be pivotal with very low probability. Note that Stigler himself refers to the public’s demand for
regulation, but it seems that he believed that it could not be modeled. When explaining the existence of
regulations that harm social welfare, he states “the second view is that the political process de…es rational
explanation: “politics” is an imponderable, a constantly and unpredictably shifting mixture of forces of the
most diverse nature, comprehending acts of great moral virtue (the emancipation of slaves) and of the most
vulgar venality (the congressman feathering his own nest)”. Our theory of regulation focuses on fairness
(and anger) and thus is capable of explaining the type of regulatory phenomena Stigler is concerned about.



                                                     6
2      The model
There are n consumers, each characterized by a parameter x interpreted, as in Salop (1979),
as either a “preferred variety”or as a “location parameter”. For each consumer, his location
is drawn from a uniform distribution on the circle of circumference 1. There are m evenly
distributed …rms along the circle (there are m …rms, but we use b = 1=m as the relevant
parameter).
      Firms are of one of two types, altruistic or sel…sh; the prior probability that a …rm is
altruistic is q. Firm i chooses a price pi ; and has a cost c; so when demand for its product
is Di ; its pro…ts are (pi c) Di : If the …rm is sel…sh, that is the …rm’s objective (its utility).
If the …rm is altruistic, its utility is pro…ts plus a term that depends on the utility of the
consumer. The altruistic …rm has a cost of if consumer utility is lower than a certain
threshold (this level is exogenous for this model, but in a richer model it could be derived
from learning, adaptation, history, etc). We call the threshold , and set it to be the utility
the consumer would obtain in a “fairly competitive” industry (see Proposition 4 and the
Appendix for two examples).
      Consumers want to buy (at most) one unit of the good, for which they would obtain a
gross surplus of s (gross of price and transport costs). If they have to travel a distance x;
and then pay a price of pi ; their net surplus is s tx pi (i.e. they have a transport cost
of t per unit of distance traveled). In addition the consumer derives c (bf ) ( + p c) from
consuming where p is the price he is paying to the …rm, c is the …rm’s marginal cost, and
    is the pro…t the …rm obtains from other customers. The individual’s altruism is denoted
                                                                             b
  c , which is assumed to depend on its estimate of the …rm’s altruism, f : The individual’s
altruism is assumed to be non-negative when he thinks he is interacting with a “kind”…rm,
which is a …rm that is altruistic towards consumers (i.e., experiences an increase in utility
when its customers are happier). And it is assumed to be negative when consumers conclude
that the …rm they are dealing with is “unkind”, which is assumed to mean a …rm that is not
altruistic. In what follows, c (bf ) will be either a …xed number > 0 or 0, depending on
whether the consumer has rejected that the …rm is altruistic, or not. These preferences have
been studied by Levine (1998) and Rotemberg (2008), who explain how they can account
for the experimental results of ultimatum and dictator games.11 The main feature of these
preferences for our purposes is that consumers can get angry, that this anger is triggered by
the behavior of the …rm, and that angry consumers dislike …rms making a pro…t (and he is
angrier when he contributes to those pro…ts).
      In what follows, and without loss of generality, we normalize t = 1 (so all other parameters
  11
    In the setting we discuss, Rotemberg and Levine’s preferences are observationally equivalent as the
“jumps”observed when Rotemberg’s agents reject the hypothesis that they face an agent that is not “mini-
mally altruistic” can also be observed when preferences are linear and pooling equilibria break up.


                                                   7
are just normalized by t). We also assume (without loss of generality) that the number of
consumers is n = 1:12 Also, we assume: s c + 1; which ensures that in a monopoly not all
consumers are served; and s c 3b       2
                                            0 for all b  1
                                                         2
                                                           ; or s c + 34 ; which ensures that in
an oligopoly, the market is covered (since otherwise an oligopoly behaves just like a group of
local monopolies). Finally, we assume that the proportion of altruistic …rms in the market is
such that based solely on this prior, the individual does not reject that the …rm he is facing
is altruistic. That is, if the individual is faced with a random …rm, and has no information
on which to update his prior, he doesn’t get angry at the …rm.


2.1     Equilibrium
We will analyze a signalling game, in which …rms choose a price which signals their type.
An equilibrium in this setting is a triplet [a (p; x; ) ; p ( ) ; (p)] where:

       a ( ) is an “acquisition” decision strategy (the same for all consumers; we are looking
       at symmetric equilibria) as a function of price, tastes x (or distance) and beliefs (of
       whether the …rm is altruistic or not) into f0; 1g ; where a = 1 means “buy”and a = 0
       means “don’t buy”;

       p ( ) is a function that maps types into prices (one price for each type; the same function
       for all …rms);

         ( ) is a function that maps prices into [0; 1] ; such that (p) is a number that represents
       the probability that the consumer assigns to the …rm being altruistic.

       a is optimal given x; p and ; p is optimal given a (and other …rms playing p);                         is
       consistent (it is derived from Bayes’rule whenever possible).

    We focus on equilibria (pooling or separating) where beliefs are of the sort “I reject the
…rm is altruistic if and only if its price p is such that p > p” where p is the equilibrium
pooling price, or the equilibrium price of the altruistic …rm in a separating equilibrium (that
is, p = p ( a ) for a the altruisitc type).13
  12
     Our formulation with n consumers is not equivalent to a formulation where there is a continuum of
consumers of mass n (the standard assumption). In the continuum formulation, a consumer’s purchase does
not a¤ect the …rm’s pro…ts, and so anger is not relevant.
  13
     We are ruling out (for example) equilibria in which the consumer rejects that the …rm is altruistic if the
…rm charges a price p < p (i.e. the consumer comes to believe the …rm is sel…sh even if it is charging a price
below the “target”price); in standard signalling models, beliefs like these may still be part of an equilibrium,
because in equilibrium one does not observe prices p < p and so the consistency condition (that beliefs be
derived from Bayes rule) places no constraints on beliefs. We are also ruling out equilibria in which the
consumer rejects that a …rm is altruistic i¤ its price is p > p; and in equilibrium the altruistic …rm charges
a price p ( a ) < p:

                                                       8
3    Anger and Competition in Oligopoly
In this section we study the connection between concentration and anger. We start by
characterizing the symmetric pooling equilibria in an oligopoly where both types of …rm
charge the same price. Of course, there may be separating equilibria too. But we focus our
analysis on pooling equilibria because we know that in a pooling equilibrium there is no
anger, while in a separating equilibrium there is some anger (amongst consumers served by
sel…sh …rms). Thus, a simple way to establish a connection between an increase in anger
and a more concentrated market structure (and, eventually, monopoly) would be to show
that as the number of …rms fall pooling equilibria are harder to sustain. Of course, there
may be other ways to connect anger and concentration, and these may even explain a large
part of this correlation. But the channel we study has the considerable advantage of being
both simple and tractable, as well as consistent with elements of the historical experience in
the US, where public preoccupation with the increased size of corporations gave rise to the
regulatory movement. Figure 1, is a graphic illustration of this fear (taken from Marchand,
1998).

                                              9
    The …rst step is to …nd necessary conditions under which a price po is part of a pooling
equilibrium in which consumers attain their target level of utility (the case of consumers
with low utility is qualitatively similar).
    Consider a …rm who maximizes pro…ts in a deviation from a pooling equilibrium with
price po (we are not including a utility cost of the deviating …rm, since we assume for the
time being that the equilibrium is such that consumers attain their target utility level ). If
the …rm lowers its price, consumers won’t be angry. In that case, demand is given by the
sum of all (unit) demands of consumers who are closer to the deviating …rm than the two
consumers (one to each side) who are indi¤erent:14

                       s    p    x=s       po     (b      x) , D = 2x = po       p+b

Pro…ts are then
                                           (p     c) (po      p + b) :
When the …rm maximizes this expression, we obtain an optimal price of
                                                       po + b + c
                                                p=                :
                                                           2
For the …rm not to want to deviate from po ; it must be the case that this optimal price is
larger than po ; or equivalently
                                      b + c po :                                       (1)
In words, if the oligopoly price is too large, the …rms are better o¤ lowering their price, and
the consumers will not punish them (by getting angry).
   If the …rm raises its price, consumers become angry, and demand is given by the condition
that
           s p x          (p c) = s po (b x) , D = po (1 + ) p + b + c:                      (2)
In that case, pro…ts are
                                   (p    c) (po      (1 + ) p + b + c) :
For the …rm not to want to deviate and charge the optimal price

                               po + b + c (1 + 2 )                  (po c + b)2
                            p=                     )              =                                        (3)

    Recall that we have assumed that there are n consumers, and we have normalized n = 1: We have argued
that this is not the same as the assumption that there is a continuum of mass 1 of consumers. Still, when
calculating demand, and elsewhere, the intuitions for the results will be conveyed “as if”we had assumed the
continuum version, since it is easier to explain equations that way. For example, in this case, the explanation
with 1 consumer would be: “In that case, demand is given by the probability that the consumer is located
closer to the deviating …rm than the locations that would leave him indi¤erent between purchasing from the
deviating …rm and its neighbors.”

                                                         10
it must be the case that pro…ts in the equilibrium are larger than these deviation pro…ts.15
Formally,

                                (po c + b)2                           h                p       i
                     o
                (p       c) b               ) po                  c+b 1+2             2  (1 + ) :          (4)
                                  4 (1 + )

Notice that combining (1) and (4) when                      = 0 (the standard Salop case), we obtain

                                                        po = b + c:                                        (5)

   An additional restriction is that for a given ; as we decrease the number of …rms the price
must also decrease to achieve the target utility. Consumer utility (in a pooling equilibrium
with price po ) is the number of …rms, 1=b; times the total utility of consumers served by each
…rm (the 2 in the equation below is because each …rms serves consumers to both sides)16 :
                                      Z   b
                                  2       2                                     b
                                              (s       po    x) dx = s    po      :                        (6)
                                  b   0                                         4
This utility is larger than       if and only if
                                                   b                      b
                                  s       po                 ,s                po :                        (7)
                                                   4                      4
    We now present an important result: as competition decreases (enough), anger is more
likely. The proposition shows that as competition decreases, a pooling equilibrium is less
likely. But since pooling equilibria have no anger, and separating equilibria do (in expected
terms there will be some sel…sh …rms), when pooling equilibria disappear, anger appears.

Proposition 1 There is a critical nc such that for all nc n0 > n; the set of pooling prices
is smaller when there are n …rms than when there are n0 : That is, as competition decreases,
anger is more likely.
  15
      It could happen that the …rm considers raising its price and discovers that the optimal price in the
deviation with angry consumers is lower than po (this happens if po is larger than the optimal price, given
in the previous equation). If that happens, the …rm is better o¤ not raising its price. Hence, our assumption
that the optimal price in a deviation is achieved (with angry consumers) is justi…ed.
   16
      Here the de…nition of what utility to consider (for consumers) is not obvious. Why consider total utility
of all consumers? Maybe …rm 1 is behaving really badly and slaughtering its consumers, but still total utility
is large in the market, and so …rm 1 experiences no utility cost of having a high price. In equilibrium this
will make no di¤erence (if …rm 1 is treating its consumers badly, all …rms are doing the same), but it matters
in a deviation. In the set of questions we will analyze in this paper, this makes no di¤erence, but in general
it would seem more “psychologically plausible” that the …rm cares about how it treats its consumers, and
not about “average utility in the market (including the welfare of other …rms’consumers)”.

so that the constraint in equation (7) is not binding, because the constraint in equation
(1) is tighter. For b > bc ; the situation is reversed, and equation (7) is binding but (1) is
not. Starting at b ; increasing b (lowering competition) lowers the upper bound on po (the
                      b
derivative of s         with respect to b is negative) and increases the lower bound since the
                      4                                          p
derivative of the bound in equation (4) is positive: 1 + 2     2     (1 + ).
    The plot below illustrates the three constraints on p : The price po must lie between the
                                                          o

two loci with positive slopes (the steeper one is equation (1) and the ‡atter, (4)) which arise
from the …rms’incentives not to deviate. The price must also lie below the negatively sloped
constraint (equation (7)) that arises from the condition that fewer …rms imply lower prices
(if consumers are to obtain their target utilities).

   Two related results can be derived. The …rst connects the cost structure of …rms and
the rise in anger. Potentially, this link could explain why less developed economies are more
regulated in practice (see Djankov et al 2002) under the assumption that in poor countries
costs are higher (perhaps because of smaller markets or higher ine¢ ciencies) or more volatile
(perhaps because of macro instability). It would also explain why there is more demand for
regualtion in poor than in rich countries, or more boradly, why capitalists and capitalism
are not popular in less developed countries (see Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2002).

Proposition 2 When costs increase, or when they become more volatile, anger is more
likely.

                                                               12
    Proof. When costs increase, the two loci of equations (1) and (4) move upwards by
the amount of the increase in costs. Since equation (7) is unchanged, the set of (b; p) pairs
for which a pooling equilibrium exists shrinks. More importantly, if for a given b there
was a pooling equilibrium, there is an increase in costs that makes that pooling equilibrium
impossible.
    Symetrically, when costs fall, the set of pooling equilibrium prices increases. But a larger
volatility in costs makes it more likely that a high (pooling-breaking) cost will happen, and
then the sel…sh …rms will reveal themselves as such and anger will arise.
    The second illustrates another straightforward feature of the model: when for some exoge-
nous reason consumers become “captive”of one particular …rm, anger is more likely. When
consumer’s elasticity of demand decreases, local monopolies have an incentive to increase
prices. The temptation may be large enough that an anger-triggering price increase may
be pro…table. The motivation for this result is the “rasing prices in a snow storm”scenario
considered in the classic paper on fairness by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1986).17 We
model this increase in captivity by changing the transport cost of consumers going to rivals,
while keeping rival’s prices …xed.18

Proposition 3 Assume that for a given parameter con…guration, there is a pooling equilib-
rium with a price of po . If the cost of transportation to …rms i 1 or i + 1 increases from 1
to t > 1; but the cost of getting to …rm i remains constant, the …rm’s incentives to increase
price increase. There is a threshold t such that if t t …rm i raises its price and consumers
become angry.

   Proof. When the cost of getting to …rms i 1 and i + 1 increases to t; the demand faced
by …rm i (after an increase in price) and its pro…ts, are
                      po    p + (c p) + bt                           po   p + (c p) + bt

and the optimal price and pro…t are
                                c + po + 2c + bt               (po c + bt)2

For large enough t; these pro…ts exceed the oligopoly pro…t, and the …rm raises its price,
causing anger.
  17
     They ask “A hardware store has been selling snow shovels for $15. The morning after a large snowstorm,
the store raises the price to $20. Please rate this action as: Completely Fair, Acceptable, Unfair or Very
Unfair.” Almost 82 percent of respondents considered it unfair for the hardware store to take advantage of
the short-run increase in demand associated with a blizzard.
  18
     This keeps competition constant for the …rm being analyzed. An equivalent way of modeling this is
assuming that the two neighbors of the …rm being analyzed move farther away, as if there had been a
decrease in the number of …rms.

                                                    13
    This resut assumes that consumers continue to make inferences based on the equilibrium
prior to the shock. Although one could argue that a new equilibrium (one with fewer …rms)
should be the benchmark, we believe that keeping the old equilibrium beliefs is also plausible.
In addition, note that the case of fewer …rms also leads to more anger, as established by
Proposition 1.
    We note that any price po in the range determined by equations (1) and (4) can be part
of a pooling equilibrium if we choose or appropriately.19

    Reference Utility and the “Disciplined Approach” (see K½oszegi and Rabin, 2006)
    Models concerned with reference points (including fairness models) have to decide how to
model it in a way that is appealing (non arbitrary) and consistent with the evidence. It is also
helpful if it is straightforward how to track the proposed deviation from standard economic
models. For example Heidhues and K½oszegi (2008) use a disciplined approach introduced by
K½oszegi and Rabin (2006), basing the reference-dependent preferences on classical models of
intrinsic utility taken straight from Salop (1979). Importantly, they endogenize the reference
point as lagged rational expectations, in a way that if there is no loss aversion, their theory
reduces to Salop’s. Likewise, we base our model in Salop (1979) and endogenize the “target”
level of utility as the utility that can be obtained in a reasonably competitive model with
sel…sh …rms. When there is no anger (at insu¢ cinetly altruistic …rms), our model reduces
to Salop’s.
    In particular, we can observe the consequences of using the “disciplined approach” by
showing that the number of …rms associated to the target level of utility is connected to
the critical number of …rms below which increases in concentration are more likely to lead
to consumer anger. To compute what would consumer utility be in some market, so that
we can set the “target” level of utility at some “reasonable” level, we need to choose one
of the possible equilibrium prices. For the purposes of “benchmarking” consumer utility in
each market, we set po = b + c; which is the price in the standard Salop case. We then have
the following result, which tells us what the critical nc of Proposition 1 is.

Proposition 4 If is the utility of the consumers in a market with n …rms, and the price is
the one that would prevail in the standard Salop model, po = c+1=n ; then for all n    n0 > n;
the set of pooling prices is smaller when there are n …rms than when there are n0 : That is,
as competition decreases, anger is more likely. In particular, the threshold nc of Proposition
1 is nc = n :
  19
    Note that if the …rm is altruistic and it raises its price enough, there could be a utility cost of providing
consumers with a very low level of utility. Since we found necessary conditions, we focused only on the
incentives of the sel…sh …rm. When we want to build an equilibrium with a price po within the range we
have just identi…ed, we need to take into account this utility cost for the altruistic …rm. But choosing or
  low enough, any one of these prices is an equilibrium.

                                                       14
    Proof. Consumer utility is as in equation (6) with po = c + b
                                  Z   b
                              2       2                                              5

                              b   0                                                  4
                                                                                                         5               5
so setting to be the utility in a market with n …rms, we get                               =s        c   4
                                                                                                           b   =s   c   4n

as was to be shown.


4     Regulation and Welfare
It is possible to analyze the welfare gains from regulation in this setting (where consumers get
angry when …rms display insu¢ cient altruism towards consumers). We focus on a monopoly
setting to simplify the exposition and the contrast with the gains from regulation in the
standard model. Note that both pooling and separating equilibria are possible (in principle)
in a monopoly. Anger will only arise in a separating equilibrium, so that is the main focus of
this section. For reference, however, we start by characterizing the conditions for a pooling
equilibrium in a monopoly setting.


4.1    Pooling in Monopoly
For the sel…sh …rm, it must be the case that sticking with the equilibrium pm is better than
deviating, angering consumers, and getting (p c) D; where D = 2x for x such that

                      s   p   x           (p        c) = 0 , x = s           p (1 + ) + c:

Of course, it must also be the case that x                  1=2 (otherwise, D = 1). For that to be the case,
we must have
                                                   1
                                          s+c      2
                                                p
                                              +1
(in the standard case, with = 0; this just says that the individual located at x = 1=2 has
negative net surplus from buying the good).
    Hence, pro…ts for the sel…sh monopolist who deviates are

                                                                 c (1 + 2 ) + s            dev       (c s)2
           (p   c) 2 (s   p (1 + ) + c) ) p =                                   ,                =            :         (9)
                                                                    2 (1 + )                         2 (1 + )



                                                                15
    So the condition on parameters for pm to be an equilibrium is that the equilibrium pro…ts,
2 (pm c) (s pm ) ; are larger than dev :
                                                                      r

               2 (p    c) (s p )               )p                              :          (10)
                                     2 (1 + )             2        2       +1
Note that consumer anger has two di¤erent e¤ects on demand. First, it reduces demand:
                          d (2 (s     p (1 + ) + c))
                                                     = 2 (c    p) < 0:
                                         d
The second is less direct and involves the e¤ect on the incentives of the …rm (that is, the
e¤ects on marginal revenue). In this setting, price as a function of Q is
                                                              (2s      Q + 2c )
                   Q = D = 2 (s        p (1 + ) + c) , p =
                                                                    2 (1 + )
which implies that marginal revenue is
                             (2s       Q + 2c )            s        Q+c
                      pQ =                      Q ) M gR =              :
                                    2 (1 + )                        +1
   Notice that in the standard model (with = 0), marginal revenue equal marginal cost
implies that Q = s c: As increases (from 0), the e¤ect on marginal revenue is given by
                                       dM gR   Q (s c)
                                             =
                                        d       ( + 1)2
which is negative for Q < Q = s c and positive for Q > Q : Hence, for Q < Q , the
monopolist facing angry consumers has a smaller incentive to increase Q (quantity demanded
is more sensitive to price, so increasing quantity on the margin, requires a bigger drop in
price than otherwise -i.e., when was 0). Similarly, for Q > Q the monopolist facing angry
consumers has a smaller incentive to decrease Q: But since the sign of M gR c is the same
as before the change in ; the optimal quantity is the same as in the standard model:
                                                 c (1 + 2 ) + s
        Q = 2 (s    pm (1 + ) + c) = 2 s                        (1 + ) + c        =s   c:
                                                    2 (1 + )
   Consumers with high utility

    For the altruistic …rm, utility in the equilibrium is 2 (pm c) (s pm ) (we don’t subtract
  because we are looking for a pooling equilibrium in which the consumer gets at least the
threshold utility level) and utility from the deviation is, for dev as de…ned in equation (9),
 dev
         . So pm can be maintained as a pooling equilibrium i¤
                                                                 r

       Consumers with low utility

     For the altruistic …rm, utility in the equilibrium is 2 (pm c) (s pm )      . The …rm has,
in principle, three alternatives.
     The …rst involves maintaining the equilibrium monopoly price, which yields 2 (pm c) (s pm )
  :
     The second, involves deviating and charging consumers the optimal price. This raises
the question of whether the …rm’s optimal price is above or below the price that would
anger consumers and whether it is above or below the price that would give consumers their
threshold utility. Note, …rst that the equilibrium monopoly price is pm         p (the optimal
price of the altruistic …rm). This is always the case, since if the equilibrium monopoly price
was higher than p ; then the altruistic …rm could lower its price without being punished.
Hence a deviation to the optimal price must be with a higher price. Second, given this,
we conclude that the equilibrium price must be the largest price for which consumers don’t
reject that the …rm is altruistic.20 Third, as a consequence of the …rst two points, since the
deviation is with a higher price, it must still leave consumers with a low (below threshold)
utility. These three points ensure that an altruistic …rm who deviates angers consumers, and
                                                           (c s)2
still pays the utility cost : The …rm’s utility is then 2(1+    )
                                                                   .
     The third involves lowering its price enough to give consumers their threshold util-
ity. Utility from the deviation is, for the maximum p that yields the threshold utility,
2 (p c) (s p) : This maximum price is de…ned by consumer utility (as in equation 12)
equal :
                                                              p
                                    (s p)2 = , p = s                                       (13)
Then, the altruistic …rm’s utility is
                                         p                    p      p               p
              2 (p   c) (s   p) = 2 s           c    s   s+        =2       s    c         :        (14)

and the condition for a pooling equilibrium in which the consumer gets low utility is that
                                                                 q
       m           m
                              p           p        m    c+s 1                p 2
  2 (p    c) (s p )          2    s c          )p                   s c 2              2

  20
    Otherwise the …rms could have increased their prices without being punished, and this price increase
wouldn’t do any additional harm in terms of worsening the altruistic …rm’s utility cost of consumers not
achieving their target utilities, since the …rm is already paying that cost with the “low” initial price.

4.2     Separating Equilibrium in a Monopoly (Regulation)
We now study the welfare e¤ects of regulating a monopoly. As explained, in order to evaluate
the gains and losses to consumers and the …rm, we must …rst characterize the equilibrium
that would give rise to regulation. That is, we must characterize separating equilibria when
there is only one …rm.
    The initial situation is one in which there is a separating equilibrium; the type of equilib-
rium we focus on is one in which beliefs are “don’t reject that the …rm is altruistic i¤ p p”
for some price p. Two cases can arise: for the altruistic …rm the consumer’s utility is above
the threshold, or it is below.
    If the consumer’s utility is below the threshold for the price of the altruistic …rm in
some equilibrium, then both …rms face the same incentives, and that can’t be a separating
equilibrium (not a strict one at least21 ). The same is true if the consumer’s utility is above
the threshold for both prices. Therefore, we will only focus on separating equilibria in which
the high price yields a utility below the threshold, and the low price a utility above the
threshold. That is, in the equilibria we analyze, we will have pa p ; for pa the price of the
altruisic …rm in equilibrium, and p be the highest price that gives consumers their target
                                                                          p
utility when they are not angry (as de…ned in equation 13), p = s            :

Lemma 1 In a separating equilibrium, the only possible price for the sel…sh …rm is the price
that maximizes pro…ts when consumers are angry:
                                     c (1 + 2 ) + s              (c s)2
                              ps =                  ,    s   =            :                        (15)
                                        2 (1 + )                 2 (1 + )
    Proof. Suppose ps is not as in equation (15). Since ps is a (separating) equilibrium price,
consumers will know that the …rm is sel…sh and will therefore be angry. Hence, playing ps
must be better than playing any price p for which consumers have rejected that the …rm
is altruistic: (ps c) 2 (s ps (1 + ) + c)       (p c) 2 (s p (1 + ) + c) : But the right
hand side has a unique maximizer given by equation (15), so we obtain a contradiction.
    We now …nd the range of prices for the altruistic …rm that can be part of a separating
equilibrium.

Lemma 2 In a separating equilibrium the price pa of the altruistic …rm must satisfy
                         r                          r
           c+s s c                        s+c 1
                                    pa                       (c s)2 + 2 :                          (16)
             2       2        +1            2     2      +1
Moreover, any price in that range can be sustained as a separating equilibrium, as long as it
gives consumers their target level of utility.
  21
   The …rm charging the high price would make “more pro…ts” out of the larger price, but “less” from the
punishment, than the …rm charging the low price. The two e¤ects would net out.

                                                  18
    Proof. Necessity. For the altruistic …rm not to want to deviate (upwards) and charge
its optimal price (the optimal price is the same as for the sel…sh …rm) we must have (as in
the analysis prior to equation 11),
                                                               r
                              (c s)2                s+c 1
         2 (pa c) (s pa )                   ) pa                      (c s)2 + 2 :
                              2 (1 + )                2      2     +1
Similarly, the sel…sh …rm must want to charge its equilibrium price, and not the maximum
price for which consumers are not angry, p: To connect this relationship with an upper bound
on pa ; notice that we must have pa = min fp; p g. This is so, …rst, because we must have
pa min fp; p g for beliefs to be consistent, and for consumers to obtain their target utility.
Second, if we had pa < min fp; p g ; the altruistic …rm could increase its price towards its
optimal price (without anger) c+s
                                2
                                  ; since

                       c+s   c (1 + 2 ) + s
                           >                >p        min fp; p g > pa
                        2       2 (1 + )
such a price increase would strictly increase its pro…ts without lowering consumer utility
below :
   For the sel…sh …rm not to want to deviate to p; we must have
                                                                    r
                                 (c s)2                 c+s s c
              2 (p c) (s p)                ) pa p
                                 2 (1 + )                2       2      +1
and this establishes the upper bound for pa :
   Su¢ ciency. It is straightforward to check that for any pa       p ; and pa in the range
de…ned by equation (16), there is an equilibrium with p = pa . This condition de…nes as
                                           (
                                              1 p p
                                     (p) =             :
                                              0 p>p

Given this, the sel…sh …rm optimally charges ps as in equation (15), the altruistic …rm
optimally charges pa = p; beliefs are consistent, and consumer’s acquisition decisions are
optimal given their beliefs and tastes.                                       q
    For an equilibrium with pa p to exist, we must have of course p    s+c 1
                                                                        2   2   +1
                                                                                   (c s)2 + 2
(otherwise the range is empty). If we continue with the assumption that is consumer utility
in some oligopoly with m = 1=b …rms, so that = s c 45 b; the condition for existence of
a separating equilibrium becomes
                           r                          r
                                      5     s+c 1
                  p =s        s c       b                    (c s)2 + 2 :
                                      4      2      2     +1
   Although, as usual, the set of equilibria is large, the Cho and Kreps “Intuitive criterion”
re…nement in this context yields that the price is as large as possible in the range determined

    Recall that we have assumed s c + 1; which was the condition for the market not to be
fully served by a monopoly. We compare two types of regulatory policies: mandated prices
for the …rms, and subsidies.
    Consider a situation where there was a separating equilibrium and the …rm is perceived
to be a sel…sh …rm (a possible example is US railroads at the time of the Sherman Act).
What is total welfare? Consumer utility is, using ps from equation 9,

                      Rs   p    (p c)                                                (s       c)2
                     2 0                (s   p     (p    c)       x) dx          =                  :
                                                                          p=ps            4
Notice that consumer welfare is exactly the same as in the case where the consumer’s utility
is standard: the expression of consumer welfare is independent of . The reason is that,
while for each price less consumers would purchase because anger diminishes the incentives
to purchase, the monopolist lowers his price so that exactly the same number of consumers
as before purchases:

      D                                          c (1 + 2 ) + s                  c (1 + 2 ) + s   s c
        =s       (ps       c)    ps = s                                   c                     =     :

   In order for the marginal consumer to be the same (with > 0 or = 0) the price
decrease must exactly o¤set anger; indeed, an increase in decreases price ps

Since transportation cost (or taste) x is additive, the e¤ect on every other consumer is exactly
the same as with the marginal consumer, and therefore total utility is the same.
   In brief, the reason for the price decrease is that demand becomes more elastic when
grows. This lower optimal price leads to a decrease (relative to the standard case) of the
welfare of the …rm:
                                                                                       (s c)2

    We now calculate the welfare in six cases: standard and anger model, crossed with 3
policies; laissez faire, regulated price p = c and a subsidy under which p = c and the
monopolist gets ps c per unit from the government, as an incentive to lower prices to
consumers. For these calculations we assume that even for p = c; not all consumers are
served.

Note that in the anger model, the consumer cares not only about how much he pays, but
also about how much the …rm receives. In calculating the subsidy, we assume that the …rm
gets ps ; the price in the absence of regulation. Note that the consumer welfare is the same
in the absence of regulation; not only that, the consumer who is indi¤erent between buying
and not buying is also the same individual; the price reduction, that the monopolist must
make in the anger model, leaves the welfare of each consumer intact.

    Since consumer welfare with and without anger is the same, and the pro…ts of the mo-
nopolist are lower with anger, total welfare in the economy is lower in the anger model.
    The following table shows the gains to regulation: total welfare after regulation, minus
total welfare before regulation. An obvious point that we haven’t addressed yet is where is
the money for subsidies coming from? How is it counted in total welfare. We will address
this issue shortly.

now show, it is not the extra subsidy in the standard case that make subsidies less attractive
in the anger model. Let SSt: R be the di¤erence in welfare between Subsidies and Regulation
in the standard model (by how much more do subsidies increase welfare); similarly, let SAng:R
be the di¤erence in welfare between Subsidies and Regulation in the anger model. We have

    Hence, imagine that due to the costs of raising the money (or the political economy costs)
the regulator was indi¤erent between the two policies when he thought the economy was a
standard one. If he learns that consumer preferences include the anger term that we study
in this paper, he would favor regulation without subsidies.
    Although subsidies are less attractive than in the standard model, good old fashioned
price setting by the regulator is better in the model with anger:

                      (c       s)2 (3 + 1)            (c        s)2       1
                                                                      =        (c           s)2 > 0

4.3    Three channels in the Regulation of Monopoly
To summarize: there are three channels through which regulation can potentially increase
welfare in our model where consumers react with anger at prices they consider to be unfair.

  1. There is a standard channel whereby a reduction in price from above marginal costs
     increases total welfare by getting a good of cost c to be produced and transfered to a
     consumer who values it at s:

  2. For each consumer, who was purchasing and was angry, a reduction in price increases
     total welfare by reducing his anger (because the …rm is making lower pro…ts).

                                                            22
   3. Finally, any channel that reduces anger (whether it reduces price or not) induces people
      who were out of the market to start buying the good, and that also increases total
      welfare. Imagine for example a policy that kept the price …xed, but “expropriated”the
      pro…ts from the …rm. In that case, in the standard model, welfare would be unchanged.
      In the current model welfare increases for two reasons: …rst, each consumer who was
      purchasing before, is happier. But also, some consumers who were not purchasing, will
      now become customers.




Figure 2. Three Channels through which a reduction in price from the monopoly price pM
                      to the regulated price pR increases welfare.

    Figure 2 depicts the three channels described above, which go beyond the standard
Kaldor-Hicks potential e¢ ciency gains.22 Consider a regulator who induces a change in the
price from the monopoly price pM to pR : Assume he does so in two (imaginary) steps: he …rst
reduces the price paid by the consumer, while keeping the price received by the monopoly at
pM ; in the second (imaginary) stage, the regulator reduces the price received by the monopoly
from pM to pR : The locus AA’depicts demand when the price paid by the consumer varies,
but the price received by the …rm is …xed at pM , D = 2 (s p + pM + c). In that case,
when the price paid by the consumer is changed by the regulator to pR , the demand function
  22
     Trivially, they are Kaldor-Hicks gains when consumers maximize an objective that has a fairness compo-
nent. An interesting extension of our model is to consider the possibility of an emotional cost to those that
are the target of anger, as …rms might want to be popular with consumers (particularly when the owner has
to live in the same community as consumers) and regulation introduces other welfare terms.

                                                     23
is …xed, and the quantity demanded changes to QI = 2 (s pR + pM + c) : At that stage,
welfare has increased only through the …rst channel, the traditional Harberger triangle (light
gray in Figure 2). Then, when the regulator changes the price received by the …rm, the new
demand curve is the locus BB’, D = 2 (s p + pR + c) : Consumers who were already
purchasing QM units, will increase their welfare due to the reduced anger; this is the dark
gray area in Figure 2, which corresponds to the second channel. Finally, the change in the
price received by the monopoly induces additional purchases of QR QI from individuals
for whom the reduction in anger makes the purchases worthwhile. These new sales generate
additional welfare through the …rst (traditional) channel, since units that cost less than
what consumers value them are being exchanged. This combination is the third channel, the
dotted trapezoid in Figure 2. The demand function when the price changes are not broken
down in the two imaginary steps is given by D = 2 (s p + p + c) and is locus CC’in the
…gure above.


5      Discussion
Our Results: The starting point of the paper is our assumption that total utility is made up
of a material payo¤ and an emotional payo¤. While the former is standard, the emotional
payo¤ is assumed to become negative when agents that are perceived to be unkind do well,
or more precisely, when a …rm that has charged “excessive” prices makes positive pro…ts.
While other speci…cations for these emotional reactions might also be natural, this one is
su¢ cient for our purposes: …rms in our model are extremely interested in appearing to behave
altruistically and often, though not always, charge relatively low prices so as not to irritate
consumers. Indeed in competitive markets (i.e., when there are still enough competitors in
the market so that it pays for a sel…sh …rm to pretend to be altruistic) the introduction of
an emotional payo¤ makes demand more elastic.23
    It is worth pointing out that, in principle, the emphasis on emotions triggered by high
prices introduces more discipline on …rms. Interestingly, however, this does not mean that
there are lower welfare gains from regulation. Indeed, when we study reductions in the
numbers of competitors, we note that when emotions matter, the increase in prices can be
considerably higher than when emotions don’t a¤ect total utility. Put di¤erently, when there
are few competitors, consumers have a higher cost of “punishing”any particular …rm that has
misbehaved (by charging them high prices) by withdrawing their purchases. This introduces
  23
    Interestingly, Supreme Court judge Stephen Breyer mentions that an additional justi…cation for regula-
tion (beyond e¢ ciency) is fairness, by which he means that competition prevents …rms from “arbitrary or
unjusti…ably discriminatory exercise of personal power” and that a monopolist might be able to get away
with discriminating or more generally “treating a customer unfairly”. See Breyer (1982).

a bigger role for regulation. More generally, given our assumption that emotional payo¤s
play a role, the optimal reaction to small restrictions in output under monopoly (a small
“Harberger triangle”) and high bureaucratic costs of setting up regulatory agencies may still
be to regulate. This …ts well with the fact that we often wish to regulate utilities (like Water
and Sewage), even though it is clear that high prices bring about small reductions in output.
Given this, some authors have opted for introducing a weight in the social welfare function
that can yield a small in‡uence of …rm pro…ts on regulated price (see, for example, La¤ont
and Tirole, 1993). The results in this paper could be used to formally justify the inclusion of
such low weight on pro…ts, perhaps providing some guide on how to estimate them through
experimental methods.
    Relationship to Other Work: Our paper is related to previous research emphasizing the
fact that one important attribute that people look to see in prices is their fairness. In an
important paper, for example, Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1986) noted a remarkable
degree of agreement amongst survey respondents in what changes in prices they consid-
ered fair and which ones they did not. A growing literature in economics has studied the
theoretical implications of assuming consumers’ preferences display a concern for fairness,
including Rabin (1993), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), Bolton and Ockenfelds (2000), inter alia.
Of particular interest for our purposes are Levine (1998) and Rotemberg (2005, 2008), who
assume that a person’s altruism towards others depends on his/her estimation of how altru-
istic others are in return. Introducing heterogeneity in agent’s preferences allows them to
explain a wide range of phenomena observed in dictator and ultimatum experiments. Using
their speci…cation of consumer preferences allows us to introduce a feature that is relevant
to the regulation of monopoly: high prices sometimes anger consumers, so there is a cost of
monopoly that is closer to the informal descriptions of “exploitation”and “abuse”observed
in the anecdotal evidence. Regulation and anti-trust actions can then be interpreted as
addressing primarily these emotional costs of monopoly.24
    Rotemberg (2005) describes how altruistic preferences can give rise to price rigidity. In
his model, missing on a good deal gives rise to regret, and facing a price that is unjusti…ably
high induces customer anger. He observes that the frequency of price adjustment can depend
on economy-wide variables observed by consumers and derives implications for the e¤ects of
monetary policy. While our speci…cation of preferences is very much related, he does not
analyze how equilibrium outcomes depend on the level of competition, the main purpose of
our paper. Heidhues and K½oszegi (2008) on the other hand describe a market equilibrium
  24
    See also the reactions to the 2009 subprime crisis, in particular the public fallout after it was disclosed
that some of the troubled …rms had paid bonuses to their executives. One example is “The Outrage Factor:
Do populist outbursts like the one sparked by the AIG bonuses represent a threat to capitalism -or an
opportunity? Our essayists on populism and its discontents”, cover story in Newsweek, March 30, 2009.

closely related to our paper (as it is also based on Salop, 1979). They also introduce a
realistic assumption of consumer preferences (in their case consumers have loss aversion, and
so a price increase is worse than a price decrease of the same magnitude). One di¢ culty
in applying their model to the study of monopolies (in terms of the interpretation) is that
is that it does not incorporate the anger feature that we believe is important in the rise
of regulation. Another di¢ culty (in terms of the modeling approach), is that consumers
who do not purchase do not experience disutility. In contrast, in the monopoly setting it
seems important that models allow for the possibility that bystanders can get upset even
when they are not themselves the victims of “exploitative” prices. Heidhues and K½oszegi
(2008) develop a “disciplined approach” where the behavioral model is based on the classic
(intrinsic utility) model of Salop, and fully endogeneize the reference point (as the lagged
rational expectations point). In our model, the predictions also reduce to Salop’s when there
are no psychologically realistic features and the “fair” outcome is de…ned within the model
(the outcome for the consumer when there is a reasonable amount of competition). For a
discussion of how a behavioral model becomes generally applicable when it is based on a
“disciplined approach”, see also K½oszegi and Rabin (2006).
    Relationship to Public Relations (the Practice and the particular Instruments used):
Given that the public is keen to …nd out which type of …rms they face, there is ample
room for …rms to try and in‡uence these perceptions. For simplicity, we only allow …rms in
our model to signal their type through their choice of prices. But …rms, in practice, employ
a variety of strategies to in‡uence the perceptions of potential clients. For example, one
interpretation of the large amounts of money spent in “public relations”is that they are an
attempt to signal a “kind”type by other (presumably cheaper) means than lowering prices.25
Similarly, it is possible to interpret the particular form that such public relations e¤orts take
in terms of our model. For example, publicizing charitable actions (by the …rm as a whole or
by its founder or main shareholders) cannot be easily interpreted when consumers care only
about their material payo¤s. A simpler explanation is that it is an attempt to in‡uence the
perception of the type of …rm.26
  25
      See, for example, Boyd (2000), Metzler (2001) and the discussion in Patel et al (2005). On the role of
status and how legitimacy confers power but depends on the support of stakeholders, see Pfe¤er and Salancik
(1978) and Suchman (1995).
   26
      One of the …rst and most famous of the public relations practitioners was Ivy Ledbetter Lee, who had
the Rockefeller family as a client. After the so-called Ludlow Massacre in 1913 (where striking miners
and children where eventually killed), Lee advised John D. Rockefeller to visit the mines personally and to
advertise his philanthropic activities (which had been secret up to then). See, for example, Bates (2002).
Note that even if potential clients were just altruistic towards the bene…ciaries of the …rm’s charitable giving
it is unlikely that (in the absence of the signalling role of donations) they would favor the …rm’s publicizing
their largesse. The reason is that the publicity might crowd out other donors (unless they think that this
publicity will now re-direct further giving by others, perhaps by raising awareness of the “worthiness” of


                                                      26
    Another particular form of public relations that is consistent with our approach is that
…rms often “humanize corporations”, emphasizing the identity of the founder or main share-
holder. One interpretation of this relatively common form of marketing is that by doing so a
…rm is more likely to be perceived to have the attributes of humans (such as kindness) than
of “soul-less” corporations that “only care about pro…ts”. Again, such language is unlikely
to make sense in a world where customers only care about material payo¤s. Figure 3 is
taken from Marchand (1998), who studies the role of corporate imagery in the creation (and
maintainance) of the perception that corporations in America have a “soul”(interpreted by
the author as forms of kindness, tolerance and other positive human attributes).




 Figure 3. An ad in the campaign by Bell Telephone System to humanize the corporation.

    It depicts an elderly lady cooking and describes her as one of the many shareholders of the
telephone company. It also emphasizes that these are neither exceptional nor sophisticated
investors (occupations mentioned include housewife, miner, clerk, teacher), are not oppor-
tunistic investors who prioritize short run pro…ts (more than half “have held their shares
for …ve years or longer”), approximately half are women, and often hold what appears as a
small amount (a large number of them “own 5 shares or less”) for saving purposes (instead
of speculation). In terms of our model, we note that it is harder to get angry at higher prices
this cause). It seems implausible that this is the primary logic that is triggered by the publicity of a …rm’s
charitable giving.


                                                     27
when these are ultimately bene…ting a gentle-looking, cooking grandmother than when the
bene…ciary is a rich capitalist. Interestingly, Marchand (1998) also mentions that it is related
to an attempt to appear democratic at a time when the big companies are perceived to have
grown dramatically in size relative to traditional institutions (the advertisement mentions
that the Bell company is a democracy run by the people it serves).
    Note that it is unlikely that the public has good information about the structure of costs
faced by the …rm. In that case a …rm that is perceived as kind will be granted more tolerance
and allowed to charge relatively higher prices than an unkind …rm in similar circumstances
without triggering consumer anger.27
    Positive Theories of Regulation: Finally, the model also has some implications for a posi-
tive theory of regulation. Most models emphasize the role of interest groups in lobbying and
bribing their way to favorable regulation, as in Stigler (1971). Our paper is complementary
in the sense that we give a role to the demand for regulation on the part of the public (rather
than on the part of …rms) and the mechanisms we describe may also give rise to the set up of
regulatory bodies that are not carefully designed by benevolent policymakers (for example,
it may not consider the …rms’welfare as part of the objective function). In these models,
causality goes from corruption to regulation.
    It is worth emphasizing that the evidence available also suggests the opposite causal
link (broadly, from corruption to regulation). For example, within a country, individuals
who perceive lots of corruption in the country are precisely those who declare to want more
regulation; and that this demand is stronger when big companies are thought to be involved.
Even over time, regulation bursts seem to follow corruption scandals (see, for example, Di
Tella and MacCulloch, 2002).28
    This is consistent with the model we present: when capitalists are perceived to be corrupt
and unkind, voters demand regulation. Of course, in sophisticated legal systems, more
e¢ cient punishment directed only at those that are perceived to be breaking the rules might
be available. In such cases, a descent into distrust and a regulated economy might be avoided
by “moral crusaders”, who often explicitly frame their campaigns as a bene…t to capitalism.29
  27
      This may be the consequence of a purely rational Bayesian calculation in which the prior belief shifts
“upwards” towards higher (better or nicer) types, but it can also be the consequence of basic psychological
mechanisms (“nice people don’t do this kind of thing”)
   28
      Anecdotal evidence is consistent with this interpretation: after the Enron scandal in 2002 there was
heightened regulation even though a Republican administration was in place (including additional funding
for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, etc). Note that authors who see
these reforms as insu¢ cient, like Conrad (2004), discuss how policymakers undercut pressures for more
reforms during this period.
   29
      Eliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York, is a recent example of a tradition that goes back at least
to Teddy Roosevelt. In one speech, he stated this view: “... even though those who pretend to speak for the
free market kick vigorously against us when we reveal these problems, . . . the reality is that the market


                                                      28
More broadly, we give a central role to the interaction between the legal system and regulation
as both are seen as limiting and punishing deviant business actions.
    There are several episodes where regulation is put into place as a result of considerable
public anxiety. The classic case is the Sherman Act of 1890, which laid the basis of the
regulation of big business in America. Our reading of this episode is that the political support
for regulation originated in perceptions of corporate “abuse”rather than the possibility that
monopolies would introduce ine¢ ciencies in the economy (by restricting trade). One example
is John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil trust. Various practices that reinforced an ability to
charge high prices made the concern the target for attacks. These were discussed in the
press and the muckrakers’writings, including Ida Tarbell’s 1902 popular series on Standard
Oil in McClure’s Magazine (later compiled in the well known book “History of Standard Oil
Company”). Starting in 1904, the States …led a series of lawsuits (13 in 1906 alone) which
ended in a Federal district court decision to break up the Standard Oil Company into its
component companies. Although doubts remain as to the impact of the separation on its
conduct, it is clear that the motivation for regulation in this case is unlikely to have been
a preoccupation with e¢ ciency (particularly when there are e¢ ciencies to be gained on the
cost side as scale is increased). Wildavsky and Tenenbaum (1981) describe this and other
episodes where high prices led to widespread mistrust between the public (and politicians)
and the oil industry. In particular, it describes the public reactions to the …rst oil shock and
the subsequent debates over how much of these increases could be justi…ed by dwindling oil
and gas reserves (versus taking advantage of the increases engineered by the OPEC cartel).


6     Conclusions
We present a model where the need to regulate a …rm arises because consumers sometimes
have adverse emotional reactions to high prices. The root assumption is that consumers
get angry when they think that a …rm is charging “abusive” or “exploitative” prices. We
model this by assuming that consumers experience utility from consumption at low prices
(a standard material payo¤) and disutility from observing high pro…ts in the hands of …rms
that have displayed low levels of altruism towards their clients (an emotional payo¤). In
the context of a simple monopolistic competition model along the lines of Salop (1979),
this implies that …rms experience large drops in demand when their activities (e.g., price
selections) irritate consumers. We show that market equilibrium in these circumstances
displays a series of interesting properties. For example, the client of a …rm who discovers
survives only because we reveal these problems, make them eminently clear, and try to confront them in a
very real way” (Spitzer, 2005). On the interaction between beliefs and punishment, see Di Tella and Dubra
(2008).

that the owner is (say) a criminal experiences a utility loss (no such loss is present in standard
economic models).30 Morover, in some circumstances, even with a very low proportion of
truly altruistic …rms, most …rms in the market charge a low price in order to appear to be
kind.
    The main result of the paper is that, under a reasonable set of circumstances, anger is
more likely as the number of …rms falls and competition decreases. This happens because
a feature of the equilibrium is that, as the number of …rms in the market drops, switching
to a …rm who has not raised prices becomes more costly to the consumer, and the threat
to punish unkind …rms by not purchasing from them becomes less credible. This leads to
price increases by …rms, which in turn leads to anger. This phenomenon introduces a new
potential justi…cation for regulation: by reducing the pro…ts of …rms revealed to be unkind,
anger of captive consumers (and of the public that is witness to the “abuses”) falls and
consumer welfare is increased.
    The second contribution of the paper is to illustrate these gains from regulation in the
context of monopoly. There are three channels: regulation helps through the standard chan-
nels (increasing output when it is valuable), through a purely emotional channel (captive
consumers are less angry as unkind …rms earn less in pro…ts), and through a mixed channel
(individuals who were out of the market as they were too angry in the unregulated mar-
ket, decide to purchase and reduce the standard distortions described in the …rst channel).
The anger mechanism emphasized here suggests that …rms will invest resources in trying
to appear kind, perhaps developing professionals devoted to “public relations”, or by ad-
vertising campaigns emphasizing the founder’s identity (in contrast to the anonymous set of
shareholders) or through philanthropy (see, for example, the evidence collected in Marchand,
1998). The mechanism also suggests that regulation may also have value when it reassures
consumers that any observed increase in prices is justi…able (for example because costs are
higher, rather than because there was an increase in the “unkindness”-or greediness- of the
…rm).
    Fairness has been the focus of a growing literature in economics. Our paper’s contribution
is to lay out a simple framework to discuss how such considerations may help understand
better the bene…ts of regulating monopolies. Speci…caly, we show how anger and competition
are connected and how the anger/fairness objective modi…es the simple Kaldor-Hicks criteria
(based only on e¢ ciency considerations) yielding three channels through which monopolies
a¤ect welfare. The framework can also be applied to help explain the choice between di¤erent
regulatory approaches, such as anti-trust versus regulatory agencies or between regulatory
instruments, such as …nes versus price regulation.
  30
    This is consistent with retail …rms charging high prices and claiming that the extra money goes to foreign
Aid (e.g., the “Red” campaign by T he Gap and singer activist Bono).

7      Appendix
In this appendix we present an example in which, for a given set of parameters, there is a
pooling equilibrium (without anger) in a duopoly but no such equilibrium in a monopoly.
Proposition 1 showed that, always within oligopoly, decreases in competition make anger
more likely. One of the points of this example is to “generalize”this observation to encompass
a reduction in competition that leads from a duopoly (a form of oligopoly) to a monopoly:
a reduction in competition that leads to the rise in anger.
    We now show that if is the utility with 3 …rms, for some parameter con…gurations there
is a pooling equilibrium in which both types of …rms choose the same price (resulting in no
anger, and consumers obtaining a “high”utility from consumption, u           ) with 2 …rms. At
the same time, there is no pooling equilibrium when there is a monopoly. This results in
consumers being angry if the monopolist happens to be of the sel…sh type. The point of this
example is to show:

    1. That anger is more likely in a monopoly, so the monopoly is the right model to look
       at when focusing on anger.31 This is so, because the only equilibria without anger are
       pooling equilibria (in any separating equilibrium, in expected terms there will be some
       sel…sh …rms, and so long as they charge a price larger than marginal cost, there will
       be anger; and price equal to marginal cost is never optimal).

    2. That there is some distance between assumptions and results. If we had chosen to
       be the utility attained by consumers in a duopoly and shown that there is no pooling
       equilibrium in a monopoly, one could suspect that the “no pooling” result was the
       consequence of focusing on a market structure di¤erent from the one used to calculate
       the benchmark utility . The example shows that that is not the case: the benchmark
       utility is with 3 …rms; one can still obtain that utility and a pooling equilibrium with
       a di¤erent (more concentrated) market, in particular in a duopoly; the pooling only
       breaks when moving to a monopoly.

    Suppose = 15     ; s = 1; c = 0; = 50    and = 12    ; corresponding to the utility of the
                                                      7
consumer in a market with 3 …rms. Note that = 50 = 0:14 is fairly small, relative to the
pro…ts (maximum pro…ts are: 1=2 in a monopoly with these parameters; and 1/4 for each
…rm in a duopoly). We say that the altruistic motive is “fairly small” in the sense that it
is not larger than total …rm pro…ts in either the monopoly or duopoly (if it were, one could
argue that the altruistic motive is driving “everything”; we have that is not too large, and
we obtain di¤erential behavior in the case of the monopoly vis a vis the duopoly)
  31
    For di¤erent parameter con…gurations one can obtain anger also in an oligopoly; anger is not “propri-
etary” of markets with a monopoly.

7.1       No pooling in monopoly with high utility for consumers
The price in the monopoly situation must be, from equation (10),

for the sel…sh …rm to want to pool. But such a price yields a consumer utility of     64
                                                                                           <   12

7.2       No pooling in monopoly with low utility for consumers
For the altruistic …rm, the alternatives are
  1. charging the equilibrium monopoly price and getting 2 (pm        c) (s    pm )        ;

  2. charging its optimal price p > pm (leaving consumers angry and still with a low
                            (c s)2
     utility), which yields 2(1+ )
                                   .

   3. lowering its price enough to satisfy consumers, which yields a utility given by equation
             p            p
      (14), 2    (s c        ):
                                                  q         q
                                                      7         7      7
    But (1) is better than (3) i¤ pm (1 pm )         12

                                                                   + 100   = 0:25043 which is
impossible. We conclude that there’s no pooling, because the altruistic …rm always wants to
lower its price and satisfy consumers. (even though is relatively small).


7.3       Pooling in duo
We consider a pooling equilibrium in which the price charged guarantees consumers their
                             7
acceptable utility level of 12 : Total utility of consumers for a price of p in a duopoly is:
             Z 1                       Z 1
                2                         2                  3 4p       7          11
           4      (s p x) dx = 4            (1 p x) dx =                   )p         :
              0                         0                       2      12          24
                            11
    We will show that p = 24   is indeed part of a pooling equilibrium. Pro…ts for both types
of …rm in the equilibrium are price times demand (half the market for each …rm):       = 11
                                                                                          48

    Faced with this price, neither the altruistic nor the sel…sh …rm wants to deviate by
decreasing its price. For both …rms, the alternative is choosing p to maximize its pro…ts in
a situation where consumers are angry and demand is given by the following condition
                                    1                                 1   23
