                                            ABSTRACT

In their different ways, both Thomas Malthus and Thomas McKeown raised fundamental questions
about the relationship between food supply and the decline of mortality. Malthus argued that food
supply was the most important constraint on population growth and McKeown claimed that an improvement
in the population’s capacity to feed itself was the most important single cause of mortality change.
This paper explores the implications of these arguments for our understanding of the causes of mortality
decline in Britain between 1700 and 1914. It presents new estimates showing changes in the calorific
value and composition of British diets in 1700, 1750, 1800 and 1850 and compares these with the
official estimates published by the Royal Society in 1917. It then considers the implications of these
data in the light of new arguments about the relationship between diet, work intensity and economic
growth. However the paper is not solely concerned with the analysis of food-related issues. It also
considers the ways in which sanitary reform may have contributed to the decline of mortality at the
end of the nineteenth century and it pays particular attention to the impact of cohort-specific factors
on the pattern of mortality decline from the mid-nineteenth century onwards.

In the Essay on the principle of population, Malthus famously argued that the growth of human

populations was necessarily constrained either by preventive checks or positive checks. He

argued that human beings had a unique capacity ‘to calculate distant consequences’ (Malthus

1803: 9), and that this enabled them to exercise voluntary control over reproduction. However, if

moral restraint was abandoned and the preventive check failed, population growth would

inevitably be arrested, sooner or later, by one of a large number of positive checks. These

included ‘all unwholesome occupations, severe labour and exposure to the seasons, extreme

poverty, bad nursing of children, great towns, excesses of all kinds, the whole train of common

diseases and epidemics, wars, pestilence, plague and famine’ (Malthus 1803: 11).

   Although Malthus emphasised that the positive check could take many forms, it was directly

related to the problem of subsistence, and therefore the most important factor limiting the

capacity for population growth was the population’s ability to feed itself. In 1803 he observed

that ‘population can never actually increase beyond the lowest nourishment capable of

supporting it’, so that ‘a strong check on population, from the difficulty of acquiring food, must

be constantly in operation’ (Malthus 1803: 3). He then went on to describe some of the

implications of this argument in the following graphic terms:

   Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful recourse of nature. The power of population
   is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man that, unless arrested by
   the preventive check, premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The
   vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in
   the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they
   fail in the war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence and plague advance in
   terrific array, and sweep of their thousands and ten thousands. Should success be still
   incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear and, with one mighty blow, levels
   the population with the food of the world (Malthus 1803: 350).
   Although they approached the subject from very different perspectives, it is interesting to

compare Malthus’ arguments with those advanced by the medical writer, Thomas McKeown, a
                                                                                                       3

century and half later.1 Whereas Malthus’ main aim was to understand the limits to population

growth, McKeown’s aim was to explain how these limits might have been overcome. As he

believed that the growth of population owed relatively little to changes in fertility, this question

resolved itself into an investigation into the causes of the decline of mortality. In his most

famous work, The modern rise of population, he argued that the most important cause of

mortality decline was a decline in the level of mortality from infectious diseases, and that this in

turn could be attributed to a number of different factors, including changes in the relationship

between infective organisms and their human hosts, medical intervention and measures to reduce

exposure, but the most important factor was an improvement in ‘nutritional state’. This

conclusion was summarised in the following terms:

    The most acceptable explanation of the large reduction of mortality and growth of population
    which preceded advances in hygiene is an improvement in nutrition due to greater food
    supplies. The grounds for this conclusion are twofold. (a) There was undoubtedly a great
    increase in food production during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in England and
    Wales enough to support a population which trebled between 1700 and 1850 without
    significant food imports. (b) In the circumstances which existed prior to the agricultural and
    industrial revolutions, an improvement in food supplies was a necessary condition for a
    substantial and prolonged decline of mortality and expansion of population. The last point is
    in accord with present-day knowledge of the relation between malnutrition and infectious
    diseases (McKeown 1976: 153-4).
    McKeown’s account of the history of mortality decline in Britain has long been open to

question. In their monumental history of The population history of England, Wrigley and

Schofield (1981: 228) argued that McKeown had grossly underestimated the extent of fertility

change during the course of the eighteenth century and that this had led him to overestimate the

extent of changes in mortality before circa 1850 (see also Wrigley 1983). They also argued that

                                                                                                     4

there was little, if any, evidence to support the view that improvements in diet and ‘nutrition’

had played any part in the decline of mortality during the second of the eighteenth century when

real wages actually appeared to be declining (Wrigley and Schofield 1981: 361-5). Although

their account of the chronology of mortality change was subsequently challenged by Peter

Razzell (1993; 1998), he nevertheless shared their view that changes in real wages had made

relatively little difference to the decline of mortality (see also Razzell 1965; 1974).

   These criticisms have been strongly reinforced by Simon Szreter’s critique of McKeown’s

account of mortality change in the nineteenth century. When McKeown examined the cause-

specific nature of mortality decline in England and Wales, he argued that it was possible to draw

a clear distinction between mortality from airborne infections and mortality from waterborne

infections. This was one of the main foundations for his argument that the most important single

cause of the decline of mortality during the second half of the nineteenth century was an

improvement in the standard of ‘nutrition’. However, Szreter argued that the methodology

which McKeown had used to estimate the size of the contributions made by ‘airborne’ and

‘waterborne’ diseases was flawed and that he had underestimated the impact of urbanisation on

the standard of public health before 1870. As a result, Szreter concluded that sanitary reform,

and not dietary improvement, was the main cause of mortality change from the 1870s onwards

(Szreter 1988; 1994; 1997).

   As this summary suggests, one of the original weaknesses of the ‘McKeown hypothesis’ was

the lack of correlation between movements in mortality rates and changes in real wages during

the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. The first section of this paper addresses this

issue by reviewing new evidence on real wages which was not available when Wrigley and

Schofield published The population history of England in 1981. The second part of the paper
                                                                                                    5

seeks to fill one of the major gaps in McKeown’s account by presenting new estimates of the

amount of food available for human consumption in England and Wales between 1700 and 1914,

and the third compares this new evidence with existing information about changes in mortality.

Section four examines some of the implications of this evidence for existing arguments about the

relationship between food availability and working capacity during the eighteenth and nineteenth

centuries. The final section returns to the theme of mortality change, and seeks to identify some

of the other factors which also contributed to the decline of mortality during the period under

review.




1. Real wages and mortality, 1770-1850




As we have already seen, one of the original criticisms of McKeown’s argument was the lack of

correlation between his account of mortality change and the available evidence on real wages.

This criticism was summarised by Tony Wrigley (1983: 143) in the following terms:

   In the eighteenth century, as earlier, there is scant evidence of any link between living
   standards and mortality levels. It is probably true that the secular tendency in real wages was
   steadily upwards from the mid-seventeenth to the late-eighteenth century but that thereafter
   there was a sharp fall for about a generation before a resumption in the upward movement in
   the early-nineteenth century. Mortality, however, moved uncertainly between 1680 and 1730
   with no decided trend in spite of rising living standards but thereafter showed a steady if not
   pronounced improvement, even though living standards went through a switchback period in
   the last decades of the eighteenth and the first decades of the nineteenth century (see also
   Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen and Schofield 1997: 201-6, 552).
   Wrigley et al.’s reluctance to accept that movements in real wages were directly related to

mortality changes was shared by Peter Razzell. Although he challenged their view that there was

no significant reduction in mortality rates before 1750, he also argued that the reductions which
                                                                                                     6

did occur were more closely related to changes in personal and domestic hygiene than to

changes in real wages (Razzell 1974: 12-17). In 1993, he summarised his position in the

following terms:

   Real incomes probably rose for most of the population during the first half of the eighteenth
   century. It is thus possible that this improvement played a part in reducing mortality.
   Certainly, the evidence of higher mortality among husbandmen in the early-seventeenth
   century would suggest that economic factors were important during this early period, but the
   weight of evidence suggests that they were not central in bringing about the overall fall in
   mortality. The substantial mortality gains among all the socioeconomic groups discussed in
   this article indicate that noneconomic forces were of primary importance. Only further
   research will definitively settle this issue (Razzell 1993: 766).
   Wrigley and Schofield based their findings on the estimates published by Phelps Brown and

Hopkins in the mid-1950s (Phelps Brown and Hopkins 1955; 1956). Their estimates showed

that real wages fell during the last two decades of the eighteenth century and did not regain their

earlier level before the start of the 1820s (Wrigley and Schofield 1981: 642-4). Although later

authors modified many of the details of this picture, they did not challenge its essentials.

Consequently, by the early-1990s it was widely accepted that real wages rose during the first half

of the eighteenth century and either stagnated or declined after 1750, with little evidence of any

sustained improvement before 1800 or even 1820 (see e.g. Wrigley and Schofield 1981: 642-4;

Lindert and Williamson 1983; 1985; Crafts 1985; Schwarz 1985; Floud and Harris 1997: 95).

   This account of the history of real wage trends came under more radical attack in the mid-

1990s. As Feinstein pointed out, changes in real wages reflect movements in both nominal

wages and prices. He argued that previous attempts to estimate movements in prices had been

undermined by problems associated either with the composition of the price index or the weights

attached to the items within it, and that the real wage indices which were based on these price

indices were also flawed (Feinstein 1995: 8-28). In 1998, he published a revised index of real

wages (or, more precisely, a revised index of real earnings) which radically altered the
                                                                                                                                                                                 7

established picture. It now appeared that real earnings increased – albeit very slowly – during

the final decades of the eighteenth century, and although Feinstein also argued that previous

authors had overestimated the extent of the improvement in real earnings which occurred after

1820, his figures nevertheless suggested that they increased by more than 39 per cent over the

period between 1770 and 1850 as a whole (see Figure 1).

                             Although Feinstein’s own calculations have also been challenged, the basic picture remains

unchanged (see Clark 2001; 2005; Allen 2007). Allen’s (2007) latest reworking of Feinstein’s

figures shows very little difference in the extent of the change in real wages between 1770 and

1820, and only a small increase in the rate of improvement between 1820 and 1850 (see Figure

2). Figure 2 also compares changes in real wages with the revised estimates of life expectancy at

birth which Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen and Schofield published in 1997. Although the new
                                                                                                                                                                                                               8

estimates do not remove all the inconsistency between changes in mortality and movements in

real wages, they do suggest that the two sets of data were much more closely aligned, in the

second half of the eighteenth century, than previous accounts have suggested.

2. The availability of food in England and Wales, 1700-1914




Although McKeown was unable to produce any direct evidence of changes in diet, other writers

have attempted to estimate the nutritional value of the food consumed by working-class families

in different parts of Britain from the late-eighteenth century onwards. Shammas (1984: 256-8;

1990: 134) examined the diets of seven northern and fifteen southern families whose household

budgets were summarised by David Davies and Frederick Morton Eden in the 1780s and 1790s,

and concluded that the average number of calories consumed by each individual was equal to

1734 calories per day in the south of England and 2352 calories per day in the north. Clark,
                                                                                                    9

Huberman and Lindert (1995: 222-3) used the same sources to examine a broader range of

household budgets, and concluded that average calorie consumption was equal to just 1508

calories per day, whilst Oddy (1990: 274) suggested that average consumption among these

families may have been as high as 2028 calories per day.

   As these figures indicate, there is a wide range of variation in the estimates constructed by

different authors even when using the same sources, and these differences are compounded by

the different assumptions which these authors make about the social status of the households

they studied. Oddy (1990: 269) argued that the Davies-Eden surveys ‘provide a cross-section of

rural life in England, since the majority of Davies’ families were from southern England and the

largest group in Eden’s were from the northern counties’, but Clark, Huberman and Lindert

(1995: 222, note 16) claimed that the Davies-Eden households were drawn from the poorest

decile of the population, whereas Shammas (1984: 255-6; 1990: 134) implied that they were

representative of the working class as a whole. However, both Oddy and Clark, Huberman and

Lindert thought that diets did improve during the first half of the nineteenth century. Clark,

Huberman and Lindert estimated that the nutritional value of the diets consumed by working-

class families between 1837 and 1863 ranged between 1974 calories per head per day and 2395

calories, whereas Oddy (using a very similar set of sources) calculated that energy values ranged

between 2300 calories in 1841 and 2600 in 1863 (Oddy 1990: 274).

   Although these figures provide a useful starting-point for the study of dietary trends, they are

merely snapshots, based on the household budgets of a small number of families living at

different points in time in different parts of the country. However, it is possible to supplement

this information by using the available evidence on food production and the import and export of

different foodstuffs to construct an alternative picture of changes in the amount and nature of the
                                                                                                                                              10

food available to the population as a whole. We can then combine this information with

information from other sources to provide new estimates of the amount of energy available to the

British population between the end of the seventeenth century and the outbreak of the First

World War.

       Since the early-1980s, there have been a number of attempts to estimate British agricultural

output in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. King (1696: 53) published figures showing the

annual output of wheat, rye, barley, oats, beans and peas and these figures were reproduced by

Chartres (1985: 444) in his contribution to the Agrarian History of England. Holderness (1989:

145) published comparable estimates of the output of cereals and pulses for 1750, 1800 and

1850, and Allen (1994: 112) combined both sets of figures in his contribution to the second

edition of the Cambridge Economic History of Britain in 1994. However, in 2001, Turner,

Beckett and Afton produced new estimates, based on the actual records of farm inventories.

Their calculations suggest that the previous authors underestimated the level of output (on

average) in 1750 and 1850, and overestimated output in 1800 (see Table 1).

   Although these figures enable us to estimate the total output of these crops, it is important to

remember that only a proportion of the total crop was made available for human consumption,

since some was retained as seed and some was used to feed livestock. We do not have precise

figures for these ratios for England and Wales, but we have attempted to compensate for this

using the estimates made by Gallman (1960: 52) and Towne and Rasmussen (1960: 294-304) to

calculate the value of the crops entering gross product in the United States in the first half of the

nineteenth century. We have also used US data to make allowances for milling losses (United

States Department of Agriculture 1939: 8) and included an additional allowance of ten per cent

for distribution losses. We have used information from John (1989: 1124-5) and the US

Department of Agriculture (1952: 40; 1992: 11, 14) to convert bushels into Imperial pounds, and

we have used McCance and Widdowson’s (1960: 116-7, 138-9) data to calculate energy values.

The final stage was to divide the total number of calories available for human consumption by

the population to estimate the daily consumption of calories by the average person in each year.

   The results of this analysis are summarised in Tables 2 and 3, and set out in more detail in the

Appendices (see Tables A1 and A2). We have included separate estimates based on the initial

output figures supplied by Allen (1994) and Turner, Beckett and Afton (2001) for two reasons.

In the first place, Turner and his co-authors do not have figures for any crops in 1700, or for rye

in 1750, and it may therefore be misleading to compare Allen’s figures for 1700 with their

figures for the later periods. Secondly, even though their figures are based on the direct

observation of farm inventories, the number of records is quite small and may not always be

representative of the entire country (see Thirsk 2002). As a result, it may be more prudent to

regard the two sets of figures as upper- and lower-bound estimates of the number of calories
                                                                                                                                           12

derived from domestically-produced cereals and pulses in the years under review. Although

the differences are not great in terms of the overall trend of calorie consumption, they are not

insignificant. Allen’s figures suggest that the number of calories obtained from these sources

rose between 1750 and 1800 and fell between 1800 and 1850, whereas Turner, Beckett and

Afton’s figures imply that average daily consumption levels declined during both periods.

    The following two rows of Table 3 include calculations showing the number of calories

obtained from domestically-produced meat and dairy products. We have estimated the calorific

value of the food consumed in the form of mutton, lamb, beef, veal, pork and ham using

information obtained from King (1696: 545) and Holderness (1989: 155). We do not have direct

information about the consumption of lard, but have estimated this using figures showing the

consumption of bacon, lard and pork in the United States at the end of the 1870s (Bennett and

Pierce 1961: 114-5). We have used Holderness’ (1989: 170) data to estimate the number of

calories derived from cheese, butter and milk in 1750, 1800 and 1850, and extrapolated from the

data on meat and dairy products in 1750 to estimate the number of calories which might have

been obtained from dairy products fifty years earlier.

   Table 3 also includes estimates showing the number of calories obtained from

domestically-obtained fish, garden vegetables, fruit, nuts and potatoes. The figures for fish,

garden vegetables, fruit and nuts are derived from the Royal Society’s investigation into the food

supply of the United Kingdom before the First World War, and we have assumed – in the

absence of any other information – that these figures remained constant over the whole of the

period (Parliamentary Papers 1917). The figures for potatoes are extrapolated from Salaman’s

(1949: 434, 539, 613) figures for 1600, 1775, 1795, 1814, 1838 and 1851, but we have assumed

that the figure provided by Salaman for the last of these years should have been 0.70, rather than

0.07. The results illustrate the growing importance of the potato in the average British diet, as

consumption rose from 53 calories per head per day at the start of our period to 255 calories per

head at the beginning of the 1850s, but the total amount of energy derived from domestically-

produced foodstuffs declined by between 212 and 253 calories over the same period.

   The apparent inability of domestic agriculture to keep pace with the needs of an expanding

population meant that Britain became increasingly reliant on imported foodstuffs. We have used

information from Mitchell (1988: 221-2) and from the Annual Accounts (Parliamentary Papers

1849a; 1849b; 1851; 1853) to calculate the amount of energy derived from imported cereals

between 1700 and 1850, after making similar allowances for losses due to milling and

distribution to those made when calculating the energy derived from domestically-produced

cereals. Our estimates suggest that Britain moved from being a net exporter of cereals to a net

importer during the first half of the nineteenth century. Throughout the period, the main form of

cereal involved in these transactions was wheat, but after 1800 Britain began to import

increasing quantities of oats, barley and especially maize, which provided about one-fifth of the

energy derived from imported cereals during the middle years of the nineteenth century.
                                                                                                       15

    The first half of the nineteenth century also saw the importation of small quantities of

meat, dairy products, wines and spirits, and fruit and nuts, but the most striking development was

the dramatic increase in the volume of imported sugar. According to Schumpeter (1960: 52-5),

Britain imported just under 10 pounds of sugar per head at the start of the eighteenth century, but

this figure increased by more than 150 per cent between 1700 and 1850, and even after allowing

for re-exports, the number of calories obtained from sugar rose from 28 calories per head per day

at the start of the period to 136 calories in 1850. However, the rate of increase accelerated

dramatically after this date. The figures provided by the Royal Society in 1917 suggest that the

average consumer derived the equivalent of 395 calories per day from sugar in the years

immediately preceding the First World War.

    When the figures for domestically-produced and imported food are taken together, they

present an intriguing picture of the main trends in food consumption in Britain between 1700 and

1914. A number of authors have suggested that UK food production failed to keep pace with the

growth of population during the second half of the eighteenth century and that Britain was facing

a ‘Malthusian crisis’ before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars (see e.g. Komlos 1993a;

1993b), but our figures suggest that the amount of energy derived from domestically-produced

food remained roughly constant during the course of the eighteenth century, and only began to

decline consistently after 1800. However, the most important change was the increase in the

amount of energy derived from imported foods. The combined effect of these changes was that

even though energy values either fell or remained broadly constant during the first half of the

eighteenth century, they rose between 1750 and 1800 and between 1800 and 1850. They then

rose much more rapidly between 1850 and 1914.

    Our estimates also enable us to calculate the ways in which the composition of the average

diet changed over the course of the period. At the start of the eighteenth century, it seems likely

that the average person obtained more than sixty per cent of their total calories from cereals.
                                                                                                     17

This figure declined during the course of the century but the British population still obtained

more than half their calories from these sources in 1850. The proportion of calories derived from

meat and dairy products increased during the first half of the eighteenth century but declined

between 1750 and 1850, and only regained its earlier level between 1909 and 1913. There were

also small increases in the proportion of calories obtained from fruit and vegetables and a much

larger increase in the proportion derived from imported sugar, but the proportion of calories

derived from fish remained very low throughout the period (see Table 6).




3. The availability of food in England and Wales, 1700-1914




What do these calculations tell us about the adequacy of the diets available to the British

population at the start of the eighteenth century, and about the relationship between nutrition and

mortality between 1700 and 1914? Livi-Bacci (1991: 27) has claimed that ‘a population which

could rely on a normal consumption of 2000 calories per head would have been, in centuries

past, an adequately-fed population, at least from the point of view of energy’, and this figure is

lower than any of the figures which we have calculated for the British population in either 1700

or 1750. However, this argument fails to take account of the impact of inequalities in the

distribution of food within the population (see also Fogel 1993: 12; 1994: 373-4). Even though

the new figures on food consumption are higher than some of our earlier figures, a significant

proportion of the population might still have experienced a diet which fell below Livi-Bacci’s

measure of sufficiency.

Notes. We have calculated that the average daily consumption of ‘cottage produce’ in 1909-13 was equal to 135 calories per head. The Royal Society estimated
that the total number of calories from this source was equivalent to one-half of the calories obtained from home-produced poultry, eggs and vegetables, and one-
third of the calories obtained from home-produced fruit. We have used these figures to estimate the proportion of the calories derived from ‘cottage produce’
which may be allocated to each of the other categories. For further information, see Parliamentary Papers 1917: 7.

                                                                                                   19

   It is also important to consider the ways in which food was distributed within the

household. It is now widely acknowledged that women received less pay than men during the

second half of the eighteenth century, and a number of authors have argued that this imbalance

was reflected in the allocation of food (see e.g. Eden 1797: 47; Oren 1974: 221; Nicholas and

Oxley 1993: 737). Several nineteenth- and twentieth-century commentators also noted that

women in poorer families tended to receive smaller amounts of food (Harris 1998: 418; 2008:

173, 194). These ‘customs’ had a damaging effect on the health of the women themselves and

may also have impaired the health of their children if their mothers continued to receive

inadequate diets during pregnancy (Osmani and Sen 2003: 114-8).

   Recent research has also cast doubt on the extent to which it is possible to judge the

adequacy of historical diets using the standards applied to well-nourished populations living

under modern industrial conditions. When McKeown examined the relationship between

nutrition and mortality, he was primarily concerned with the ways in which inadequate nutrition

impaired resistance to infection, and he failed to consider the ways in which exposure to

infection might damage ‘nutrition’. It is well-known that many infections can lead to a loss of

appetite and that infection increases the body’s need for nutritional resources (Eveleth and

Tanner 1976: 246), but infection can also have a dramatic effect on the body’s ability to digest

the nutrients which are consumed. Uauy (1985) found that people living in less-developed

countries showed signs of sub-clinical nutrient malabsorption which meant that they were

unlikely to digest more than ninety per cent of the nutrients they consumed, whilst a second

study showed that undernourished individuals and individuals who had recently experienced

episodes of acute diarrhoea absorbed less than eighty per cent of nutrients (Dasgupta and Ray

1990: 215).
                                                                                                    20

   The absorption of nutrients can also be influenced by the composition of the diet. As we

have already seen, people living in preindustrial and early-industrial Britain derived a high

proportion of their energy from cereals, but Dasgupta and Ray (1990: 215-6) have argued that

the consumption of a high-fibre diet also leads to a significant reduction in nutrient retention.

Their overall conclusion was that individuals living under preindustrial conditions in the modern

world needed to increase their total consumption by more than 35 per cent to derive the same

nutritional benefit from the food they consumed as people living under more favourable

conditions.

   In view of these arguments, it is particularly intriguing to compare our new estimates of the

main trends in food consumption with the chronology of changes in height and mortality. As

Floud and Harris (1997: 96, 101-2) have demonstrated, both the average height of the population

and average levels of life expectancy rose between circa 1750 and 1820, followed by a period of

stagnation or decline, and then further improvement from the 1850s onwards. These trends are

broadly consistent with our new estimates of food availability (certainly for the periods 1750-

1800 and 1850-1914), and help to reinforce the link between nutrition and mortality which

McKeown could only infer when he attempted to account for the modern rise of population in

the 1970s (see also Figure 3). However, one of the main themes of our argument has been to

emphasise the synergistic nature of the relationship between nutrition and infection, and it would

certainly not be correct to conclude that dietary change was the only reason for improvements in

either height or life expectancy.

4. Food availability and work intensity




In recent years, arguments about diet and nutrition have played an increasingly important part in

debates about the origins and nature of Britain’s industrial revolution. Voth (2000) has

examined changes in the length of the working year over the course of the eighteenth century and

De Vries (2008) has incorporated these arguments into his account of an ‘industrious revolution’

in Britain and other parts of Europe and North America over the same period. Although these

arguments are not directly concerned with either diet or nutrition, they do make important

assumptions about the amount of food available to support the work involved.
                                                                                                     22

   Arguments about diet and nutrition have also played an important part in Allen’s (2009)

attempt to answer the question of why Britain became ‘the first industrial nation’ (Mathias

2001). He argued that the high cost of labour in Britain provided manufacturers with the

necessary incentive to invest in the new technologies which defined the new industrial era.

Although this argument was based primarily on comparisons of national wage rates, he also drew

on nutritional data to support his claim that British workers and their families enjoyed a much

higher standard of living before industrialisation than their continental counterparts.

   As Allen (2009: 38) has pointed out, actual food requirements vary according to age, gender

and body size. He therefore argued that it was appropriate to assume that the nutritional needs of

‘a family with a father, a mother and some children’ were equivalent to those of three adult

males. He then used this formula to estimate the number of calories available per adult male at

different income levels in 1843 (Allen 2009: 47).

   Allen acknowledged that these estimates had been framed ‘rather loosely’ (Allen 2009: 38).

However, it is possible to make the frame somewhat tighter by using current information on the

dietary requirements of men and women at different ages and combining this information with

data on the age- and sex-structure of the British population between 1700 and 1914. We can

then use the results of this exercise to calculate the factors which should be used to convert our

estimates of the number of calories available per head into new estimates of the number of

calories available per adult male equivalent.

   The relevant data are shown in Table 7 below. The figures in columns 1-3 show the number

of calories required by males and females in each group as a fraction of the calories required by

an average male between the ages of 20 and 39. These figures have then been multiplied by the

percentage of the population in each age-group to estimate the total food requirements of all the
                                                                                                       23

individuals in that age-group in each period, and these figures have been added together to

estimate the conversion factors for the population as a whole. We can then use these figures to

estimate the number of calories available per adult male equivalent in each period (Table 8). The

results suggest that this figure increased from just under 3000 calories per adult male equivalent

(or per consuming unit) at the start of the eighteenth century to nearly 4000 calories on the eve of

the First World War. Since it is obviously unreasonable to assume that all individuals consumed

the same amounts of food (in relation to their physiological needs), it is also important to take

some account of the likely impact of inequalities in the distribution of food on the health of

different sections of the population. In a series of earlier publications, Fogel argued that ‘all of

the known distributions of the average daily consumption of calories for populations are …

reasonably well-described by the lognormal distribution’ and that it was plausible to assume that

the most likely value for the coefficient of variation for the populations of both Britain and

France at the end of the eighteenth century was 0.3 (Fogel 1989: 39; see also ibid. 1992: 268;

1993: 10-13; 1994: 374). If this assumption is applied to the current estimates of the amount of

food which was available for human consumption in England and Wales, the results suggest that

approximately twenty per cent of the British population is likely to have received fewer than

2500 calories per consuming unit at the start of the nineteenth century (see Table 9).

    What do these figures imply about the relationship between diet and working capacity in the

eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? The World Health Organisation, in association with the

Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the United Nations University, has

estimated the number of calories required by men and women of different sizes and at different

ages engaged in different levels of physical activity, and we can combine this information with

our knowledge of the heights and weights of British men in the nineteenth and early-twentieth

centuries to estimate the calorific needs of such individuals during this period. The results are

shown in Table 10. They imply that the number of calories required to enable an adult male to

satisfy his basic metabolic requirements and perform a full day’s work is likely to have ranged

from approximately 2400 calories per day for light work to 3500 calories per day for heavy

work. However, our figures suggest that the number of calories available for consumption is

unlikely to have reached the latter figure before the second half of the nineteenth century.

Notes.
(1) The height data are based on the heights of military recruits in 1800, 1850 and 1910-14.
(2) The average weights of recruits in 1800 and 1850 have been estimated using the BMIs of men who were born in the first two decades of the nineteenth
    century and measured between 1826 and 1849, when they were between the ages of 26 and 30.
(3) The numbers of calories required for basal metabolism have been estimated using the following formula: BMR = 15.3W + 679, where BMR = Calories
    required for basal metabolism and W = weight in kilograms. The FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation (1985: 178) also recommends an alternative
    formula, using both height and weight, but the results are almost identical when the alternative formula is applied to these data.

   These figures imply that a significant proportion of the British population may not have

had access to the number of calories which they needed to undertake physically-demanding work

on a regular basis at the start of the nineteenth century. The increase in the amount of food

which was available for human consumption therefore helped to improve the working capacity

of the population as a whole by enabling a larger proportion of the potential workforce to

contribute in this way. However, there is also evidence to suggest that many families responded

to this situation by transferring resources from women and children to male breadwinners. Many

contemporary observers, such as the mid-nineteenth century medical officer, Dr Edward Smith,

saw this as a rational response, because it enabled the male breadwinner to remain in work and

therefore contribute to the wellbeing of the family as a whole (Parliamentary Papers 1864: 249).

However, it also contributed to the undernutrition of other household members, and the effects of

this were likely to have been reflected, not only in the poor nutritional status of working-class

children, but also in the premature mortality of their mothers (Harris 1998; 2008).




5. Other factors associated with the decline of mortality




When McKeown outlined his analysis of the causes of mortality decline, he argued that some

part of this decline could be attributed to changes in the relationship between infective organisms

and their hosts if the organisms themselves became less virulent, or if the human population

became more resistant to infection as a result of genetic selection. He acknowledged that ‘scarlet

fever is the outstanding example of an infection in which the relation between host and parasite

is unstable, and the decline of mortality since the mid-nineteenth century can be attributed

confidently to a change in the character of the disease’ (McKeown 1976: 82), but he was
                                                                                                                29

unwilling to concede that similar factors might have contributed to declines in mortality from

other diseases. Nevertheless, it is certainly possible to argue that he underestimated the overall

significance of this effect in his overall schema, given the extent of the contribution made by this

disease to the decline of mortality as a whole in England and Wales between 1861/70 and

1891/1900 (Harris 2004a: 398-400).

    Although few historians would deny that the decline of mortality from scarlet fever was

associated with changes in the virulence of the disease itself, the role played by disease virulence

in the decline of tuberculosis has recently become rather more controversial. Woods (2000: 336,

340, 359) argued that mortality from phthisis, or respiratory tuberculosis, ‘appears to have

declined in nearly all districts regardless of the initial rate or whether the place had urban or rural

characteristics’, and that ‘the simplest explanation is that the disease became less virulent and …

this was the principal reason for a reduction in the risk of disease developing and leading to early

death’ (see also Woods and Shelton 1997: 143-4). However, Woods was unable to provide any

direct evidence for this assertion, and his interpretation has been challenged by a number of

leading authorities (see e.g. Landers 2000: 468; Szreter 2001: 563).2 In 1976, when McKeown

himself discussed this issue, he concluded that ‘there is no evidence that the virulence of the

organism has changed significantly; the disease continues to have devastating effects in

populations not previously exposed to it; and the virulence of the bacillus appears not to have

diminished when it has been possible to assess it in the laboratory’ (McKeown 1976: 83).




2
    Stephen Kunitz (2007: 196) has recently suggested that virulence may have declined as a result of reduced
    exposure. However, although he regarded this proposal as ‘conceivable’, he also acknowledged that it was
    ‘highly speculative’.
                                                                                                    30

   Although it seems unlikely that the decline in tuberculosis mortality can be attributed

either to changes in the virulence of the tubercle bacillus or to any changes in the genetic

susceptibility of the human population (see McKeown 1976: 83-4), it is possible that changes in

the nature of infectious disease have affected patterns of mortality in other ways. As Kunitz and

Engerman have argued, the main causes of premature death in the sixteenth and seventeenth

centuries were epidemic or pandemic diseases, but these either became less important (in the

case of plague) or more endemic (in the case of smallpox) in the eighteenth century. They

argued that the transition from epidemic and pandemic diseases to endemic diseases meant that

social factors, such as personal hygiene, domestic sanitary arrangements and nutritional status,

played an increasingly important part in the determination of death rates as the century

progressed, and this was one of the main reasons for the emergence of a ‘social gradient’ in

health and mortality from the 1750s onwards (Kunitz and Engerman 1992: 33).

   Historians of mortality change have often tended to pay particular attention to the

relationship between real wages and diet, but it is also important to consider the impact of real

wages on other items of consumption, including housing. During the early stages of the

industrial revolution, it is widely accepted that housing conditions deteriorated in both urban and

rural areas, but conditions began to improve from the 1850s onwards. These improvements were

caused partly by the introduction of new bye-laws which established higher standards for the

construction of new housing, but also by the increase in the value of real wages, which enabled

more households to afford a higher standard of accommodation. However, it was not until 1919

that the state began to make a concerted attempt to provide subsidised housing for working-class

tenants and even then it decided to concentrate on the construction of new housing at the upper

end of the working-class market. The government only began to launch a direct assault on the
                                                                                                  31

problem of the slums following the introduction of the Greenwood Housing Act of 1930,

which offered a more generous form of subsidy to local authorities that linked the construction of

new housing to the demolition of slum properties and formed the basis of public housing policy

for the remainder of the decade (Harris 2004b: 125-35, 245-54).

   As we have already seen, the debate over the causes of mortality decline has often appeared

to be polarised between those who apportion a dominant role to ‘living standards’ (and, by

implication, diet) and those who prefer to emphasise the role of public action and, especially,

sanitary intervention, but it is clear that, even during the eighteenth century, there were a number

of ways in which individual communities could act collectively to reduce mortality risk. Dobson

(1997) has shown how the marshland communities of Essex, Kent and Sussex were able to

reduce mortality from malaria by instituting drainage schemes, and Razzell (1965; 1977: 140-58)

and Mercer (1985; 1990: 46-73) have provided strong grounds for believing that the introduction

of inoculation and vaccination played a major role in the decline of smallpox mortality from the

1750s onwards. These efforts were complemented by the measures taken by local bodies in the

market towns of southern England and London to improve the quality of the urban environment

during the same period (Jones and Falkus 1990; Porter 1991; Landers 1993). However, it is

difficult to reach any categorical conclusions about the overall impact of these measures,

particularly in the poorest and most rapidly-growing areas. Hennock (1957: 117) argued that the

Improvement Commissioners who were primarily responsible for urban government in the late-

eighteenth century ‘were primarily concerned with the comfort of the wealthier citizens…. As

measures of sanitary reform, their value was marginal. For the same reason, they are not

conclusive evidence that there existed an effective local public opinion in favour of sanitary

reform’.
                                                                                                   32

   Despite the best intentions of late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century reformers, there

seems little doubt that their efforts were insufficient to cope with the rapidly-expanding pace of

urban growth during the first half of the nineteenth century. As Wohl (1984: 4) has shown, the

period between 1800 and 1850 saw a dramatic increase in the proportion of the population who

lived in towns and in the size of the towns in which they lived, and both Szreter and Mooney

(1998: 104) and Woods (2000: 360-80) have argued that this led to an absolute deterioration in

the standard of public health in many urban areas. Szreter (1997: 64) suggested that the rapidity

of urban growth gave rise to the ‘four Ds’ of disruption, deprivation, disease and death, and that

these features continued to blight the lives of Britain’s urban citizens for much of the nineteenth

century.

   One of the most important aspects of early-nineteenth century urban growth was the

deterioration in the quality and quantity of the water supply. As Hassan (1985: 533, 538, 543)

has shown, it was already apparent by the end of the eighteenth century that many local

authorities lacked the resources to maintain an adequate water supply. During the first half of

the nineteenth century Parliament had encouraged them to transfer responsibility for water

provision to private companies, but by 1850 ‘significant sections of Victorian public opinion’

had come to the conclusion that it was inefficient ‘to leave the profitable activities of water, gas,

electricity and urban transport to unregulated private enterprise’ and there was widespread

support for the view that these utilities should be restored to municipal ownership. However,

although there was a rapid increase in the number of municipally-owned water companies after

1850, it is difficult to say how far this may have contributed to any immediate improvement in

urban health standards. This was partly because a substantial proportion of the increased supply

of water was reserved for industrial use, and partly because ‘the direct environmental benefits of
                                                                                                      33

increased water deliveries for sanitary purposes were probably limited before the whole range

of water services, including sewage treatment and river conservancy, were modernised’.

    In view of the close association between the improvement of water supplies and the broader

concerns of sanitary engineering, it is clearly important to pay close attention to the chronology

of nineteenth-century sanitary reform. As Michael Flinn and others have demonstrated, there

was a significant growth of interest in the need for sanitary reform in the 1830s and 1840s, and

this culminated in the passage of the Public Health Act of 1848, but this was a largely permissive

piece of legislation which had relatively little impact, at least in the short term, on the largest

urban centres (Flinn 1965: 18-43; Harris 2004b: 110). Szreter (1988: 22) argued that the real

beginning of sanitary reform occurred in the 1870s, when local authorities began to borrow much

larger sums of money from the Local Government Board for public health purposes, but Bell and

Millward (1998: 232-7) have argued that local authorities only began to invest substantial

amounts of money in sewerage systems during the 1890s and early-1900s. Their conclusions are

reinforced by our own analysis of the Local Government Board’s loan figures, which shows that

the value of the loans provided to local sanitary authorities rose from £2.56 million in 1890 to a

peak of just over £12 million eleven years later (Figure 4).

       These findings have important implications for the debate about the causes and timing of the

decline of mortality in England and Wales in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.

They suggest that, even though sanitary reform may have made a significant contribution to the

decline of mortality before 1900, it is likely to have played an even more decisive role after that

date, as the scale of public health investment increased. Recent historians of public health have

tended to concentrate the bulk of their attention on the second half of the nineteenth century, but

these figures reinforce the case for believing that more attention should now be paid to the early

years of the twentieth century (see also Harris 2004a: 405).
                                                                                                  35

   The most dramatic improvements in mortality in the nineteenth century were concentrated

among those between the ages of five and 44, whereas the twentieth century also witnessed

substantial improvements in the survival prospects of infants and older adults (Wohl 1984: 329).

It is tempting to assume that these developments must have reflected the impact of other changes

which also occurred after 1900 but there is an impressive body of evidence which suggests that

they should also be seen in the context of the more long-term improvement in health status which

began around 1850.

   In recent years, a growing number of researchers have paid increasing attention to the impact

of cohort, or life-course, approaches to the study of mortality change, and such cohort factors

may have played an important role in the decline of both infant mortality and older-age

mortality. Baird (1974: 330, 334-5, 340; 1975: 139) suggested that women who were born

during the economic recession of the late-1920s and early-1930s were more likely to give birth

to low-birth-weight infants at the end of their own pregnancies, and Kramer (1987: 718) argued

that ‘maternal height and pre-pregnancy weight, though listed as direct determinants [of birth-

weight] may themselves be affected by the mother’s intrauterine and postnatal growth which

depend, in part, on her mother’s pregnancy and on subsequent nutritional and environmental

influences during childhood’. However, whilst most authorities seem to agree that there is some

relationship between a mother’s foetal environment and the health of her own offspring, the

precise nature of this relationship remains unclear. Lumey (1998: 132) argued that

undernutrition of the grandmother and thus of the mother during the first trimester of her own

gestation had no effect on the mother’s own birth weight but did affect the birth weight of her

children, whilst undernutrition in the third trimester of gestation affected the mother’s birth

weight but not that of her infants.
                                                                                                     36

   In view of these arguments, it is important to consider the extent to which changes in the

health of adult females during the last thirty years of the nineteenth century may have

contributed to the decline of infant mortality in the twentieth century, but the evidence for such a

relationship is far from clear. Floud (1998: 11) found that there were ‘insufficient observations’

to draw any conclusions about trends in the heights and weights of women born during the

second half of the nineteenth century, but Millward and Bell (2001) have suggested that it might

be possible to infer levels of maternal nutrition from the death rate from tuberculosis among

women of child-bearing age. However, even though they found that there was a close

relationship between the tuberculosis mortality rate and infant mortality before 1900, there is

little evidence to suggest that this factor can also account for the acceleration in the rate of infant

mortality decline after this date.

   Although it is difficult, on the basis of current knowledge, to attach too much importance to

the impact of life-course effects on the decline of infant mortality, that does not mean we should

ignore their effect on the decline of mortality at older ages. Since the mid-1980s, a great deal of

attention has been focused on the possible impact of developments before and immediately after

the time of birth on health in later life (see e.g. Barker, Eriksson, Forsén and Osmond 2002), but

this research has not been accepted uncritically (see e.g. Lancet 2001) and it is also important to

recognise the extent to which developments at older ages can also influence susceptibility to

disease. Davey Smith et al. (2001: 113) found that ‘two … conditions – stroke and stomach

cancer – appear to be particularly responsive to early-life influences whilst others – coronary

heart disease, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, breast cancer and suicide – appear to be

influenced by socially-patterned exposures acting right across life’, and a third set of conditions,

such as lung cancer, ‘appear to be mostly determined by … factors … in adulthood’. They
                                                                                                    37

concluded that ‘there is no single answer to the question … on whether deprivation in

childhood or adulthood is a more important determinant of adult mortality risk’.

   One of the main problems in evaluating the impact of life course factors on historical

changes in adult mortality is the difficulty of finding an appropriate proxy for health in early life.

If improvements in foetal and infant health were the main reason for the decline of adult

mortality in the first half of the twentieth century, one might expect to find stronger evidence of a

relationship between changes in infant mortality and subsequent changes in adult mortality but,

as we have already seen, the infant mortality rate did not begin to decline in Britain until the

decline in death rates among older children and young adults was already underway. However,

there does appear to be a much more obvious relationship between changes in child mortality

and the decline of adult mortality. In 1934, Kermack, McKendrick and McKinlay showed that

when the death rate experienced by each age group was expressed as a percentage of the death

rate for that age-group in the 1840s, ‘each generation after the age of five years seems to carry

along with it the same relative mortality throughout adult life, and even into old age’, and this led

them to conclude that the ‘care of children during their first 10-15 years of life is of supreme

importance. It is at this period … that improved environment exercises its effects most

promptly, and … the improved physique built up during this period would seem to be of decisive

effect at all later ages’ (Kermack, McKendrick and McKinlay 1934: 699, 702).

   These arguments are reinforced by evidence of changes in human stature. The average

height of the population from which army recruits were drawn increased, albeit inconsistently,

between the birth cohorts of the 1740s and the 1820s and declined between the birth cohorts of

the 1820s and the early-1850s, before resuming its upward path from the early-1850s onwards

(Floud, Wachter and Gregory 1990: 134-54). The increase in the average height of men born
                                                                                                    38

after circa 1850 coincided with the onset of the decline in child mortality, and the cohorts

which experienced these improvements also experienced lower rates of age-specific mortality

throughout the life-course. Although these findings do not necessarily provide unequivocal

support for McKeown’s view that the decline of mortality was caused by improvements in diet,

they do provide further evidence of the link between improvements in child health and the

subsequent decline of adult mortality (Floud, Wachter and Gregory 1990: 313-4; Harris 1994:

312; 2001: 693).

   Although these findings continue to provide strong support for a life-course approach to the

understanding of mortality change, they also suggest that researchers need to look beyond a

straightforward focus on the health and nutrition of the future child in the womb. Bengtsson and

Lindström (2000) found that there was a close relationship between infant mortality in four

Swedish parishes and the mortality rates experienced by the survivors of these cohorts between

the ages of 55 and eighty, and suggested that this was a consequence not so much of access to

nutrients (either in the womb or during infancy), but exposure to infection. There are obvious

problems in applying this directly to England and Wales in the absence of any similar

relationship between infant mortality and mortality at older ages, but their emphasis on the

relationship between childhood infection and later-life mortality may still have an important part

to play in enhancing our understanding of the relationship between the decline of child mortality

and the decline of adult mortality during the first half of the twentieth century (see also Finch

and Crimmins 2004).

6. Conclusions




As this paper has demonstrated, the relationship between food, income and health has continued

to be the subject of considerable controversy. Although Thomas McKeown argued that

improvements in the quality and quantity of the human diet were primarily responsible for the

decline of mortality in Britain from the beginning of the eighteenth century, several writers have

criticised this view. One of the major sources of objection was the lack of correlation between

movements in real wages and life expectancy and the absence of direct information about food

availability.

    This paper has sought to address these issues in two ways. In the first place, we have

summarised the new evidence on changes in real wages which has come to light since

McKeown’s findings were originally published. Although these findings do not remove all the

inconsistencies between the movement of real wages and changes in life expectancy, they do

suggest that the two series were much more closely aligned, during the second half of the

eighteenth century, than previous accounts have suggested.

    The second aim of the paper was to present new estimates regarding the availability of food

in England and Wales between 1700 and 1914. Although some of the results are mixed, our

overall conclusion is that the number of calories available for human consumption per head per

day increased by between 200 and 250 calories over the course of the eighteenth century and by

between thirty and one hundred calories between 1800 and 1850. This was followed by a much

larger increase in food availability between 1850 and 1914.
                                                                                                   40

   Our evidence also shows that there were significant changes in the composition of the

British diet over this period. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, about two-thirds of the

calories consumed by the average Briton were likely to have been derived from cereals.

However, by the early years of the twentieth century, the proportion of calories derived from

cereals had halved and the proportions derived from fruit and vegetables, and from meat and

dairy products, had increased substantially. Although some authors have recently highlighted the

increased importance of the role played by processed foods in British diets during the course of

the nineteenth century (see Clayton and Rowbotham 2008a; 2008b; 2008c), the potentially

negative aspects of this change may still have been outweighed by the improvement in the

nutritional composition of the average diet and the overall increase in the number of calories.

   The nutritional adequacy of a diet depends on the size of the body which the diet is required

to sustain and on the amount of work which the same body is required to perform. In order to

estimate the adequacy of the diet which was available in Britain at different points in time, we

have also calculated the number of calories available per ‘consuming unit’ or ‘adult male

equivalent’ and compared this with the available information about the average heights and

weights of British men in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This exercise demonstrated

that the average number of calories per consuming unit was well below the level needed to

enable an 18-30 year old man to perform a full day’s worth of physically-demanding labour

during much of the period under review. However, it is also important to recognise that the costs

of any shortfall may not have been shared equally – either within the household or within society

as a whole. During the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, many contemporary observers

noted that adult women and children regularly consumed a smaller share of the available food

than their husbands and fathers. Even if it were possible to justify this on the grounds that it was
                                                                                                     41

essential to maintain the strength of the primary breadwinner, it may still have contributed to

the stunted bodies of many working-class children and the high mortality rates of their mothers.

   Although we have paid particular attention to the importance of diet and the estimation of

food availability, this paper has not been designed to offer a monocausal explanation for

mortality change. In the first place, it is important to recognise that a diet which may prove

adequate under one set of environmental circumstances may prove wholly inadequate under a

different set of circumstances, and therefore it is essential to take full account of what Nevin

Scrimshaw and others have called the ‘synergistic’ relationship between infection and nutrition

(see e.g. Scrimshaw, Taylor and Gordon 1968; Scrimshaw and SanGiovanni 1997; Scrimshaw

2000). Secondly, it is also important to recognise the wide range of additional factors which also

influenced changes in mortality during our period.

   Although we have identified a range of such ‘additional factors’, two are of particular

importance. In the first place, it is important to recognise the impact of environmental

degradation in general, and urbanisation in particular, on the history of public health in Britain

during the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century. The rising tide of urbanisation was

associated with a reduction in the average heights of men who were born during the second

quarter of the nineteenth century and was at least partly responsible for the absence of any

further progress in aggregate life-expectancy rates over the course of the same period. As a

result, it is also important to acknowledge the vital contribution made by sanitary reform to the

decline of mortality after circa 1870. However, our findings suggest that the greatest increases

in spending on the sanitary infrastructure only became apparent at the very end of the nineteenth

century and during the early years of the twentieth century. A lot of attention has been paid in
                                                                                                    42

recent years to the impact of sanitary reform before 1900 but our evidence suggests that it was

likely to have played an even greater role after that date.

   The second key factor is the importance of a cohort-based or life-course approach to the

understanding of mortality decline. As Kermack, McKendrick and McKinlay pointed out in

1934, the first generation to experience declining mortality in the second half of the nineteenth

century were the men and women who were born towards the end of the 1840s. The decline in

mortality began when these individuals were between the ages of five and nine and then started

to affect each succeeding age-group as the century progressed, but there was little improvement

in the scale of older-age mortality before the start of the twentieth century. This pattern of age-

specific mortality decline suggests that, in order to understand at least some of the causes of the

decline of mortality at older ages, we still need to pay more attention to the factors which

contributed to an improvement in the life-chances of these individuals during their earlier years.

Notes. Energy values have been calculated using the original figures, with the following exceptions: wheat: 95 calories per ounce (rather than 103 calories); oats:
114 calories per ounce (rather than 109); maize: 104 calories per ounce (rather than 97); sugar: 112 calories per ounce (rather than 114); potatoes: 23 calories per
ounce (rather than 27). The population has been taken to be 45.2 million (in accordance with the original estimates).
