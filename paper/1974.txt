Private Investment in R&D to Signal Ability to PerformGovernment Contracts



                                    ABSTRACT


          Official government statistics on the "mission—distribution" of

     U.S. R&D investment are based on the assumption that only the government

     sponsors military R&D. In this paper we advance and test the

     alternative hypothesis, that a significant share of privately—financed

     industrial R&D is military in orientation. We argue that in addition to

     (prior to) contracting with firms to perform military R&D, the

     government deliberately encourages firms     to   sponsor defense research at

     their own   expense,   to enable the government to identify the firms most

     capable of performing certain government contracts, particularly those

     for major weapons systems. To test the hypothesis of, and estimate the

     quantity of, private investment in 'signaling' R&D, we estimate variants

     of a model of company R&D expenditure on longitudinal, firm—level data,

     including detailed data on federal contracts. Our       estimates   imply that

     about 30 percent of U.S. private industrial R&D expenditure in 1984 was

     procurement— (largely defense—) related, and that almost half of the

     increase in private R&D between 1979 and 1984 was stimulated by the

     increase in Federal demand.

                   Private Investment in R&D to Signal

                 Ability to Perform Government Contracts



                          Frank R. Lichtenberg



     The U.S. defense buildup that began in 1979 has intensified the

public debate about the size and rate of growth of the defense budget in

general, and defense-related R&D expenditure in particular. A key issue

in the debate about defense R&D is whether too large or too small a

fraction of the natio&s scientific and technical resources are being

allocated to defense, as opposed to civilian, research. If there were

extensive technological spillovers from defense-oriented research to

civilian-oriented research, the distinction between the two would be

neither very meaningful nor very important. In our view, however, there

is little empirical evidence to support the claim that much recent or

planned military research is likely to benefit civilian technologies.1

Explanations for the low and possibly declining rate of spillover have

been offered by Thurow (1986), among others.

     If the tradeoff between the nation's ability to promote military and

civilian technological progress is fairly steep, a correct accounting of

the distribution of national investment in R&D by "mission" (defense vs.

civilian) appears to be a worthwhile objective. I submit that at least

some of the government's official statistics concerning the mission-

distribution of R&D are misleading in this regard. According to data




        brief survey of some empirical evidence on the incidence of
spillovers from military to civilian research is presented in Lichten—
berg (1985).
                                                                           2



published by the National Science Board and the National Science Foun-

dation, only the government, and not private industry, sponsors (fi-

nances) defense—related R&D; the private sector sponsors only civilian

R&D. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical explanation

for, and to test empirically, the alternative hypothesis, that industrial

contractors sponsor a significant amount of military R&D, due to incen-

tives deliberately provided to them by the government to do so. We also

provide estimates of the quantity (and share) of private R&D investment

that is induced by federal procurement and, hence, is largely military in

orientation.

     As we observe in the next section, previous investigators have

provided various kinds of evidence of private investment in R&D oriented

toward defense and other federal government missions. Such investment

occurs because the government establishes rewards for, and subsidizes the

costs of, procurement-related R&D expenditure. What has not, in our

opinion, been adequately explained, is why it is in the government's

interest to encourage this investment. After all, the government can

directly contract with firms to perform R&D on its behalf. The govern-

ment contracted with industrial firms for $20.2 billion worth of R&D in

1983, almot one—third the total value of R&D performed by these firms.

Since it engages in such extensive contracting for R&D services, why does

the government evidently also provide firms with incentives to sponsor

relevant R&D on their own? From a different perspective, under what

conditions might the government seek to induce private investment in a

particular area of R&D, rather than directly contracting for this R&D?

    We attempt to provide answers to these questions in Section II of

the paper. Our explanation is based on the assumption that in some cases
                                                                            3




the government has imperfect information about the ability of various

potential contractors to perform a given R&D contract (or other contracts

involving great technical uncertainty). In these cases, the government

invites firms to "signal" their ability to perform the contract: it

sponsors  "design and technical competitions." Signaling entails the
utilization of contractors' R&D personnel and facilities. For a signal
to   effectively convey information about contractor ability, the cost of

generating the signal (R&D investment) must be at least partially borne

by the prospective contractor, rather than by the government.

      In Section III of the paper, we propose an econometric model for

testing the hypothesis that federal procurement in general, and procure-

ment via design and technical competition in general, induces consider-

able private R&D investment. Variants of this model are estimated on

longitudinal, firm—level data on R&D investment, sales, and government

contracts obtained from the Compustat General Annual Industrial File and

the Federal Procurement Data System. In Section IV we report estimates

of the model and compute from them the aggregate quantity (and share in

total R&D investment) of private R&D induced by federal procurement. A

suimnary and concluding remarks are presented in Section V.



                                    II




      We begin this section by citing two important pieces of evidence

that a significant share of private R&D investment is defense-related.

We then develop an explanation of why the government seeks to promote

private investment in military R&D, in addition to directly contracting

for such R&D.
                                                                                4




         The first piece of evidence consists of budgetary data on the

 government's Independent Research and Development (IR&D) program.2 Under
 the    provisions   of this program, DoD and NASA contractors are permitted to

 charge part of the costs of their R&D efforts that are not
                                                                 supported by
specific contracts as overhead on cost-reimbursement contracts.
                                                                      Major
defense contractors negotiate advance agreements with these agencies that

impose ceilings on the amount of R&D expense for which contractors can be

reimbursed. In order for the costs of a project to be eligible for

reimbursement, under the IR&D program, the project must be demonstrated to

have "potential military relevance." Also, in order to have any of its

R&D expenses reimbursed, a company must have some DoD or NASA contracts.

Major defense contractors reported having incurred total IR&D costs of

$3.9 billion in 1983. This represents about 9.2 percent of NSF's esti-

mate of $42.6 billion for "company and other fundsfor R&D". (i.e.,

non-contract R&D) in industry in 1983. Firms were reimbursed for $1.6

billion (about 40 percent) of this expenditure by DoD and NASA. Accord-

ing to the IR&D budget data, then, firms spent $2.3 billion on projects

with "potential military relevance" for which they were not reimbursed in

1983.

        A second type of evidence is provided by Scherer's (1984) analysis

of "linked" R&D and patent data of the largest R&D-performing companies.

A team of students supervised by Scherer attempted to classify each of

about 15,000 U.S. patents (obtained by 443 companies between June 1976

and March 1977) by "industry of use,1' i.e., to identify the sector(s) of




     2See Reppy (1977) and Winston (1985) for detailed discussions
of the IR&D program.
                                                                              5




the economy in which (most intensive) use of the invention was            -




anticipated.    Scherei "assigned" R&D-expenditures to each patent by

assuming that the value of R&D "embodied in" (invested to obtain)
                                                                    any
particular patent was equal to the average R&D expenditure per patent of

the line of business receiving the patent. This assignment procedure

enabled classification of R&D expenditures, as well as of patents, by

industry of use. Two of the industries of use defined by Scherer were

"defense and space operations" and "government, except postal and de-

fense." He estimated the value of company-sponsored R&D "used" by these

sectors to be $1206.3 million and $378.7 million, 1l3 and 3.6 percent,

respectively, of the total amount of company-funded R&D ($10.64 billion)

attributed to these companies.3 Thus, according to Scherer's methodo-

logy, the federal government is the primary beneficiary of about 15 per-

cent of company-sponsored industrial R&D expenditure. These estimates

are based, of course, on judgments concerning the classification of

patents by industry of use, and on the imputation of "average" R&D ex-

penditures per patent to specific patents.

       Thus, both the IR&D budget data and the "linked" patent R&D data

suggest that a non-negligible fraction -- on the order of 10 percent --

of   private R&D investment is oriented toward defense or other federal

missions. The econometric evidence presented in the next section sug-

gests that the fraction is significantly larger and has increased sub-

stantially in recent years. Before considering that evidence, however,




     3These estimates were obtained using what Scherer termed the
'1private goods" assumption, according to which a patent (and its associ-
ated R&D expenditure) benefitted (was assigned to) only one, rather than
several, industries of use.
                                                                               6



we seek to explain why the government provides financial incentives for

firms to sponsor such research, in addition to, or instead of, directly

contracting with them. As anticipated above, our explanation is based on

the   premise that the goverment has imperfect information about the
ability of potential contractors to perform specific R&D projects.
      The idea that the government's information in the context of R&D

contracting is incomplete is not a novel one. Rogerson (1984) developed

a theory of optimal R&D contracting predicated on the assumption that it

is costly or infeasible for the government to monitor either the outcome

of a project performed by a contractor (i.e., how "successful" the

project was in achieving its objectives) or the effort (expense) invested

in the project. Rogerson argued that if it is difficult for the govern-

ment to observe the outcome of the project, and if the financial reward

to the contractor is greater if he reports a successful outcome than if

he reports an unsuccessful one, then the contractor has an incentive to

misrepresent the outcome, i.e., to overstate the degree of success. In

practice, a contractor is likely to earn higher rewards if he reports a

successful outcome; in particular, he is likely to be awarded "followon"

contracts for further development, and possibly also for production,

training, maintenance, spare parts, and so forth. To eliminate the

contractor's incentive to distort the outcome of the project, the govern-

ment could offer a fixed fee for performance of R&D contracts, i.e.    ,
                                                                           a

reward that is independent of the reported outcome. (Presumably, under

this scheme follow-on contracts would not be awarded to the R&D perform-

er, even if the project were a success.) However, this mode of contract-

ing suffers from a number of defects, one of which arises for the

following reason. Suppose, as Rogerson does, that the government has
                                                                              7




difficulty monitoring contractor effort. Assume that the probability of

a successful outcome increases with the quantity of effort. If the

contractor's reward does not depend upon the reported outcome, the

contractor maximizes his net income by expending minimum possible (per-

haps zero) effort on the project, and by (truthfully) reporting failure.

As Rogerson observes, the difficult problem facing the government is to

design an optimal contract that "achieves a balance between the three

competing concerns of inducing effort, inducing truthful revelation, and

allocating risk:'4

     The work of Rogerson and others on optimal R&D contracting addresses

the important problem of how the government should contract with a

specific firm, given the difficulty of monitoring the effort on or

outcome of the project. But due to its incomplete information, the

government faces an additional difficulty, one that is logically prior to

that of writing an optimal contract: choosing the right firm with which

to contract. We assume that both R&D projects and prospective R&D

contractors (firms) are heterogeneous: some firms are more qualified to

perform a given R&D project than other firms. By more qualified, I mean

that they will have a higher probability of success from a given effort,

or will require less effort to achieve a given probability of success.

In the case of some projects, the government may know (or at least

believe that it knows) the identity of a firm   that   is best qualified to

perform the project. In these situations the government may contract

with the finn it has identified on a noncompetitive basis. Only about 30

percent of the value of DoD R&D contracts are awarded on this basis,




     4Rogerson (1984), p. 4.
                                                                           8



however.5 In the case of the remaining 70 percent of R&D contracting,

the government does not know (although it may have subjective probabili-

ty beliefs concerning) which of a relatively small number of finns is

best qualified to perform the contract. How can the government discover

the identity of the firm most capable of performing the contract?

     The market for government R&D contracts is by no means the only

market in which the buyer has imperfect information about the quality

of products or services offered by different sellers.   Employers have

incomplete knowledge of the ability of (hence the quality of labor

services provided by) job applicants; consumers are uncertain about the

quality of various brands of a product. A number of theoretical models

of markets characterized by this kind of imperfect information show that

it is equilibrium behavior for sellers to invest in acquiring, and for

buyers to rely on, signals of quality and ability. Spence (1974) has

argued that employers may use information about job applicants' invest-

ments in education as signals of their underlying ability, and thus make

wage offers on the basis of educational attainment. Kihistrom and

Riordan (1984), developing ideas advanced by Nelson, argue that adver-

tising expenditures may signal unobservable product quality to con-

sumers. We hypothesize that prospective federal contractors signal

their ability to perform R&D and related contracts by producing elabor-

ate technical proposals, which entails utilization of R&D personnel and

facilities. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the signaling




     5The 30 percent figure reflects our treatment of follow-on awards after
design and technical competition as competitive contracts. Although
these contracts are officially classified as noncompetitive, since they
are awarded to the winner of design and technical competitions, we
regard them as being awarded on a competitive basis.

concept to the market for government R&D contracts, it is useful to

briefly review Spence's model of job market signaling. We then descibe

the government's principal method of awarding R&D contracts, procurement

by design and technical competition. We postulate that the government

sponsors these competitions in order to encourage contractor signaling.

     Spence hypothesizes that employers are willing to make high wage

offers to high—ability job applicants, and low offers to low—ability

applicants, but that employers cannot directly observe applicant ability.

In the absence of that information, employers may make wage offers to

applicants based on the value of an observable atttribute which, they

believe, signals ability. Spence argued that for an attribute to func-

tion as a signal of ability, three conditions must be satisfied: (1) the

value of the attribute must be subject to the applicants control; (2) it

must be costly (to the applicant) to increase the value of the attribute;

and (3) the cost of increasing the value of the attribute must be lower

for applicants of higher ability.6 Spence hypothesized that educational

attainment functions as a signal of ability in the job market. Employers

make subjective evaluations of job applicants' ability (and hence make

wage offers) on the basis of the quantity of investment in education

applicants have made: higher wage offers are made to individuals with

more education. High-ability workers find it worthwhile to invest in

education in order to secure higher wage offers, but due to their higher

costs of acquiring education, low-ability workers do not. An interesting




     6lnstead of assuming asymmetry of costs of signalling (and equality
of returns), Xihlstrom and Riordan assume asymmetry of returns -- greater
returns to signalling by the high-quality seller -- and equality of
costs.
                                                                          10




feature of signalling models is that multiple equilibria often exist: any

of a number of initial employer beliefs (about the relationship between

the value of the signal and ability) may be self-confirming. Some of the

equilibria may be Pareto-inferior to others. In the signalling model

(high-ability) individuals invest in education not because it increases

their productivity (which is the motive for investment in education

according to human capital theory) but "merely' because it signals their

(exogenously) higher productivity. It is true that the social rate of

return to educational investment will be positive if signalling improves

the allocation of applicants to jobs, placing high-ability individuals in

jobs requiring high ability, and conversely. But the private rate of

return is likely to exceed, perhaps by a substantial amount, the social

rate of return, resulting in significant overinvestment in education.

     Let us return to consider the problem of government selection of an

R&D contractor under uncertainty about contractor qualifications. When

the government is (initially) unable to identify the most qualified

contractor, it sponsors something called a design and technical competi-

tion. The following is a brief characterization of of the modus operandi

of design and technical competitions; a signaling interpretation of

these competitions is provided below. The competition begins "official-

ly" when a federal agency (DoD or NASA) issues a formal Request for

Proposals (RIP). Many analysts have noted, hoiiever, that potential

contractors are aware of the government's interest in particular areas of

technology, and attempt to influence the "shape" of government demand for

innovations, long before the publication of REP's. Indeed, a contractor

who first learned about a project from an REP would be effectively out of

the running for that project. Danhof has observed that "it is an impor—
                                                                            11



 tant part of the contractual process that the firm's representatives

participate in the informal discussions that long precede the establish-

ment of requirements and in the debate as alternatives are narrowed.1'

     In the case of DoD procurement, the mean and median number of firms

to submit proposals in response to-an RIP is about three or four. In

four of the seven (presumably "representative") DoD
                                                       competitions consid-
ered by Fox, three firms submitted proposals; in two of the competitions,

four firms did, and in one competition, seven firms.    Danhof notes that
about one out of four competitive proposals for
                                                  aerospace (DoD) contracts
is successful. About one of every nine bids for competitive NASA con-

tracts is successful.

     In view of the fact that the Rip's are on the order of 1100 to 2500

pages in length, it is perhaps not suprising that the typical proposal

ranges in length from 23,000 to 38,000 pages. The five proposals submit-

ted under the C-IA program totalled 240,000 pages. The proposals gener-

ally consist of three main sections. The technical section is the

largest, comprising about two-thirds of the total proposal. In this

section, the company explains how it plans to meet the performance

specifications set forth in the RIP. In the management section, the

company attempts to convince the govermnent that it has the necessary

manpower and the appropriate management and control techniques to suc-

cessfully perform the project. Cost estimates and supporting documenta-

tion are presented in the cost section of the proposal.

    Once the proposals for a given procurement program have been submit-

ted, an elaborate review process begins. Various committees assign

"scores" to numerous aspects of each company's proposal, and the individ-

ual scores are combined using a predetermined set of weights. Proposal
                                                                           12




evaluation appears generally to take about three months, during which

time tens of thousands of government-employee manhours are engaged in the

"source-selection" process. The firm that submits the proposal receiving

the highest score is generally awarded the contract.

     We believe that it is both natural and useful to interpret design

and technical competitions as signaling phenomena. The signal of

contractor ability to perform the contract that the government relies on

is the score on the technical proposal. Each firm has its own (possibly

stochastic) "score cost function" (and a dual "score production func-

tion") that relates the cost of preparing the proposal to the (expected)

score to be received by the proposal. We hypothesize that there are

positive and increasing marginal costs of improvements in the score.

Following the logic of the Spence model, in order for the score on the

proposal to effectively signal ability to perform, two additional condi-

tions must be satisfied. First, the cost of preparing a proposal of any

given score must be lowest for the most capable contractor. That this

should be the case seems quite plausible. Second, the cost of preparing

the proposal must be at least partially borne by the contractor. The

government could, after all, contract with finns to produce proposals.

But if all costs of proposal preparation were borne by the government,

proposals would not effectively convey information about contractor

ability. Evidently, contractors must place some of their own resources

"at risk" if they are to demonstrate their capability to the government.

Although it would be inappropriate for the government to underwite all

contractor costs of proposal preparation, it might be appropriate for it

to subsidize such expenditures if it believed contractors would under-
                                                                            13




invest in signaling in the absence of subsidies.7 The existence of the

Th&D program, which, we indicated above, subsidizes private military

research expenditure, might perhaps be justified on these grounds:

without IR&D reimbursements, design and technical competitions might

yield an insufficient quantity of information about contractor ability.8

     We have argued that the government sponsors design and technical

competitions, which elicit signaling investments by potential contrac-

tors, in order to acquire information about contractor qualifications to

provide R&D and related services and products. There is, however, an

alternative hypothesis that could account for the government's use of

this method of procurement. According to this view, federal agencies

sponsor these competitions not in order to acquire information about

contractor ability --   they know in advance of the competition which firm
they want to hire --    but in order to impress (or signal) Congress that

they are committed to competition in procurement. Judging from the

periodic Congressional hearings and reports on the subject (see, for

example, U.S. Congress (1969)), there is strong Congressional demand for

competition in procurement, and procurement officals must pursue polices

that at least appear to be consistent with this objective.




     7The socially optimal (efficient) quantity of signaling investment
is the quantity at which the marginal (expected) benefit (assumed to be
diminishing) of the information transmitted equals the marginal cost
(assumed to be increasing) of transmitting the information. The mar-
ginal benefit is measured in terms of the increase in the probability of
choosing the most qualified firm, and the increase in the probability of
success (or reduction in costs) resulting from choosing the most
qualified firm.


     81f the rate of subsidy varies across firms, as it appears to do
under the IR&D program, it is important that it not be very negatively
correlated with contractor ability. If the least capable firms receive

     Roberts (1964) has argued that, in practice, source selection does

not operate according to the three tenets of official procurement

policy: (1) maximum competition; (2) objective (numerical) proposal

evaluation; and (3) independent, multilevel review. With regard to the

second two principles, he notes first that scores on technical proposals

essentially reflect evaluators' prior beliefs about contractor ability,

and are scarcely influenced by the merits of the proposal. He also

observes that there are strong political pressures for higher—level

reviews of source-selection decisions to endorse (rubber-stamp) the

actions of lower—level reviews. But his analysis of a sample of 41 DoD

R&D contract awards does not suggest an absence of competition in the

case of most contracts. That there is generally effective competition

is implied by the following data. The technical initiator of an R&D

project typically provides a list of "recommended firms" for the pro-

ject. Edwards reports the following distribution of 41 R&D contracts,

by number of recommended companies:


          Number of Companies                 Number of
              Recommended                     Contracts

                  1                                6
               2or3                                9
               4to21                              26
                                                  41


Thus, at least two firms were recommended in the case of 35 out of 41

(85 percent) of the contracts; at least four firms in the case of 63




the largest subsidies, they might be most likely to produce winning
proposals.
                                                                          15




percent.9 Moreover, overall mare than twice as many companies were

solicited by the agency to submit proposals as were recommended by the

technical initiator. An average of seven firms competed for contracts

when only one firm was recommended; between 10 and 40 companies were

solicited when two or three were recommended.

     Of course, even if procurement officials know in advance which firm

they want to perform the contract, and sponsor the design and technical

competition merely to appease Congressional demand for (the appearance

of) competition, unless firms also know that the outcome is predeter-

mined, the competition would still be expected to elicit substantial R&D

investment. And even if a firm is aware of its status as the "desired

sole source" for a project (i.e., it is the only recommended firm), the

firm may (correctly) perceive that it is required to submit a respect-

able technical proposal. Although desired sole sources are normally

awarded the contract, Edwards cites a case in which a desired sole

source lost because it "insulted the agency by sending in an 'advertis-

ing brochure.' Evidently, even a company that is 'in' can sometimes get

too cocky," i.e., not devote sufficient effort to proposal development.

     We conclude this section by briefly reviewing some case-study and

anecdotal evidence regarding private R&D investment in pursuit of govern-

ment contracts. Edwards describes an unpublished study by Thomas Allen

at lilT of companies' proposal efforts related to 14 small ($30—$50

thousand) R&D contract awards. Allen found the total cost of all com-

pany proposal efforts in each competition ranged from 3 to 150 percent




     9Edwards notes, however, that the lists of recommended firms were
often not in alphabetical order, suggesting that procurement officials
may have favored a subset of recoimnended firms.
                                                                           16




of the direct cost of the contract awarded. Total proposal effort

appeared to be related more to the number of bidders than to the value

of the contract. Another study of 36 firms bidding for a single large

R&D contract estimated that each bidder spent three to four thousand

engineering manhours on its proposal. The estimated combined 45 to 60

engineering man—years reflects effort only at the prime contractor level;

subcontractors must also generate technical data for prime contractors.

     Estimates of the amount of R&D investment made by single firms in

specific periods or competitions have occasionally been reported. Gorgol

noted that "the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation was estimated to have spent

about $75 million of its own money in the period 1964-66 to improve its

competitive position in relation to the contract possibilities it viewed

as likely to materialize. For example, more than 1000 employees were

working on the C-5A proposal."1° Lockheed continues to make such invest-

ments today: according to one of its vice presidents, Lockheed spent "in

the low hundreds of millions of dollars," and assigned hundreds of its

most able managers and technicians to research on the Advanced Technical

Fighter, prior to submitting (along with six other companies) a 3000-page

technical proposal for the aircraft project in February 1986.11 Competi-

tion for "Star Wars" (Strategic Defense Initiative) research contracts

has also elicited company R&D investment. In 1984, the government's

Strategic Defense Initiative Organization "challenged companies to enter

what it called a horse race to devise the best Star Wars blueprint. A

herd of 300 firms submitted initial applications, but SOlO narrowed the

field to five, each of which will receive a $5 million grant to work on

its designs." According to the head of GTE's Star Wars effort, "the

price of admission to this game is much higher than usual." GTE normally

Lays out between $100,000 and $1 million of its own funds to develop a

bid for a research grant, but as of October 1985 it had spent about $3

million on Star Wars proposals.'2

     While the anecdotal evidence is certainly consistent with our

hypothesis of private investment in R&D to signal ability to perform

government contracts, it is not adequate for formally testing the hypoth-

esis or for estimating the quantity (and share) of private R&D investment

undertaken for this purpose. A basis for formal testing and estimation

is provided, however, by the econometric model presented in the next

section.




                                    III




     In this section we propose an econometric methodology for testing

the hypothesis of, and estixnatingthe quantity of, private investment in

R&D to signal ability to perform government contracts. The methodology

we propose is a generalization and extension of that used in previous

investigations of the reduced-form relationship between company R&D

expenditure (or other measures of innovative activity such as patents)

and sales (or other measures of firm size such as assets).

       If one is willing to regard a finn-size variable such as sales as a

proxy for the extent of a firm's market (or growth in sales as a proxy

for growth in demand for the firm's products-cum-innovations), then the

"indivisibility"   property of innovations suggests that innovative activi-
ty   should be an increasing function of firm size. As Kamien and Schwartz

(1982) observe, development costs are fixed costs, independent of the

number of units of output produced, whereas more revenue is collected if

output is larger. Hence, the larger the market, the greater the number

of process and product improvements that are likely to appear profitable.

      The objective of most previous studies of the relationship between

inputs or outputs of innovative activity and firm size has been to test

the Schumpeterian hypothesis that large firms tend to sponsor a dispro-

portionate amount of innovation. In perhaps the most recent such study,

Bound et al. (1984) computed regressions of the log of R&D expenditure

on the log of sales and its square or the log of gross plant, using

cross-sectional data for 1479 firms. They concluded that both very small

and very large firms are more R&D intensive than average-size firms, and

rejected the existence of any significant R&D threshold.

      We are interested in investigating the effect of the composition, as

opposed to the size, of demand for a firm's products on its R&D intensi-

ty, or propensity to sponsor R&D. A firm's total sales may be inter-

preted as the sum of its sales to each of its customers. In particular,

it is the sum of its sales to the federal government (G0V) and to other

customers (0Th). A regression equation of company R&D expenditure (CRD)

on total sales (SALES) embodies the a priori restriction that government

and other sales have the same effect on R&D expenditure. The most

important respect in which we extend and generalize previous econometric
                                                                              19




studies of the determinants of privfle R&D investment is by relaxing this

restriction, by classifying (disaggregating) SALES into its components

GOV and 0TH, and subclassifying GOY by method of procurement (competitive

vs. other) and by commodity (R&D vs. other). By disaggregating sales in

this manner; we purport to determine the extent to which government

procurement in general, and procurement via design and technical competi-

tion in particular, stimulates private R&D investment.

      In order to get consistent estimates of the (relative) effects of

government and nongovernment demand on private R&D investment, we believe

that two additional methodological extensions are necessary. The first

involves testing for the presence of correlated firm- (and year-) effects

by computing both random—effects and fixed-effects estimates of the

following model.using longitudinal, firm-level data:

where CRD. represents company-sponsored R&D expenditure of firm i in

year t, and X.. represents sales of type j by firm      i   in year t. The

individual (firm) effects a. reflect the influence of all unobserved

time—invariant, firm—specific determinants, whereas the year effects

capture the effects of changes over time in unmeasured determinants of

CRD which      are common to all firms. It is well known that there are two
basic approaches to the estimation of model (1): "random effects" estima-
tion and "fixed effects" estimation. In the random effects framework,

the values of the individual and year effects are regarded as realiza-

tions of a random variable assumed to be distributed independently of the
                                                                                  20



 regressors and of u.

 are regarded as unknown parameters to be estimated. Under the null

 hypothesis that the individual effects are uncorrelated with the regres-

 sors, the random effects (RE) estimator is both consistent and asymptoti-

 cally efficient, while the fixed effects (FE) estimator is consistent

but inefficient. Under the alternative hypothesis of correlated indivi-

dual effects, only the FE estimator is consistent.        Clearly, which esti-

mator should be chosen depends upon whether or not the null hypothesis

is true. Fortunately, }Iausman (1978) has developed a test for determin-

ing whether we should reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.           The

test statistic is a measure of the distance between the FE and RE esti-

mates; large values of this statistic should cause us to reject the

null, and therefore to regard only the FE estimates as consistent. All

of the models considered below were estimated by both RE and FE, and the

ilausman test statistic based on the difference between these estimates

was computed; in every case, the null hypothesis was decisively reject-

ed. This is not very surprising since, as }fausman and others have not-

ed, unobserved individual effects are unlikely, in general, to be uncor-

related with the regressors. In view of these findings, we report in

Section IV only FE ("within-firm") estimates.

     The second econometric extension that may be required to obtain

consistent parameter estimates is estimation of the (fixed-effects) model

by instrumental variables (IV) rather than by ordinary least squares

(OLS). There are at least two reasons why one might expect OLS estimates

of equation (1) to be inconsistent: simultaneous—equations bias, and

errors-in—variables. The consistency of OLS estimates is predicated on

the assumption that a firm's sales is exogenous relative to its R&D
                                                                           21



 expenditure. Although Mairesse and Siu (1984) were unable to reject the

 hypothesis that (total) sales is exogenous with respect to R&D, in view

 of our above characterization of design and technical competitions, it is

quite plausible that the part of a firm's sales accounted for
                                                                by govern-
ment contracts (at least those awarded by design and technical competi-

tion) is partly determined by its (current or past) R&D   expenditure.
Thus, although total sales appears to be exogenous, it is unlikely that

the (typically relatively small) government-sales component is.

       Errors-in-variables (or, equivalently, errors in classifying firm

sales into government and nongovernmeut components) arise mainly because,

as discussed below, "government sales" is defined, perforce, as the value

of federal prime contract actions (obligations) by firm and year. Error

may result from both the fact that we are treating obligations as sales

and from inability to account for subcontracting. There is a question as

to when federal contract actions are "recognized" as revenue (sales) by
the firm's accountants. We assume, in the absence of reliable informa-
tion   on this issue, that contract actions during a given year are re-

flected in that year1s sales figure. With regard to subcontracting, it

might be argued that subcontracting should be taken into account when

classifying the firm's sales by customer. It might be desirable, for

example, topartition the firm's sales into three components: sales

directly to the government of products produced by the firm (i.e., prime

contract awards minus subcontracts awarded to other firms); sales indi-

rectly to the government (i.e., subcontracts awarded under other firms'

prime contracts); and nongovernment sales. This kind of disaggregation

would enable us to assess the extent of private R&D investment undertaken

in pursuit of subcontracts. Unfortunately, there are at present no
                                                                         22




comprehensive and reliable data on the incidence of subcontracting at the

firm level.13 DoD data suggest that at least 38 percent of the value of

prime contracts awarded to business firms is subcontracted.14

     Let us briefly consider the consequences for our parameter estimates

likely to result from errors in measuring government sales and, hence, in

classifying total sales (assumed to be measured without error) into its

components. First, because, as discussed above, the Hausman specifica-

tion test indicated that the fixed-effects model was appropriate, we have

adopted the "within-firm" estimator. Within this estimation framework

(at least certain kinds of) "permanent" errors in measuring a firm's

government sales are likely to be inconsequential; they will be absorbed

by the individual effect for that firm. If we assume that the non-

permanent component of the measurement error has the usual classical

properties (i.e., uncorrelated with the "true" regressors and with the

disturbance term), then a result reported by Griliches concerning the

effect of measurement error in a multiple regression implies that the

difference between the coefficients on government and nongovernment sales

should be biased toward zero.15




     13The Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council is currently considering
an amendment to the DoD acquisition regulations that would require
large prime contractors to submit quarterly statistical reports on
first—tier contracting.


     l4See Department of Defense (1985), p. 81.


     15This result can be established as follows. Suppose the true model
may be expressed as

                        Y =        +   p222 + U
                                                                              23



      We attempt to address the problems posed by both potential

 endogeneity of government sales and errors in measuring government sales

 by computing instrumental-variable estimates (using putatively exogenous

 instruments for government sales), as well as OLS estimates, of our model

 of private R&D investment. A statistic measuring the distance between

the OLS and IV estimates may be computed to test the null hypothesis that

the assumptions required for consistency of the OLS estimator (i.e.,

government sales exogenous and measured without error) are satisfied.

     In view of the fact that we are trying to measure the effect of

exogenous shifts in the government's demand for each firm's products—

cum-innovations, the instrument for firm i's actual government contracts

in year t   is   an an estimate of its potential contracts in that year.

Potential contracts is defined as the total (across all firms) value in

year t of government contracts for two-digit FSC (Federal Supply Code)

products and services that the firm    ever   sold to the government during

                              =   y2j+D2z+u

all other variables. Griliches shows that plim(b        y) = yA/(1 -
where X var(t)/var(x) and p is the sample correY*tion coefficient
between x and z. Thus, the least squares estimate of y is biased toward
zero (estimates of    and f2 are biased toward equality). Also, provided
that p > 0 (which is true for our sample), the bias is "transmitted,"
with an opposite sign, to the other coefficient: Plim(byz.x - Pt) =
-p[bias y]. See Griliches (1984), pp. 22-23.

 follows:

                     during the period 1979—1985;
                 =   0 otherwise

        AGGit =      total   (across firms) value of government contracts

                     for product j in year t.

equation, the variables on the BBS of (2) should be exogenous relative to

CRD. It seems reasonable to maintain that this is the case, i.e., that

neither the lines of business the firm was engaged in, nor the aggregate

volume of government procurement in those markets, was determined by the

firm s rate of R&D investment. 16

     Testing certain hypotheses requires that we disaggregate government

sales into various components, e.g., R&D and non—R&D. In order to have

as many instruments as there are government-sales variables, the poten-

tial contracts variable is disaggregated into components in exactly the

same way as the (actual) contracts variable.. For example, potential

contracts is divided into potential R&D contracts and potential non—R&D

contracts, and these are used as instruments for actual R&D and non-R&D

contracts, respectively.




     16Obviously, using POT as an instrument is similar to using industry
dummy variables as instruments, albeit in highly restricted form.

      In the remainder of this section we provide a brief description of

the data sources and procedures we have used to develop a data base

suitable for estimation of the model outlined above. We have constructed

a panel consisting of annual observations on company R&D expenditure,

total sales, and government sales, for each of 187 firms during the years

1979-1984. Data on company sponsored R&D expenditure and on total sales

of the company are taken from the Compustat General Annual Industrial

File. Data on sales to the federal government (more precisely, on the

net value of obligations to the firm under federal contract actions) are

derived from the Federal Procurement Data System. The sample was con-

structed as follows. The Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC) provided

to the author a computer tape containing records of all federal (prime)

contract actions of the 1500 industrial firms who had the largest total

value of contracts during 1979-1984 (FPDC began operation in 1979). This

tape contained records of almost 1.3 million contract actions. Each

record indicates the month in which the contract action occurred, and the

contract actions for each firm were aggregated to the annual level. We

then matched the federal contract data, by firm and year, to the corre-

sponding data on sales and company-sponsored R&D from the Compustat file.

The Compustat file included data for only 187 out of the 1500 firms, many

of which are not publicly traded companies. The firms that are included

in both the FPDC and Compustat files (and therefore in our sample),

though, tend to be the largest firms, measured either by CRD, sales, or

value of federal contracts.

 sored R&D, sales, value of federal contract actions, and value of R&D

 contract actions —-   are shown. In 1983, these 187 firms reported   a total
 of about $29 billion of company-sponsored R&D expenditure, or about 68

 percent of NSF's estimate of U.S. aggregate industrial R&D expenditure.17

 The value of federal obligations to these firms for R&D was about $15

 billion in 1983, which is 74 percent of NSF's estimate of federal funds

 for industrial R&D. The share of federal R&D in total (company +     fed-
eral) industrial R&D expenditure is about a third in both sample and

national data.

     Recall that the method of contracting hypothesized to elicit (the

most intense) private R&D investment is procurement by design and techni-

cal competition. Unfortunately, while the FPDS data do distinguish

negotiated competitive procurement from other methods of contracting

(e.g., negotiated noncompetitive or formally advertised procurement),

they do not distinguish between the two principal methods of negotiated

competitive procurement: price competition, and design and technical

competition. Moreover, as the summary   data   published by DoD presented in

Table 2 indicate, design and technical competitions account for only

about one-fourth of the value of negotiated competitive contracts.'8
                                                                         By



     17Because company R&D expenditures that are reimbursed under the IR&D
program are included in the NSF estimate but evidently excluded from the
Compustat (10K-based) data, this fraction may understate the true share
of these companies in national R&D expenditure.


     18Although under 10 percent of the value of DoD contracts are
officially recorded as competitive contracts awarded on the basis of
design and technical competition, an additional 27 percent are designated
"follow—on" contracts after design and technical competition, awarded on
a nonompetitive basis to the winner of the competition. Hence in
reality 37 percent of the value of DoD contracts are awarded, initially
or eventually, on the basis of these competitions.

 cross-classifying contracts by whether or not they are competitive and by

 whether or not they are for R&D, however, we can isolate one class of

 contracts --   i.e.,   competitive R&D contracts --   which are awarded almost
 entirely on the basis of design and technical competition.19
                                                                    Thus if, as
 we hypothesize, design and technical competitions provide the greatest

 stimulus to private R&D investment, competitive R&D contracts should have

 the largest coefficient of the contract types which we can identify,

 given the data available to us. Since about one-fourth of competitive

 non-R&D contracts are awarded by design and technical competition, the

 coefficient on this category would be expected to be smaller in magnitude

but still positive, and larger than the coefficients on other (follow-on

and noncompetitive) contracts (whether or not for R&D), which are not

awarded (at least directly) on the basis of a design and technical

competition.

     Finally, before turning to our parameter estimates, we thought it

might be of interest to present data on the distribution of design and

technical competition awards by product and service.        These data provide

an indication of the product fields in which the hypothesized
                                                                    company-
sponsored signaling R&D is concentrated. Due to the data limitations

cited above (i.e., inability to distinguish price competition from de-




      19The distribution of contracts by method shown in the second column
of Table 2 reflects the distribution of contracts which cite statutory
authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(4)(ll) ("experimental, developmental, test, or
research") as their authorization for exception to the requirement for
formal advertising. Whenever procurement officials wish to employ any
method of procurement other than formal advertising, they must cite one
of 17 possible reasons for not advertising enumerated in the U.S. Code.
The eleventh such reason is that they are contracting for experimental,
developmental, test, or research services. Contracts citing this reason
are treated as tR&D contracts" for the purposes of Table 2.

sign and technical competition), we present data on the distribution of

follow-on contracts (almost 90 percent of which follow design and tech-

nical competitions) rather than that of competitive contracts.2° A list

of the top 25 (4-digit Federal Supply Code) products and services,

ranked by value of follow-on contracts, is presented in Table 3.    These

products and services account for over three-fourths of the total value

of follow-on contracts. Not surprisingly, virtually all of these prod-

ucts and services are defense- and space-related.

     In   this section we present and interpret estimates of the model of

company R&D expenditures developed in the previous section. OLS and IV

estimates of the fixed-effects version of equation (1) are presented in

Table 4. We begin by disaggregating SALES into only two components:

government contracts (sales), and nongoverrunent sales. In column (la),

OLS estimates of the regression of ORD on GOV and 0Th are reported. The

coefficient on GOV is about 2.26 times as large as the coefficient on

0Th; moreover, the difference between these two coefficients is highly

statistically significant.21 IV estimates of the same model, using




     20We note, however, that over 90 percent of the value of competitive
R&D contracts are for defense and space R&D.


     21The ratio of coefficients is similar to (slightly smaller than)
that obtained when a similar equation was estimated on panel data for 88
business segments (lines of business) observed annually during the period
1978—1983. The ratio estimated from those data (derived from the
Compustat Industry Segment File) was 2.67.

 "potential government sales" as an instrument for actual government

 sales, are presented in column lb. The coefficient on 0Th is unchanged

 by using an instrument for GUy, but the IV estimate of the GO'? coeffici-

 exit is almost twice as large as the OLS estimate.    The IV estimates

 imply that a dollar of government demand (sales) induces over four times

as much R&D expenditure as a dollar of rzongovernment demand.

     We performed the instrumental—variables test for errors-in—variables

discussed by Hausman (1978), by running the regression of ORB on GUy,

0TH, and the residual from the regression of GOV on its instrument

(potential contracts). The coefficient on this residual was signifi-

cantly different from zero (t =   2.7),   indicating that we should reject

the null hypothesis that GOV is measured without error (or, more general-

ly, is uncorrelated with the disturbance). Consequently, only the IV

estimates should be regarded as consistent.

     We can use these coefficients to estimate the total quantity of

private R&D expenditure induced by government sales; this estimate may be

considered in relation to three different measures of R&D investment: (1)

the quantity of private R&D expenditure induced by sales of all types;

(2) the quantity of federal contract R&D; and (3) the quantity of IR&D

investment. The quantity of private R&D investment induced by sales of a

particular type is calculated as total sales of that type times the

estimated (IV) coefficient on that type of sales. Estimates of the

quantity of private R&D induced by both government and nongovernment

sales are presented in Table 5. As indicated, the estimated share of

government-sales-induced R&D expenditure in total induced R&D expenditure

increased from 19.8 percent in 1979 to 28.7 percent in 1984.     Moreover,

almost half (48.7 percent) of the increase in total induced R&D expendi-

ture during this period was induced by the increase in government sales.

     Our estimates of government-sales-induced CRD investment, considered

in relation to contract R&D expenditure, suggest that there is slightly

more than 50 cent& worth of private, procurement-related R&D investment

for every dollar of contract R&D. Stated differently, about one-third of

the industrial R&D investment associated with government procurement is

privately financed.

     Because data on IR&D costs and reimbursements are available only at

the national level, in order to compare government-sales-induced ORB

expenditures to IR&D outlays, we need to estimate the former for the

country as a whole, not merely for the sample of 187 firms. We do this

by multiplying the government-sales coefficient (.098) by the aggregate

value of DoD prime contract awards. (Because DoD accounts for only about

80 percent of the total value of federal procurement, this is probably a

conservative estimate of the amount of private R&D investment induced by

total federal procurement.) As indicated in Table 6, the resulting

estimates of aggregate CRD expenditure induced by DoD prime contract

awards are $5.7 billion in 1979 and $11.9 billion in 1983 (the last year

for which we have IR&D data). These figures are about three times as

large as the corresponding estimates of total IR&O costs incurred by

industry ($2.1 and $3.9 billion, respectively). Moreover, the CRD-

expenditure data upon which our estimate of the government-sales coef-

ficient is based evidently exclude IR&D costs for which companies are

reimbursed by DoD or NASA. These agencies typically reimburse about 40

percent of IR&D costs incurred. Hence it is to the total IR&D costs not

reimbursed by federal agencies that our estimates of government-sales-

 induced private R&D expenditure ought to be compared. As the comparison

 of the second and fourth lines of Table 6 indicates, unreimbursed IR&D

 costs are only about one-fifth as large as the value of
                                                               privately-
 financed, procurement-related R&D expenditures implied by our model. The

IR&D budget data appear to significantly understate the extent of private

investment in defense-related R&D.

     The model of GRID expenditure in which SALES is disaggregated into

two components —-
                    (all)   government, and nongovernment -—   is   useful for

estimating the amount of private R&D investment stimulated by federal

procurement as a whole. We hypothesize that it is procurement by design

and technical competition that provides the greatest stimulus to private

R&D investment. As discussed above, we can test this hypothesis by

estimating a version of the model in which government sales is cross-

classified by method of procurement (negotiated competitive vs. other)

and by commodity (R&D vs. other). Before presenting these estimates, we

report estimates of models in which government sales is classified by a

single attribute. These estimates are useful for purposes of comparison

with previous econometric studies of the effect of federal procurement

on private R&D investment. These studies have focused exclusively on

the R&D component of procurement, and have not considered the effects of

different methods of procuring R&D on private R&D expenditure.

     Column 2 of Table 4 displays estimates of the CRD equation in which

government sales is classified into R&D and non—R&D components. In the

case of both the OLS and the IV estimates, the coefficient on government

R&D is not significantly different from zero, whereas the coefficient on

other government sales is positive and highly significant. One might

well infer from these estimates that previous studies have been concern-

ed with the portion of procurement which has the smaller and less signi-

ficant effect on private R&D investment. But before we conclude that

private R&D investment is essentially unresponsive to changes in the ex-

tent of R&D contracting, it behooves us to consider arguments and evi-

dence in support of a subtler hypothesis: that some R&D procurement

stimulates, and other R&D procurement depresses, the rate of private R&D

expenditure. The insignificance of R&D procurement in general maybe

masking the offsetting effects of different methods of contracting for

R&D services.

     Estimates of the model in which government sales is classified by

method of procurement are presented in column 3 of Table 4. In the case

of both the OLS and IV estimates, the effect of competitive contracts is,

as expected, substantially larger and more significant than the effect of

the other types of contracts. The restriction that the two methods of

procurement have the same effect on private R&D is decisively rejected:

the t-ratio on the difference between competitive and other coefficients

is 3.8 in the case of the OLS estimates and 2.0 in the IV case. The IV

estimate of the coefficient on competitive contracts is about three times

as large as the OLS estimate, and implies 42 cents of private R&D invest-

ment per dollar of competitive awards.

    Estimates of the CRD model in which government sales is cross-

classified by method of procurement and by whether or not the contract

is for R&D are presented in column 4 of Table 4. Consider first the OLS

estimates. Consistent with our hypothesis, the coefficient on competi-
                                                                          39



tive R&D contracts has the largest (and a highly significant) coeffici-

ent.22 For this finding to be consistent with our earlier finding (in

column 2) that R&D contracting in general has an insignificant effect on

private R&D investment, non-negotiated-competitive R&D contracts should

have a sizable negative effect on CR0. The estimates suggest that this

is indeed the case: the coefficient on this component of government

sales is negative and significantly different from zero. Evidently, the

competitive award of R&D contracts tends to stimulate private R&D invest-

ment, but firms tend to reduce their own R&D spending when the value of

R&D contracts awarded to them on a non-negotiated-competitive basis in-

creases. Non—R&D contracts, on the other hand, appear to have a posi-

tive effect regardless of the method of contracting.

     Whereas all of the OLS estimates in column 4 are highly significant-

ly different from zero, the IV estimates are at best only marginally

significant. Presumably, this lack of significance reflects the deterio-

ration in quality (extent of correlation) of the "potential contracts"

variables as instruments for their corresponding "actual contracts"

counterparts as the extent of disaggregation of actual and potential

government sales increases. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that the

signs and relative magnitudes of the IV estimates in column 4 are gener-

ally similar to those of the OLS estimates.




     22Since about 17 percent of competitive non-R&D contracts are
awarded via .DTC, a smaller but positive and significant coefficient on
these contracts conforms with expectations.

     Official government statistics on the distribution of the nation's

R&D expenditures by "mission'1 are predicated on the assumption that only

the government sponsors military R&D. But IR&D budget data, analyses of

patents, and-anecdotal evidence all suggest that a significant fraction

of company—sponsored R&D expenditure is defense—related. We have argued

that firms sponsor such research because the government deliberately

provides them with incentives to do so, i.e.   ,
                                                   it establishes rewards for,
and subsidizes the costs of, private military R&D investment.

     Since the government simply contracts with firms to perform a

substantial amount of R&D, the question arises why, and under what

circumstances, does the government encourage private R&D investment

rather than (or in addition to) directly contracting for R&D services.

We have provided an explanation for this behavior which is based on the

notion that the government often has imperfect information about the

ability of various firms to perform R&D and similar contracts involving

great technical uncertainty. In these situations, the government spon-

sors design and technical competitions, which may be interpreted as

solicitations to companies to signal their ability to provide services

and products. Signaling requires considerable R&D investment, which

must be at least partially at firms' own expense for the signal to be

informative.

     Estimation of variants of an econometric model of company-sponsored

R&D expenditure enabled us to both test the hypothesis of, and estimate

the quantity of, private investment in signaling R&D. Our estimates

imply that there is about 50 cents worth of private, procurement-related
                                                                                41


 ("contract—seeking")   R&D for every dollar of contract R&D.       The amount of

 private procurement— (largely defense—) related R&D expenditure appears

 to be substantially greater than thç reported costs incurred by contrac-

 tors under the IR&D program. We estimate that in 1979 —-        before   the
major defense buildup had begun -- about 20 percent of private R&D

 investment was induced by (related to) federal procurement. Nearly half

of the increase in company R&D expenditure between 1979 and 1984, during

which time federal national defense
                                          purchases grew much more rapidly than

nondefense demand, was stimulated by growth in government sales. By

1984,                             R&D accounted for about 30 percent of
private R&D spending.

        According to the official goveinment statistics, the fraction of the

nation's total R&D (company- plus
                                    government-sponsored) investment

devoted to military research increased from 23 percent in 1979 to 30

percent in 1984. Treating all of the private R&D investment we have

estimated to be associated with procurement as military R&D would in-

crease this share to 32 percent in 1979 and 45 percent in 1984. While

this procedure may result in some overstatement of the defense share of

R&D, these estimates are, we think, much closer to the truth than the

official estimates. The latter appear to substantially overstate U.S.

investment in R&D relevant
                             to meeting the challenge posed by competitors
in the   civilian technology race (e.g.   ,   Japan, less than one percent of
whose R&D is military), and to understate investment devoted to meeting

the challenge posed by our major competitor (the Soviet Union) in the

military technology race.
