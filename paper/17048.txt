                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we analyze the trends in labor force participation and transitions to benefit programs
of older workers in relation to health trends as well as recent Social Security reforms. Our preliminary
conclusions are pessimistic regarding the effect of health improvements on the labor market attachment
of older workers since we show that despite the large improvements in the mortality rates among older
individuals in Spain, the employment rates of individuals older than fifty-five remain lower than the
ones observed in the late 1970s. Some caution should remain in our conclusions as the evidence on
health trends is inconclusive. Regarding the effect of Social Security reforms, we find that both the
1997 and the 2002 reform decreased the stock into old-age benefits at the cost of an increased share
of the participation into disability. Finally, we find that there was a significant increase in the outflow
from employment into disability after the 2002 reform.

1. Introduction


Disability has always been an important social welfare program in developed countries
and Spain is not an exception. The program represents an average of 1.5 % of GDP in
the 1995-2010 period, slightly below the EU average of 2.2 % of the GDP. The relative
importance of the program with respect to the pension program has varied in the last 20
to 25 years. In 1977 the ratio of benefits originated from disabilities to retirement
benefits was 0.44, in 1985, by the end of the early 80 crisis, it reached a maximum of
0.58, and decreased slowly since then. By 1997 the ratio was again down to 0.45. Figures
from 1998 are difficult to compare since all disability pensions from age 65+ are since
then converted to retirement benefits but back of the envelope calculations1 suggest that
the ratio decreased in early 2000s and increased from 2008 because of the recent crisis.


The above ratio of benefits has a clear business cycle component because the disability
program has been often used to cushion recessions and to alleviate transitions into and
from economic inactivity in regions of high unemployment, as suggested by Disney and
Webb (1991), McVicar (2006), and more recently Benítez-Silva et al (2010). In addition,
disability programmes have often been used as an alternative to early retirement through
pension programmes, either because of restrictions on early retirement, or because
disability programmes offer more attractive after-tax benefit levels (Gruber and Wise,
1999, 2004; Jiménez-Martín et al. 2006, Jiménez-Martin and Vall-Castelló, 2009). This
alternative ‘route’ into inactivity for older people proved particularly attractive when
employers were seeking to shed older workers in periods of recession such as the early
1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s.


It is common in the literature to distinguish between ‘health disability’, which arises from
clear diagnosed medical conditions, and ‘work disability’, which may also have its roots in
economic and social circumstances. Although there is a link between work and health
disability, economic conditions, and, the variations in the risk of unemployment over
time, may play an important part in explaining the dynamics of the disability rolls
(Benítez-Silva et al, 2010). Other factors, including the trend in the relative generosity of

                                                                                                2
disability benefits relative to unemployment or pension benefits (Autor and Duggan
(2003, 2006) and Burkhauser and Daly (2001) in the United States, and OECD (2006,
2007) more generally), and underlying demographic and morbidity trends, are also
relevant.


As in many other OECD countries, in Spain the underlying demographic trends are very
favorable. The increase in life expectancy at birth has also been translated in increases in
life expectancy at age 65. In 1960 women aged 65 expected to live 15.3 more years, while
the expectations were 21.9 in 2008. Similar improvements are also observed among men
(from 13.1 in 1960 to 18.0 in 2008) (OECD Health Data, 2010). As a consequence there
have been striking improvements in age-specific mortality rates over the last 50 years in
Spain across individuals aged over fifty-five. The extent to which these changes translate
into higher labor capacity depends on the evolution of ill-health. Thus, further reduction
in the age-specific mortality rate will only translate in an increase in the population able
to work at older ages if the average age of the onset of a work-related disability increases
and, simultaneously, the requirement to work for the disabled are adjusted accordingly.


When analyzing trends of disability rolls it is also needed to take into account Social
Security reforms as they may change the relative balance between the various exit routes
into (retirement) benefits. There have been two main Social Security reforms since 1990.
In 1997 the medical requirements of the disability system were tightened and the
generosity of the old-age pension system was decreased, while in 2002 the job search
criteria to receive unemployment benefits was tightened and more incentives to retire
later were introduced.


The main purpose of the paper is to analyze the trends in labor force participation and
transitions to benefit programs of older workers in relation to health trends. In particular,
we explore questions such as: Do mortality improvements at older ages translate into
more participation? Do we reach the same conclusions with other health variables? Do
health improvements reduce the prevalence of disability among older workers? Have
recent social security reforms favored the participation of older workers, and in
particular, of disabled workers? Have these reforms affected transitions from
employment to unemployment or disability at older ages? Do we find any substitution
across programs?



                                                                                           3
Those questions referring to the link between program participation and health will be
analyzed descriptively. Alternatively, those questions referring to the effect of reforms in
program participation will be evaluated using stock and flow administrative data of
participation into unemployment, disability and retirement for individuals approaching
the normal retirement age complemented with data from the Spanish Labor Force
Survey. In order to help identifying the key parameters of the model we use data
aggregated at the gender and age-group (50-54, 55-59, 60-64) level using two levels of
regional aggregation.


Our preliminary conclusions are pessimistic regarding the effect of health improvement
on the labor market attachment of older workers since we show that despite the large
improvements in mortality rates among older individuals in Spain, the employment rates
of individuals older than fifty-five remain lower than the ones observed in the late 1970s.
On the other hand, decreases in mortality rates do not necessarily go hand in hand with
improvements in population health and we do not find any conclusive evidence on
health improvements. Regarding the effect of Social Security reforms we find that both
the 1997 and the 2002 reform decreased the stock into old-age benefits at the cost of an
increased share of the participation into disability. More interestingly, the magnitude of
the two opposite effects is the same suggesting a clear substitution effect among these
two programs in the older age-groups. Finally, we find that none of these two reforms
had any effect on the share of these age-groups into unemployment, which is highly
explained by the total share of the population out of employment. Regarding the effects
of these two reforms on the outflows from employment we find that there was a
significant increase in the outflow from employment into disability after the 2002 reform.


The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we present the institutional setting
and discuss disability insurance and pension reforms. In section 3 we review historical
data on mortality, health status and use and labor force participation, and compare their
trends during the last thirty years. We analyze the effect of program reforms on disability
rolls and the substitution among the different programs in section 4. Last, section 5
concludes.

2. DI and social security reforms


The aim of this paper is to provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between past
trends on health status and labor market participation at older ages and the role of Social
Security reforms. Therefore, we first describe the disability system in Spain, as it is the
pathway out of employment more closely linked to the individual’s health. However, the
transition into a program will also depend on the availability and characteristics of the
other programs. Therefore, we also highlight the main changes in the unemployment and
old-age systems. In all three cases, the Social Security is responsible for the payment of
contributory benefits (old-age, disability, unemployment, temporary sick-leave, maternity-
leave and survivor’s benefits), while non-contributory benefits are managed by the
regional authorities of each Autonomous Community and the IMSERSO (the Institute
of Aged People and Social Services) in Ceuta and Melilla.


2.1 The Disability Insurance System

In Spain, there are two types of permanent disability benefits: i) contributory, which are
given to individuals who have generally contributed to the Social Security system before
the onset of the disabling condition; ii) and non-contributory, which are given to
individuals who are assessed to be disabled but have never contributed to the Social
Security system (or do not reach the minimum contributory requirement to access the
contributory system). Non-contributory disability benefits are means-tested2 and
managed at the regional level.


The size of the non-contributory system is relatively small compared to the contributory
system (197,126 individuals received non-contributory disability benefits in 2009, while
920,860 received contributory benefits during the same year). The amount of benefits
received is also smaller in the non-contributory case (the average non-contributory
pension is 417.09 Euros/month compared to an average contributory disability pension
of 831.49 Euros/month). However, the benefit level for non-contributory disability
pensions differs quite a lot across regions, as the benefits are managed at the regional
level. Figure 1 shows the average contributory and non-contributory disability pension by
Autonomous Community. It can be seen that in all cases the average contributory

non-contributory disability pension amounts around 400 Euros/month in all the regions,
the average contributory pension varies from 677 Euros/month in Extremadura up to
1,070 Euros/month in País Vasco. In the remaining of this chapter we mainly focus on
the permanent contributory disability system in Spain.

The Social Security defines the permanent contributive disability insurance as the
economic benefits to compensate the individual for losing a certain amount of wage or
professional earnings when affected by a permanent reduction or complete loss of
his/her working ability due to the effects of a pathologic or a traumatic process derived
from an illness or an accident.


In order to capture the different situations in which a person can be after suffering from
a disabling condition, the Spanish Social Security administration uses a classification of
four main degrees of disability that depend on the working capacity lost:




                                                                                        6
(i)      Permanent limited disability for the usual job: the individual losses at least 33%
         of the standard performance for his/her usual job but the individual is still able
         to develop the fundamental tasks of his/her usual job or professional activity.
         Individuals in this level of disability only receive a one-time lump sum payment.
(ii)     Partial disability: the individual is impaired to develop all or the fundamental
         tasks of his/her usual job or professional activity, but he/she is still capable of
         developing a different job or professional activity.
(iii)    Total disability: the individual is impaired for the development of any kind of job
         or professional activity.
(iv)     Severe Disability: Individuals who, as a result of anatomic or functional loses,
         need the assistance of a third person to develop essential activities of daily living
         such as eating, moving, etc…

Figure 2 shows the distribution of individuals receiving disability benefits by degree of
disability and region in 2009. It can be seen that in all the Spanish regions, the percentage


                                                                                                    7
of individuals receiving permanent limited disability was rather small. In fact, at a
national level, only 917 out of the 920,863 contributory permanent disability pensions
were for individuals classified as permanent limited disabled for the usual job in 2009.
The second dimension shown in Figure 2 is the regional variation not only in the
percentage of the working-age population receiving disability benefits but also on its
distribution across types. Asturias is the region with a higher share of the working-age
population receiving contributory disability benefits (4.9%) followed by Galicia (3.8%),
Andalucía (3.7%) and Cantabria (3.6%). On the other end, Madrid is the region with the
lowest percentage of recipients of contributory disability benefits (1.6%).


Figure 3 shows the percentage of the population aged 16-64 that is receiving non-
contributory benefits. As argued before, the share of the population receiving non-
contributory benefits is smaller when we exclude the special autonomous regions of
Ceuta and Melilla. Among the others, we find the highest percentages in Canarias, Galicia
and Extremadura.

2.1.1      Eligibility and Pension Amount


The eligibility requirements and the pension amount depend on the source of the
disability (ordinary illness, work related or unrelated accident or occupational illness), the
level of the disability and the age of the onset of the disability. Table 1 summarizes the
main parameters of both the eligibility criteria and the pension formula. The two main
features to highlight are: i) there are not contributory requirements if the health
impairment is due to either an accident or a occupational illness; ii) individuals older than
fifty-five with a partial disability receive a higher replacement rate if it is considered
difficult for them to find a job due to lack of education or the social and labor market
conditions of the region where they live.


The total amount of the pension is obtained multiplying a percentage, which varies
depending on the type of pension and degree of disability as shown in the last rows of
Table 1, to the regulatory base, which depends on the source of the disability and on
previous salaries3. The number of years included in the regulatory base depends on the
source of disability.

The income tax rules differ across type of disability. Partial disability benefits are taxable
under the general income tax rules, while total disability pensions are always exempted
from income taxes. Furthermore, if the individual works while receiving the pension,
there is a reduction in the earnings used to calculate the income tax of 2,800 Euros/year
if their degree of disability is low (between 33% and 65%) or 6,200 if the disability level is
higher (more than 65%) or if the disabled has reduced mobility. In addition, individuals
receiving partial disability benefits can combine the benefits with earnings from work, as
long as the type of job is compatible with his/her disability.


In general, to be granted a permanent disability benefit, the individual must come from
sick leave (also called temporary disability/incapacity), and after following the prescribed
medical treatment, he/she still presents in principle anatomic or functional reductions
that decrease or cancel his/her capacity to work. The application can be started by the
provincial office of the National Institute of Social Security (NISS), by the institutions
that collaborate in the process (such as hospitals), or by the individual himself (in which
case, more documentation is required). The Disabilities Evaluation Team evaluates the
medical report and the professional background of the solicitant, and on the basis of this
analysis, the directors of the provincial office of the NISS decide on the type of disability
pension granted (if any), the benefit level and the date of the next medical check-up. All
permanent disability pensions are automatically converted to old-age pensions once the
individual turns sixty-five4.


2.1.2    Sick leave or temporary disability

Sick leave benefits are available to all workers who have contributed for at least 180 days
during the five years prior to the onset of the illness in the case of common illness. If the

4 Most of the outflows from the permanent disability system are due to death or automatic transfer to old-
age pensions. Around 4% of the outflows are due to improvement of the health condition and 2.7% to a
judicial process. Monthly outflows in 2010 were around 2,500-3,000.


                                                                                                        10
origin of the sick leave is an accident (whether or not working accident) or an
occupational illness, no minimum contributory period is required.


The amount of benefits also depends on the source of the disability. Individuals who
have a disability because of a working accident or an occupational illness are entitled to
75% of the basic salary (including overtime pay) from the first day of leave. In the other
cases, there is a waiting period of three days without benefits unless it is covered by a
collective agreement, and from the fourth day until the twentieth the employee receives
sixty percent of the basic salary. After the twenty-first day, the compensation represents
seventy-five percent of the basic salary. The social security pays from the first day if a
working accident or occupational illness, and from day sixteen otherwise. The employer
pays in this case from the fourth until the fifteenth day. It is not possible to combine
sickness benefits with any kind of paid work, even part-time work.


The duration of the benefits is for a maximum of 12 months with a potential extension
of an additional six months when it is foreseeable that the beneficiary will become
capable of working within this additional period of time. At the end of this period the
individual is either considered non-disabled or can apply to permanent disability benefits.
Certification and monitoring of the sick leave is ensured by a doctor (GP) of the Public
Health Services (or from a doctor from a Mutual Work Fund).


2.1.3   Major health conditions of disability benefits recipients


Figure 4 shows the percentage distribution of total contributory and non-contributory
disability recipients by health conditions, distinguishing among mental, muscular-skeletal
and other health problems by three age-groups in 2004. First of all, it is important to
note the importance of the musculoskeletal conditions as 50.3% of all the individuals
receiving a disability benefit in Spain are on the basis of a musculoskeletal health
problem. This condition is more prevalent among the youngest group, as it represents
59.4% among the individuals aged 20-34 receiving disability benefits. Its importance
slightly decreases with age (54.0% of disability pensioners aged 35-49 and 48.2% of
disability pensioners aged 50-64).




                                                                                        11
The figure also shows that 9.7% of all the individuals in the disability rolls are diagnosed
with a mental condition, being the prevalence higher among the younger. The share of
claimants due to mental health conditions is among the smallest in Europe. For example,
the share of inflows into disability due to mental diseases was 34.3 % in UK in 2006,
41% in Switzerland in 2004, 43.4% in Denmark in 2005 or 25.4% in Norway in 2004
(OECD, 2008).

comes from special tabulations provided by the University of Madrid, based on linked NISS and
IMSERSO data.


The share of “other health conditions” varies across age-groups, as it represents from
26.9% of the pensioners aged 20-34 up to 43.3% of the pensioners aged 50-64.
Unfortunately, there is no evidence available of the distribution of the other illnesses. In
order to shed some light on its likely distribution, Figure 5 shows both the percentage of
total cases and total days of sickness leave (temporary disability) in Spain in 2005. The
biggest category within the specific illnesses is “Diseases of the musculoskeletal system
and connective tissue”, which corresponds to the main category among the recipients of
disability benefits. Next, diseases of the respiratory system have the second highest share
among the number of cases, while mental health problems have the second highest share
in the number of days. Surprisingly, the share associated with circulatory problems both
in days and cases is smaller, and similar to the share of diseases of the digestive and the
nervous systems.

2.1.4 Reforms of the Disability Insurance System

Permanent disability benefits were used extensively as an early retirement mechanism for
workers in restructuring industries (such as shipbuilding, steel, mining, etc…) or as
substitution for long-term unemployment subsidies in depressed regions during the late
1970 and 1980 (OECD, 2001), which resulted in an increase in the inflows into the
disability system and permanent disability benefits.


These events prompted a number of reforms introduced during the second half of 1980
and beginning of 1990 in order to try to reverse these trends. The main aim of these
reforms was to abolish the incentive effects to permanently leave the labor market before
reaching the legal retirement age through the disability system.


Here we focus on some distinctive features of the main reforms since the creation of the
National Institute of Social Security in 1979, while refer the reader to Table 2 for a
summary of all the reforms in the disability system in Spain during this period.




                                                                                                                               13
Table 2. Main reforms of the disability system in Spain

1985        The terms of eligibility for disability pensions are tightened.
1990        Introduction of a means-tested non-contributory disability pensions for
            people aged 65+ and for disabled people aged 18+ who satisfy residency
            requirements.
1997        Stricter control of sickness status, reduction of long-term sickness benefit
            level, usual occupation replaces own job assessment.
            Permanent disability pensions individuals 65+ are converted to old-age
            pensions.
            New INSS disability assessment team to assess permanent disability instead of
            the GP.
            Entitlement to non-contributory benefits is not lost if working, and can be
            collected if losing the job.
1998        Possibility for doctors from INSS and mutual insurance companies to review
            health situation of beneficiaries.
2004-       Improve monitoring and control of sickness leave with new INSS tool.
2005        Possibility to combine non-contributory disability with some earnings.
2007        Minimum contributory period to access permanent disability is reduced for
            young workers.
            The formula to calculate the regulatory base of the benefit gets closer to the
            formula for old-age pensions.


The first biggest reform of the disability system took place in 1997 and it included 4 main
points:
          1) Sickness benefits: stricter control of the sickness status by doctors of the
             Social Security system, reduction of the level of long-term sickness benefits,
             replacement of the old own job assessment by a more objective definition of
             the usual occupation of the individual.
          2) Permanent disability pensions of individuals aged at least sixty-five are
             automatically transferred to the old-age pension system. This is just a change
             in the classification within the pensions system.
          3) There is also a major organizational reform as all the permanent disability
             matters are transferred to the NISS. Until that moment, the permanent
             disability status was assessed and granted by the local GP’s and this reform
             created a group of experts (the disability assessment team; a newly created
             body inside the NISS) which was in charge of assessing the person’s ability
             to work on the basis of the available medical files and a special medical
             assessment done by one of the NISS doctors.




                                                                                        14
          4) The individual does not lose entitlement to non-contributory disability
               benefits if he/she starts working. He/she will then still be entitled to receive
               non-contributory disability benefits if he/she looses his/her job.

Apart from this major reform in 1997, the 1998 budget law introduced the possibility for
doctors from the NISS and mutual insurance companies to review the health situation
and status of beneficiaries. However, in reality very few individuals in the permanent
disability system do effectively lose their benefits.


In 2004 and 2005 monitoring of the use of sickness leave was tightened with the creation
of a new sub-department at the NISS and a new monitoring tool with the sole purpose
of better monitoring and reducing absence rates. In 2005, a general absence control was
put in place when the duration of absence was greater than six months.


Finally, in 2007 the minimum contributory period to access permanent disability
pensions was reduced for young workers in order to adjust for the current later entrance
into the job market of younger workers. At the same time, the formula to calculate the
regulatory base of the benefit was slightly modified: the regulatory base of permanent
disability because of a common illness is decreased by 50% if the individual had not
contributed at least 15 years and it is lower the further the individual is from age 65.


All these reforms have ensured the financial stability of the disability system in Spain as
inflow rates have remained at stable levels and have not experienced any dramatic
increases like in other countries covered in this volume.


2.2 Reforms in other Social Security Programs in Spain


The extent to which reforms in the disability system are able to decrease the outflows
from employment at older ages will depend on the evolution of other programs that can
be used as alternative early retirement routes. Therefore, in this section we summarize
other important reforms that have taken place in other Social Security Programs in Spain.
In particular, we focus on reforms in the unemployment and old-age systems. Table 3
provides a chronological summary of these reforms5.

5 A detailed exposition of the changes in the old-age pension system in Spain is provided in Boldrin et al
(2010)


                                                                                                             15
In 1984, both temporary contracts and non-contributory unemployment benefits (also
called unemployment assistance benefits) were introduced. In addition, a special
provision was established for workers aged over fifty-five who were allowed to receive
unemployment assistance benefits until retirement age. To receive these benefits,
individuals had to satisfy the entitlement requirements of the retirement pension except
for the age. The subsidy paid 75% of the minimum wage until reaching the age to be
transferred to an old-age pension. Furthermore, the years spent unemployed under this
special scheme were counted as contributive years towards an old-age pension.


In the following year, 1985, an old-age pension reform was passed which increased the
minimum mandatory annual contribution to old-age pensions from 8 to 15 years, it also
increased the number of years of contribution used to calculate the pension from 2 to 8
years6 and introduced several early retirement programs linked to hiring a new worker,
such as the Partial Retirement program that allowed part-time retirement at sixty-three
combining part-time wages and old-age pension, and Special Retirement at sixty-four if
the employer hired a registered unemployed.


In 1989 the special provision of unemployment assistance benefits until the retirement
age of sixty-five for individuals aged at least fifty-five was extended to individuals aged
fifty-two, thus increasing the incentives of older workers to leave the labor market at
younger ages. The expected decrease in the labor force participation rates of older
individuals observed in Spain during the 1980s and the early 1990s prompted the
government to adopt a change in the strategy, and to start a series of reforms to reverse
these negative labor market trends. Therefore, the reforms introduced during the 1990s
had the objective of keeping older workers active in the labor market for longer.


There have been two main reforms since the mid 1990, in 1997 and 2002. In 1997 the
number of contributory years used to compute the benefit bases was progressively




6 The change in the minimum mandatory annual contributions to have access to an old-age pension
affected all individuals since 1985, but the number of years used to calculate the pension was progressively
increased: during the first year, the last 70 months were used, 72 months in the second year and 84 in the
third year.



                                                                                                          16
increased from 8 to 15 years7 and the formula to calculate the replacement rate was also
made less generous. On the other hand, the 8% penalty applied to early retirees between
the ages of 60 and 65 was reduced to 7% for individuals with 40 (or more) years of
contributions at the time of early retirement. Some changes in the incentives on the
demand side were also introduced in 1997 to reduce the unemployment rates and the
share of temporary contracts among the most disadvantaged groups, among them the
individuals aged forty-five or older who were either unemployed or had a temporary
contract.


In 2002 changes in both the old-age and the unemployment systems were introduced.
Before 2002, only individuals who had contributed to the system earlier than 1967 could
benefit from early retirement at sixty, while the rest had to wait until the normal
retirement age at sixty-five. In 2002, earlier retirement at age sixty-one was made available
for the rest of the population. At the same time, there was an impulse to the partial and
flexible retirement schemes with the possibility of combining income from work with
old-age benefits and the introduction of incentives for individuals to retire after the legal
retirement age of 65. These consist on an additional 2% higher percentage per additional
year of contribution beyond the age of 65 applied on top of the 100% applied to the
regulatory base. In order to have access to this additional 2%, the worker needs to have a
minimum contribution period of 35 years.


At the same time, the possibility to access retirement is extended to individuals who are
unemployed for reasons beyond their willingness at the age of 61 and who have
contributed for at least 30 years and have been registered in the employment office for
the last 6 months.


On the other hand, the reform in 2002 opened up the possibility for individuals aged
fifty-two or more who are receiving unemployment benefits to combine the receipt of
these benefits with earnings, as they will receive 50% of normal benefits and the
employer will pay the remaining quantity in wages. In addition, it extends the program
that helps to integrate unemployed persons in the labor market8 to all individuals aged at



7 In 1997 the last 108 months are included, the last 120 months in 1998, the last 132 months in 1999, the
last 144 months in 2000, the last 156 months in 2001, the last 180 months from 2002 onwards.
8 This program is called Contrato de Integración (Integration Contract).




                                                                                                        17
least forty-five who have been unemployed for one month and to people with
disabilities, among others.


Last, in 2007 the incentives to retire later than age sixty-five were further increased
providing an additional three percent, instead of the two percent agreed in 2002.
Moreover, in order to have access to an old-age pension the individual must have
contributed for at least two out of the last 15 years and the proportional part related to
the extra monthly salaries will not be taken into account when computing the number of
contributed years. On the other hand, the 8% penalty applied to early retirees between
the ages of 60 and 65 was reduced to between 6-7.5%, depending on the number of
years contributed, for those individuals with 30 years of contributions. In addition, the
contributions for unemployed workers older than fifty-two were increased so that they
would receive a higher old-age pension when retiring,

3. Historical data


Mandatory insurance for job related accidents was introduced in Spain in 1900, through a
bill that also authorized the creation of some funds, for public employees only, paying
disability and retirement pensions. In 1919, mandatory retirement insurance (Retiro Obrero
Obligatorio) was introduced for private-sector employees aged sixteen to sixty-five whose
total annual salary was below a certain threshold. In 1926, a universal pension system for
public employees (Régimen de Clases Pasivas) was established, which still exists under the
same name. By the late 1930s, most Spanish employees were covered by some minimal
government mandatory retirement insurance program.


Since the introduction of the first insurance programs the life expectancy of the Spanish
population has experienced an outstanding improvement; while the life expectancy at
birth in 1930 was of 51.13 years for females and 47.46 for males, it achieved the 71.65
(females) and 66.66 (males) years in 1960, and up to 84.07 (females) and 77.58 (males)
years in 2006 (Human Mortality Database, 2010). The labor force participation of older
workers has not always gone hand in hand with the evolution of life expectancy. In this
section we provide some descriptive evidence of the trends in mortality, health and labor
force participation in order to unravel the existence of any common trends during the
last 30 years.


3.1. Mortality


The increase in life expectancy at birth has also been translated in increases in life
expectancy at age 65. In 1960 women aged 65 expected to live 15.3 more years, while the
expectations were 21.9 in 2008. Similar improvements are also observed among men


                                                                                          19
(from 13.1 in 1960 to 18.0 in 2008) (OECD Health Data, 2010). Moreover, the higher
decrements in mortality rates achieved since 1960 are concentrated among the
population aged 65 and older as Figure 6 shows. Figures 7 (men) and 8 (women) show
how much steeper the decrease in mortality was among individuals aged 65 compared to
individuals aged 60 or 55.


Figure 6. Mortality rates by gender and age. 1960, 1985 and 2006.

Figure 6 also shows that the decrease in mortality rates observed from 1960 to 1985 is
similar to the decrease from 1985 to 2006. In addition, it shows that male’s mortality
rates evolve after female’s mortality rates, as the curve for men in 1985 overlaps the
female’s curve in 1960, and mortality rates of men in 2006 are similar to mortality rates of
women in 1985. Therefore, one would expect further improvements in life expectancy
and mortality rates, at least for men, in the coming years.

One of the conclusions to be derived from Figures 7 and 8 is that individuals in later
years reach the same mortality rates at older ages compared to previous cohorts. For
example, women aged fifty-five in 1960 had the same mortality risk as women aged sixty
in 1980 and women aged sixty-five in 2005 (0.006). If one understands by old age the
later part of life with some reference to deterioration, then one would probably agree that
the experience of a given high mortality rate should be part of the elements to be
considered when classifying a group of individuals as elderly. As recently pointed out by


                                                                                         20
Shoven (2010)9, this raises some challenges to compare individuals through time. For
example, if individuals were classified as elderly in the 1960s at age sixty-five, it seems
somehow surprising that they were still classified as elderly in 2000 when their mortality
rates were like the ones of individuals aged sixty in 1960 among men, and even lower
among women. This suggests that age-since-birth is possibly not the best measure to
compare the ageing of populations across time, and it poses some questions about its
convenience to set the rules of the social security system.

Figures 9 and 10 show how individuals of different ages-since-birth could be considered
to have the same age if measured by the same mortality rate. It plots the ages at which
cohorts in different years face the mortality risk as sixty and sixty-five year olds in 1960.
It can be seen that a men aged 72.7 (68.6) in 2006 had the same mortality risk as a 65 (60)
year-old in 1960. Similarly, a women aged 74.8 (71.5) had the same mortality risk as a 65
(60) year-old in 1960. Then, a mortality-based age system would suggest that a 74.8 year-
old woman in 2006 and a 65 year old woman in 1960 were the same age. Similarly, a 72.7
year old man in 2006 would have the same age as a 65 year old man in 1960

(1984) or Cutler and Sheiner (2001)

3.2. Health trends


We have previously shown that there has been striking improvements in age-specific
mortality rates over the last 50 years in Spain across individuals aged over fifty-five. The
extent to which these changes translate into higher labor capacity depends on the
evolution of ill-health. Thus, further reduction in the age-specific mortality rates will only
translate in an increase in the population able to work at older ages if the average age of
the onset of a work-related disability increases. This would certainly be the case if the
compression of morbidity hypothesis10 (Fries, 1980) was satisfied. However, the
international literature is inconclusive in this respect (Mackenbach et al. 2008). For
example, the evidence provided by several studies that analyze disability trends in the US
from the 1980s and 1990s suggests that while the prevalence rates for individuals older
than sixty have decreased, the rates for the younger age groups have seen no
improvement or even a deterioration (for example Crimmins et al 1999; Lakdawalla et al.
2004; Bhattacharya et al. 2008)



10 Fries (1980) compression of morbidity states that the burden of lifetime illnesses will be concentrated in
a shorter period before death as the age of functional impairment due to ill health will be increased.


                                                                                                           23
In order to shed some light on the past-trends of health status in Spain we use data from
the 1987, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2006 editions of the Spanish Health Survey
(ENS) available from the Ministry of Health and Social Policy (www.msps.es). These are
nationwide cross-sectional surveys that collect information on health and socio-economic
characteristics of individuals. The surveys contain separate samples for adults (16+) and
children. The figures presented below are based on the adult samples. We use weighting
factors to compute the different averages.

Source: own elaboration from data from the Spanish Health Surveys

Figures 11 and 12 show the evolution of self-assessed health status for men (Figure 11)
and women (Figure 12) in the age-groups forty to forty-four, fifty to fifty-four and sixty
to sixty-four based on the question “how would you rate your health during the last
twelve months?”. We show the percentage of each age and gender group that report
being in good or very good health (good at least) and the percentage that report being in
fair, good or very good health (fair at least). The figures do not show an overall
improvement in self-reported health, neither a worsening, although the percentage of
women in at least good health has experienced a slight increase among the three age
groups considered during the last twenty years. This improvement in self-assessed health
among women is not found when looking at the percentage of women in at least fair
health. In addition, older individuals are on average in worse health if percentages in at
least good health are compared, but the differences disappear if averages on at least fair
health are compared. This could suggest that reporting heterogeneity among age-groups

health status.

the two weeks prior to the survey and the percentage of individuals who had any type of
accident during the last year. First, they show that the percentage of individuals with a
work limitation or who have experienced an accident has increased for all age-groups for
both sexes during the last twenty years. On the other hand, while there is a clear age
pattern among women, i.e., higher prevalence of both work limitations and accidents, the
evidence among men is more mixed.

Figures 15 to 20 show trends in the prevalence of several diagnosed chronic illnesses:
cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems and asthma or bronchitis
(respiratory problems). The data show that the prevalence of cholesterol and high blood
pressure have increased both for men and women across all age groups. Moreover, the
reported prevalence of men and women in their forties at the end of the time period is
similar to the one reported by individuals aged fifty twenty years ago. On the other hand,
one should be cautious before concluding from these increasing trends that the
prevalence of these two health problems has increased over the observed period as this
could be due to a better awareness of the population, which would translate in higher
self-reported rates. Johnston et al (2009) find that, while the rates of self-reported
hypertension in England were 5.5% in 1998 and 8.5% in 2003, hypertension measured by

Figures 21 (men) and 22 (women) show the prevalence of overweight and/or obesity in
the last twenty years, which are known to be risk factors that could increase the burden
of disease in the future. The data show that both the percentage of men with overweight
and obesity have increased during the last twenty years among all age-groups, being the
increase in obesity rates steeper than the increase in overweight rates. In 2006 almost
eighty percent of men older than fifty are either overweight or obese compared to sixty
percent in 1987.

The percentage of women who are overweight is lower compared to men, which is
consistent with the evidence found by Andreyeva et al (2007) using data from the 2004
sample of the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe. On the other hand, little have
changed in the weight distribution of women aged forty to fifty-five. At the same time,
the prevalence of reported obesity among women in their sixties has increased by ten
percent in the last twenty years, while the percentage that report being overweight has
remained around forty-five percent



                                                                                                 30
In order to complement the self-reported descriptive evidence, we provide some
information on the number of hospitalizations by type of diseases using administrative
data from 1998 to 2007 from the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy. We
present data for the same three age groups, but unfortunately we are not able to show
figures for men and women separately.


Figures 23 to 25 show the number of hospitalizations for each 10,000 inhabitants by age
group and by major condition. The data show that neoplasm and circulatory diseases are
the two main groups of health conditions leading into a hospitalization among all age
groups. Neoplasm represents the first cause among individuals younger than fifty in the
overall period but its incidence has decreased since 2000. On the other hand, while
circulatory problems were the main cause of hospitalization among individuals aged fifty
to fifty-four ten years ago, currently it ranks second after neoplasm due to a decrease in
the number of hospitalizations due to circulatory problems during the last decade. There
is a decreasing trend in the number of hospitalizations due to health problems related to
the circulatory system among the older age group, which remains the first cause, but
simultaneously there is an increase in the number of hospitalizations due to a neoplasm.

It is also worth mentioning the observed increase in the number of hospitalizations due
to mental problems, being it steeper among the youngest age group. The number of
hospitalizations related to respiratory health problems has also increased among the

considered.

3.3 Mortality and health


In the previous two sections we have shown that, while age-specific mortality rates have
decreased through time, the evidence on the health status of the individuals aged forty to



                                                                                                         32
sixty-five is less conclusive, and it depends on the health measure used. Here we explore
further the relationship of Mortality with the other health variables.


Figure 26 (men) and Figure 27 (women) compare Mortality Equivalent Ages versus SAH
Equivalent Ages. We plot the average for each age-interval at the mid point of the
intervals and then we fit a linear functional form for SAH and a power function for
mortality. First, based on these rough estimates, Figure 26 shows that men aged 58.7 in
2006 had the same mortality rates as men aged 55 in 1987, a difference of almost 4 years.
The difference is about one year higher for women (Figure xx) as women aged 59.9 in
2006 had the same mortality rates as women aged 55 in 1987. Second, both figures also
show the proportion of individuals who reported that their health status was less than
good in 1987 and 2006. The gain in SAH over this period is smaller than the gain in
mortality as men aged 56.9 in 2006 reported similar SAH as men aged 55 in 1987 and
women aged 57.7 in 2006 had about the same SAH as women aged 55 in 1987.

Figures 28 (men) and 29 (women) depict together trends in mortality, self-reported
health status and self-reported work limitations as defined above. Figures 26 and 27
show that the large gains in mortality rates have not been translated into better SAH.
This is further reinforced by the data shown in Figures 28 and 29. On the one hand, the
percentage of individuals who reported that their health status was less than good in the
last year slightly decreased over the last twenty years, while the percentage who reported

3.4 Trends in disability and labor force participation


In this section we provide some graphical evidence on labor force trends by age-groups
and gender. Data on employment, unemployment and disability come from the Encuesta
de Población Activa (EPA). The EPA is a rotating quarterly survey carried out by the
Spanish National Statistical Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, INE). The planned
sample size consists of about 64,000 households with approximately 150,000 adult
individuals. Although the survey has been conducted since 1964, publicly released cross-
sectional files are available only from 1977. The 1977 questionnaire was modified in 1987
(when a set of retrospective questions were introduced), in the first quarter of 1992, in
1999 and 2004. The EPA provides fairly detailed information on labor force status,
education and family background variables but, like most of the other European-style
labor force surveys, no information on health is provided. The reference period for most
questions is the week before the interview.


Figure 30 shows the evolution of employment rates by age-group for men and women
separately. The data show that there has been an important increase in female labor force


                                                                                                         35
participation since the mid-1980s, although employment rates of women in their forties
are still far below the rates of their male counterparts (around twenty percentage points
difference). The increase in female participation also translates in an increase in
unemployment rates (Figure 31). The unemployment rates of males and females move in
parallel since the beginning of the nineties. In addition, the data show that there are no
differences across age groups among men, except for the lower unemployment rate of
the older group resulting from lower labor force participation as suggested also by the
employment rate.

In the same spirit, Figures 32 (men) and 34 (women) show the evolution of the
percentage of individuals who classify themselves as permanently disabled when asked
about their labor status in the previous week using data from EPA. It should be noticed
that there was a change in the survey in 1987 that affects the numbers shown. Before
1987 there is information available about one state, while after 1987 individuals can be
seen in up to three different states. This implies that some individuals could report being
permanently disabled and doing some volunteer or paid work, for example. We have
decided to count an individual as permanent disabled if he reports being so in any of the
three possible states. This results in an increase in the percentage of disabled individuals
after 1987, being the discontinuity higher among the older age groups.

The data show that, for both male and female, the percentage of permanent disabled is
higher among the older age groups, although the difference across age groups is bigger
among males. Figure 33 shows the different enrollment rates into DI by men by age for
the last year of data available. The data show that the percentage of men collecting
disability benefits increases with age from less than 4% among men aged forty to over
12% among men aged sixty-four.


The share of women who can claim a contributory disability pension has increased
through time with their labor participation. This could explain the lower differences
across age-groups among women, as well as the increase of the share in women in



                                                                                               37

aged over fifty-five.

Figures 32 and 34 also indicate the years in which the two main reforms took place (1997
and 2002). We will investigate their effects a bit more into detail later. However, it is now
worth that neither the trends nor the levels seemed to change after their implementation.




                                                                                            38
3.5 Disability, health and mortality


We combine in Figures 35 to 37 the information on permanent disability shown in the
previous section with the health and mortality information shown above for three age
groups: i) forty to forty-four (Figure 35); ii) fifty to fifty-four (Figure 36); iii) sixty to
sixty-four (Figure 37). The data show that the trend of the percentage of individuals into
disability does not follow any of the other health measures. So, despite the reduction in
age-specific mortality, the percentage of individuals into disability remains almost
constant. As argued above, we would expect a reduction of disability coming from an
improvement in mortality only if the onset of the disabling condition happens later in
life. Otherwise, the share of the population at a given age in ill-health could even
increase. Unfortunately, we cannot take any conclusive evidence on this regard with the
analysis shown here. On the other hand, the stability of the share into disability during
the last twenty years suggests that any changes that could have happened in the
population’s health have not affected the inflows into disability. Thus, it is likely that
other dimensions of the program are more important in explaining its evolution. We
focus on the role of the different Social Security reforms in section 4.

3.6 Health, mortality and labor force participation


The data in Figure 30 above have shown that employment rates of men in their late
fifties and early sixties in Spain decreased during the 80s until the mid 90s and, although
they have slightly increased in the last decade, they are far from the rates observed in
1980. In this section we combine data on health status and labor force participation. We
will not show figures for women as the increase in female participation rates in the past
masks any relationship.


We first follow Shoven (2010) and look at a different definition of age based on mortality
risks and compare the employment rates of individuals at the same mortality risk in
different points in time. Then, if we assume that individuals with the same mortality risk
experience the same health status, we can evaluate how participation rates change across
time for individuals with the same health status. Figure 3812 pictures the employment rate
in 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2006 (last year for which both employment and mortality data
are available) for each mortality risk for men.

12We combine the information presented above on employment rates from the EPA with information on
mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database for individuals aged forty to sixty-nine. The rates refer
to five-age group averages for both measures.


                                                                                                       41
The conclusions we draw from Figure 38 are somehow different from the ones drawn
before. First of all, we find that participation rates have not increased among the older
group of individuals, defined as individuals with higher mortality, in the later years. On
the other hand, the employment rate decreases, not for all the individuals, but among the
ones whose mortality risk is at least 0.5 percent. Consistently, the decrease through time
is higher among the groups with higher mortality risks to the extent that the employment
rates of groups whose mortality risk is at least 0.01 have been halved. Looking at the data
in another way, the mortality rate when 60 percent of men were employed was 0.0175
percent in 1980, but it was only 0.01 percent 26 years later. Therefore, men in 2006 had
to be much healthier (by the mortality measure) in 2006 that they were in 1980 for the
employment rate to be 60 percent.


As argued above, individuals with the same mortality-risk do not necessarily face the
same health status as health care technology improvements could have helped to
decrease the age-specific mortality risks, but at the cost of higher prevalence of disability.
In order to shed some light on this, we focus on the evolution of employment rates using
both information on self-assessed health and the existence of a work limitation using
ENS data.


Figure 39 shows the employment rates by individual’s self-assessed health. We have
grouped self-assessed health in two categories: good or very good health (thin lines in the
Figure) and fair, bad or very bad health (thick lines in the Figure). We have used this
division as it was found to capture better the age differences in health status (see Figure
11 above). The data show that employment rates of individuals in bad health are much
lower compared to their healthy peers among individuals younger than sixty. More
specifically, among men aged fifty to fifty-four who report being in bad health only about
sixty percent is at work, while this number is higher than eighty percent among the
healthy ones. The employment rates of healthy and unhealthy individuals converge
among the group aged at least sixty.


The second feature shown by Figure 39 is that employment rates of individuals older
than fifty-five in good health had fallen from 1987 to 1997 and, although some recovery
is observed in 2006, employment rates are still below the ones observed in 1987. This is
in line with the data shown in Figure 30. The evidence regarding individuals in bad health



                                                                                           42
is less clear-cut and it seems that employment rates of this group have remained stable
through time.

All together, the evidence presented here suggests that health status is an important
variable in determining labor force participation among individuals younger than sixty,
but it becomes less important as the social security incentives of the old-age pension
system kick in. We then now focus on the role played by the different social security
reforms in explaining the evolution of labor force participation trends in general, and
more specifically, the participation in the disability program.



4. Pathways to retirement and program reforms


In the previous section we have shown that the trends in labor force participation are not
likely to be driven by the evolution of the population health. Thus, in this section we
analyze the relationship with the other usual suspect, i.e., the incentives that the Social
Security system poses to individuals to withdraw from the labor market.




                                                                                         43
In particular, we first look at the association between the characteristics of the social
security system and the inflow into and the stock of the main contributory social security
programs (permanent disability, retirement and unemployment). Later, we provide a
tentative evaluation of the two main reforms of the social security system that have
affected the incentives of old-age workers to withdraw from the labor force during the
period for which we have data available.


4.1. Descriptive evidence on the pathways to retirement


The evidence pictured in Figures 30 to 34 above using aggregate data from the Spanish
Labor Force Survey, which uses self-reported labor status, did not show any change in
behavior after the 1997 reform, neither after the 2002 reform. Let us recall that the main
characteristics of the reform held in 1997 were the implementation of stricter medical
control to apply for disability benefits, and the decrease in generosity of the contributory
old-age benefits. The 2002 reform provided individuals with more incentives to continue
working beyond the age of sixty-five, at the same time that a more stringent search
criteria was required among the unemployed.

this system slightly decreased after 1997 for all the age groups considered (from forty to
sixty-four) and it stayed constant thereafter. Figure 41 shows comparable data for the
inflows into contributory old-age benefits. The trends and levels remain stable through
the period despite the different reforms.

In order to look at changes in the postponement of the retirement age, Figure 42 shows
the percentage of the population that enters into contributory old-age benefits by age for
individuals aged sixty to sixty-four. Unfortunately, we do not have information on the
total number of inflows into old-age contributory pensions by individual ages for
individuals aged sixty-five or older so we present two different shares. The first one
considers inflow as a share of the total population aged at least sixty-five (as in Figure
41), while the second one uses the population aged sixty-five to sixty-nine, as retirement
later than sixty-nine is anecdotic.

In order for the policy reforms to have effects on the sustainability of the system, they
should influence the stock of individuals in the different programs. Figure 43 shows the
total number of pensioners in the two previous programs from 1980 to 2009.
Unfortunately, this information is not available by age groups. The general picture shows
a slightly increasing trend in the number of pensioners in both programs. The total
number of disability pensioners decreased in 1997 when all the disability pensions of


                                                                                                     45
individuals aged sixty-five and older were reclassified as old-age pensions, so the amount
of old-age pensioners increased correspondingly. The growing time trend could be at
least partly explained by the incorporation of women into the labor market or the
population ageing.

From 2002 onwards, at least in theory, in order to claim unemployment benefits older
workers also had to enroll in active searching at the same time that unemployed

individuals aged at least fifty-two could combine unemployment benefits with earnings.
A priori, one would expect this reform to have some effects on the number of older
individuals claiming unemployment benefits. However, the percentage of the population
older than fifty-five that was receiving unemployment benefits did not change thereafter.
This is shown in Figure 41, which uses administrative data from the Ministry of
Employment and Immigration. In fact, the share of the population older than sixty-five
receiving unemployment benefits continued to grow despite the economic growth.

In figure 45 we make use of another source of administrative data, the “Muestra
Continua de Vidas Laborales (MCVL)”, to contrast the results obtained above. The
MCVL is a microeconomic data set based on administrative records provided by the
Spanish Social Security Administration. It contains a random sample of 4% of all the
individuals who, at some point during 2007, had contributed towards the social security
system either by working, being in an unemployment scheme or receiving a contributory
pension. The random sample selected contains over one million individuals. The MCVL
provides rich employment history information at the cost of scarce representativeness as


                                                                                                                 47
we go back in time. This is particularly important here as the individuals of any cohort
entering into disability benefits are expected to have higher mortality rates and therefore,
to have lower probability of being selected in 2007. In this respect, the information
provided here is complementary to the other sources


Figure 45 plots the number of individuals entering permanent disability benefits each
year from 1970 until 2007. The two red lines correspond to the years of the 1997 and
2002 reforms. As for the reform in 1997, a possible anticipation effect is observed as
inflows into permanent disability pensions increased in 1997. This could be either due to
the expected future higher requirements or to the decrease in the generosity of the old-
age pension system. However, the inflows in the disability system dropped in the
subsequent years.

On the other hand, the 2002 reform, which tightened the job search criteria for
unemployed individuals, had a clear substitution effect of increasing the inflows into
disability benefits. Recall that disability benefits are of a permanent nature and do not

more attractive for older workers with already some previous health related problems.

Figures 46 to 48 report, for the three older five-years age groups of working-age
individuals, the percentage that reports being in each program in the EPA. The data is
also only shown for men and cannot be fully compared to the one shown in Figures 40


                                                                                                                                                                   49
to 44; not only because it is self-reported, but also because individuals receiving a non-
contributory pension should also report receiving a pension or benefit (either disability,
old-age or unemployment) in the EPA, while they were not included in the previous
figures.

Note: own elaboration using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey

The data from Figures 46 to 48 reinforces the previous evidence; the percentage of the
population either unemployed, receiving disability or old-age benefits increases with age.
On the other hand, the share of individuals that declare being disabled or retired is higher
the older the group, while at the same time, the share of unemployed individuals
becomes smaller. In fact, the share of individuals aged sixty-to-sixty-four that report
being unemployed is below five percent compared to the rate of ten percent (except for
the last years) of the other two groups. At the same time, the data does not show any
substitution effects across programs after the different reforms or drops in the
participation rates.

In order to better approach a measure of the pathways into retirement, we look at the
exit routes from employment. We use the retrospective information available in the
second quarter of the EPA regarding the labour status of individuals in the previous year.
We calculate the percentage that transit from employment to each of the status of
interest. This is shown in Figures 49 to 51. Unfortunately, the retrospective information
does not distinguish between the different jobless status, which would have allowed us to
identify the individuals that transit from unemployment or disability into retirement.

Note: own elaboration using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey

The conclusions reached from these figures are similar to the ones presented above.
The share of individuals that leave employment and transit into unemployment is higher
among the relatively younger individuals than among the older groups (80% of men aged
fifty-to-fifty-four that leave employment, and transit to one of the status of interest go to
unemployment compared to 20% among men aged sixty-to-sixty-four). The main
difference with previous Figures is the smaller percentage of individuals that leave
employment to transit into disability among men older than sixty. This is consistent with


                                                                                                                                                                                                     51
the numbers shown in Figure 40 for contributory permanent benefits, and suggests that
the biggest share of individuals into disability in this age-group is mostly due to an
accumulation of individuals who left employment and transit into disability earlier in
their career and/or individuals receiving non-contributory disability benefits transiting
from another jobless state.

4.2. A tentative analysis of the quantitative effects of the reforms


The descriptive evidence shown in the previous sections of this chapter points out that
the reforms had, if any, small effects on the labor market behavior of older workers. In
this section we attempt to provide some estimates of both the effects of the different
reforms in participation in different programs, as well as analyze the substitution effects
among programs.


We first show in figure 52 the share of each age group that goes into permanent
contributory disability before and after the set of reforms that took place in 1997 in both
the disability and old-age pension systems using the administrative data from the Ministry
of Employment and Immigration shown in Figure 40. The data shows that the share of
individuals transiting into disability decreases among all the age-groups studied, except
among individuals aged fifty to fifty-four. The drop is small in absolute terms among all



                                                                                                                                            52
groups, but this is due to the small shares into disability. However, it represents a nine
percent drop for the group with the largest inflow into disability (individuals aged fifty-
five to fifty-nine).

These estimates represent a before-after analysis in a period of economic growth. As can
be derived from the evidence shown above, the labour force participation has been
increasing since the mid nineties for older workers. Therefore, we need to control at least
for changes in total employment outflows before drawing any conclusion.


We provide estimates of how the percentage in each program (disability, unemployment
and old-age) changes after each of the two reforms of interest when one controls for a
time trend and the total share out of employment. We use data from EPA aggregated at
the gender and age-group (50-54, 55-59, 60-64) level using two levels of regional
aggregation. We first use the same figures shown previously in this chapter, and we later
construct aggregates at the regional level (Autonomous Communities). Although there is
no variation in the timing of the reforms across regions, it provides us with variation in
the shares out of employment and in per capita GDP.



                                                                                                             53
Thus, we estimate the following model:


S srgat   s 0    
                    r
                         sr Dr      
                                     g
                                          sg Dg      
                                                      a
                                                           sa Da    st   s1997 D1997  s 2002 D2002   s Osrgat   srgat


Where Ssrgat is the share of individuals of gender g and age-group a in region r in year t
that are in the status s (s being disability, unemployment and retirement), and Osrgat is the
corresponding share out of employment. The other set of explanatory variables are
region-dummies (Dr), gender-dummies (Dg), age-dummies (Da), a time trend ( st ) and
two dummies capturing the effect of the reforms: D1997 takes value one from 1997
onwards and zero otherwise, and D2002 takes value one from 2002 onwards and zero
otherwise.


In order to control for the endogeneity of the total outflow, we use regional GDP per
capita as an instrument. When we provide estimates at the country-level, we use national
values. We obtain GDP information from the Spanish Institute of Statistics
(www.ine.es).


We repeat the same analysis but, instead of using information about the stock of
individuals in the different programmes, we use information on the outflows from
employment as shown in Figures 46 to 48 above. This analysis is only shown using the
aggregates at the country-level because the data cells at the regional level were too small
as only the information on individuals that were working on the previous year is used to
obtain the different aggregate figures.


The results for the parameters of interest are shown in Table 4. Tables A1 to A3 in the
appendix show both the first-stage estimates and the coefficients of the other variables.
First, notice from Tables A1 to A3 that the total outflow and the share out of
employment diminished after both the 1997 and the 2002 reform.


The sign of the effects of the two reforms on the participation in each program is the
same using the data at the country-level (first three rows of Table 4) or exploiting the
regional variation (second three rows of Table 4) except for the effect of the 1997 reform
on the disability system. However, none of the effects at the country-level are significant



                                                                                                                              54
probably due to the small sample size (120 observations). On the other hand, the analysis
at the regional level shows an interesting pattern: both the 1997 and the 2002 reform
decreased the stock into old-age benefits at the cost of an increased share of the
participation into disability. More interestingly, the magnitude of the two opposite effects
is the same suggesting a clear substitution effect among these two programs in the older
age-groups.

The results also show that none of these two reforms had any effect on the share of
these age-groups into unemployment, which is highly explained by the total share of the
population out of employment. Regarding the effects of these two reforms on the
outflows from employment into the different programs shown in the last three rows of
Table 4, we find that there was a significant increase in the outflow from employment
into disability after the 2002 reform. The rest of coefficients are non-significant, although
we cannot rule out that this is due to the lack of explanatory power due to the small
sample size (108 observations).




                                                                                          55
5. Conclusions


In this chapter we have shown that despite the large improvements in mortality rates
among older individuals in Spain, the employment rates of individuals older than fifty-
five remain lower than the ones observed in the late 1970s, and the decrease in
participation is more drastic when comparing different cohorts with the same mortality-
based age than with the same age-since-birth.


Alternatively, decreases in mortality rates do not necessarily go hand in hand with
improvements in population health. The descriptive evidence on health trends provided
here remains inconclusive. On one hand, there is some evidence suggesting a health
deterioration, as the percentage that reports having reduced their principal activity
because of a health problem, as well as the prevalence of hypertension, cholesterol and
obesity, and the number of hospitalizations due to mental disorders have increased. On
the other hand, the percentage that reports being in good or very good health has also
increased, while the number of hospitalizations due to other illnesses except for mental
problems has decreased.


Health status is an important variable in determining labor force participation among
individuals younger than sixty, but it becomes less important as the social security
incentives of the old-age pension system kick in. The comparison of trends in mortality,
health and employment and participation in different social security programs shows a
lack of an overall association among these dimensions in the last twenty years in Spain.
Thus we try to disentangle the effect of the main social security reforms since 1990. In
1997 the medical requirements of the disability system were tightened and the generosity
of the old-age pension system was decreased, while in 2002 the job search criteria to
receive unemployment benefits was tightened and more incentives to retire later were
introduced. Using regional aggregate data, we find that both the 1997 and the 2002
reform decreased the stock into old-age benefits at the cost of an increased share of the
participation into disability. More interestingly, the magnitude of the two opposite effects
is the same suggesting a clear substitution effect among these two programs in the older
age-groups.




                                                                                         56
An avenue for further research is the evaluation of the aforementioned reforms using
longitudinal individual data in order to follow the different transitions. Moreover, it
would be of interest to use the time variation in the implementation of the different old-
age reforms in order to disentangle the effects of interest.
