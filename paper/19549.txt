                                              ABSTRACT

The Internet has radically transformed the way we live our lives. The net changes in consumer surplus
and economic activity, however, are difficult to measure because some online activities, such as obtaining
news, are new ways of doing old activities while new activities, like social media, have an opportunity
cost in terms of activities crowded out. This paper uses data from the American Time Use Survey
from 2003 – 2011 to estimate the crowdout effects of leisure time spent online. That data show that
time spent online and the share of the population engaged in online activities has been increasing steadily.
I find that, on the margin, each minute of online leisure time is correlated with 0.29 fewer minutes
on all other types of leisure, with about half of that coming from time spent watching TV and video,
0.05 minutes from (offline) socializing, 0.04 minutes from relaxing and thinking, and the balance from
time spent at parties, attending cultural events, and listening to the radio. Each minute of online leisure
is also correlated with 0.27 fewer minutes working, 0.12 fewer minutes sleeping, 0.10 fewer minutes
in travel time, 0.07 fewer minutes in household activities, and 0.06 fewer minutes in educational activities.

Introduction
The Internet has transformed many aspects of how we live our lives, but the magnitude of its
economic benefits is widely debated. Estimating the value of the Internet is difficult in part not
just because many online activities do not require monetary payment, but also because these
activities may crowd out other, offline, activities. That is, many of the activities we do online,
like reading the news or chatting with friends, we also did long before the Internet existed. The
economic value created by online activities, therefore, is the incremental value beyond the value
created by the activities crowded out. Estimates of the value of the Internet to the economy that
do not take into account these transfers will, therefore, overstate the Internet’s economic
contribution.

This observation is of course not unique to the Internet. In the 1960s Robert Fogel noted that the
true contribution of railroads to economic growth was not the gross level of economic activity
that could be attributed to them, but rather the value derived from railroads being better than
previously existing long-haul transport such as ships on waterways.1 The true net economic
benefit of the railroad was not small, but was much smaller than generally believed.

This paper takes to heart Fogel’s insight and attempts to estimate changes in leisure time spent
online and the extent to which new online activities crowd out other activities. If people mostly
do online what they used to do offline, then the benefits of time spent online is biased upwards,
potentially by a lot. In other words, if online time substitutes for offline time then that online
time represents purely an economic transfer, with the net incremental benefit deriving from
advantages of doing the activity online, but not from the time doing the activity, per se. By
contrast, brand new online activities or those that complement offline activities do create new
value, with activities crowded out representing the opportunity cost of that new activity.

With the available data, this paper does not evaluate which online activities substitute or
complement offline activities. Instead, it estimates the opportunity cost of online leisure time.
The analysis suggests that the opportunity cost of online leisure is less time spent on a variety of
activities, including leisure, sleep, and work. Additionally, the effect is large enough that better
understanding the value of this opportunity cost is a crucial issue in evaluating the effects of
online innovation.

To my knowledge, no empirical research has investigated how leisure time online substitutes for
or complements other leisure activities.2 In this paper I begin to answer that question using
detailed data from the American Time Use Survey, which allows me to construct a person-level
dataset consisting of about 124,000 observations from 2003 – 2011.

2003-2007. The author finds no particular effect of IT use on other time spent on other activities, though the
empirical test is simply whether IT users and non-users spend significantly different amounts of time on various
activities. John Robinson, “IT, TV and Time Displacement: What Alexander Szalai Anticipated but Couldn’t

I find that the share of Americans reporting leisure time online has been increasing steadily, and
much of it crowds out other activity. On average, each minute of online leisure is associated with
0.29 fewer minutes on all other types of leisure, with about half of that coming from time spent
watching TV and video, 0.05 minutes from (offline) socializing, 0.04 minutes from relaxing and
thinking, and the balance from time spent at parties, attending cultural events, and listening to the
radio. Each minute of online leisure is also correlated with 0.27 fewer minutes working, 0.12
fewer minutes sleeping, 0.10 fewer minutes in travel time, 0.07 fewer minutes in household
activities, and 0.06 fewer minutes in educational activities, with the remaining time coming from
sports, helping other people, eating and drinking, and religious activities.

Among the interesting findings by population groups, the crowdout effect of online leisure on
work decreases with age beyond age 30, but remains fairly constant with income. Online leisure
has a large crowdout effect on time spent on education among people age 15-19, but the effect
decreases steadily with age.

Existing Research on The Economic Value of the Internet
The value of the Internet is intrinsically difficult to estimate in part because it enables so many
activities and in part because many of the most popular online activities are “free” in the sense
that they have no direct monetary cost to consumers. Several tools exist for valuing nonmarket
goods, such as contingent valuation surveys to revealed preference inferred by related market
activities.3 Those mechanisms have shortcomings. In principle, contingent valuation can tell you
willingness to pay, but people often have no reason to respond truthfully to contingent valuation
surveys. Measuring spending on relevant complements reveals how much people spend on an
activity, but not how much they would be willing to spend.

Given those weaknesses, perhaps the most common approach to valuing time spent on activities
outside of work is to value that time at the wage rate under the implicit assumption that the
marginal minute always comes from work. Of course, that assumption may be problematic, as
those who employ that approach readily admit. Nevertheless, it is a useful starting point.

Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) were among the first to apply this approach to the Internet. They
estimated the consumer surplus of personal (i.e., non-work) online time using the wage rate as
the measure of time value and an imputed demand curve.4 They estimated a consumer surplus at
about $3,000 per person. Setting aside the question of whether the wage rate is an accurate
measure of the value of all leisure time, this approach provides an estimate of gross consumer
surplus as it does not measure incremental benefits.

Brynjolfsson and Oh (2010) improves on Goolsbee and Klenow with newer survey data, from
2003 – 2010, and measure the value of incremental time spent online.5 Although they also use
the wage rate to estimate surplus, their estimates are smaller in magnitude because they focus on

                                                                                                             3
the increase in time spent online over this time period rather than the aggregate time spent
online. Based on that approach, they estimate the increase in consumer surplus from the Internet
to be about $33 billion, with about $21 billion coming from time spent using “free” online
services.

Both Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) and Brynjolfsson and Oh (2010) almost certainly over-
estimate the true surplus created by the Internet, even setting aside the question of whether all
leisure time should be valued at the wage rate. In particular, they neglect to factor in the extent to
which consumers are simply doing some things online that they used to do offline and that new
activities must at least partially come at the expense of activities they are no longer doing.
Spending an hour reading the paper online shows up as a “free” activity, assuming no subscriber
paywall, but is not intrinsically more valuable than the same hour spent reading the news on
paper. Similarly, the net benefit to you of reading an electronic book on a Kindle, for example,
does not include the time spent enjoying the book if you would have otherwise read the book in
dead-tree format. Instead, the net benefit is only the incremental value of reading an electronic,
rather than paper, book.

To be sure, the online version of the newspaper must generate additional consumer surplus
relative to the offline version or the newspaper industry would not be losing so many print
readers, but not all of time spent reading the paper online reflects the incremental value of the
Internet. Additionally, at a price of zero the activity might attract more consumers than when the
activity was paid, or consumers might read more electronic books than paper books because they
prefer the format or because e-books are so much easier to obtain. But even if lower prices
increase consumption of a particular activity, the cost of that additional consumption is time no
longer spent on another activity.

Activities that once required payment but became free, such as reading the news online,
represent a transfer of surplus from producers to consumers, but not new total surplus. Of course,
these transfers may have large economic effects as they can lead to radical transformations of
entire industries, especially given that consumers spend about $340 billion annually on leisure
activities.6 Reallocating those $340 billion is sure to affect the industries that rely on it. Hence,
we should expect to see vigorous fights between cable, Netflix, and content producers even if
total surplus remains constant. Similarly, as Joel Waldfogel shows in this volume, the radical
transformation in the music industry does not appear to have translated into radical changes in
the amounts of music actually produced. That is, the Internet may have thrown the music
industry into turmoil, but that appears to be largely because the Internet transferred large
amounts of surplus to consumers rather than changing net economic surplus.

As the number and variety of activities we do online increases, it stands to reason that our
Internet connections become more valuable to us. Greenstein and McDevitt (2009) estimate the
incremental change in consumer surplus resulting from upgrading from dialup to broadband

6
 See Table 57, http://www.bls.gov/cex/2009/aggregate/age.xls. The $340 billion estimate includes expenditures on
entertainment, which includes “fees and admissions,” “audio and visual equipment and services,” “pets, toys,
hobbies, and playground equipment,” and “other entertainment supplies, equipment, and services.” I added
expenditures on reading to entertainment under the assumption that consumer expenditures on reading are likely to
be primarily for leisure.

service based on changes in quantities of residential service and price indices.7 They estimate the
increase in consumer surplus related to broadband to be between $4.8 billion and $6.7 billion.

Rosston, Savage, and Waldman (2010) explicitly measure consumer willingness to pay for
broadband and its various attributes using a discrete choice survey approach.8 They find that
consumers were willing to pay about $80 per month for a fast, reliable broadband connection, up
from about $46 per month since 2003. In both years the average connection price was about $40,
implying that (household) consumer surplus increased from about $6 per month in 2003 to $40
per month in 2010. That change suggests an increase of about $430 per year in consumer surplus
between 2003 and 2010. Translating this number into total consumer surplus is complicated by
the question of who benefits from each broadband subscription and how to consider their value
from the connection. That is, a household paid, on average, $40 per month for a connection, but
does each household member value the connection at $80? Regardless of the answer to that
question, Rosston, Savage, and Waldman’s (2010) estimate is clearly well below Goolsbee and
Klenow (2006).

In the remainder of the paper I will build on this research by explicitly estimating the cost of
online activities by investigating the extent to which online activities crowd out previous
activities.

The American Time Use Survey, Leisure Time, and Computer Use
Starting in 2003 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census began the American
Time Use Survey (ATUS) as a way of providing “nationally representative estimates of how,
where, and with whom Americans spend their time, and is the only federal survey providing data
on the full range of nonmarket activities, from childcare to volunteering.”9

Each year the survey includes about 13,000 people (except in 2003 when it included about
20,000) whose households had recently participated in the Current Population Survey (CPS).10
From the relevant BLS files we constructed a 2.5 million-observation dataset at the activity-
person-year level for use in identifying the time of day in which people engage in particular
activities, and a 124,000-observation person-year level dataset for examining the crowd-out
effect.

The ATUS has several advantages for estimating the extent to which online time may crowd out
or stimulate additional time on other activities. First, each interview covers a full 24-hour period,

   More specifically, BLS notes that “Households that have completed their final (8th) month of the Current
Population Survey are eligible for the ATUS. From this eligible group, households are selected that represent a
range of demographic characteristics. Then, one person age 15 or over is randomly chosen from the household to
answer questions about his or her time use. This person is interviewed for the ATUS 2-5 months after his or her
household's final CPS interview.” http://www.bls.gov/tus/atusfaqs.htm



                                                                                                             5
making it possible to study how time spent on one activity might affect time spent on another
activity. Second, it is connected to the CPS so includes copious demographic information about
the respondents.

Third, the survey focuses on activities, not generally on the tools used to conduct those activities.
So, for example, reading a book is coded as “reading for personal interest” regardless of whether
the words being read are of paper or electronic provenance.11 As a result, the value of the time
spent reading would not be mistakenly attributed to the Internet when using these data. Similarly,
time spent watching videos online would be coded as watching TV, not computer leisure time.

The survey does, however, explicitly include some online activities already common when the
survey began in 2003. In particular, time spent doing personal email is a separate category from
other types of written communication.12 Online computer games, however, are simply included
under games.

ATUS coding rules therefore imply that any computer- or Internet-based personal activity that
did not exist in 2003 as its own category would be included under “Computer use for leisure
(excluding games),” which includes “computer use, unspecified” and “computer use, leisure
(personal interest).”13 For example, Facebook represents the largest single use of online time
today, but ATUS has no specific entry for social media, and therefore would almost certainly
appear under computer use for leisure.

This feature of the ATUS means that increases in computer use for leisure represent incremental
changes in time people spend online and that it should be possible to determine the opportunity
cost of that time—what people gave up in order to spend more time online. It worth noting,
however, that the ATUS does not code multitasking, which is a distinct disadvantage to this
research to the extent that online behavior involves doing multiple activities simultaneously. In
principle the survey asks whether the respondent is doing multiple activities at a given time, but
only records the “primary” activity.

To reiterate, the ATUS does not make it possible to determine, say, how much time spent
watching video has migrated from traditional television to online services like Netflix. It does,
however, tell us how new online activities since 2003 have crowded out activities that existed at
that time and—to extend the video example—how much those activities have crowded out (or
in) time spent watching video delivered by any mechanism.

A significant disadvantage the survey, however, is that as a survey, as discussed above,
respondents have little reason to respond truthfully, especially about sensitive subjects. For
example, would viewing pornography online be categorized under “computer use for leisure”

   More explicitly, reading for pleasure is activity code 120312: Major Activity code 12 (Socializing, relaxing, and

however, any time spent doing volunteer work on a computer is its own category (150101).

(based on the “unspecified” example in the codebook), or under “personal/private activities”
(also the “unspecified” example under this subcategory)?

“Computer Use for Leisure” is Online Time

The relevant ATUS category is time spent using a computer for leisure.14 This measure explicitly
excludes games, email, and computer use for work and volunteer activities. While some
computer leisure activities may not necessarily involve the Internet, nearly all of the many
examples provided to interviewers under that heading involve online activities (Figure 1).
Additionally, while the measure is coded as “computer use for leisure,” based on the coding
instructions it also likely includes mobile device use.

             Figure 1: Evolution of Examples of "Computer Use for Leisure" Provided for ATUS Coders 15




Based on what the ATUS measure excludes and other sources of information detailing what
online activities include, we can get a good idea of what people are probably spending their time
doing. Nielsen identifies the top 10 online activities (Table 1). Of the top 10, the ATUS variable
excludes online games, e-mail, and any Internet use for work, education, or volunteer activities.
Based on this list, it is reasonable to conclude that the top leisure uses included in the ATUS
variable are social networks, portals, and search.

 video-specific or movie-specific websites (e.g., streamed video on sports or news sites).

How Do Americans Spend Their Time?

The New York Times produced an excellent representation of how Americans spend their time
from the ATUS (Figure 2). As the figure highlights, ATUS data track activities by time of day
and activity, as well as by different population groupings due to coordination with the CPS. Each
major activity in the figure can be broken down into a large number of smaller activities under
that heading. The figure reveals the relatively large amount of time people spend engaged in
leisure activities, including socializing and watching TV and movies.




                                                                                                                 8

The ATUS includes detailed data on how people spend their leisure time. ATUS has seven broad
categories of leisure, but I pull “computer use for leisure” out of the subcategories to yield eight
categories of leisure. Figure 3 shows the share of time Americans spent on these leisure activities
in 2011.

The total time Americans engage in leisure on average per day has remained relatively constant
at about five hours increasing from 295 minutes in 2003 to about 304 minutes in 2011, though it
has ranged from 293 to 305 minutes during that time.

Figure 4 shows the average number of minutes spent per day using a computer for leisure
activities. While the upward trend since 2008 is readily apparent, the data also show that, on
average, at about 13 minutes per day, leisure time online is a small share of the total five hours of
daily leisure activities the average American enjoys.

This average is deceptively low in part not just because it does not include time spent doing
email, watching videos, and gaming, but also because it is calculated across the entire population
so is not representative of people who spend any time online. Figure 5 shows that the average is
low primarily because a fairly small share of the population reports spending any leisure time
online (other than doing email and playing games). However, the figure shows that the share of
the population who spend non-gaming and non-email leisure time online is increasing, and, on
average, people who spend any leisure time online spend about 100 minutes a day—nearly one-
third of their total daily leisure time.

Who Engages in Online Leisure?

Online leisure time differs across many demographics, including age and income. As most would
expect, the amount of online leisure time decreases with age, more or less (Figure 6). People
between 15 and 17 spend the most time online, followed by 18-24 year olds. Perhaps somewhat
surprisingly, the remaining age groups report spending similar amounts of time engaged in
online leisure. However, because total leisure time increases with age, beginning with the group
age 35-44, the share of leisure time spent online continues to decrease with age.




                                                                                                                           11

Perhaps not surprisingly given the trends discussed above, both the amount of leisure time spent
online (Figure 7) and the share of respondents reporting spending leisure time online is generally
increasing over time (Figure 8).

Leisure time also varies by income. Figure 9 shows average total leisure time excluding
computer use and computer use for leisure by income. The figure shows that overall leisure time
generally decreases with income. Computer use for leisure, on the other hand, appears to
increase with income.




                                                                                                                    13

People with higher incomes, however, are more likely to have computer access at home,
meaning average computer use by income is picking up the home Internet access effect.

Goldfarb and Prince (2008) investigated the question of online leisure by income in a paper
investigating the digital divide.17 Based on survey data from 2001, they find that conditional on
having Internet access, wealthier people spend less personal time online than poorer people.
Their key instrument identifying Internet access is the presence of a teenager living in the house,
which may make a household more likely to subscribe to the Internet but not more likely to
spend personal time online except due to having Internet access.

With the ATUS data I can attempt to replicate their instrumental variables results using this more
recent data. While I know the ages of all household members, the data do not indicate whether a
household has Internet access. However, I can identify some households that have access. In
particular, any ATUS respondent who spends any time at home involved in computer leisure, e-
mail, or using a computer for volunteer work must have home Internet access. Following
Goldfarb and Prince, I estimate the following two simultaneous equations using two-stage least
squares:

   where i indicates a respondent, and Z is the vector of independent variables included in the first

   so the data are a stacked cross-section rather than a pure time series. “Labor force status” is a
   vector of dummy variables indicating whether the respondent is employed and working,
   employed but absent from work, employed but on layoff, unemployed and looking for work, or
   not in the labor force. I include year dummy variables to control for time trends. I include an
   indicator for the day of the week the survey took place since certain activities—leisure time
   especially—differs significantly across days.
   As mentioned, my indicator for home Internet access identifies only a portion of households that
   actually have Internet access. This method implies that only 17 percent of households had access
   in 2010 when the U.S. Census estimated that more than 70 percent actually had access.18
   Nevertheless, in the first stage of this two-stage model the variable is useful in creating a
   propensity to have access for use in the second stage in that while the level is wrong, the fitted
   trend in growth in Internet access tracks actual growth in access reasonably well. The fitted
   propensity to have access increases by about 70 percent while actual home Internet access
   increased by about 78 percent during that same time period.19
   Table 2 shows the (partial) results of estimating the set of equations above. The first column
   replicates Goldfarb and Prince. These results mirror theirs: conditional on home Internet access,
   computer leisure time decreases with income. In order to see whether computer leisure looks
   different from other types of leisure, I change the dependent variable to computer leisure as a
   share of total leisure (column 2). These results are similar in that conditional on home Internet
   access, computer time as a share of total leisure time decreases with income, although the effect
   is fairly small in magnitude above $50,000 in annual family income.

   I also find that computer use for leisure decreases with education, conditional on access,
   although the effect on computer use as a share of leisure is less straightforward. For example,
   online leisure as a share of total leisure is less for people with masters’ degrees than for people
   with doctorate degrees. By race, people who identify as “White-Asian-Hawaiian” spend the most
   time engaged in online leisure, followed by “White-Asian,” “Black,” and finally “White.”
   Not surprisingly, the largest amount of online leisure takes place on Saturday and Sunday,
   followed closely by Friday. Wednesday appears to have the least online leisure.
   As Goldfarb and Prince note, these results shed some light on the nature of the digital divide. In
   particular, while we know from Census and other data that a significant gap remains on Internet
   access, conditional on access poorer people and minorities are more likely to engage in computer
   leisure than are rich people and white people.
   Goldfarb and Prince note that these results are consistent with poorer people having a lower
   opportunity cost of time. These results, using ATUS data, are also consistent with that
   hypothesis. However, because, as shown above, poorer people engage in more leisure time
   overall, the results also suggest that online leisure may not be so different from offline leisure, at
   least in terms of how people value it.


                                                                                                                   16
What times do people engage in online leisure?

As discussed, to better understand the true costs (and benefits) of time spent online, it is
important to figure out the source of the marginal minute online—what activities does it crowd
out? It is reasonable to assume that much of it comes from other leisure activities, since leisure
time has remained unchanged for so many years, but it need not necessarily come only from
other leisure time.

To begin to understand where online time comes from, we first look at it in the context of some
other (major) activities throughout the day.

Figure 10 shows how sleep, work, leisure (excluding computer time), and computer time for
leisure are distributed throughout the day. Not surprisingly, most people who work begin in the
morning and end in the evening, with many stopping mid-day, presumably for lunch. People
begin heading to sleep en masse at 9:00 pm with nearly half the over-15 population asleep by 10
pm and almost everyone asleep at 3 am. Leisure time begins to increase as people wake up and
increases steadily until around 5 pm when the slope increases and the share of people engaged in
leisure peaks at about 8:45 pm before dropping off as people go to sleep.

Time engaged in computer leisure, a subcategory of leisure, tracks overall leisure fairly well, but
exhibits somewhat less variation. In particular, the peak in the evening is not as pronounced and
continues later in the evening. This time distribution suggests that computer leisure may, in
principle, crowd out not just other leisure activities, but also work, sleep, and other (smaller)
categories. The next section investigates the extent to which online leisure crowds out these other
categories.




                                                                                                              17
What Does Online Leisure Crowd Out?
The ATUS has 17 “major categories” of activities (plus one “unknown” category for activities
that the interviewer was unable to code). Each of these major categories includes a large number
of subcategories. The first step in exploring where online leisure time comes from is to
investigate its effects at the level of these major categories. The second step will be investigating
the effects within those categories.

Major Activity Categories

Table 3 shows the average time spent on each of the 18 major categories. Personal care, which
includes sleep, represents the largest block of time, followed by leisure, work, and household
activities.

To explore potential crowdout effects, I begin by estimating 18 versions of equation (3), once for
each major activity category.

Table 4 shows the coefficient (and t-statistic) on the computer leisure variable from each of the
18 regressions (the full regression results are in the appendix). Figure 11 shows the results
graphically. Perhaps not surprisingly, since computer use for leisure is a component of the major
leisure category, computer use for leisure has the largest effect on other leisure. Each minute
spent engaged in computer leisure represents almost 0.3 minutes less of doing some other type of
leisure. Online leisure appears to have a relatively large effect on time spent at work, as well,
with each minute of online leisure correlated with about 0.27 minutes less time working. Each
minute of online leisure is also correlated with 0.12 minutes of personal care. Most other
activities also show a negative, though much smaller, correlation with online leisure.

Note: Each cell shows the coefficient on the “computer use for leisure” variable and its statistical significance in a regression in
which the column heading is the dependent variable and regression includes only the observations in the group represented by the
row heading. Thus, the table shows a single coefficient from each of 156 separate regressions. Each regression includes variables

Men and women show few differences in terms of crowd-out effects, except for time spent
helping household members. While online leisure time is not statistically significantly correlated
with helping household members for men, each minute of online leisure is associated with 0.08
fewer minutes helping household members for women. This result, however, is at least partly
because women spend more than 50 percent more time helping household members than men do.

Among race, Black people show the biggest crowd-out correlation between online and other
leisure, while Hispanic people should the smallest crowding out. Black, White, and Hispanic
people show similar levels of crowding out on work, with Asians showing the smallest crowding
out of work. Asians, however, show the most crowding out of online time on education, with
each minute of online leisure correlated with 0.23 fewer minutes engaged in educational
activities.

Perhaps the most striking result is how the correlation between online time and education differs
by age. Figure 12 shows this information graphically. Among people age 15-19, each minute of
online leisure is correlated with 0.3 fewer minutes engaged in educational activities. The
magnitude of the crowd-out correlation decreases quickly with age: 0.12 minutes for ages 20-24,
0.03 minutes for ages 45-59, and no statistically significant correlation beyond age 50.

To some extent, the decreasing magnitude of the correlation with age has to do with the simple
fact that the amount of time spent engaged in educational activities decreases sharply with age—
much more sharply than the time spent in online leisure activities. This relationship, however,
does not change markedly when estimating elasticities rather than levels: among the youngest
group, each percent increase in time spent online is correlated with 0.06 percent less time spent
in educational activities. The correlation becomes generally smaller in magnitude with age and
statistically insignificant by age 45.

Activity Subcategories

As discussed above, each major category includes multiple subcategories (and even more sub-
sub categories). To get a better idea of which specific activities online leisure might crowd out, I
now estimate a set of similar regressions with the largest subcomponents of leisure as the
dependent variable. Table 6 shows the coefficient its statistical significance for the online leisure
variable for each regression. As above, the full regression results are in the appendix.

Note: Each entry shows the coefficient (and t-statistic) on the variable representing time engaged in online leisure in a regression in

Online leisure has the strongest (in magnitude) negative correlation with watching TV and
movies. Each minute of online leisure is associated with 0.12 minutes less of watching video.
Note that this result does not speak to the question of whether over-the-top video like Netflix
complements or substitutes for traditional TV.21 Watching video online in any form—including
YouTube and Netflix—is coded as watching video, not computer leisure time. Thus, these results
suggest that online activities not captured by the 2003-era list of leisure activities have a
crowding out effect on TV viewing. Given that Americans spend 2.75 hours per day watching
TV (according to ATUS; more according to Nielsen), the crowdout effect is small.

Nevertheless, the crowdout effect on video suggests that the net effect of the Internet is less time
watching all forms of video. If this result holds true, it means not only that OTT video competes
with traditional video but that they are competing over a shrinking share of Americans’ time.

The next-largest effect is on socializing and communicating. Each minute of online leisure time
is correlated with 0.05 minutes less socializing in more traditional ways.

Social media has become among the most popular online activities. Survey data from the Pew
Internet and American Life Project show that by 2012 nearly 70 percent of all Internet users had
engaged in social media online and almost half had done so the day prior to being surveyed.
21
   How OTT affects traditional TV is, of course, an important question that will affect the video delivery industry.
Israel and Katz (2010) argue that Nielsen surveys and other data suggest online video complements traditional video
because people watch online video to “catch up with programming or if the TV itself is unavailable.” (Mark Israel
and Michael Katz, The Comcast/NBCU Transaction and Online Video Distribution, May 4, 2010, para. 30.) Other
data suggest the two are not complements. Subscription TV services lost a record number of subscribers in the
second quarter of 2011 with estimates of the loss ranging from 380,000 to 450,000
(http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2011-08-10-cable-satellite_n.htm). Liebowitz and Zentner (2009) examine
econometrically the relationship between Internet penetration and TV watching, using data from 1997 through 2003.
They find a small negative correlation between the two, suggesting that online video was substituting for TV
watching, at least among younger people. Stan J Liebowitz and Alejandro Zentner, “Clash of the Titans: Does
Internet Use Reduce Television Viewing?,” Review of Economics and Statistics, Forthcoming (2009).

(Figure 13). Given the ubiquity of social media, it is not surprising that scholars in various fields
have investigated whether social networking strengthened or weakened other social ties, though
there does not appear to be consensus on the answer.22

Previous studies have asked whether online social networking might crowd out other activities.
Early studies, primarily during dialup days, were inconclusive,23 though the relevance of that
research to today’s activities is questionable, given the changes in the Internet, its ubiquity, and
the growing variety of social networking applications.

My results suggest a small crowding out effect of online leisure on offline socializing. Data from
the ATUS show generally declining levels of offline socializing since 2003 (Figure 14).

My results also suggest that other offline leisure activities that involve interacting with other
people are crowded out by online leisure: attending parties and attending cultural events and
going to museums are all negatively correlated with online leisure. In short, these results based
on ATUS data suggest that a cost of online activity is less time spent with other people.

Listening to the radio is also negatively and statistically significantly correlated, but the
magnitude of the effect is quite small. Given the way the ATUS is coded, one might expect that
if time spent listening to the radio is negatively correlated with online leisure that time spent
listening to music but not on the radio would be positively correlated, not because listening to
online streaming music would show up in the online leisure variable, but because people likely to
engage in online leisure may also be likely to listen to streaming media. The coefficient is
positive, but is not statistically significant.

Online leisure is statistically and positively correlated with one category of leisure: hobbies,
although the magnitude is small. Each minute of online leisure is correlated with 0.004 minutes
of doing hobbies. However, considering Americans spend, on average, only about two minutes a
day on hobbies, the effect is not as small as it might seem based on the coefficient alone. A
possible explanation for this effect is that the Internet has given people a way to find and interact
with others who share their particular hobby interests. Similarly, the Internet is awash with
instructional videos, product manuals, and other ways to get information about hobbies, and it is
therefore not surprising to find a correlation between time spent doing hobbies and time online.

Conclusions

The amount of leisure time we spend online is increasing steadily as is the variety of activities
available to do online. Translating this time into increased economic surplus is difficult, not just
because many of these activities require no monetary payments, but because many online
activities represent activities we already did but in a different form, and even brand new
activities like social media come at the expense of activities we no longer do. Estimates of the



                                                                                                    25
value of online time that do not take these factors into account will over-estimate the incremental
economic surplus created by the Internet.
This paper does not estimate the net change in surplus, but uses data from the American Time
Use Survey to estimate the extent to which new online activities crowd out other, offline,
activities. I find that online leisure does crowd out other activities. In particular, some
incremental online leisure comes primarily from offline leisure, work time, and sleep. Online
time is also correlated with less time traveling, which should count as a benefit. Online leisure is
also associated with less time engaged in educational activities, especially among younger
people. The crowd out effect is sufficiently large that understanding the true economic effects of
the Internet must take them into account.
This research is a small step forward in understanding the economic effects of the Internet. The
data clearly show that time spent and the share of the population engaged in online leisure is
increasing. The analyses suggest that new online activities come at least partly at the expense of
less time doing other activities. Much, however, remains yet to be understood. While I control
for a large number of relevant factors in the analyses, the relationships between online and
offline time are correlations, meaning we cannot say definitively that an incremental minute
translates into a tenth-of-a-minute less sleep. Perhaps, instead, when people suffer from bouts of
insomnia they take to the Internet, either to look for insomnia cures or other ways of passing a
sleepless night. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that online activities, even when free from
monetary transactions, are not free from opportunity cost.
A next research step may be estimating the increase in economic surplus from new online
activities net of the activities they replace, a la Robert Fogel’s analyses of the true net economic
effects of railroads. While such work is challenging, such an effort may be a worthwhile
endeavor to counter much of the poorly-informed hyperbole that routinely emanates from
policymakers
