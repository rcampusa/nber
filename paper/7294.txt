        In this paper we provide an empirical evaluation of the effect that the provision of an arbitration
statute has on the wage levels of police officers. We analyze the effect of arbitration on wages by comparing
wage levels across political jurisdictions and over time using a sample of states. Two complementary data
sources are used: panel data on state level wages of police officers, and individual level data on police
officers from Decennial Censuses. The empirical results from both data sets are remarkably consistent and
provide no robust evidence that the presence of arbitration statues has a consistent effect on overall wage
levels. On average, the effect of arbitration is approximately zero, although there is substantial
heterogeneity in the estimated effects across states.

                                               Introduction

        In the public sector, where strikes are often legally prohibited, the advantages of

binding arbitration for the day to day functioning of the industrial relations system are

widely acknowledged. (See, especially, Lester (1984).) At the same time, however,

there has been continuing concern over the possibility that the presence of an

arbitration statute may distort and increase wage levels artificially above what would

otherwise prevail. In this paper we provide an empirical evaluation of the effect that the

provision of an arbitration statute has on the wage levels of police officers. Since police

officers are a very homogeneous class of workers, and since arbitration statues are

both present and absent in roughly the same proportion among the non-Southern

states that we study, this group provides a fruitful evaluation design.

         Although there is a considerable literature attempting to measure the effect of

collective bargaining in the public sector on wages1, attempts to measure the effect of

the arbitration institution on wages face a major conceptual problem. In the standard

model of the arbitration process, due to Stevens (1966) and Farber and Katz (1979),

negotiated and arbitrated wages are not expected to differ because negotiations take

place "in the shadow of arbitration." Thus, the comparison of arbitrated and negotiated

wages provides no information on the overall impact on wage levels of the workers

covered by the arbitration statute.

       Our approach to solving this problem is to compare overall wage levels across


  'A comprehensive, but dated survey is Freeman (1986).




                                                      1
political jurisdictions and over time in order to isolate the impact of the arbitration

statute. Approximately one third of states introduced binding arbitration to resolve labor

relations disputes involving police officers at various dates over the past 30 years.

Thus, it is possible to provide both across-state and within-state estimates of the effect

of arbitration on wage levels. Our analysis focuses on states in three regions: the

Northeast, the Midwest and the West, and uses data from two complementary sources.

First, we have constructed a panel data set on state level wages of police protection

workers in these states. Approximately half of the states in these regions ultimately

adopted arbitration statutes, while the remaining states were selected for comparison.

Second, we have constructed an individual level data set of police officers from the

1970, 1980 and 1990 Decennial Censuses for these same states. This latter data set

permits us to control for possible heterogeneous changes in police demographics

across states and over time.

       The empirical results provide no strong evidence that the presence of arbitration

statutes has had any effect on overall wage levels. There is some weak evidence that

wage levels may actually be lower as a result of arbitration statutes, although there is

also some evidence of heterogeneity in the estimated effects. These results may come

as a surprise to some, but they are by no means inconsistent with plausible theories of

the role of arbitration in the wage determination process.

       The first section of the paper outlines the motivation for the empirical tests and

the design of the data collection. The data and results are described in the second and




                                              2
third sections of the paper, and these are followed by a brief conclusion and discussion

of the limitations of the results.



                                I. Motivating the Measurement Method

        Arbitration systems for public sector workers, especially for police officers and

firefighters, are typically implemented because these workers are forbidden the right to

strike. Once collective bargaining has been permitted, arbitration systems are a natural

procedure for resolving what might otherwise be very protracted negotiations.

        The now standard model of arbitrator behavior predicts that to survive arbitrators

must attempt to make decisions similar to those that would have been made by other

arbitrators had they been in the same position.2 This is the only strategy that will

guarantee that the parties will continually select them. This implies that negotiating

parties can predict the central tendency of any award that is likely to be made by an

arbitrator. As a result, if the parties are risk neutral, they will rationally propose

settlements that are distributed around this central tendency. The result is that

negotiated settlements mimic the central tendency of arbitrator awards.

         This argument is quite general and independent of the type of arbitration

institution adopted. If the parties are not risk neutral, however, then the negotiated

settlements need not equal the central tendency of arbitration awards. The difference


  2That is, arbitrators are said to be statistically exchangeable (or random). This assumption forms the basis of the
models used by Farber and Katz (1979) and Farber (1980) and others. The logical foundation for this assumption,
and a summary of the evidence to support it, is contained in Ashenfelter (1987).




                                                          3
between arbitrated and negotiated settlements will reflect any differences in the risk

preferences of the party. In general, the more risk averse party is disadvantaged and

will accept a lower negotiated settlement in order to avoid the risk associated with the

arbitration system.3 According to this theory, the negotiated settlements do not provide

a useful comparison group for determining the impact of arbitration on wages because

of the spillover between arbitrated and negotiated settlements. The same argument is

equally applicable to the use of non-union workers, who would otherwise be covered by

the arbitration statute, as a basis for comparison. The mere presence of an arbitration

statute creates incentives for the wages of all workers to be treated similarly.4

        There is some good evidence that, as predicted, negotiated and arbitrated

wages do not differ significantly. In careful studies both Bloom (1981) and Currie

(1989) conclude that this is the case.

        The interesting question that this analysis raises, but does not answer, is, what

determines the central tendency of arbitrator awards? One possibility is that arbitrators

look to previously negotiated settlements. If this is uniformly the case, then arbitrated

and negotiated settlements are not only equal, they must remain constant at the same

level! It is certainly possible that this is the case with some arbitration systems in some

periods, but it seems unlikely that it could exist indefinitely. Since it is unclear what

determines the central tendency of arbitrator awards, and since the presence of long-


  3See especially   Farber (1980).

  4This is also the argument made by Freeman, Ichniowski, and Lauber (1985) with respect to collective bargaining
coverage in the public sector.




                                                       4
term implicit contracts is likely to introduce considerable specificity in the employment

relationship, it is essentially an empirical question whether the presence of an

arbitration statute affects the overall wage level.

       This discussion makes it clear that to evaluate the effect of an arbitration law on

the wage level it is necessary to use a comparison group that falls outside the coverage

of the arbitration statute. In this study we use two different comparison groups for this

purpose. We use individual states as controls for themselves (by comparing pre and

post-arbitration wages) and we use adjacent states as controls (comparing states with

and without arbitration). In our sample we have selected a total of 33 states from the

Northeast, the Midwest, and the West. In addition to the geographic variation across

the sample, there is also variation in whether arbitration was adopted by the sample

states and, for those states that did adopt arbitration, the date at which arbitration

became effective. In particular, during the sample period, 18 of the selected states

introduced binding arbitration for police officers at various dates between 1969 and

1988. In addition, there were a variety of different types of arbitration adopted across

the sample. (Lester (1984) provides a careful study of nine of the jurisdictions in the

present sample.)

       Police officers in all these states form very homogeneous groups by comparison

with virtually any other occupation. In addition, the police officers in all these states

tend to belong to specialized unions of police officers or equivalent fraternal orders.

Strikes by police officers are illegal in all states.

                                        II. Data

      There are a variety of sources for data on police officer compensation. We use

data from two complementary sources. First, we use a long time series of the average

payroll cost per full-time equivalent employee of local police protection workers, which

comes from various issues of Public Employment, compiled by the U.S. Department of

Commerce. These data cover police officers and other police protection employees.

These are the workers who are generally directly covered by the arbitration statute and

they comprise the vast majority of police officers and support personnel in the states

covered.

       Second, we have constructed a micro data sample of police officers' annual

earnings and average hourly wages from the 1970, 1980 and 1990 Decennial

Censuses for the same group of states. For the 1970 census, we use data from both

the "15%, One-in-One-Hundred" and the "5%, One-in-One-Hundred" public use micro

samples (PUMS), giving approximately a 2 percent random sample; for the 1980 and

1990 censuses, we use data from the 5-percent PUMS. The sample includes police

and detectives, supervisors, and sheriffs and marshals who are employed by state or

local administrations. The sample was also restricted to individuals aged 25-50, who

worked at least 40 weeks the previous year, and whose annual earnings were at least

$5000 (in 1990 dollars) and below the topcode limit in effect in each year. The wage

and earnings information coverthe previous calendaryear (i.e. 1969, 1979 and 1989).




                                            6
The average hourly wage measure we use was computed as annual earnings divided

by the number of weeks worked multiplied by usual hours per week.5

        We have taken the date at which coverage became effective for the arbitration

statute from Valletta and Freeman (1 988).6 The list of states, together with the effective

adoption periods, and the number of observations in each state-year cell from the three

censuses are indicated in Table 1. There is an ambiguity in the categorization of New

York because arbitration was enacted for the City of New York two years in advance of

the legislation for the State of New York. We have adopted the later date, but using the

earlier date in the empirical analysis has no material effect on the results.

        The characteristics of the census samples by year and arbitration provisions are

described in an appendix, in Table Al. The demographic characteristics of the samples

appear reasonably stable over time, although there has been a significant increase in

the education level of police officers and the fraction female. Wages and annual

earnings have increased over time in states both with and without arbitration provisions.

The increase appears to have been greater for states with arbitration, but this may be

due to the changing composition of states with arbitration and heterogeneity across

states.



   As the 1970 census did not include the number of usual weekly hours last year, we computed the average hourly
wage for 1969 using the number of hours worked last week.

    Valletta and Freeman categorize the availability of arbitration as follows: 'no provision', 'specifically
prohibited", "voluntary" (both parties must consent), "discretionary" (administrative agency may initiate, either
unilaterally or upon the request of either party", and "mandatory" (required by statute). We treat the latter two
categories as representing binding arbitration.

                                   Ill. Empirical Results



State Level Analysis

      We begin our analysis by providing some basic facts about average monthly

compensation of police officers in the states under consideration in table 1. Table 1

divides the states into three regions -- the Northeast, Midwest, and West -- and, for

each region, orders the states by the date at which an Arbitration statute came into

effect. It is apparent from the table that there is substantial variation across states in

both the level of compensation in 1992 and the growth rates during the period 1961-92.

For example, compensation levels varied from $1 801 in West Virginia to $3556 in

California, while the average growth in real compensation ranged from 0.66 percent in

Indiana to 2.52 percent in New York. There is some systematic regional variation in

compensation levels and growth rates, which are generally higher in the Northeast and

West than the Midwest. However, there is also considerable variation within regions.

Also, there is no apparent relationship between the growth rates and the date of

adoption of arbitration.

       A very straightforward initial analysis of the data is contained in Figure 1 and

Table 2. For each region, we have constructed an unweighted index of the (logarithm

of) wages for states that eventually adopted arbitration and subtracted from it a similar

index of the wages for states that never adopted arbitration. The time series of these




                                              8
proportionate wage differences are graphed in Figure 1, while Table 2 presents the

means across alternative "pre-" and "post-" arbitration periods. The pre-arbitration

period is.the period before any state in the region adopted arbitration; similarly, the

post-arbitration periods are defined as the period from when the last state in the region

adopted an arbitration statute. For the Northeast the pre- and post- arbitration periods

are 1961-68 and 1979-92 respectively,7 and the corresponding periods for the Midwest

and West are 1961 -69 and 1985-92, and 1961 -73 and 1988-92. The dates defining

these periods are labeled on Figure 1.

        The first column of Table 2 contains the mean of the wage difference index for

each of the three regions for the pre-arbitration periods defined above. As is apparent

from Figure 1 and Table 2, wages of Police Officers in the arbitration states in the

Northeast and Midwest were on average 15 and 20 percent higher than in the non-

arbitration states over this period. Wages in the Western states, on the other hand,

were 5 percent lower in the states which later adopted arbitration. This implies that a

simple cross-section comparison would provide a very misleading measure of the effect

of arbitration on wage levels. The second column contains the corresponding average

wage difference indexes during the post-arbitration periods. The pattern of wage

differences is similar to that observed in the pre-arbitration periods: wages are

comparatively higher in the Northeast and Midwest "Arbitration" states, and lower in the


   Massachusetts repealed its compulsory arbitration statute in 1981. The analysis presented here ignores this
change, but the results are qualitatively unaffected by this factor --for example, omitting Massachusetts from the
analysis does not change the qualitative nature of the results.

West "Arbitration" states.

       A very simple estimate of the effect of the arbitration statutes on wages is

presented in the third column of Table 2. This estimate is computed by comparing the

wage differences in the pre- and post-arbitration periods for each region. The

"difference-in-differences" point estimates of the effect of arbitration vary across the

three regions: -6 percent in the Northeast, 4.8 percent in the Midwest and 1 .9 percent in

the West. The estimates for the Northeast and Midwest states are each statistically

different from zero, while the estimate for the Western states is not. Although

informative and easy to present, the simple comparisons in Table 2 and Figure 1 do not

take advantage of all the data available. For example, several other estimators of the

effect of arbitration could be constructed using different groups of comparison states

and/or comparison periods.

       We now turn to a series of regressions that exploit the data more fully. The

results of this analysis are presented in Table 3. We first present results using all the

states in the sample in row (1) of the table. Column (1) contains the estimated

arbitration effect on the logarithm of wages from a regression that controls for individual

year effects and state effects, and that allows arbitration to have a constant

proportionate effect on wage levels in each state. This specification finds that

arbitration reduces wages by a statistically insignificant 0.5 percent. One possibility is

that arbitration may directly affect wage growth. To examine this conjecture, the

specification reported in column (2) also includes an arbitration trend term, which grows




                                             10
linearly from the effective date of arbitration. The results for this specification are very

close to those in column (1): the estimated effect of arbitration on the wage level is 0.5

percent (and statistically insignificant), and the effect on wage growth is almost zero.

       Columns (3) and (4) repeat the analysis, but allow state-specific time trends.

The results of these specifications again find no statistically significant constant effect

of arbitration on the level of Police wages. However, the results in column (4) suggest

that arbitration reduces wage growth by a statistically significant -0.35 percent per year.

       In order to evaluate the robustness of these results, we repeat the analysis for

each region separately in rows (3), (4), and (5). The results for states in the Northeast

in row (2) imply two consistent findings: first, arbitration is estimated to have a

statistically significant negative effect on wages of between 2.6 and 4.3 percent; and

second, there is no evidence that arbitration affects the rate of wage growth in these

states. In contrast, for the Midwestern states, the results in columns (1) -- (3) show a

significant positive effect of arbitration on the level of wages of between 2 and 3.5

percent. However, when state-specific time trends in wages are allowed (column (4)),

the estimates find arbitration has a -0.6 percent effect on wage growth. Also, the

estimates for the Western states find no evidence of statistically significant arbitration

effects on either the level or growth of Police wages.

       Finally, we also allowed the effect of arbitration to vary across states in

specifications analogous to those presented in Table 3, and tested the joint significance

and equality of these effects. With the exception of the Western subsample of states,




                                             11
the test statistics indicate that the arbitration effects are jointly significant and that they

are not equal. This latter result serves to emphasize that, although the average effect

of arbitration on wage levels is small and negative, this masks considerable

heterogeneity in the estimated effects by state.



Census Analysis

       We now turn to the analysis using micro data from the decennial censuses.

Table 4 contains estimates of the effect of arbitration on the (logarithm of) annual

earnings and the (logarithm of) average hourly wages of police officers using a variety

of specifications and samples. The results in columns (1) -- (4) pertain to annual

earnings, while those in columns (5) -- (8) pertain to hourly wages. In order to control

for possible common unobservable factors across individuals which might bias the

precision of the results, all of the specifications allows for a common random

component of error across observations in each state-year cell.

        The first row in Table 3 presents the results using the full sample of states from

each of the three regions we consider. The model in column (1) includes just an

arbitration statute indicator variable, which varies across states and over time. This

specification suggests that the presence of an arbitration statute has a statistically

significant positive effect on police salaries, and raises salaries by 8 percent. The

model in column (2) includes observable individual specific demographic characteristics

in the regression. The result is to reduce the effect of arbitration to 5 percent, which is




                                               12
still statistically significant at conventional levels. In column (3), state dummy variables

are included in the model to control for heterogeneity across states in salaries. In this

specification, the estimated effect of arbitration is negative (-1.7 percent), but not

statistically different from zero. The final specification, presented in column (4),

includes year dummy variables to control for common economy-wide factors that may

affect salaries. The estimated effect of arbitration is again negative (-3.8 percent), but

not statistically different from zero. Columns (5) -- (8) present results for analogous

specifications for the logarithm of average hourly wages. The results are qualitatively

the same as for earnings: in the absence of state and year controls, the estimated

effect of arbitration is positive and statistically significant; however, there is no statistical

evidence of an arbitration effect once we control for state and year effects.

       In order to evaluate whether there are any regional differences in the effect of

arbitration on police wages and earnings, we repeat the above analysis separately for

each of the three regions. The results are presented in rows (2), (3) and (4) of Table 3

for states in the Northeast, the Midwest and the West respectively. The results are

broadly in line with those for the full sample in row (1). The single exception to the

finding that arbitration has no effect on police earnings and wages once state and year

effects are controlled for is in the Midwest, where the effect of arbitration on wages and

earnings is estimated to be 3-4 percent.

        Finally we consider the effect of arbitration statutes on the variability in wages

 and salaries. One plausible hypothesis, if arbitrators tend to propose settlements




                                               13
around the central tendency of possible outcomes, is that arbitration reduces the

dispersion in outcomes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we computed the state and year

specific standard deviations of the logarithm of individual annual earnings and hourly

wages, and compared the averages in samples with and without arbitration. We have

computed both the state-year specific standard deviations using the raw data, and also

the standard deviations for regression adjusted residuals from the regression

specifications in Table 4, rows (4) and (8), for annual earnings and hourly wages

respectively. The results are contained in Table 5. Row (1) presents the results of this

exercise using the raw data. The estimated effect of arbitration of the dispersion of

earnings is negative but not significantly different from zero. The effect on the

dispersion in hourly wages is also negative (-0.012) and has a t-value of 1.5, implying

some weak statistical evidence that arbitration does reduce the variability in wage

outcomes. Row (2) presents the results for the standard deviations of the regression-

adjusted residuals: the results are qualitatively the same as those in row (1). All of

these results suggest that any effect of an arbitration statute on the dispersion in wage

rates is very small.



                                     IV. Conclusion

       It is well known that the presence of an arbitration system influences negotiated

settlements because they are negotiated in the shadow of the arbitrated decisions.

This is an extreme example of a spillover effect and it makes the measurement of the




                                            14
effect of the arbitration system on wage levels very difficult. Comparisons of arbitrated

and negotiated outcomes provide no evidence on the key question, so other

comparisons must be used.

       In this paper we have used comparisons of political jurisdictions with each other

and with themselves at different points in time to estimate the effect of arbitration

statutes on wage levels. Comparisons using both state-level time-series data and

micro-level data from the Census give remarkably similar results. The estimates tell a

complicated story. On average, there is no strong evidence that arbitration tends to

raise wage levels, but there is considerable evidence that this average effect masks

considerable heterogeneity in effects across states. There is some weak evidence that

arbitration may reduce the variability of wages. Although there is some evidence that

arbitration lead to an increase in police wages in the Midwest, accounting for differential

time trends in wage growth across states reverses this result. Since the estimated

effects do appear to differ by state, it is possible that this reflects the way that the

parties have interacted in the manipulation of the central tendency of arbitral awards.

Lester (1984) provides many anecdotes indicating that the parties strive to manipulate

these systems through the internal comparisons they engender. The evidence in this

paper suggests that the average effect on wage levels of this behavior is small.
