            Investment, Tobin's Q, and Multiple Capital Inputs




                                   ABSTRACT




      Despite   their solid theoretical basis, models of business
investment based on Tobin's Q      theory     have recorded a generally
disappointing empirical performance.  This paper examines one
possible source of misspecification. When the firm's technology is
expanded to include two or more capital inputs, the investment
equation following from maximizing behavior includes Q as well as a
series of additional explanatory variables. The importance of these
omitted variables is assessed, and the econometric evidence is mixed,
as the Multi-Capital Q    model   clearly dominates the Conventional
specification but empirical problems remain. In addition, the
implications of the parameter estimates from the Conventional and
Multi-Capital models for tax policy are noted.

     INVESTMENT. TOBIN'S Q. AND MULTIPLE CAPITAL INPUTS


I. INTRODUCTION
     Quantifying the parameters characterizing the capital
accumulation process has been the subject of economic research for a
number of years. A substantial amount of our knowledge of this
process is based on estimates of the "Neoclassical" investment model
pioneered by Dale Jorgenson (1963). While this econometric
specification is capable of explaining a substantial amount of the
variation in investment expenditures, it has been criticized for a lack
of careful consideration of dynamics arising from expectations
(Lucas, 1976) and intertemporal aspects of the technology (Nerlove,
1972).
         The Q theory approach to investment behavior, introduced by
Keynes (1964) and revitalized by James Tobin (1969), offers possible
solutions to these two shortcomings. In this model, a forward-
looking firm faced with costs in adjusting its capital stock will have
its investment expenditures determined by marginal Q, the ratio of
the discounted future revenues from an additional unit of capital to
the net-of-tax purchase price. Whenever this ratio differs from
unity, the firm has an incentive to alter its capital stock, but its
actions are tempered by the adjustment cost technology.       Since
marginal Q is unobservable, empirical models have utilized average
Q, defined as the ratio of the value of the firm, as evaluated in
financial markets, to the replacement cost of its existing capital stock.
By relying on financial market data, which in principle incorporates
expectations of future variables relevant to the investment decision,
                                                                         2

Q models   provide a direct role for expectations in the econometric
specification.
      The problem of unobservable expectations has received a great
deal of attention in the applied econometrics literature, and an
alternative approach uses time-invariant, forecasting equations to
calculate marginal Q. This class of solutions includes the two-step
procedure of Abel and Blanchard (1984), the maximum likelihood
estimator of Hansen and Sargent (1980), and the Euler equation
technique of Hansen and Singleton (1982); in the latter case, the
forecasting equations are determined by the choice of instruments.
These methods arose in response to the critique of Lucas (1976), who
argued that "any change in policy will systematically alter the
structure of econometric models" (p. 41). Under this view, changes in
policy are identified as changes in the parameters governing policy
outcomes, and these parameters will generally affect forecasts of
economic variables. Only if one maintains that the sample period
contains no changes in policy or non-policy factors affecting the
stochastic environment will the forecasting solutions to the
unobservable expectations problem be valid.    A significant advantage
of the Q approach  is that estimation can proceed even if the sample
period is characterized by an unstable stochastic environoment.
      However, the usefulness of Q theory is called into question by
its generally disappointing empirical performance.1 A number of the
problems associated with empirical Q models are evident in the


1 See Chirinko (1986, Section V.B.3) for a review of the econometric
results from Q models, and Clark (1979) for simulations comparing Q
to other investment models.

following investment equation estimated with aggregate data for
equipment, structures, and inventories,

         1(t) / K(t) =   .072 + .013       (t) / K(t) +   .368   I(t-1) / K(t)
                         (.021)   (.005)                  (.190)                 (1)

where 1(t) and K(t) are the investment flow and capital stock,
respectively, for the three capital goods and c (t) is a variable closely
related to average Q (to be discussed below). The coefficient of .013
is smaller than that obtained in the Q study of Summers (1981, p.
101), who found that investment responded unreasonably slowly to
variations in (t). His simulations indicated that, twenty years after
an unexpected change in the economic environment, the capital stock
would have moved only three-fourths of the way to its ultimate,
steady-state value.2 Contrary to the theory, the lagged dependent




2 When constrained by a geometric lag distribution, the econometric
estimates of Ciccolo (1975) imply that the mean lag of the
adjustment to a change in the long-run capital stock is seven years
(Hall, 1977, p. 89).
                                                                              4

variable proves an important determinant of investment.3
Furthermore, the R2 is rather low and, as measured by the m-
statistic (cf., fn. 11), serial correlation in the residuals indicates that
the model is misspecified. A problem thus facing the applied
econometrician is that conventional Q theory does not suggest what
modifications or additional explanatory variables may be useful in
attenuating these deficiencies.
       An examination of the investment data for equipment,
structures, and inventories suggests a possible cause of this
disappointing empirical performance.   In Table I, the serial
correlation patterns for the three capital inputs differ widely,
indicating that the capital homogeneity assumption implicit in the
conventional Q model may be inappropriate. Under the assumption
that adjustment costs increase with the durability of the capital
asset, these patterns are consistent with the adjustment cost
technology underlying the Q model. Thus, the central idea to be
exploited in this study is that conventional formulations of empirical
Q models   are misspecified by failing to recognize the possibility that
the value of the firm depends on two or more capital inputs with
differing adjustment cost technologies.     That the relationship

3         (1983) has shown that lagged Q should be an important
    Fischer
determinant of investment spending. There are two objections to his
result. First, he enters lags into the maximization problem by
assuming that adjustment costs depend on both current and lagged
investment, but it is not at all clear what phenomena are being
captured by this formulation. Second, the investment schedule that
follows from his model is quite different from those actually used in
econometric work, and thus the relation betweeen his result and
empirically significant lagged variables is not apparent.
                                                                           5


between Q   and   investment is sensitive to the number of capital
inputs has been noted previously (Chirinko, 1982b; Wildasin, 1984).
In this paper, we investigate the specification error due to these
omitted variables, show that a structural model can be preserved
under a broader specification of the technology, and provide
econometric evidence to evaluate the Multi-Capital Q model.
      The theoretical development of the Multi-Capital Q model        is
contained in Section II, which relates investment expenditures,
(unobserved) marginal Q,   and   (observed) average Q.    We give
particular attention to the way in which debt finance affects the
definition of average Q.   Section   III considers specification issues
relating to the investment model.     In Section IV, the Conventional
and Multi-Capital Q   models   are estimated with a variety of
econometric techniques.    The simulated responses of investment
expenditures and capital accumulation to an unanticipated change in
the economic environment are calculated for both models in Section
V. A summary and conclusions are provided in Section VI.

II. THE MULTI-CAPITAL Q MODEL - THEORY
      The representative firm chooses variable and quasi-fixed
inputs to maximize the present discounted value of its cash flow
(V(O)) over an infinite horizon,
              00

  V(O) =      fo exp(- f p(s) ds) {R(t) -
                          0
                                            C(t)   -   T(t) - F(t)} dt ,   (2)



where p (s) is the discounting factor at time s and R(t), C(t), T(t), and
F(t) represent revenues, operating costs, taxes, and net financing
costs, respectively, at time t. Revenues (R(t)) are generated by
selling a single product in a competitive market at an exogenous
price (p(t)). The production technology (cI[tJ) depends on labor (L(t))
and J distinctive types of capital (K(t), jEJ), and is characterized by
constant returns to scale with respect to all inputs and by Inada
conditions,


  R(t) = p(t)   C1
                     [L(t),K(t),VjcJI   .                                  (3)



      Operating costs (C(t)) arise from purchasing inputs and
adjusting the capital stocks. The firm purchases labor services at
price w(t) and new capital (I(t)) at prices v(t) in perfectly
competitive factor markets. To capture the quasi-fixed nature of
capital, we assume that the firm incurs adjustment costs when
incorporating new capital goods into the production process. These
internal costs can be viewed as the movement of real resources from
producing output toward installing capital goods, are valued in terms
                                                                                     7

of the opportunity cost of foregone output, and increase at an
increasing rate as investment exceeds replacement needs, defined as
the product of an exponential depreciation rate () and the existing
capital stock.  These properties apply to the adjustment cost
functions (F[I(t),K(t)],VjcJ) that are homogeneous of degree one in
both arguments,


  C(t)         w(t) L(t) +         v(t) I(t) +   p(t)         F[I(t),K(t)J ,   (4)
                             jeJ                        jEJ



         An income tax is assessed at rate t(t) against the firms
revenues less labor and adjustment costs, and is reduced by tax
credits (k3(t)) extended on the purchase of investment goods. The
effective cost of the jth capital good is further lowered by tax
depreciation allowances granted against current taxes but based on
both current and past investments,

         -00



where     D(t-s,s) are tax depreciation allowances per dollar of the jth
investment made t-s periods ago according to the tax code in effect
in period s. When embedded in the firm's discounted cash flow
expression (2), equation (5) can be rearranged to isolate those factors
that depend on current decisions and those that are predetermined
at time t,

                   00            5

          z(t) =   ft    exp(- f p(u) du) er(s) D3(s-t,t) ds ,
                              t
                                                                              (6b)



                             0
          A(t,O) = t(t) f D(t-s,s) vs(s) Ia(s) ds .                           (6c)
                           -00
                                                         te [0,00)




The expression for z(t) represents the present discounted value of
current and future tax depreciation allowances flowing from a dollar
of investment in period t, and (6c) represents the total value of tax
depreciation allowances claimed at time t on the jth capital asset
purchased before time 0.   Total taxes (T(t)) paid by the firm,
excluding those directly associated with debt finance, are as follows,


  T(t) = t(t) {p(t) D [L(t),K(t),VjeJ] â€” w(t)      L(t) â€” p(t)         F[I(t),K(t)]}
                                                                 jeJ


      â€”
           , v(t)       (k(t)+z(t)) I(t) â€” A3(t,0)                            (7)
          jeJ


     Net financing costs (F(t)) for the jth type of capital are
introduced into the model by augmenting the firm's cash flow to
                                                                           9


reflect the acquisition and retirement of debt and net-of-tax interest
payments.4 A firm that finances a proportion (b(s)) of its net-of-tax
investment with debt will have its cash flow incremented by

  X(s) =     b(s)   (l_k(s)-z(s)) vs(s) I(s) .                      (8a)


Debt policy is exogenous to this model, and debt is retired at an
exponential rate (TI). In period t, the cash flow devoted to
retirements equals the amount of debt issued at time s (X(s))
multiplied by the "survival" factor (exp-rI (t-s)) and the retirement
rate (TI), and summed from time t backward,

    t
   f Ti X(s) exp(-i1(t-s)) ds .                                     (8b)
 -00



Interestpayments at time t are the product of the amount of debt
issued at time s surviving at time t and the interest rate (i(s))
prevailing at time s, summed from time t backward. In recognition
of the deductibility of interest payments against income taxes, they
are multiplied by one less the tax rate at time t,
             t

  (1-t(t)) f i(s) X(s) exp(-TI (t-s)) ds .                          (8c)
           -00




  This formulation of debt finance follows from joint work with
Stephen King (1983).
                                                                                           10

      Equations       (8a-c) can be embedded in the firm's discounted cash
flow expression (2), and rearranged to obtain the following
expression for the firm's net financing costs,


  F(t) =            v(t) (l-k(t)â€”z(t)) (t) I(t) â€” B(t,O)       ,                 (9a)

                                    0
      B(t,O) = (1-t(t))           f i(s) X(s) exp(-'r (t-s)) ds

                                   X(s) exp(-rl(t-s)) ds.

Equation (9b) represents the potential subsidy for the purchase of
investment goods provided by debt finance. If financial policy
eliminates arbitrage opportunities between the net-of-tax cost of
borrowing and the capitalization rate on debt, then ic(t) becomes
unity, and the potential advantage of debt financing, arising from the
tax deductability of interest payments, would be eliminated.
Equation (9c) represents the value of the net-of-tax interest and
retirement payments at time t on debt acquired prior to time 0 and,
when discounted by p(t) and integrated from zero to infinity,
becomes the market value of the firm's debt at time 0 (B*(0)).                   This
interpretation holds for any time paths of the variables, but becomes
                                                                                  11

apparent when we assume i(s), 'r(t), and p(t), are constant from time
zero onward,5

  B*(O) = [((l-t(O)) i(O) + 'ri) I (p(O) + TI)] FV(O) ,                   (lOa)

            FV(0) =         f X(s) exp(rs) ds ,                           (lOb)
                      jeJ -

where   FV(O) is the face value of debt remaining at time 0.         If the
costs of debt and equity are equated through financial policy, then
the term in braces in (lOa) is unity, and the face and market values
of debt are identical.
      To complete our specification of the cash flow problem facing
the firm, we assume that movements in the capital stocks are
governed by the following transition equations,

  K(t) = I(t)     â€”
                      & K(t) .                        VjcJ               (11)


       The firm is assumed to maximize (2) constrained by (3), (4),

and capital inputs, we construct the following current-value

6 In regard to debt finance, our formulation differs in two respects
from that found in the Q models of Summers (1981) and Poterba and
Summers (1983). First, our derivation permits the marginal and
average levels of debt finance to vary, and thus average Q (or 2 in
the current notation) will reflect the time variation in the market
value of debt. Second, the specification of the purchase price of new
capital allows for the possibility that financial policy may not
eliminate the subsidy associated with debt finance. When the
percentage of debt finance is constant (as has been assumed in
previous studies), it is unlikely that this subsidy will be zero,
especially when nominal interest payments are tax deductible.

Equation  (13a) is the familiar marginal productivity condition for a
variable factor of production. The marginal benefit of an additional
unit of capital is defined in (13b) as the sum of current and future
marginal products weighted by the rates of discount and
depreciation.   Along the optimal path, this marginal benefit must
equal the total marginal costs of acquiring capital. These involve the
sum of purchase and marginal adjustment costs, and the requisite
equality is given by (13c).

III. THE MULTI-CAPITAL 0 MODEL - SPECIFICATION
      The optimizing conditions associated with the maximization of
(12) form the basis of the Multi-Capital Q model of investment.    By
dividing both sides of (13c) by v(t). we derive the positive
relationship between investment, as embedded in the adjustment
cost function, and marginal Q, the ratio of the shadow price for the
jth capital good to its net purchase price.7 Since this equation
contains an unobservable variable, it is of little immediate use in
applied work. For a firm that uses only equity finance and one
capital input, Hayashi (1982a) has developed the conditions under
which the unobserved shadow price of capital can be related to
financial market data.   These conditions include that the production
and adjustment cost technologies exhibit constant returns to scale,
the firm participates in perfectly competitive output and factor
markets, capital depreciates exponentially, and the discounted values
of the capital stocks are constrained by transversality conditions.8
Modifying Hayashi's proof to incorporate multiple capital goods and
debt finance, we obtain the following relationship between shadow
prices and financial data,




  This relationship has been noted by, among others, Abel (1979),
Mussa (1977), Sargent (1979), and Yoshikawa (1980).
8 The transversality condition is written as follows,

      The intuition behind this results is rather straightforward.                      The
assumption of competitive markets ensures that, after period 0, the
firm is unable to earn any profits, and the equity value of the firm is
determined by the quasi-rents from the stocks available at the
beginning of the planning period. The most important of these is
fixed capital and, under constant returns to scale, the marginal and
average return to capital are identical. Thus, the value of the jth
capital good is the product of its shadow price and the existing stock.
Assuming momentarily that the firm uses only one capital good and
that A*(0) and B*(0) are zero, we see that (14a) delivers the basic
relationship between marginal and average Q, the latter defined as
the ratio of the financial value of the firm to its replacement cost,

  average Q        V(0)   / (0) K(0) =     j.t(0)    / (O)             marginal Q.   (l5)
                                                                            16

More generally, the equity value depends on the other capital goods
and their shadow prices, plus the discounted value of tax
depreciation allowances due to past investments (A*(O)), less the
discounted liability due to past financing committments (B*(O)).
     To obtain an investment equation amenable to testing, we need
to impose some assumptions about the intertemporal technology, and
choose the following parameterization of the adjustment cost
function s,



  F3[I(t),K(t)J = (yf2) [I(t)/K(t) â€” J}2 K(t)       VjeJ             (16)




As  noted in the introduction, past studies have found that lagged
variables have been significant in Q investment equations, and
lagged dependent variables are included in the general econometric
specification to represent any dynamics not fully captured by (16).
\Vhile these lagged variables compromise the structural
interpretation of the investment equations, they are included in the
general specification because their statistical significance serves as a
test for misspecification in the expanded model. Furthermore, it
would appear preferable to account explicitly for the dynamics
rather than doing so implicitly through a GLS correction. Combining
(13c), (14), and (16), we obtain the following system of investment
equations for the J capital goods,
                                                                                    17

where the k subscript represents all but the jth capital good and (17)
corresponds to the case where J=2. A white-noise error term (c(t))
reflects non-systematic variations in I(t) and approximation errors
that have arisen in the development of the model,9 and     is the
parameter for the lagged dependent variable.
     Equations (17) highlight that, in the Multi-Capital Q model,
market value data will not prove to be a "sufficient statistic" for
signaling investment expenditures for any particular capital input.
In (17b), (t) is defined as the difference between the financial value
of the firm (adjusted for tax depreciation) and the replacement cost
of the capital stocks all deflated by the net-of-tax output price. (Note
that the same 1 (t) enters all J investment equations and, if
adjustment costs were valued by the price of investment goods
   An additive error term can be derived from the theoretical model if
we assume that technology shocks affect either the production
function (Hayashi, 1982b) or the adjustment cost function (Poterba
and Summers, 1983). The maximization problem has not been
formulated with these additional assumptions because neither result
in any restrictions on the estimation procedure, other than to warn of
the omnipresent possibility of correlation between error terms and
endogenous regressors (i.e., Ik(t)).
                                                                           18

rather than output,      (t) would be replaced by average Q less unity
(cf., (15)).)   In (17a), a given value of (t) indicates the profitable
level of investment activity for the entire firm.     The own capital
stock influences gross investment positively due to replacement
needs.   The regressors subscripted by k affect I(t) through
adjustment costs. The higher Ik(t), the greater the adjustment costs
for the kth capital good and, hence, the fewer resources available for
investment in the jth capital good. Since a larger capital stock lowers
adjustment costs, Kk(t) has a positive effect on investment
expenditures.The failure to include these latter variables in
econometric equations implies that conventional formulations of the
Q model may be misspecified.        The stronger the association between
  (t) and investment expenditures for the kth capital good, the
greater the upward bias in Yj.10 The econometric results presented in
the next section will allow us to assess the extent of this bias and the
degree to which the Multi-Capital model attenuates the other
empirical problems associated with Q theory.




10 Alternatively, it has been noted that the large estimated values of
    are an inevitable outcome of relating volatile financial market data
to the less variable investment series (Shapiro, 1986, p. 531).
Insofar as the flow variables are strongly, positively correlated with
1 (t), the estimated 7j's from (17), ceteris paribus, should fall.

IV. ECONOMETRIC RESULTS

       The Multi-Capital Q   model   was estimated with data for
nonfinancial corporations over the period 1950-1978 for three
capital goods - equipment, structures, and inventories. The length of
the sample and the number of capital goods were determined by
data availability, and detailed information concerning data sources is
provided in the Glossary.  For each capital input, (17a) was scaled by
K(t) to eliminate the possible spurious correlation arising from the
trends in the flow and stock variables (Granger and Newbold, 1974).
Since no estimation technique dominates under even modest
violations of maintained assumptions, results are reported for a
variety of estimators.
       Ordinary Least Squares estimates of the Conventional (CV) and
Multi-Capital (MC) models are presented in Table II, columns 1-3
and 4-6, respectively.   For the CV model, the bulk of the explanatory
power of the Q model can be traced to the structures equation. As
assessed by the rn-statistic,11 the residuals are serially correlated
and, contrary to a strict interpretation of Q theory, the lagged
dependent variables in the equipment and structures equations are
significant. The results for the MC model are mixed. The 2's are
improved substantially, and serially correlated residuals are absent.
11   The rn-statistic is distributed t under the null hypothesis of no
serial correlation.  The rn-statistic is calculated in a regression of the
residuals from an equation with a lagged dependent variable (e.g.,
(17a)) on all of the explanatory variables in the initial regression
plus the lagged residual; m is the t-statistic on the lagged residual.
Performing a t-test on this coefficient is asymptotically equivalent to
the Durbin h-test. However, it can be calculated for all possible
values of the estimated parameters, and has performed better than
the h-statistic in Monte Carlo experiments (Harvey, 1981, p. 276).
                                                                                 20

However, the only significant coefficient on c(t) appears in the
structures equation, which also contains a significant lagged
dependent variable. While a number of the additional flow and stock
variables are significant, most are of the wrong sign.       The CV
specification is nested within the MC and, for each of the three
investment equations, the zero restrictions on the four additional
regressors (Ik(t), Kk(t), Vk,jEJ,       are rejected at the 1% level.
      Key to our development of the Multi-Capital Q model is the
assumption that the adjustment cost parameters differ among the
capital inputs, and two tests suggest that the null hypothesis
--   = Yk' Vj,kEJ,        is   rejected by the data.   First, the rejections o
the CV model reported above are strong evidence in favor of the MC
specification.'2 Second, we can interpret the aggregate equation (1)
as a restricted case of the separate MC equations (17) and, regardless
of which capital good served as the dependent variable, the
restricted model was always rejected at the 1% level.13
       Estimates for the MC model may be biased by correlations
between error terms and the investment flows (the capital stocks

12 These results hold whether or not a lagged dependent variable is
included as a regressor.
13 To ensure that (1) is nested within (17a), the separate MC
equations have all been scaled by the aggregate capital stock instead
of K(t) and the constant term in the restricted model is interpreted
as a weighted average of the depreciation rates for the separate
capital goods. The tests were conducted for each of the capital goods
four different ways: with or without a lagged dependent variable,
and for two (equipment and structures) or three (equipment,
structures, and inventory) capital goods. This aggregate Q
investment equation stands in contrast to Wildasin's (1984)
Proposition II, which is based on an aggregate investment equation
specified as the ratio of nominal variables.
                                                                            21

and (t), dated at the beginning of the period, are predetermined),
and Table III contains two sets of estimates that avoid this potential
problem.  Reduced form estimates are contained in the first three
columns, and all of the coefficients on (t) are significant. An
implication of the adjustment cost technology is that these
coefficients should be lowest for structures (representing the largest
adjustment costs) and highest for inventories, a prediction borne-out
by the estimates. Instrumental variables (IV) regressions for the MC
model are presented in columns 4-6 of Table III and, relative to OLS,
these estimates remain essentially unchanged.14
     By recognizing the contemporaneous correlation between the
cs we can enhance the efficiency of the coefficient estimates, and
can conduct an additional test of the specification.    Three-Stage Least
Squares (3SLS) estimates are presented in Table IV.      For the MC
model, all of the coefficients on Q(t) are significant at the 1% level,
though the coefficient in the equipment equation is negative.
Coefficients on the lagged dependent variables and tests for serially
correlated residuals are both insignificant.
                                          The system of equations
characterizing the MC model has 12 regressors not contained in the
CV model, and 11 of these are statistically significant, 4 of which are
of the correct sign. Not surprisingly, a comparison of the CV and MC
models based on the differences in their Criteria, distributed X2(12),

14 The instrument list included all of the predetermined variables in
the three equation system plus keq(t), zeq(t), t(t). The R2's for the
first-stage regressions were no lower than .78. When the instrument
list was reduced to keq(t), zeq(t), t(t), and all predetermined variables
in a given equation, the parameter estimates were largely
unaffected.
                                                                           22

rejects the restrictions defining the Conventional Q   model   at the 1%
level.    Further support for the MC model is obtained by comparing
the IV and 3SLS estimates with the test proposed by Hausman
(1978), Durbin (1954), and Wu (1973). If misspecification is present
in the system, the 3SLS estimates will differ substantially from the
corresponding IV estimates. For the three equation system, the HDW
test statistic is distributed 2(21), and equals 6.372 (P >     .999),

indicating that the null hypothesis of no misspecification can not be
rejected. 15
         To gain additional insight into the MC model, we examine the
role of inventory capital, which has been excluded in a number of
previous Q studies.     Table V contains estimates of equation systems
for equipment and structures, and the results change little for the CV
model (columns 1-2) or for the MC model when the inventory terms
remain as regressors (columns 3-4). These inventory terms are
removed in the regressions reported in columns 5-6, and the
coefficients on the lagged dependent variables increase sharply.
Since inventories play an important role in buffering the firm against
shocks, failing to include these terms may lead to misspecified
dynamics captured in an ad hoc manner by lagged variables in
conventional Q models. Formally, a comparison of the Criteria for the

15  This statistic is based on the IV estimates in Table III, columns
4-6, and the 3SLS estimates in Table IV, columns 4-6. The test
statistic was computed with the 3SLS residual covariance matrix, and
can be interpreted as the Lagrange multiplier version of the HDW
test. In comparing the IV and 3SLS estimates, note that the standard
errors of the estimated coefficients from the single equation
estimators (Tables II and III) are adjusted by the degrees of
freedom, whereas the the estimated coefficients from the systems
estimators (Tables IV and V) are adjusted by the sample size.
                                                                       23

models in Table V rejects the hypothesis that inventories can be
excluded.   Complementary evidence is provided by the HDW test
statistics of 8.261 (P > .875) for columns 3-4 and 13.721 (P > .186) for
columns 5-6. While both tests are below conventional significance
levels, the substantial increase in the latter P value confirms the
importance of the inventory variables.
                                                                           24

V. SIMULATIONS
      To evaluate further the Multi-Capital Q model, we examine in
this section the response of investment expenditures to changes in
V(t) (hence (t)) in both the CV and MC models. We assume that
V(t) increases unexpectedly by $1, perhaps due to a lump sum tax
rebate,16 and use the estimated parameters to calculate the
increments to investment and the capital stocks.17    These calculations
will be only approximate because we are not constraining the
solution to be consistent with the eventual steady-state (i.e., remain
on the stable manifold). A comparison of our method to that used by
Summers (1981, Table 6) indicates that the understatement of the
accumulated capital stock is small: the bias is approximately 0%
during the first five years, 1% in the tenth year, and 13% in the
fiftieth year.
      The simulation results are reported in the Tables at the bottom
three rows for each equation, and the response of investment is quite
slow. Ten years after the $1 shock, increments to the accumulated
sum of the three capital stocks range between $.19 and $.37.    These
results do not vary systematically with the CV or MC specifications,
and are quite consistent with the value of $.32 from the equation

16 These simulation results are comparable to and consistent with the
evidence from other econometric investment models discussed in
Chirinko (1986).
17 Since the lagged dependent variables are not part of the formal Q
model and lead to explosive behavior, they have been excluded in
the simulations. The system of investment equations (17) was
augmented by the capital accumulation equations (11) with
geometric depreciation rates of .13, .04, and 0.0 for equipment,
structures, and inventory, respectively. When the three capital
inputs are aggregated, the depreciation rate was set to .061.
                                                                       25

based on aggregate capital (1). A result not apparent in the
aggregate equation is that inventories are accumulated at a
disproportionately fast rate in the conventional model. For the
sample period, the inventory stock is 25% of the aggregate, but the
simulated changes in inventories are between 51-56% (CV models)
and 19-32% (MC models). In sum, one finds that the modifications to
the Q model undertaken in this paper do little to attenuate the
unreasonably sluggish response of investment to variations in L (t).
                                                                         26

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
     The poor empirical performance of Q models has led us to
reexamine the conventional framework. By recognizing the
possibility that the value of the firm depends on two or more capital
inputs whose adjustment cost technologies may differ, we have
derived an econometric specification that nests the Conventional
model as a special case.     Econometric evidence was generated with
equipment, structures, and inventories considered as capital inputs,
and the Conventional model was rejected in favor of the Multi-
Capital specification. However, for a number of the variants of the
Multi-Capital model, lagged variables proved significant, serial
correlation in the residuals was important, and a number of the
regressors had incorrect signs.   Furthermore, as has been the case in
previous work with Q models, the response of the capital stock to
unexpected changes in the economic environment remained
unreasonably slow.
      The results reported in this paper thus provide substantial
support for the Multi-Capital model as a useful extension to the Q
framework, but indicate that further work remains.    In particular,
inventories were shown to play a key role in the modeling of fixed
investment expenditures within the Q framework. One possible

adjustment   cost approach for equipment and structures.18
Alternatively, the dynamics of fixed capital accumulation may be too
complex to be captured adequately by the adjustment cost
technology. A more satisfactory model of capital accumulation may
thus have to be based on an intertemporal technology that recognizes
explicitly delivery, expenditure, and gestation lags and the possibility
of non-exponential capital decay.




18   Giventhe availability of suitable data, the MC framework could be
extended to other capital inputs such as research and development,
human capital, or advertising/goodwill. However, in the event that
the data associated with these types of capital are plagued by
substantial measurement error, their inclusion may compromise the
other coefficient estimates (cf., Fisher, 1980, p. 158).
