                                              ABSTRACT

Motivated by the large differences in labor market outcomes across college majors, we survey the
literature on the demand for and return to high school and post-secondary education by field of study.
We combine elements from several papers to provide a dynamic model of education and occupation
choice that stresses the roles of specificity of human capital and uncertainty about preferences, ability,
education outcomes, and labor market returns. The model implies an important distinction between
the ex ante and ex post returns to education decisions. We also discuss some of the econometric difficulties
in estimating the causal effects of field of study on wages in the context of a sequential choice model
with learning. Finally, we review the empirical literature on choice of curriculum and the effects of
high school courses and college major on labor market outcomes.

1 Introduction
A huge literature studies educational attainment and the return to education, with the more recent work focussing


on heterogeneity in the return.
                                   1 There is much less work on why indviduals choose dierent         types   of education or on


the career consequences of those choices. This is surprising, because the question of what kind of education should


be provided receives an enormous amount of attention in policy discussion and is a decision that every student must


make, particularly at the post-secondary level. Periodically, there are calls for reform of the high school curriculum,


often in response to concern about the readiness of students for the work force. An important example is               A Nation
at Risk   (Gardner (1983)). As we discuss below, the report advocated a focus on the new basics, with an increase


in the number of courses in key academic subjects such as math and science. But despite the perennial debate about


what students should study and many calls for better math and science instruction, there is surprisingly little hard


evidence about the labor market consequences of specic high school courses.
                                                                                          2

   At the college level, dierences by eld of study have received much less attention in the academic literature than


the average return to post-secondary education. This is true even though the dierence in returns across college majors


rivals the college wage premium. For example, using the data from the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS),


we nd that after adjusting for basic demographics, potential labor market experience, and graduate education, the


gap in log wages rates between male electrical engineering and male general education majors is 0.561 (0.016). This is


nearly as large as the 0.577 (0.003) dierence between college graduates and high school graduates. Furthermore, the


standard deviation of the return to various majors is 0.177 for menabout double the typical estimate of the value


of the year of school. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2012) is the latest in a series


of policy reports calling for a major increase in college graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.


However, the extent to which these dierences reect unobserved dierences in high school preparation and worker


ability or represent compensating dierentials for nonpecuniary aspects of jobs is not well-established. Understanding


these dierences is important for understanding the role of education in economic success and even for providing advice


to students who are deciding on a course of study.


   In keeping with the treatment of schooling as homogeneous, most of the literature in labor economics on career


earnings focuses on the return to general experience, job tenure, and job mobility. However, there is an important and


growing literature concerned with the implications of occupation-specic human capital for wages and mobility. Field


of education conditions occupational paths.


   In this paper, we provide a survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on the heterogeneous nature of


education and its link to particular occupation paths.               First, we combine elements from several papers to provide


a theoretical model of education choice, occupation choice, and wages.                  The model has ve key features.    First,


preferences, innate ability, and the initial vector of skills and knowledge early in high school shape the feasibility and


the desirability of particular education programs.          Second, individuals only learn gradually about their preferences

  1 See Card (1999) and Meghir and Rivkin (2011) for surveys.
  2 A recent example is President's Council of Advisors on Science   and Technology (2011).




                                                                     3
and ability and are uncertain about wages. Third, the type of education program shapes what one learns during a


schooling period. Fourth, education programs and occupations have dierent skill and knowledge prerequisites that


inuence learning and job performance. Switching elds in response to new information about ability, preferences, and


returns is costly. Finally, knowledge accumulation is stochasticstudents cannot simply decide that they are going


to complete a program of study. We draw out a number of implications of the model that have been discussed in the


literature, including an important distinction between ex ante and ex post return to an education choice. We also use


the model to discuss some of the econometric diculties that sequential choice in the presence of learning poses for


estimating the causal eect of eld of study on wages.


   We then turn to the empirical literature on the demand for and return to particular types of education, beginning


with high school curriculum and then turning to college major. We place particular emphasis on the determinants of


college major and the eects of high school courses and college major on wage rates.
                                                                                                         3 We supplement the existing

literature with an analysis of the returns to college major using the ACS, which is large enough for us to consider


narrowly dened majors and 5-digit occupation categories.                 Due to space constraints, we focus primarily on the


literature for the US.


   We conclude with some theoretical and econometric implications of the model as well as suggestions for future


research.




2 Lifecycle decision making: a theoretical model and some empirical im-
     plications
The aim of the following section is to describe a theoretical model that brings together the educational choices with the


labor market careers that follow them. This sets the scene for interpreting the review of empirical results that follows.


From an econometric point of view this unied framework can help identify the assumptions required for empirical


analysis. As a setup, this model is not new and brings together elements of Altonji (1993) and Arcidiacono (2004),


who emphasize the dynamic decisions about type of education, as well as Keane and Wolpin (1997), Eckstein and


Wolpin (1989) and Violante, Gallipoli, and Meghir (2005), who also include risk considerations and examine the role


of parents. We conclude this section with a discussion of the implications of the model and the important empirical


challenges that this eld faces. Almost all of the empirical literature we describe is either based on OLS regression or


on instrumental variables strategies and focuses on specic aspects of educational choice. This work is very important,


and we expect that going forward IV style approaches will continue to play a dominant role given the diculties with


structural modelling. However, the model implies that when agents are making a sequence of choices among multiple


education options, the use of single equation methods to estimate ex ante and ex post returns to education choices


requires strong assumptions. These methods also lead to incomplete measures of such returns, since costs are ignored.


Readers who are primarily interested in the empirical work may wish to skip to Section 3 on a rst pass through the

  3 We   discuss the literature on the choice of high school curriculum in the supplementary appendix.




                                                                     4
paper.


    We now describe the sequence of decision phases for the individual. We start from the end point where individuals


make labor market decisions; we then go back through the education choices and end up at the beginning, when


parents can make transfers and inuence their children's decisions.




2.1 Preliminaries and notation
2.1.1 The state space
We dene the state space, i.e. the set of relevant variables describing the history of events and choices made by the


individual up until the current point, by                â¦.   This includes past grades and educational attainment, and possibly past


choices to the extent they have persistent eects on behavior either directly or through expectations.                      â¦t   also includes


assets. Once in the labor market,        â¦ will track labor market history,              including wages and the occupational choices that


help determine the vector of skills      K,      which drives achievement in school and wages. We use the subscript               Ï   to denote


educational stages, i.e. high school, rst part of college and second part of college. When the individual enters the


labor market, we switch to a subscript               t   which denotes years in the labor market. In general we denote labor market


and education choices made in period             Ï   by   xÏ ,   and other information, including grades, wages, assets, etc., by      gÏ .   The


state space is updated by      â¦Ï = {â¦Ï â1 , xÏ â1 , gÏ â1 },         where     Ï =Ï   during education and   Ï =t   during the labor market


period.
          4 The initial information     â¦I   will contain a vector of background variables, including parental characteristics,


grades, and childhood developmental characteristics. In practice, much of the state space will be unobserved by the


researcher.     When implementing such a model empirically, the relevant information set would have to be suitably


restricted so as to make the computational problem feasible. However, here we ignore such (important) specication


issues.




2.1.2 Updating beliefs about ability and preferences
It is useful to think of individuals as possessing ability                  a   (possibly multidimensional) and preferences      Î¸.   Both are


unknown to the individual and are a source of uncertainty.                         The individual learns about ability and preferences


through environment and through experience, such as trying a set of courses or switching occupations in the labor


market. This is helpful in explaining switches between elds of study and between occupations, as individuals learn


what they can and cannot do well and what they like. We start with prior beliefs summarized by the distribution


F (a, Î¸).   These are updated according to Bayes' rule, i.e.:




                                              F Ï (a, Î¸|â¦Ï ) =â G(â¦Ï |a, Î¸)F Ï â1 (a, Î¸|â¦Ï â1 )
   4 We   make the notational distinction between the labor market periods (t) and the educational periods to emphasize that they last a
dierent amount of time. In the labor market we will think of periods as one year (or perhaps a quarter). In education we will have a high
school period, a rst period of college, and a second period of college, each lasting dierent amounts of time. It also helps distinguish the
nature of the state space or choice variables.




                                                                            5
where     Ï   denotes stage (such as high school, college, or labor market period).                        G(Â·)   is the likelihood function of the


information set        â¦Ï .   At the initial stage, which is the end of statutory schooling,            Ï â 1 is taken to be I ,    the information


set is   â¦I ,   and   F I (a, Î¸|â¦I ) = F (a, Î¸),      i.e. the prior distribution.


    In what follows, whenever ability and preferences need to be integrated out, it is done so based on the updated


distribution.




2.1.3 The human capital production function
Productivity in the labor market and hence wages will be driven by a vector of human capital indices (skills)                                     Kit =
  r
{Kit }, r = 1, ..., R,        where   t   measures time from entry in the labor market and             r    indexes skills.


    Human capital evolves as


                                                             Kit = f (Kitâ1 , Dit , ai , it |â¦s )                                                      (1)



where    â¦s     contains the completed educational history of the individual, including choices of subjects, elds of study and


majors, as well as grades. This emphasizes that accumulated skills may depend on the particular type of education

                                                                                                                                      l
followed. Skills are produced by the set of past skills and by occupational experience reected in                            Dit = {Dit }, an L Ã 1

vector of experiences in the              L   possible occupations, including unemployment. Note that skills are not equivalent to


occupations. However, the dependence on                    Dit   reects the fact that what one learns depends on the occupation. Before


entry in the labor market,            Dit     is empty and skills are produced through education; eld of study inuences what one


learns.   it   is an idiosyncratic error term that reects the fact that knowledge accumulation is stochastic; it may depend,


for example, on unforeseen illness or the quality of instructors.                    f   is increasing in   Kit   and ability, allowing possibly for


self-productivity and ability-skill complementarity. Finally, the separate dependence on educational history reects


the fact that the level and type of education may lead to a permanently dierent type of human capital which is not


perfectly substitutable with other types and which commands its own market price. For example, medical training


allows one to become a surgeon, a skill not obviously substitutable with skills of individuals of a dierent educational


background.




2.2 Labor market
The labor market is competitive and includes                      L   dierent occupations, each paying an occupation-specic wage                      Î±lt

per eciency unit of human capital. Human capital required for the sector is a combination of the                                 R   skills   Kit .   It is


dened by the occupational production function




                                                                       Ql = Ql (K, a)                                                                   (2)




Thus the set of skills an individual              i   accumulates denes the eciency units she can supply in each of the sectors                         l.

Assuming symmetric information between workers and employers, human capital is priced based on expectations of




                                                                              6
productivity from the distribution of belief about ability                   F t (a, Î¸|â¦t ).      The resulting individual wage is




                                                           ln wilt = Î±lt + lnEF t (Qlit ) + uilt                                                     (3)




where   uilt   is an idiosyncratic shock to eciency units for the                         lth   occupation.   In practice, one would have to nd


ways to restrict and rene the information set. However, this implies that factors aecting learning from individual


experience will determine wages despite the fact that they have no inuence on productivity itself. For example, math


grades in high school may aect lawyers' wages.                     (See Farber and Gibbons (1996), Altonji and Pierret (2001) and


Lange (2007) for work on employer learning about productivity with only general education.) Wage equations may


dier for men and women, although this has not been made explicit in the above equation.


   One traditional way of parametrizing the above wage equation is as follows:



                                                                                       2
                                        ln wislt = Î±0lt + Î±1sl aÌit + Î±2sl Xit + Î±3sl Xit + Î±4sl Titl + vilt


where   Titl   is person    i's   current tenure in occupation          l   and      Xit   is total labor market experience.       We use the loose


notation    aÌit   to denote the expectation about ability at               t.   The subscript        s   indicates that the coecients of the wage


equation depend on education history including the sequence of eld choices and highest degree. Finally,                                   vislt   is an


idiosyncratic stochastic shock. This equation is an approximation obtained by substituting out for the vector                                K     using


(1), (2), and (3). Tenure in other occupations would also belong in the equation to the extent that productivity in


occupation     l   depends on skills learned in other occupations. Very recently, a few theoretical and empirical papers have


appeared that formalize occupations as sets of tasks with skill requirements that overlap.
                                                                                                                       5



2.2.1 Work and occupation choices
We now formally describe the lifecycle decision process relating to education and the labor market. It is presentationally


and analytically more convenient to start from the end and move backwards, the order in which one would actually


solve such a model.


   Following the completion of education the individual enters the labor market and chooses between a number of


dierent occupations, including inactivity or home production. The labor market choices are repeated in each period


and the value functions are indexed by                t,   which denotes length of time in the labor market and emphasizes that this


is a non-stationary lifecycle problem. The terminal condition is left unspecied here.


   An individual possesses a utility function, which expresses her preference over consumption and occupations. This


is denoted by      ul (ct |Î¾tl , a, Î¸), where ct   is consumption and the index             l denotes occupation.    The preference for a particular


occupation is determined by a set of parameters                 Î¸, by ability and by a random shock Î¾ l             (with   l=B   for unemployment).


As described above, the vector              Î¸   may not be known.           Beliefs about it depend on past experiences, and indeed the

  5 See,   for example, Lazear (2009), Gathmann and SchÃ¶nberg (2010), Poleatev and Robinson (2008) and Yamaguchi (2012).




                                                                                 7
updating of beliefs about preferences or ability may be an important source of switching occupations.
                                                                                                                                                      6

      Now dene the value of working in occupation                        l   as    Vtl (â¦t , Î¾tl ), l = 1, ..., L â 1    and the value of unemployment as


VtB (â¦t , Î¾tB ).   We have that



                                                                                                     L
                                       Vtl (â¦t , Î¾tl ) = max       Ea,Î¸ ul (ct |Î¾tl , a, Î¸) + Î²Et [Vt+1 (â¦lt+1 , Î¾t+1 )]
                                                                  
                                                        c,At+1



where      At+1 are assets in period t+1, included in â¦lt+1 (â¦t includes At respectively).                                The superscript          l on â¦lt+1 indicates

that each occupational choice will lead to a dierent point in the state space because of dierent labor market earnings


(wilt ), dierent savings behavior (At+1 ) and most pertinently dierent labor market experiences. Assets evolve based


on the usual dierence equation


                                                            At+1 = (1 + r)(At â ct + wilt )


The expectations operator            Et     is taken with respect to information in period t. The value of unemployment is similarly


dened, except that          wilt   is replaced by unemployment benets.


      The optimized value of the labor market in period                         t   is then given by




                                           VtL (â¦t , Î¾t ) = max        Vtl (â¦t , Î¾tl ), l = 1, ..., L â 1 , VtB (â¦t , Î¾tB )
                                                                                                       
                                                            l



                                                                    Î¾t = Î¾tl , ..., Î¾tLâ1 , Î¾tB
                                                                        
This value depends on the entire set of shocks                                                          as well as on other factors unknown in earlier


periods, including shocks to wages.                  Thus from the perspective of earlier periods, these are sources of uncertainty,


which will matter given risk aversion and incomplete insurance markets.


      Important factors in practice are frictions and occupational shocks, such as exogenous job destruction.                                                  From a


substantive point of view these can be important particularly if the extent of frictions dier from sector to sector. Given


that individuals are risk averse, dierent risk characteristics may aect occupational and by implication educational


choice. As we have set it up here there is still occupational risk, which is reected in dierent volatility of wages.




2.3 Education choices
2.3.1 Utility
Let   j   denote the eld of study followed by the individual and                         Ï = H, C1 , C2      denote the level (high school, rst period of


college, second period of college). The ow utility of schooling choice                                (j, Ï)   depends on eort exerted, on a stochastic


preference shock denoted             Î¶Ïj    and on consumption.               It also depends on the individual's ability                      a   and on preferences


that are known up to some person-specic vector of parameters                                  Î¸.   Ability and preferences inuence net enjoyment of


pursuing      (j, Ï),   including the cost of eort. We denote this utility by                        ujÏ (cÏ |Î¶Ïj , a, Î¸),   which does not dier notationally


from the utility conditional on occupation. We often leave the school level subscript on                                         u   and   c   implicit. Since ability

                                                                                      8
and preferences are not known, they need to be integrated out with respect to the current distribution of beliefs and


preferences     F Ï (a, Î¸|â¦jÏ )   dened earlier.




2.3.2 College education
We split college into two decision periods:                   C1    represents the rst period of college, wherein a student can choose


between a number of general courses;                  C2    is a period of specialization wherein the student chooses major.                 â¦C1    is the


resulting information and knowledge set at the end of the rst period of college, including the mix of all past courses.


Grade progression is contingent on meeting certain threshold requirements, i.e.                               (gC1 > C1â ),     in order to continue in


major   j .7

   In the second period of college, a major is chosen out of                          JC2      possible options, subject to having qualied. The


value of a specic major          j   is given by




                                                                       VCj2 (â¦C1 , Î¶Cj 2 ) =

                                                n                                                          o
                                        maxc,AC2 Ea,Î¸ uj (c|Î¶Cj 2 , a, Î¸) + Î² C2 EC2 [Vt=0
                                                                                        L
                                                                                           (â¦jt=0 , Î¾t=0 )]


where   Î¶j   are utility shocks for major         j   and   Î¾ is the relevant set of shocks for the labor market that will follow completion

of the major. The superscript on the discount factor here and below reects the fact that the education periods last


longer than a year. Following major choice                    j   and the second period of college, the updated information set is                   â¦jt=0

where, like before, the superscript           j   denotes that the updating follows choice               j. â¦jt=0   reects whether the student met


graduation requirements for a degree in                j . AC1     are assets at the point of decision and          AC2   are assets at the end of the


second period in college and are contained within the set                       â¦jt=0 .   They are related by




                                                            AC2 = (1 + rC1 )(AC1 â c2 â FCj 2 )


where   FCj 2   represents costs of education for major               j.   Note that dierential costs of education by subject matter would


be very useful empirically for the purposes of identication. The function                            E[Vt=0 (â¦jt=0 , Î¾t=0 )]   is the expected value in


the labor market (which starts at             t = 0)    following major choice            j,   as dened above. The dependence on time         t   reects


the non-stationary nature of the life-cycle problem.


   Continuing with a major requires one to have satised the grade requirement                                 gC1 > C1â .   Thus the value when the


student has to choose one of            JC2   majors is




                                                                  VC2 (â¦C1 , Î¶C2 , Î¾C2 , gC1 ) =

                                         nh                                                    i                   o
                             maxj,L        VCj2 (â¦C1 , Î¶Cj 2 ) Ã 1(gC1 > C1â ), j = 1, ..., JC2 , Vt=0
                                                                                                    L
                                                                                                       (â¦C1 , Î¾C2 )
  7 The   thresholds could depend on major, but we avoid further complicating the notation.




                                                                                9

The choice includes the possibility of starting o in the labor market with information set                                   â¦t=0 = â¦C1 ,   i.e. with the


educational history up until that moment, but without completing a major. This is reected in the value function

  L
Vt=0 (â¦C1 , Î¾t ).

    Upon nishing high school the individual chooses between college (if she qualies) and the labor market. The infor-


mation set at the beginning of that stage (C1 ) is summarized by                     â¦H .        Choosing college involves choosing a particular


curriculum (for example humanities versus social science versus natural sciences). This problem is presentationally


similar to the one of choosing major. The value of each of the                     JC1   curriculum options is



                                                    n                                                                   o

where   â¦jC1   is the state space resulting from the          j th   choice. Assets      AC1      are given by




                                                         AC1 = (1 + rH )(AH â c â FCj 1 )


where   AH     are assets following high school completion and             FCj 1   are the monetary costs of following curriculum                 j   in the


rst period of college. The value at the start of the college choice period is




                                                          VC1 (â¦H , Î¶C1 , Î¾C1 , gH ) =

where   gH > H â     signies that the high school grades are sucient to qualify for college.




2.3.3 High school education
The earliest choice the individual has to make is to attend high school and follow a particular curriculum                              j, j = 1, ..., JH .

The value of choosing        j   is

where   â¦I   represents the initial information set, including parental background and earlier school achievement, and                                  â¦jH

                                                                          10

where     AU   are parental transfers if the child enters the labor market, while          T   are transfers if the child completes high


school (HS      = 1).    Any costs of school are implicit in the amount transfered. The dierent interest rates reect the


dierences in the amounts of time for the two activities, with work lasting one year (or quarter). The resulting choice


faced by the individual is between one of the possible elds of study               j   and entering the labor market. She earns     w0H

The notation on the state space makes explicit that the initial position may dier depending on the parental transfers,


to which we now turn.




2.4 Parental inuence and transfers
The starting point of decision is at the end of compulsory schooling. We suppose that while the child makes her own


decisions, they can be inuenced by parents. Part of the inuence is through genetic and cultural factors that are not


the subject of conscious choices by the parent. Part is through decisions that inuence the health, educational and


broader social experiences of the child prior to high school.
                                                                        10 These are all implicit in the original information set    â¦I ,

and although some may be the result of earlier choices, we do not have much to say about them here. However, one


important source of inuence is nance: parents choose how much to transfer to their children, either unconditionally


or conditional on desired actions by the children (such as attending high school or college). This is a crucial source


of funding for children who may not have other access to nancial sources. From a policy perspective, understanding


such transfers lies at the heart of understanding the extent to which outcomes can be inuenced through government


transfers.


       Parents possess assets   AP .   They need to choose how much to transfer to their children, given that they will fund


high school and given that they may care about the child's welfare as well as whether the child completes high school.


We denote by        AU   transfers oered if the child drops out of school and by              T   transfers given if the child continues


schooling. Given these, parents solve the problem




                             max E0 [V P (AP â T Ã HS â AU Ã (1 â HS), HS) + Îº[VH (â¦I , Î¶H , Î¾H )]]

  10 Surveys   of this literature include Currie (2009), Todd and Wolpin (2003), Heckman and Masterov (2007), and many others.




                                                                      11
where      VP   is the parents' value function,      HS   is a binary indicator for high school attendance, and           AU   and   T   are part


of    â¦I   aecting the child's education decision. Note that we assume that transfers cannot be negative; for example, the


parents cannot ne the children to induce them to attend high school. Finally,                       Îº   is the weight attached by parents


to child utility.      In a standard altruistic model, transfers will increase with             AP   but will be lower for higher ability


children, who can achieve higher value             V H.   This is a more complicated model because of the parents' preference for


their child to attend high school and their resulting willingness to use transfers to distort the child's choice towards


education. The key point here is the link that this model creates between parental wealth and education in a world


with liquidity constraints: wealthier parents will make more transfers enabling childen to study, whereas equal ability


children from lower income backgrounds may be unable to do so if they cannot borrow. Conditional parental tranfers


can easily be incorporated into the college stage of the model.




2.5 Implications of the model
2.5.1 Theoretical implications
The model implies an interesting interplay between preferences and the purely nancial return to education.
                                                                                                                                         11 First,

preferences and innate ability aect the ex ante           nancial return to completing high school, starting college, and choosing
a particular major        even if they play no role in the wage equation.           This is because they inuence the likelihood that


an an individual will ultimately choose to complete a program of study and receive the ex post payo associated with


it.    Second, persons with preferences for elds with high labor market payos, such as engineering, have higher ex


ante and ex post returns to high school completion and college attendance. This is true even though preferences do


not directly enter the wage equation. These two results imply, for example, that parental education and gender could


aect the nancial return to education even if they have no eect on wage rates. Altonji (1993) demonstrates this


empirically.


      Sequential decision making under uncertainty about preferences, ability, and knowledge accumulation opens up


some interesting possibilities concerning the eects of wages on education outcomes. One example is that an increase


in expected wages of college graduates holding the wages of high school graduates and college dropouts constant boosts


the high school graduation rate and increases college enrollment but has an ambiguous eect on the college dropout


rate. To see this, note rst that the college wage increase will increase the ex ante return to starting college, holding


constant human capital at the end of high school and beliefs about preferences and ability. On one hand, this will


induce some individuals with relatively low probabilities of completing college to start, raising the college dropout


rate. On the other hand, the higher payos will induce some individuals who would otherwise have dropped out after


the rst period of college to continue. A second example is that an increase in the payo to a degree in one eld,


say engineering, holding the ex post payo in other elds constant, can lead to an increase in the graduation rate in


the other elds. The reason is that the increase in the engineering wage raises the ex ante return to starting college.

  11 See    Altonji (1993) for proofs of the claims in this section using a stripped-down version of the model sketched in this section.




                                                                        12
Consequently, this higher wage will increase the number of persons who spend the rst period of college in a program


geared toward completing a degree in engineering by more than it reduces the number who start college in a program


geared toward a humanities degree. If enough of the college entrants who start in engineering ultimately conclude that


they prefer the humanities major and the occupations it leads to, and/or enough conclude that they are much more


likely to be able to meet graduation requirements in humanities than in engineering, then the ow into humanities


following the rst period of college could be enough to oset the smaller number who start college with the intention


of pursuing a humanities degree.


   The role of risk aversion brings forward two important empirical issues.                   First, individuals will also care about


uncertainty in ability and the eect of this uncertainty on alternative degrees or courses of study, possibly avoiding


ones where ability might matter a lot.         In general we will see a risk-return trade-o induced not only from the


macroeconomic environment and the possible volatility of returns but also because of uncertainty in individual ability


and microeconomic uncertainty in wages within each sector.




2.5.2 The returns to education paths
The model oers a systematic way of dening and measuring returns to education. Thus, for example, the returns to


a major   j   relative to dropping out of college and working is dened as



                                                              VCj2 (â¦C1 , Î¶Cj 2 ) â Vt=0
                                                                                      L
                                                                                         (â¦C1 , Î¾C2 )
                                    R(â¦C1 , Î¶Cj 2 , Î¾C2 )   =              L
                                                                       Vt=0 (â¦C1 , Î¾C2 )

This depends on individual heterogeneity, known to the individual but not to the econometrician. The estimated return


will be an average of this function and will depend on individual history. Thus, we can document how the returns


dier across individuals with dierent choice history of courses, grades, etc. The ex ante heterogeneity of returns is


driven partly by these dierences in early experiences and partly by the way that they aect individual perceptions and


expectations of their ability and preferences. Moreover, they take fully into account the costs of education, including


opportunity cost and eort involved in alternative course choices.




2.5.3 Econometric implications
The model we presented also brings to the fore econometric issues that will appear when reviewing the literature.


First, wages across dierent levels of education and elds of study are best described by a Roy-type model, implying


heterogeneous returns to education.       In other words this is a switching regressions framework (see Quandt (1972),


Heckman and Robb (1985)).         Ex post the selection into any of the sectors will be endogenous to the extent that


preferences about education are correlated with unobserved determinants of wages (lazy at school and lazy at work


for example) and to the extent that information about future wages is known by the individual at the time education


choices are made, but is unobserved by the econometrician. For example, if an individual knows they will be more


productive working in an oce rather than outdoors, this will inuence the sequence of education choices and imply




                                                                     13
that education choice is endogenous for wages, even if education and labor market ability are themselves independent.


     This brings us to the dicult question of identiability and identication in practice. The model highlights the


costs of education as the main source of exogenous variation: a low-cost college can trigger a chain of decisions that


leads to college completion, where this may have not happened if fees were higher. Thus if there is variation in the costs


of obtaining alternative combinations of education, and if such variation can be taken as exogenous (i.e. not correlated


with quality of education or with the characteristics of the individuals having access to such fees), this can be an


important source of exogenous variation. However, as shown in Heckman and Navarro (2007) and further discussed in


Meghir and Rivkin (2010), this may be far from enough to identify such dynamic models non-parametrically. Thus, in


practice, identication will be in part driven by such exogneous variables and by restrictions on the functional forms


of the distribution of unobservables.


     The dynamic model presents a clear approach to estimating both an education choice model and the returns to


education, as well as the specic properties of wages.      Any source of endogeneity is taken into account and there


is transparency regarding the assumptions made.        However, it is a complicated model; to include all the detail we


have suggested may be almost impossible in practice. Thus, a dynamic approach will have to impose a number of


simplications and will rely on functional form restrictions.      The complexity of such models and the detailed data


requirements can be a serious impediment to their use.


     Meanwhile, most of the literature we review has taken the simpler approach of estimating relatively simple wage


equations based on instrumental variables. The cost is the limited external validity and alternative assumptions that


in a sense take the place of the ones required by the ful dynamic structural model: Imbens and Angrist (1994) have


shown that IV will identify the Local Average Treatment Eect parameter (LATE), which is the eect of the binary


treatment on those who were induced into treatment (college in our example) by the variation in the value of the


instrument. If the instrument (say reform assignment) is independent of all the unobservables, such is the case when


it is randomized, then LATE identies the eect of those who switched into treatment as a result of the reform under


the key additional assumption that no one is induced out of treatment as a result of the policy (monotonicity). In this


case the theoretical framework can be suggestive of whether monotonicity is valid.


     With many dierent treatments, as would arise in our context of multiple levels of education and curriculum


choices, it is harder to interpret instrumental variables, even if we had enough instruments. This of course does not


mean that the dynamic model is necessarily our only alternative. Consider, for example, the wage equation, and take


expectations conditional on a set of instruments that have been randomized (Z ) and on educational history denoted


by   S.   Assume that the dimension   l   indexes the education path. (We will ignore for this example the labor market


history as well as time in the labor market.)




                           E ln wil |Si = Sil , Z = zi = Î±lt + Î²sl Sil + E(uil |Si = Sil , Z = zi )
                                                     



This is a standard Roy model and its identiability has been studied by Heckman and Honore (1990).             Î²sl   is the




                                                             14
average ex post return to education path              Sil .   In terms of our notation the issue is whether the control function


assumption required, i.e. that         E(uil |Si = Sil , Z = zi ) = E(uil |Si = Sil )   and whether it has independent variation from


the education choices      Sil .   The form of this function is driven by the dynamic selection process described earlier in the


theoretical model. Constructing this control function will require a model for                 S.   In general this is not going to be a


single index model, because of the sequential nature of the choices; hence the need for many instruments. For example,


Cameron and Heckman (1998) have shown that education choice can be represented by an ordered choice model


(which hugely simplies the identication and estimation problem) when there is just one unobserved factor driving


educational decisions. When we depart from this very framework, we will need more than one index to represent the


choice of   Si   as well as many instruments. This is an issue of both sucient amounts of exogenous variation and the


correct structure. In interpreting the results of the existing empirical literature, we need to remember that important


identication questions remain both when implementing the full dynamic structure and when estimating a simpler


version of the model. But given the complexity and pitfalls of estimation based on dynamic structural models, we


expect careful studies using IV strategies or OLS with rich controls to continue to play a critical role in the literature


going forward.




3 The eects of high school curriculum on educational attainment and
     wages
As we noted in the introduction, there is surprisingly little hard evidence about the causal eects of specic high


school courses on educational attainment and labor market outcomes.
                                                                                        12 This is partly due to data limitations, but

mostly due to the fact that student course selection is not random given the available options, as is clear from the


model in Section 2. Furthermore, student curriculum choices are shaped by school requirements, tracking policy, and


guidance, and these reect to some extent the qualications and interests of the student body. In the supplemental


appendix, we provide a brief discussion of trends in course taking, socieconomic correlates of course taking and role


of graduation requirements, but we found little model-based curriculum choice.                       The complexity of the subject is


undoubtedly part of the reason why. Even with excellent data, identifying the causal eects of high school courses on


educational attainment, choice of college major and occupation, and wage rates is a dicult task.


   In this section we review the limited evidence on the eects of high school curriculum. We emphasize wage eects


but also touch upon educational attainment and choice of major. We discuss the approaches to estimation that are


used and briey summarize the results. None of the studies we reviewed model the endogeneity of curriculum choice


by allowing for dynamics.            The implication is a lack of clarity of the underlying determinants of both wages and


educational choice, as we discussed in Section 2. The existing empirical studies estimate equations of the form




                                                     Si = Ci Gs + Xi Bs + Ci gsi + esi                                               (4)

 12 Due   to space constraints, we do not discuss evidence on the eects of curriculum on test scores.




                                                                      15
for educational attainment         S   and




                                              ln W agei = Ci Gw + Xi Bw + ÏSi + Ci gwi + ewi                                                                (5)



for wages where here        Ci   denotes high school curriculum,              Xi    denotes background and other characteristics,               ewi   and   esi

are unobserved random intercepts, and                  gsi   and   gwi   are unobserved random coecients.                 Ci   is typically a count of the


number of year-long courses taken in various subjects. It is likely to be correlated with the composite error terms in


the equations, which will lead to bias in OLS estimates of                     Gs    and   Gw .   Studies dier in a number of ways including in


the assumed exogenous source of variation for the curriculum, in whether or not all courses are examined at the same


time rather than one by one or in subsets, in whether courses in a given subject area are dierentiated by level, and


in whether the analysis is conditional on high school graduation.


    An important issue is whether one should control for post-secondary education                                 S   in the wage equation. Doing so


aects the interpretation of the coecient on                      C.    The entire history and type of educational attainment will aect


wages to the extent that each path leads to a dierent set of skills. As specied in (5),                                   Gw     is the average eect of


courses on     lnW age   holding years of post secondary education constant. For example, high school math and science


courses may inuence the types of jobs obtained by students who enter the workforce after high school or facilitate


completion of a BS in engineering as opposed to a lower-paying college major. Controlling for post-secondary education


in some fashion makes sense because post-secondary schooling is costly. However, if the return                                      Ï   exceeds the interest


rate, then part of the return to         Cih      is through facilitating protable investments in                    S.   It raises the option value of


investment in    S.   Altonji (1995) reports a set of estimates based on including                     S     in the wage equation with         Ï set to 0.04,

which he assumes is the real discount rate. Most studies report estimates with and without                                      S. None of the papers that

estimate   Ï   addresses the fact that       S    is endogenous in (5).


    We now to turn to the studies. Altonji (1995) is the rst comprehensive study of the eects of curriculum on post-


secondary educational attainment and wages.
                                                               13 He uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS72),

which follows samples of 12th grade students from a large number of high schools. His specication of (4) and (5)


includes counts of courses in eight subject areas: math, science, English, social studies, foreign languages, commercial


studies, industrial arts and ne arts. His main identication strategy uses the substantial amount of variation across


high schools in the average value            Ch   of   Ci    as an instrumental variable for          Ci ,   where    h   is the high school    i   attends.
                                                                                                                                                             14

If the variation in    Ch   reects high school or school district policies that are unrelated to the distribution of aptitude,


ability, and prior preparation of the student body, then use of high school averages as excluded instruments would


yield consistent estimates of the average treatment eect of an extra semester of math, science, etc.                                           But casual


observation, as well as the evidence from the NLS72 and other similar data sets, indicates that variation across schools


in the quantity of academic courses is positively related to both the level and quality of the courses and to the quality

  13 Rumberger and Daymont (1984) is         a noteworthy early study of the eects of curriculum on wages shortly after high school.
  14 For example, Table 1 of his paper       reports that cross-school variation accounts for 25.9%, 26.9% and 26.4% of the variation across
students in science, foreign language, and math, respectively.




                                                                               16
of the students.       These associations would imply a positive bias in           Gw   and   Gs ,   because course quality and level is


not accounted for and the controls for family background, primary school preparation, and high school quality are


imperfect.


    Altonji's IV estimates indicate that the eects of additional courses in academic subjects are small. Even when


controls for family background and ability are excluded, the combined eect of an extra year of science, math, foreign


language, English, and social studies is only 0.3 percentfar less than the value of a year of high school. The combined


eect of an extra year of science, math, foreign language is only 0.017 (0.012) when family background controls for the


student and the school are included. The point estimate for math is actually negative, -0.007 (0.015), although one


cannot rule out a substantial positive eect given the standard error. The IV estimates indicate that students who do


not go to college benet from vocational courses.


    Altonji also reports OLS estimates with family background controls.                     These are somewhat larger than the IV


estimates, but nevertheless also suggest that the value of additional courses is too small to account for the value of a


year of high school.
                         15 The conclusion is not very sensitive to how post-secondary education is treated, in part because

the courses have only have a modest eect on post-secondary education. Altonji's conclusion is not that courses have


little eect, but rather that the results, which are not easy to dismiss with an appeal to unobserved heterogeneity,


pose a challenge for researchers. He raises the possibility that the estimates for particular courses are aected by the


interaction of biases in the coecients on the curriculum variables and/or the control variables.


    Levine and Zimmerman (1995) use a framework and methods similar to Altonji's. However, they use dierent data


sets (NLSY79 and High School and Beyond (HS&B)), focus on math and science classes, stress dierences by gender,


and look at a broader set of outcomes. They rely primarily upon OLS because their estimates using cross high school


variation in course taking are noisy.          Controlling for post-secondary education, their OLS estimates suggest that a


year of math raises the wage by between 0.028 and 0.056 log points for men and about 0.044 for women. The point


estimates vary within education group and are largest for female college graduates. The estimates of the eects of


science are mixed in sign and not statistically signicant.


    Levine and Zimmerman nd that both math and science courses boost educational attainment. There is evidence


that additional math and science courses increase the probability of choosing a technical college major. This evidence


relates directly to the question of how the type of education one chooses at the high school level conditions the optimal


choice of education and occupation later. Additional math and science courses move women toward jobs that involve


more mathematical reasoning, although the evidence is stronger in HS&B than in NLSY79.


    As the authors emphasize, the OLS estimates may be biased upward by selection in course-taking and the other


issues discussed in more detail in Altonji (1995).             Nevertheless, the ndings of the positive eect of math and the


evidence pointing to an eect of math and science on the probability that the individual majors in a technical eld


are interesting.

  15 This   is true even through the coecients of separate OLS regressions relating the log wage to a year of science, foreign language, and
math with no controls are very large: 0.054, 0.040, and 0.072, respectively.




                                                                      17
   Rose and Betts (2004) use the 1982 senior cohort from HS&B to provide a more nuanced study of the return to high


school math. Their primary dependent variable is log earnings in 1991. They control for demographic characteristics


and family background variables in most of their analysis, include high school dropouts, and control for highest degree.


Their main innovation is to take advantage of detailed transcript information and dierentiate math courses by level


vocational math, pre-algebra, algebra/geometry, intermediate algebra, advanced algebra, and calculus. They nd that


a year of math substantially raises wage rates even when math GPA and math test scores are controlled for.                        The


returns are larger for advanced math courses, particularly algebra and geometry. They obtain positive estimates using


OLS and using an IV approach based on cross-school variation, although the OLS estimates are stronger, perhaps in


part because they are more precise.


   The math results are robust to including English, science, and foreign language. English courses enter positively,


and the OLS estimate suggests the return of 0.026 (0.013) to a semester of upper-level English, while the IV estimate


is 0.071 (0.036). The coecients on science courses are negative for lower-level courses and positive but not signicant


for upper-level physics, chemistry, and AP biology. The OLS estimates indicate that a student who takes a year of


calculus, English, chemistry, and foreign language would earn about 8.6% more than a 12th grade student who did


not take any courses. Consequently, Rose and Betts come closer than Altonji in accounting for the value of a year of


high school. On the other hand, the return to a year of low-level courses in the 11th grade and in the 12th grade is


small. Rose and Betts attempt to reconcile their OLS and IV results with Altonji's smaller estimates. They conclude


that the dierence stems from their disaggregation by course level in case of IV and disaggregation by course level and


their use of math GPA rather than test scores as a control in the case of OLS. On the other hand, Rose and Betts' IV


estimates are large and negative for several of the advanced math courses. Some of the dierences between the two


studies may reect sampling error. Furthermore, concerns remain about positive selection in who is taking advanced


courses. But overall, the study signicantly advances our understanding of the payo to dierent types of courses.


   Joensen and Neilson (2008) estimate the return to advanced high school math by exploiting an educational reform


in Denmark in 1988 which allowed students to combine advanced math with chemistry rather than only with physics.


The reform was piloted at some high schools during the years 1984 through 1987.                     These reforms were plausibly


exogenous for students who chose their school before the pilot was introduced.                  The authors nd that taking the


advanced math course in combination with the advanced chemistry course increases earnings by 0.20 log points. The


estimate rises to 0.25 when they exclude schools that are able to unilaterally decide whether to implement the pilot


program because there is evidence of negative selection for that group. Interestingly, the OLS estimate is similar (0.23)


when detailed controls are included, as is the IV estimate based on the cross high school means              Ch .   There is not much


evidence of selection bias.
                              16 Controlling for post-secondary educational attainment eliminates most of the eect, in

contrast to the US studies.


   In interpreting their estimates, Joensen and Neilson make the monotonicity assumption that students who had

 16 The   OLS results are weighted toward students who took math in combination with advanced physics because the advanced math and
chemistry combination was only available in the pilot schools. Consequently, the OLS and IV estimators identify dierent parameters.




                                                                  18
chosen advanced math when only the advanced math and physics combination was available would continue to take


an advanced math package following the introduction of the advanced math-chemistry option. This is reasonable, but


even if this assumption is true, their estimator does not have a LATE interpretation as the eect of advanced math.


This is because their IV strategy precludes controlling for whether the student took math in combination with physics


or math in combination with chemistry. Some of the students who were induced to choose the advanced math and


chemistry combination would have chosen a curriculum involving less math, while some would have chosen advanced


math with advanced physics.            Despite this ambiguity in the interpretation of the results, this study is a valuable


contribution that illustrates the potential for research that exploits sharp curriculum reforms.


    Goodman (2009) exploits curriculum reforms inspired by                 A Nation at Risk (1983).    In the years following the report,


a number of states established course requirements in core academic subjects or increased existing ones. Goodman's


instrument is the indicator        M athRef orm      for whether students in a given high school class from a given state were


subject to an increased math requirement relative to what prevailed for the high school class of 1982. Because the


state laws are not very powerful instruments, a large sample could help in improving precision if the within state error


correlation is limited. Goodman employs a Two Sample Instrumental Variables (TSIV) estimator that uses micro data


sets on student high school transcripts to estimate the rst stage and wage and educational outcome data from the


2000 Decennial Census to estimate the second stage. Controlling for state and high school cohort,                        M athRef orm         is


associated with an increase of about 0.184 years of basic math and 0.214 years of advanced math for black males. The


impact for black females is somewhat smaller, and the impact for white males and females is about half as large and


is concentrated in basic math. The corresponding TSIV estimates of the eect of a year of math are -0.030 (0.048) for


white females and about 0.08 for the other three groups. About 40% of this eect is due to an increase in educational


attainment.
               17   When education policy controls, economic controls, and census division level trends are added, the


TSIV estimates become 0.052 (0.018), 0.035 (0.030), 0.033 (0.030) and 0.005 (0.041) respectively. The eects tend to


be larger for disadvantaged groups, but one should not make too much of the dierences given the sampling errors. It


should also be kept in mind that the specication does not include controls for other courses. (The reform instruments


are not powerful enough to identify the eects of dierent courses.)




3.1 Conclusion about the eects of high school curriculum
Some progress has been made toward the goal of providing hard evidence on the eects of high school curriculum on


wages and educational attainment. Breaking out courses by level, as in the Rose and Betts study, indicates that taking


more advanced courses has a substantial economic return. While there are clear concerns about selection bias, their


result is reinforced by Joensen and Neilson's clever IV study, although it is worrisome that most of their large eect of


taking advanced math and chemistry is through post-secondary education independent of the eld of post-secondary

  17 We   arrived at the 40% gure based on the fact that the reduced form coecients relating log earnings to   MathReform   fall from 0.028 to
0.019 (0.008) for black males, 0.026 to 0.016 (0.008) for black females, and 0.020 to 0.011 (0.010) for white males when education/graduating
class interactions are added to the baseline specication. The estimates are negative but not signicant for white females regardless of
whether education is in the model.




                                                                      19
education. These results, along with Goodman's TSIV estimates and Levine and Zimmerman's results, suggest that


additional math courses have substantial value. There is also some evidence that vocational courses have value for


students who did not intend to go to college.          (See, for example, Altonji (1995) and Mane (1999) and additional


references that she provides.) However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the value of particular courses of


study, about how the courses aect post-secondary education, and about heterogeneity in these eects.


    We have two suggestions for research. The rst is to make use of the huge student record data sets that have become


available in several US states and other countries. This information, combined with post-secondary education records


and earnings (as is possible, for example, for the states of Florida and Texas) and in conjunction with information about


specic reforms to curriculum at the high school and/or school district level, provides a way to address the problem of


endogeneity of curriculum. A panel data set on course graduation requirements and course availability will have to be


assembled for a large set of schools. Furthermore, the student record data sets can be used to study how curriculum


aects post-secondary eld, which has been dicult to do because of sample size considerations in the panel data


sets discussed above. The second is to integrate the study of curriculum choice into a dynamic model of educational


attainment and labor market outcomes, along with sources of exogenous of variation in curriculum. This would help


elucidate how courses are chosen and how education choices today inuence future opportunities. Furthermore, it will


provide a systematic way of addressing selection in course-taking in a dynamic setting when estimating the return to


curriculum.




4 Empirical evidence on the determinants of college major
The theoretical framework presented above implies that college major choice is inuenced by expectations of future


earnings, preferences, ability, and preparation. We discuss some of the evidence on the role of each of these factors,


drawing on both the small number of structural models and on the more extensive reduced-form approaches. First,


however, we document some trends.




4.1 Trends in college major
Patterns of college major choice have been relatively steady over the past twenty years.                 Supplementary Figure 1


illustrates the trends across college graduation cohorts in the fractions of degrees accounted for by the ve most


popular aggregated college majors. The results are shown separately for men and women.
                                                                                                     18 In keeping with the high

school course-taking trends, the fraction of science majors has shown a slight uptick in recent years. Taking a longer


view, the fraction of education majors has decreased substantially over the past forty years, while the proportion of


business and economics majors peaked about twenty-ve years ago, following a period of rapid growth in the 1980s.

 18 Data   are from the 2009 ACS; respondents are assumed to graduate at age 22. Supplementary Figure 2 reports trends from 1984 to
2009 based on data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS). There are some minor dierences that could be due
to recall bias in ACS, changes in IPEDS coverage, the fact that the ACS includes immigrants who received degrees abroad and IPEDS
includes degrees of foreign students who later return home, the fact that some individuals obtain more than one bachelors degree, and
dierences in aggregation of majors.




                                                                 20
Later in this section we estimate the contribution of this change in composition to the growth of the college wage


premium in the 1980s.


   Not surprisingly, women are far more prevalent in education, and men in engineering and in business and economics.


However, this gure disguises interesting within-category trends.                 While women have caught up with men in the


sciences overall, Turner & Bowen (1999) point out that the disaggregated trends show a surge of women in biology,


for example, but not in the more mathematical sciences.                 Similarly, the oft-used social sciences category includes


majors as dissimilar as economics and cultural studies. To address this, Figure 1 reports the trends over time in the


fraction female in selected majors relative to the fraction female across all majors. The trends in the relative fractions


are not aected by the rise in the share of women among all college graduates or changes in the general popularity of


particular majors. Remarkably, although the relative fraction of women in most science-related majors has increased


over time, the relative fraction female among computer science majors has actually dropped.
                                                                                                              19

   Table 1 describes various characteristics associated with some of the more common college majors: share enrolled,


fraction female, math and science course content, SAT scores, wages, and the share attending graduate school.
                                                                                                                                         20

There is a great deal of variation across majors: engineers have among the highest SAT math scores, for example,


while elementary education majors have among the lowest. Similarly, wages tend to be high for engineers and low


for elementary education majors, suggesting that perhaps much of the wage dierences between majors are due to


dierences in mathematical ability and high school course work.


   The table also reports the 10th and 90th percentiles of the hourly wage distribution. The size of the gap relative


to the mean varies substantially across majors. For example, mean earnings in economics is about 10 percent higher


than in mechanical engineering, but the 90-10 dierential is twice as large. Part of the variation in the 90th percentile


reects dierences across elds in the contribution of graduate school, but the basic pattern is present for those who


do not go to graduate school.
                                   21




4.2 Expected earnings
The work on the impact of expected earnings on major choice uses three main approaches. The rst uses a rational


expectations-type framework in which expected future earnings are based upon a statistical model of earnings. Berger


(1988) is an early example of this. He models the utility from major                 j   as the consumption value of the major plus


the present value of expected lifetime earnings in major           j.   In doing so he improves upon previous myopic models that


incorporate only rst-year post-college earnings. The coecient on expected earnings in the conditional logit model


has the expected positive sign.


   However, Berger's model does not account for uncertainty about preferences, ability, or academic progress. Changes


in these factors will lead some students to leave school or change elds, as emphasized in the theoretical section. In

 19 See   Goldin et al (2006) for an excellent overview of long-run trends in the educational attainment and high school curriculum and
college major choices of women.
 20 The wage and share   data are from the ACS, and the other data are from the 1993/2003 Baccalaureate & Beyond survey.
 21 For example, among    individuals without graduate degrees the mean, 10th percentile and 90th percentile values are 43.7, 14.3, and 80.6
for economics and 41.2, 20.1, and 61.9 for mechanical engineering. See Supplementary Table 2.




                                                                     21
Altonji's (1993) model, uncertainty regarding ability and preferences leads to probabilistic major completion even if ex


post monetary payos are known. He emphasizes the distinction between the ex ante and ex post return to a particular


course of study. (Note that the estimates in the next section are all ex post returns; that is, returns contingent on


completion of a major.) The ex ante return is the return associated with starting a particular major, and includes the


possibility of dropping out entirely, switching majors, or proceeding on to a graduate degree. Altonji does not estimate


his theoretical model, but Arcidiacono's (2004) econometric model has some of the same features.
                                                                                                                    22 Montmarquette et

al (2002) break down expected (ex ante) returns into the probability of completing a major, and earnings contingent


on completing a major. They nd that expected earnings (the product of the two) has more predictive power than


either on its own.


    While many papers include the expected wages associated with a terminal college degree in the choice equation,


Eide & Waehrer (1998) also incorporate the option value of graduate school. For both men and women the option


value of graduate school increases the likelihood of majoring in science or liberal arts relative to business, although


the magnitudes dier signicantly by gender.


    A few recent papers directly measure expectations. They use specialized surveys (usually conned to one school)


to assess students' subjective expectations about wages. A more representative sample of colleges would be preferable,


but these studies provide unique insights into college students' decision-making.


    Betts (1996) nds that University of CaliforniaSan Diego seniors are much better informed about wages than fresh-


men, suggesting that students may wait to learn about their abilities and preferences before investing in information-


gathering.    This has implications for the timing and informativeness of information shocks about the labor market


in our model, relative to the preference and learning shocks              Î¶   and   .   Given the diculty of majoring in science and


engineering if one does not lay the foundation in freshman and sophomore year, students may be obtaining the la-


bor market information after it is too late. Betts also shows that students from lower-income families systematically


underestimate earnings for college-educated workers.


    Arcidiacono, Hotz & Kang (2010) nd that major choice is based on comparative advantage, in that Duke sopho-


mores expect to have higher earnings in the major in which they are currently enrolled than in other majors (with


the exception of economics, which all students believe would lead to higher earnings). Students also tend to be more


accurate about future earnings in their own major than in other majors. Zafar (2009b) (Northwestern sophomores)


and Betts (1996) nd similar results. Reassuringly, students' earnings expectations do correlate with actual earnings.


    The literature on choice of major also considers risk aversion. With concave preferences, students should consider

  22 Altonji estimates probit models for the probability of 19 post-secondary education outcomes as a function of demographic characteristics,
family background, high school curriculum, and a vector of 12th grade aptitude and achievement measures. He also estimates a model of
the wages associated with each of these outcomes. He uses the education outcome probabilities and the wage payos to compute the ex
ante return to starting college as a function of student characteristics. The ex post payos matter in proportion to the probability that
they will be realized. He provides estimates for men and women of the eects of family background, high school curriculum, and aptitude
and achievement on the ex ante return to starting college. Students with higher ex ante returns are more likely to start college and 12th
graders who expect to attend college have a higher ex ante return. Stange (2011) estimates a dynamic structural model of education choice
which shows that the option value of early choices can be substantial. See also Heckman et al (2008). Neither Stange nor Heckman et
al consider eld of study.   See Altonji (1993) for references to a few earlier papers that consider the implications of uncertainty about
completion probabilities in examining the demand for and return to education, including Manski (1989). Weisbrod (1962) introduced the
concept of the nancial option value of a year of education.




                                                                     22
the variance as well as the mean of earnings associated with particular programs of study.                   (Table 1 reports 10th


and 90th percentiles of wages by major.) Saks & Shore (2005) nd that students from wealthier families are more


likely to choose  riskier majors, as is implied by a model in which agents have decreasing absolute risk aversion.


Christiansen et al (2007) investigate the risk-return trade-o in major choice and conclude that many majors are not


at the ecient frontier. However, their model excludes eort costs and other costs, so the frontier interpretation may


be overly restrictive.




4.3 Preferences
A number of studies examine the eects of preferences for non-pecuniary aspects of majors and their associated


occupations on choice of major. Daymont & Andrisani (1984) make use of survey questions regarding the importance


an individual assigns to various job characteristics (being a leader, working with people, making lots of money, helping


others). They nd substantial gender dierences in in the measures. Their multivariate regression analysis indicates


that the preference measures account for nearly a third of the gender dierence in choosing a business major is explained


by these variables but play only a minor role other majors. However, this paper does not include ability controls or


test scores.


   Blakemore & Low (1984) nd that women tend to choose majors that are subject to less atrophy, reducing the


costs of time away from the labor market for child care. Turner and Bowen (1999) also outline stark gender dierences


in major choice but point out this could be due to dierences in preferences or to the chilling eect of past labor


market discrimination. They also highlight the importance of ner degrees of disaggregation in major choice, pointing


out that biology and physics, while often grouped together, in fact require very dierent skill sets.


   Zafar (2009a) is principally interested in decomposing gender dierences into dierences in abilities and preferences.


He nds that preferences play a strong role. For example, in addition to expected future earnings, students care about


enjoying coursework, parental approval, and the social status of future occupations.
                                                                                                  23 Moreover, while the choices

of men depend roughly equally on pecuniary and non-pecuniary attributes, women's choices depend roughly twice


as much on non-pecuniary attributes than pecuniary ones. Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2011) nd that student


preferences and ability play a crucial role in eld of study.




4.4 Ability and preparation
We have not yet said anything about how high school preparation and innate ability conditions choice of major. Turner


& Bowen (1999) show that the eects of SAT scores (math and verbal) are non-linear and, moreover, that the eects


dier by gender. These scores account for 45% of the gender gap in math/physical sciences, but only 8% in psychology,


leaving a great deal of room for gender dierences in preferences. Zafar (2009a) also rules out gender dierences in


beliefs about ability as a driver of gender dierences in choices.

 23 Other   papers in the large literature in economics and other elds on gender dierences in major choice include Dickson (2010) and
Canes and Rosen (1995).




                                                                  23
    Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner (2011) use a unique panel data set on Berea College students to track student


major choices over time. Rather than asking students to state their expected major, they ask the students to assign


probabilities to completing various majors (see also Manski (1993) and Manski (2004)).                      They nd that although


many students begin their college careers assigning a high probability to nishing a science major, many learn that


their abilities are not adequate.        In our model, we incorporate this new information about one's abilities through


performance shocks in college.         Ost (2010) echoes Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner (2011) and Arcidiacono (2004) in


documenting a positive relationship between grades and persistence in a particular major. However, Ost points that


physical science majors get higher grades in non-science courses than in science courses and thus may be tempted away


from science.     This eect is exacerbated by increasing grade ination in non-science elds relative to science elds.


He nds additionally that the presence of high-achieving peers in the physical sciences positively inuences one's own


persistence. It is somewhat articial to separate ability and preparation from preferences in determining major choice.


Ability to pursue a particular course of study with a reasonable level of eort and to perform well in related jobs


inuences the utility associated with the activity, holding wages constant.




5 Returns to college major: empirical evidence
Here we provide a partial survey of the literature on returns to college curriculum. We also present descriptive estimates


of returns to dierent majors using data from the ACS, supplemented with characteristics associated with dierent


majors (average SAT scores, numbers of math and science courses, etc) extracted from the Baccalaureate and Beyond


1993 dataset. We begin with a discussion of the estimation strategies used and possible alternative ones. We then


turn to the results.




5.1 Estimation strategies in the existing literature
Estimating the returns to college major is fraught with many of the same diculties that plague estimations of the


average return to schooling more generally. The main problems are omitted variables that inuence both choice and


earnings, and selection bias based on heterogeneity in returns. To the extent that students select into particular majors


on the basis of their anticipated future returns, OLS estimates of the returns will be biased as estimates of the causal


impacts of major choice. As such they will represent neither the average treatment eect, nor the eect of treatment


on the treated.
                   24 Most papers nevertheless use OLS and hope that controls are adequate.

    Berger (1988) is one of the few papers that attempts to address this kind of selection. He uses a conditional logit


with ve major categories and nds that students choose majors on the basis of the present value of expected lifetime


earnings.     To obtain identication, he allows family background variables (father's occupation, parental education,


race, etc) to aect the choice of major without aecting earnings and allows ability measures (IQ, Knowledge of


World of Work) and cohort to aect major choice only through the earnings equation. Both of these assumptions are

  24 Sample   selection bias associated with labor force participation is also an issue, as Hamermesh and Donald (2008) show (see below).
Few studies address it.




                                                                    24
questionable. There is clear evidence that the psychic costs and benets of college depend on ability and performance


see for example Arcidiacono (2004). Furthermore, family background might easily aect general skills and may thus


inuence earnings as well as the payo to particular majors.
                                                                            25

    The coecient on the selection correction term is found to be signicant for only two majors within each specication


(education and liberal arts in the case of log wages; education and science in the case of log earnings). While Berger


interprets the signs on these coecients as indicative of positive selection, the lack of consistency across specications


and lack of signicance leaves room for doubt.


    The nal approach is to use a dynamic discrete choice model along the lines of Section 2. Arcidiacono (2004) uses


this approach.




5.2 Possible alternative strategies
Other methods to control for selection in major choice do not appear to have been used.                            If there were sucient


regional variation in oerings across colleges, such as the availability of an engineering school, a variant of Card's


(1995) distance to college instrument might be tried. Freeman (1976) and Siow (1984), among others, show that the


supply to specic occupations depends upon market conditions at the time that students choose a eld of study. More


work could be done using variation across time and place in the demand for particular types of majors. However, the


work of Lisa Kahn (2010), Paul Oyer (2006) and others indicates that market conditions at the time of labor market


entry have long-term eects on earnings prospects. Consequently, one might question whether labor market conditions


early in college can be excluded from wage equations even several years after graduation. Perhaps parental occupation


or college major could be used if parental earnings, assets, highest degree level, and ability are controlled for.


    A natural approach would be to use a regression discontinuity (RD) design in situations where certain majors have


a test score cut-o or enrollment cap for entry. Some US universities use GPA cut-os as a way to ration access to


some programs. The opportunity for RD approaches is greater in countries that admit students to particular programs


and particular colleges based primarily on test scores.
                                                                   26 However, because students are in fact making a sequence of

decisions about whether to remain in school and about which eld to choose (particularly in the US context), there is


an important distinction between ex ante and ex post returns to schooling decisions. Both of these returns to school


choice depend on when the choice is made.                 The ex post return parameter to graduating in engineering identied


by a regression discontinuity design based on grades or test scores at the time of college entry is dierent from the


corresponding parameter identied using a grade cuto after the second year of college.


    Another selection issue is selection into the labor force. Employment rates dier substantially across majors both


because of dierences in labor force attachment and dierences in the unemployment probability.                              Insofar as this


problem is restricted to women, one solution is to estimate wage equations for men only, as is standard in the returns

  25 See also Willis and Rosen (1979).
  26 Depending on the institutional details,   one must address selection in the decision to apply to particular universities and programs. See
Carvalho and Magnac (2010) for an example of such a study of college and major choice for Brazil. With additional data, their analysis
could be extended to labor market outcomes. Bertrand et al (2010) apply an RD strategy based on admissions cut-o scores to engineering
colleges in India that vary across castes, although large sampling errors limit what they can conclude about earnings eects.




                                                                       25
to schooling literature more generally. However, this sidesteps many interesting and important questions regarding


gender dierences in choice of, and returns to, college major, and it does not address dierential unemployment risk.


Hamermesh and Donald (2008) is the only paper we reviewed that explicitly corrects for selection into employment.
                                                                                                                                     27

They nd that accounting for selection into the labor force reduces earnings dierentials across major by 10-20%.


Furthermore, this bias is most important for education majors, which is not surprising given the much larger proportion


of female education majors and the fact that Hamermesh and Donald pool men and women.                             This points to the


importance of an integrated approach where both employment and earnings prospects play a role in choosing major


and employment selection is controlled for.




5.3 Estimates of the return to major
As we already noted, most studies use OLS with control variables rather than addressing endogenous selection into


college major with an IV strategy or a selection model with exclusion restrictions. The control variables range from


simple demographics, a small set of family background measures, and perhaps test scores, to detailed high school


transcript information. The case for controlling for high school grades, tests, and courses prior to college seems clear.


However, omitted variables bias in estimates of the eects of these variables could spill over into bias in estimates


of returns to major. Some studies control for college transcript information and college quality measures. Some also


include performance measures in college, arguing that insofar as ability diers by major, the returns to college major


may be conated with returns to ability. Whether one includes college variables, such as semesters of math, depends


on whether one wishes to measure the total eect of a particular college major (including human capital accumulation


in the form of coursework and grades) or the eect of the title of the degree, net of substantive skill dierences.


Hamermesh and Donald (2008) show that there is a substantial return to upper-level math and science credits and


grades holding eleven major categories constant. (Explaining dierences in the returns to majors with dierences in


course content and grades, as opposed to the credential eect of the eld of degree, is an interesting challenge for


research.) Controlling for occupation is hard to defend other than as part of a strategy to identify why majors pay


dierently.


    Table 2 presents certain estimates from selected papers.                  Aside from methodological concerns and dierences


in control variables, caution is urged in comparing results across studies for two main reasons.                   First, the level of


aggregation of majors diers widely from study to study, ranging from four to over ten. Second, the time periods in


question vary somewhat, although many use the same data set (NLS72). The estimates shown are the coecients on


major dummies in OLS regressions with the specied control variables.
                                                                                     28 Coecients for men and women are presented

separately when available. For ease of comparison, coecients have been re-calculated, when necessary, relative to the


education major; signicance levels are not reported unless education was the original excluded category in the study.


    As has been well-documented, the return to skill has increased substantially over the past few decades, particularly

  27 They also model    survey non-response, but nd that this has a negligible eect on results.
  28 The exception is   Berger (1988), who runs separate regressions for each major category. The estimates shown are the premiums (over
education) in predicted log wages.




                                                                      26
in the 1980s. Grogger and Eide (1995) decompose this into a change in returns and a change in the composition of


majors.
           29 In particular, they nd that the return to math ability increased substantially for women, while a trend

toward more technical subjects accounted for much of the increase for men. The coecients presented in the table


are the coecients on the major; however, the authors also include major interacted with experience and experience-


squared, whose coecients are not shown.
                                                   30

    Overall, however, the relative results have remained remarkably consistent over time. In particular, engineering


consistently commands a high premium (around 0.40 relative to education), usually followed by business and science.


Humanities, social sciences, and education are further behind. Controlling for pre-college test scores and grades reduces


earnings dierentials substantially. Hamermesh and Donald (2008), for example, report a standard deviation of 0.305


points of log earnings dierences across twelve majors; this is halved when GPA, upper division math courses, upper


division math grades, annual hours worked and a few additional controls are included. Controlling for selection into


the labor force and non-response bias reduces the standard deviation somewhat further, to 0.139.


    There has been speculation that the dierence in returns is due to dierence in math ability. Paglin and Rufolo


(1990), for example, explain 82% of the variance across college majors in entry-level wages on the basis of the average


GRE-math scores by major.
                                   31 Moreover, Grogger and Eide show that the return to math ability has increased over

time: the eect of a one standard deviation increase in math ability grew from a 2% increase in wages in 1978 to 5%


in 1986, and from 3% to 7.5% for women.


    There are also dierences across majors in hours worked. Hamermesh and Donald (2008) nd that controlling for


hours worked and selection into the workforce reduces earnings dierentials.


    One might also be interested in the eects of college major on occupation, and in particular, the extent to which


human capital is major-specic.           Robst (2007) shows that students who are employed in a eld unrelated to their


eld of study suer a wage penalty, suggesting that this is at least partially the case; however, the wage penalty


varies by eld. The most specic elds, such as engineering, involve harsher penalties than elds which develop more


general skills, such as liberal arts. Malamud (2011), however, shows that the British system that requires students to


specialize early leads to greater eld-switching upon labor market entry than the Scottish system, which allows later


specialization. This suggests that delaying specialization to learn about one's preferences and comparative advantage


may outweigh any loss in eld-specic skills.


    Not much is known about the eect of college major on opportunities at the graduate level. Black et al (2003)

  29 These changes in composition are documented in Section 5.
  30 Several other studies address the contribution of major choice   to the gender gap among college graduates, including the recent study
by Black et al (2008), who provide additional references. Black et al use the National Survey of College Graduates, which provides large
sample sizes, highly disaggregated major categories and a measure of full-time experience.      Results dier somewhat across race/ethnic
groups, but for whites the unexplained gender gap is -0.184 when highest degree, highest degree major eld, and age are controlled for,
compared to a total gap of -0.339. For workers with high labor force attachment, the unexplained gap is -0.086 and the total gap -0.297.
Black et al (2006) provide a similar analysis of the contribution of dierences in detailed major to race dierentials in the wages of highly
educated men. Among individuals who speak English at home, dierences in education and language prociency account for essentially all
of the small gap between white men and Hispanic men but only a quarter of the much larger gap between white men and black men. The
reduction in the gap is about the same for the two groups. However, they account for the entire gap for black men born outside the South
with parents who have some education.
  31 See   also Weinberger (1999). Some of this reects the eect of major on math scores, and association between average math scores and
other student characteristics. In the ACS data we explain about 58% of the variance in the major-specic returns with SAT math and
verbal scores.




                                                                      27
provide estimates of wage gaps by undergraduate major relative to economics for those who obtain an MBA or a


graduate law degree. With the exception of chemical engineers who obtain an MBA, economists earn more than their


counterparts from the other most common pre-MBA or pre-law majors.                        These results illustrate the importance of


considering the options that an earlier education choice oers.




5.4 Descriptive evidence from the ACS on college major choice and returns
In this subsection we provide additional evidence on the relative returns to college major using the ACS. Unfortunately,


the data set lacks test scores and family background measures, and so the estimates we report almost certainly overstate


the relative return to majors that attract advantaged, high ability students. Nevertheless the large size of the ACS


permits one to examine very detailed major categories with and without 5-digit occupation controls and to examine


trends in major choice by graduation cohort and gender. Table 3 provides OLS estimates of major coecients separately


for men and women, with and without occupation controls. These regressions include dummy variables for advanced


degrees, a cubic in potential experience, and race/ethnicity as controls. The table reports only the 23 most popular of


the 171 major categories included in the regression. These twenty-three account for just over half of the college-plus


sample. The omitted category is General Education. Near the bottom of the table we also report the sample-weighted


standard deviation of the major coecients adjusted for sampling error.
                                                                                        32 The dierences across majors are large.

Consistent with results in the literature, the estimates show that engineers have the highest returns and education


majors the lowest. This is true even after controlling for occupation. In most elds the size of the premium over a


general education degree is higher for men than it is for women. The standard deviation is 0.177 for men and 0.146


for women. Thus, for men (women), a two standard deviation shift is associated with an increase of 0.354 (0.292) log


points in earnings. To compare, the high schoolcollege dierential is 0.577.
                                                                                            33 Almost all of the gender dierence in

the standard deviation is due to gender dierences in major choice rather than gender dierences in the dispersion of


the major coecients.


    How have trends in major choice aected the gender gap holding the major coecients for men and women constant?


Figure 2 takes the major coecients from Table 3 and calculates their weighted average by age and gender. (General


education is the omitted category.) For individuals who graduated from college in the early 1970s, the weighted average


of the female coecients using the male major weights is about 0.1 above the value using the female weights. The gap


narrows for the later cohorts but does not move very much. The gap at the beginning of the period is even wider using


the male weights, but it narrows during the 70s. These results indicate that over most of the period, the dierences in


college major choice account for about a third of the gender gap in log wages.


    The gure also show how changes in the composition of majors have aected the average return to a college degree.

  32 The    sample is restricted to individuals between 23 and 59 years of age who worked more than 34 hours a week for more than 40 weeks
in the previous year and who had a college or advanced degree. All majors are included, not just those corresponding to the coecients
presented in the table. The full set of coecients are in Supplementary Table 3. See Carnevale et al (2011) for a descriptive analysis of the
returns to college major using the ACS.
  33 This   is the coecient on a college degree dummy in a regression that excludes the college major indicators, includes education level
indicators and the other controls used in Table 3, and is estimated on a sample that includes high school graduates and above.




                                                                     28
For both men and women, the curves show an increase of about 0.05 in the weighted average of the returns between the


early 1970s and about 1986. This is due to a shift toward more lucrative majors, particularly engineering and business,


with a peak in the mid-80s. The gure shows a decline of about 0.02 after that. These shifts in the distribution of


majors are illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1.


    We have also estimated, but do not present, a set of regressions using major characteristics from the B&B and


the demographic and educational variables used above.              Including 51 B&B major dummies yields an            R2   of 0.261,


an increase of 0.06 over the      R2   of a model with only highest-degree indicators. Replacing the major dummies with


major-specic SAT scores
                               34 (math and verbal) or including counts of the average number of courses in 8 dierent

disciplines (math, business, etc) leads to      R2   values of 0.234 and 0.241, respectively. SAT scores account for 54.7% of


the variation in the return to college major across the B&B categories (weighted by frequency in the ACS sample).


We obtain 62.5% of the variation using average GRE math, verbal, and writing scores for graduate school applicants


in a smaller number of major categories. However, this overstates the role pre-existing ability dierences for reasons


touched upon earlier.


    What is the role of occupation? For men, the standard deviation of the college major coecients is 0.177 when


occupation is excluded and 0.098 when it is controlled for.            Thus a substantial part of the dierence in pay across


majors is related to the occupations that they lead to. Part of this wage dierence represents compensating dierentials


for nonpecuniary factors, of course.


    In summary, wages vary greatly across college major. The variation is large enough for the tendency for men to


choose high paying majors to be an important factor in the gender gap in wages. A substantial part of the dierences


in returns is almost certainly due to dierences in the market value of tasks that require the specic knowledge and


skills particular majors develop. However, pre-college dierences in skill and ability, as captured by the SAT scores,


and compensating dierentials for nonpecuniary attributes also play a role. Much remains to be learned about why


majors pay so dierently.




5.5 College major and occupational choice
In this subsection we discuss the empirical link between college major and occupation.
                                                                                                     35 For some majors, such as

nursing and accounting, the path is clear. For others it is not. Supplementary Table 4 illustrates the proportion of


graduates in various majors employed in the three most common 5-digit occupations for that major. About 70% of


accounting or auditing majors aged 25-29 are employed in the top three occupations. Even among those aged 55-59,


the gure is 51%. For nursing, the comparable gures are 90 and 79%. On the other hand, history and psychology


are examples of majors that have high occupational dispersion at all ages. Overall, the table suggests a fanning-out


of occupations as individuals are promoted or switch occupations as their careers progress. Figure 3 provides further

  34 SAT   Math and Verbal scores are predicted using the combined SAT Math and Verbal scores when the math and verbal scores are
missing.
  35 Ransom   and Phipps (2010) provide related evidence on the link between major and occupation using the National Survey of College
Graduates.




                                                                  29
evidence for this pattern. This gure reports the probability density (across majors) of the fraction of people in a major


who are in one of the top ten occupations for that major. The peak of the densities occurs when the fraction is about


0.43. However, the heavy right tail and lower peak for those aged 25 to 34 indicates that occupational concentration


is substantially larger for young workers.


   The ip side of this analysis is the proportion of workers in an occupation accounted for by the three most common


majors for that occupation.    In Supplementary Table 5 we report this statistic for a few occupations by stage of


career. Not surprisingly, almost all registered nurses major in either nursing, biology, or psychology regardless of stage


of career.   The values for marketing and sales managers and for accountants and auditors are similar, though less


extreme. Post-secondary school teachers and marketing and sales are examples of occupations that draw on a wider


array of majors. With a large panel data set, one could go much further in examining the link between major and


career path. We have already noted that much the variance in the returns to majors is associated with dierences in


the pay of the occupations that they lead to. The clear message is that specicity of skill is important to a degree that


varies across occupation and major.




6 Conclusion
The demand for and return to    types   of human capital investments is an exciting research area that is highly relevant


for both education and labor market policy, as education and occupation choices dier greatly in the monetary and


non-monetary rewards that they bring.


   Rather than summarizing the paper, we close by restating the questions for empirical research. The recent the-


oretical work on education and occupation choice that we have synthesized here emphasizes several key factors: the


sequential nature of the decision-making process; the partial irreversibility of some decisions because of the heterogene-


ity of human capital and the cumulative nature of human capital investment in many elds; the importance of innate


ability, preferences, and pre-high school learning in shaping the feasibility and non-pecuniary costs and benets of


particular education and occupation paths; and the essential role of uncertainty about ability, preferences, knowledge


accumulation, and wage rates at each stage. The theory has some very clear implications for empirical research. The


rst concerns the determination of preferences for schooling in general and types of schooling in particular, which we


touch on briey in Section 3. The second concerns the determination of the ability to do math, excel at science, write


well, etc. The third concerns estimation of the knowledge production function. How should skills and knowledge be


classied? How can they be measured using observables such as course content, grades, and tests? How much does


learning in school or on the job depend on the program or the occupation? The fourth is how grades, knowledge and


ability determine promotion and admission to colleges, a subject on which there is a substantial literature that we


have not touched on here. The fth is how best to model the agent's information set and learning about ability and


preferences.   The sixth is estimation of the ex post payo to knowledge, ability, and degree by level and eld.      We


summarized a number of papers that attempt this for college education and a smaller number that look at high school




                                                            30
curriculum. Much progress has been made, but there is a long way to go on the road to credible measures of the payo


to elds of study. We suggest several approaches that might prove fruitful.


   The overriding question is the choice of education and occupation at each stage in the life course and the conse-


quences of those choices. For example, how does the current utility and expected future utility of spending the rst


period of college in a pre-engineering curriculum versus a ne arts curriculum depend on preferences, ability, and the


stock of human capital at the start of college? The large earnings gaps across elds that attract students admitted


to the same universities with similar grades and test scores strongly suggests that compensating dierentials are of


critical importance.

Empirical evidence on choice of high school curriculum

There is relatively little empirical work in economics on how high school students choose curricula, partic-

ularly in comparison to research on choice of college major. The main margins of choice for a typical high

school student are among vocational, general, and academic curricula, and, within the latter, between a

focus in social sciences and humanities and a focus in mathematics and science. The level and number of
courses (subject to promotion and graduation requirements) are also choice variables. Contrary to popular

perception, the number and level of courses in academic subjects taken by high school students in America

have risen over the past thirty years. Data on course taking by high school seniors reported in Ingels et al

(2008) for the years 1982, 1992, and 2004 shows an increase from 1982, particularly in science. Supplemen-

tary Table 1 compares course-taking trends from 1990 to 2009 for high school graduates, as reported by Nord

et al (2011). Course-taking overall is up and in core academic subjects (mathematics, science, social science,

and English). Furthermore, the percentage of students taking more rigorous programs of study has increased
as well. Of course, one would expect curriculum choice to change over time as the occupational mix of labor

demand changes. As we discuss in Section 4, part of the trend is due to changes in state level graduation

requirements. It would be interesting to decompose trends in college attendance and major choice over the
past 40 years into the contribution of changes in high school curriculum and the contribution of changes in

the link between high school curriculum and major choice.

   We are not aware of any study that has estimated a structural model of high school curriculum choice

along the lines sketched in the previous section. Zietz and Joshi (2005) use the NLSY (1997) to estimate

a two-period model of leisure maximization, subject to minimum consumption constraints. They find that

âacademic aptitude, pre-high school academic performance, and lifetime consumption goals as driven by
peer pressure and family background are by far the most important determinants of program choice.â Meer

(2007), using the NELS88 data, finds that the principle of comparative advantage is at play when students
choose between academic and vocational high school curricula. In the remainder of this section, we briefly

summarize some of the descriptive evidence on the determinants of curriculum.

   There is a substantial literature on the role of gender, race/ethnicity, and socio-economic status in

determining high school curriculum, which we touch on briefly here. Historically, girls tended to take less

math and science than boys, despite equal (or greater) opportunities or prior achievement (Oakes (1990),

Catsambis (1994), Ayalon (1995)). Girls tend to have less positive attitudes toward or fewer aspirations
for careers in math or science; they are less interested in math and less confident about their mathematics


                                                      1
abilities (Dick & Rallis (1991)). However, Goldin et al (2006) report that among graduating seniors the

male/female ratio of mean number of high school courses in math, science courses, and chemistry declined

from between 1.3 and 1.4 in 1957 to between 0.9 and 1.0 in 2000. In physics, the male/female ratio declined

from 3.1 to 1.21.
   Students from high SES backgrounds tend to be streamed into more academic tracks; this can be explained

by a variety of factors including higher intrinsic ability (cognitive or non-cognitive), choice of school and

neighborhood, better preparation in primary school, peer eï¬ects, or parental lobbying (Vanfossen, Jones &

Spade (1987)). Interestingly, African-American and Latino students have positive attitudes toward math,

despite low achievement (Catsambis (1994)). That said, minorities enroll in math-intensive courses at lower

rates than whites; however, this is mostly explained by SES and prior achievement (as measured, for example,

by GPA) (Ferguson (2009)).
   Recent reports discussing student course taking and achievement with emphasis science, engineering,

technology and math, include Presidentâs Council on Science and Technology (2011).


School-level influences

School policies, particularly course requirements, scope of oï¬erings, and tracking guidelines, are an important

influence on curriculum choice. These policies are in turn shaped in part by state and school district
regulations, as we document below. A substantial fraction of the variance in curriculum choice is across high

schools (see note 9).

   To the extent that school behavior can be taken as independent of the unobserved characteristics of the

students that attend the school, such variation can be (and has been) used to identify the eï¬ects of particular

high school curricula. In practice, however, school choice and cross school competition and specialization
(attracting particular parts of the student market) will undermine the credibility of such a strategy. In

Section 3, we discuss three studies that use curriculum reforms as a source of exogenous variation.
   Peers, teachers and facilities (e.g., availability of science labs or a theater) may also influence curriculum

choice, but attempts to identify the causal eï¬ect of these factors are subject to the same endogeneity problem.
