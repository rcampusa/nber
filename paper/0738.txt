               The Terminations Premium in Mortgage Coupon Rates:
            Evidence on the Integration of Mortgage and Bond Markets


                                   ABSTRACT




         During the last three years mortgage rates have risen relative to
 yields on comparable maturity bonds. The questions addressed in the present
 paper    are what is the extent of this increase and to what is it attributable?

 We find the increase between early 1978 and early 1981 in coupon rates on

 GN14A mortgage pools relative to the" rate on a comparable portfolio of

 Treasury bonds to be about 100 basis points. We attribute the increase

 to a rise in the terminations premia built into mortgage coupon rates.

 The premia Is the price borrowers are charged for the option to repay the

mortgage when it is to their benefit (to refinance if interest rates

decline). This price has risen in response to an increase in interest

rate uncertainty. Our empirical results suggest that the increase is

due to both greater uncertainty regarding the inflation premium in

 interest rates and the lesser weight the monetary authorities give to

interest rate stability in their deliberations.

       Financial markets have behaved somewhat differently in recent years

  than in the previous quarter century. Two       changes   are particularly

  relevant to this paper. First, interest rates have been more volatile

 generally. Second, while all interest rates have risen to unprecedented

  levels, mortgage rates have increased by more than rates on other

 securities of comparable maturity. This contrasts markedly with the

 previous quarter century, when mortgage rates were typically described

 as "sluggish." We suspect that the second of these two phenomena

 follows from the first. Mortgage rates contain a terminations premium

 to compensate lenders for expected reductions in effective yields

 relative to quoted coupons owing to borrowers prepaying at a faster

 or slower rate, depending on which is to their economic benefit (and

 to the detriment of the lender). An increase in interest rate uncertainty

 increases expected reductions due to the terminations option and

 raises the terminations premium in mortgage coupon rates. That is, the

 coupon rate adjusts to maintain parity between the expected effective

 yields on mortgages and securities without call options.

       There are two pieces of evidence that interest rate uncertainty has

 increased   in recent years. First, the importance the Federal Reserve

 attached to interest rate stability was substantially reduced in late

 l97'9 and 1980. One indication of this was the increase in the targeted

 band for the federal funds rate from less than a percentage point In

  Annual Meetings of the American Economic and Finance Associations,

 1978 to percentage points on October 6, 1979 and as much as 7 percentage

points in 1980. Second, the standard deviation of one-year inflation

forecasts of the participants In the Livingston survey rose above two

percentage points for       the   first time in 1979-80. Given a relationship

between interest rates and inflation, uncertain inflation Implies uncertain

interest rates.

        Two specific questions are addressed in the present paper. First,

how much have mortgage coupon rates (more specifically, that on newly-

issued GNMA. pools) risen relative to a comparable maturity portfolio

of Treasury securities? Second, Is the increase reasonably attributed

to a rise in the terminations premium owing to an increase in interest

rate uncertainty or must an explanation appeal to other factors? To

answer these questions we first calculate the terminations premia Implied

by coupon rates and prices on newly-issued pools of GNMA securities

over the past several years under the assumption that the mortgage

market is fully integrated with capital markets generally. The

resulting "options premia" are then examined for their plausibility

(related empirically to reasonable proxies for interest rate uncertainty).

     The first three sections of the paper provide a framework for

performing     the calculations. The sections include a method of valuing
pools    of level-payment mortgages when termination rates are certain,
a discussion of the impact of interest rate outcomes on termination
rates,   and   a   description of methodologies for measuring the terminations
premium in mortgage coupon rates. Basically, the premium is the difference
between the pool coupon rate and the internal rate of return on a portfolio
of Treasury securities with cash flows identical to those of the mortgage

  pool   after netting out payments for the terminations option. Premia

  are   calculated in Section IV for the LO months from         January    1978   to
  April 1981 and are related empirically to proxies for interest rate

  uncertainty. A summary      concludes   the paper.




         I. The Value of Mortgage Pools When      Termination     Rates are Certain


         The   formula for the scheduled payment on a level-payment mortgage
 with an initial principal of X dollars is:

         (1.1) PAYS     ix(l+i)M/[(l+i)M_l],


 where M is the maturity of the loan (the period over which the loan is
 amortized), and I is the mortgage coupon rate. The scheduled outstanding
 principal at time t on this mortgage is:


        (1.2) PRS — xr(l÷i)M -


 The above expressions hold whatever unit        of   time   is chosen.1
        The decline over time in the      scheduled principal of level-payment
mortgages      results exclusively from amortization. The cash-flow generated

by a portfolio or pool of mortgages will be greater than this by the amount

of the servicing fee which is a percentage of the outstanding principal.

Also, expost cash flow will exceed scheduled cash flow if any mortgages prepay.




1These expressions also hold for variable-rate and renegotiable mortgages
If   interest rates are expected to be unchanged in the future.
                                             -4-




Let      denote the fraction of the N loans, each of value X, in the pooi

that will terminate at time t and s be the servicing fee (the c superscript

indicates that the values are viewed as certain). The total payment on

the mortgage pool in period t contingent on               is then:



                                         +
        (1.3) T1V1PAY =      (-s)NPRIN        (l-)rPAY5
                 t-1
where
         T
             =         and       I because all mortgages are terminated by
period N. That is, the payment is simply the principal termination, less

the servicing fee, plus the scheduled payment (interest plus amortization)

on the remaining principal outstanding.

       Now consider an existing pool k periods after origination where

is the fraction of the N mortgages in the original pool that are still

outstanding. The fraction of mortgages that will terminate in each period

t subsequent to k is defined as kt and the cummulative n-action of
                                                                             t -1
mortgages that will be terminated by time t-l is denoted by              =
                                                                                    "
                                                                             j=k
The total payment in time t       (contingent      on kt on a portfolio of mortgages

k-i   periods old is then:


       (1.4) kPAYt =         (k_s)rPR1         +
                                                   (1_k)QkNPAY


      The value of this mortgage pool is simply the discounted present

value of the total payments or

                       t=k÷l (1+ytk) -


 Because these payments are known with certainty, the appropriate discount

 rates are the yields on risk-free pure-discount securities of the matching

 maturity.2 That is, it-k is the yield on a riskiess pure discount bond

 of maturity t-k. Although such yields are not directly observable

 in the securities markets as coupon rates, capital markets will implicitly

 determine a unique spectrum of these yields, which when plotted form

 a yield curve.3

      Even though the cash flows of the pool are certain, interest-rate

 uncertainty could affect the value of the pool through its effect on the

 discount rates. The yields on pure discount default-free securities

 might contain interest-rate risk or term prernia if the marginal investor

 is averse to the risk that future rates might differ from those currently

 anticipated. The magnitude of these premia will reflect the degree of

 uncertainty. Thus, for example, "flat" interest rate expectations might

 generate an upward sloping yield curve, where the degree of slope reflects

 the uncertainty of future interest rates and investor aversion to this

 uncertainty .   Because our focus is on the impact of interest-rate

uncertainty on the relative values of mortgage pools with certain and

 cash flows based on some multiple of FHA experience by the term structure
 of Treasury yields. rkVC is described as "the market value" of a portfolio
 of Treasury securities having the same (but certain) cash flows as the
 mortgage pool. Next he determines the single"internal rate of return"
 for the given kV° and cash flows. Finally, he adds a premium to this rate
 just sufficient to equate the discounted present value of these cash flows
 to the observed market price of GNMA pools. Garbade does not develop an
 interpretation of the premium.

loss of generality, that term prenila are zero and thus that     a flat yield
curve   inrplies   constant interest rate expectations.

     While prices for securities are generally quoted as a percent of par

value, we    shall   express prices as a fraction of par. Thus the price

at time   k of a portfolio of securities is:

That is, the quoted price at time k is the market     value   at time k as

a fraction of the principal still outstanding at time




Taxes have been ignored in the above analysis. This is permissible if
either:  (1) the pool is trading at par so there is no need to distinguish
between capital gains and interest income which are taxed at differential
rates or (2) the marginal investor in the pool is a tax-exempt institution.
If neither of these conditions holds and if one knew the tax rate of the
marginal investor, then the differential tax treatment of gains and
interest could be accounted for directly.

                      II.    Interest Rates and       Terminations   Rates


        The terminations rate for mortgages is akin to the mortality rate

 for   life insurance companies. A "niorta].ity" table has              in   fact been
 calculated for FHA experience.5 Termination rates are often expressed
 as some multiple, say 200           percent,   of actual (and projected) FH& repayment
 experience     for mortgages issued during a given period. Most generally

 where      =           . Thus      the fraction of the pool still outstanding

 of a   pool with     actual FHP experience that would be repaid in that same

 period         /(l4T
        The terminations schedule on a mortgage pool is defined in terms of

 all the terminations rates. The schedule is a random variable that depends

 in a rather complex way on the initial subjective (joint conditional

 Bayesian) probabilities that an individual mortgage will terminate in

 each subsequent future period. We define the "most likely" terminations

 schedule as the collection of termination rates that are giien the highest

 initial subjective probabilities.

        The timing of mortgage repayments is irrelevant to the

 valuation of pools only if (1) the yield curve is flat and (2) the

 mortgage pool is trading at par. Consider two pools, both carrying

 coupons   equal to the current   issue coupon. If the yield curve is
                                    new

 upward sloping, indicating that future interest rates are expected to be
 higher, then faster repaying pools will be valued above
 slower   repaying pools. And the converse is true if     the yield curve is
 downward sloping.        On the other hand, even if the yield curve is flat,

 faster   and slower repaying pools with equal coupons will be valued
 differently if this coupon differs from the current new issue coupon.
 For example, if the new-issue coupon exceeds that on the existing pools,
 then both existing pools will trade below par, with the slower paying
 pool   being further below par.
        The fact   that   the terminations rate is   not known a priori would not
 be   of concern if these rates were unrelated to economic variables and

 investors were indifferent to this uncertainty. One could simply project

 the "most likely" rates from past experience and calculate the value of'

 mortgage pools from equation (1.5) based on these rates.6 Unfortunately,

 mortgage terminations reflect the exercise of the borrower's option which is

 generally related to the observed course of interest rates.7 Moreover,

 as we wiU indicate in the following section, the systematic relationship

 between interest rates and termination experience causes investors to

 care about the uncertainty of termination rates.



6This is the procedure followed in some studies, e.g., Cater and Lloyd (1980).


7For evidence on this point, see Curley and Guttentag (1971i.).
                                   -9-.




     The dependency of mortgage terminations on interest rates operates

through three channels. First, the willingness of homeowners to sell their

houses depends on current mortgage rates relative to the rate on their

existing mortgages. For example, if rates are currently high, then homeowners

will be reluctent to forego the implicit capital gains they have on their

existing mortgages. Reduced mobility means fewer mortgage terminations.

Second, even if homeowners do sell, in some cases the mortgage will be

assumed by the new buyer. All FRA/VA mortgages are assumable, and, while

the standard deed of trust for conventional mortgages generally does not

allow assumptions, some obviously occur. More assumptions imply fewer

terminations. Third, even when no house sale occurs, the existing mortgage

can be terminated. If mortgage rates decline below the coupon rates on

existing mortgages by enough to outweigh the costs of refinancing, including

closing costs, repayment penalties and additional points charged the

borrower, then mortgages will be terminated and refinanced at the current

existing low rates.

     The data in Table 1 support dependency of termination rates on the

spread between past and current mortgage coupon rates. These data

are termination rates for mortgages issued in particular years (endorsement

years) cuznmulated through the third and sixth years after issue (the policy

years less one). The two sections in the table distinguish between

periods when early termination is less likely (mortgage rates in subsequent

 is described in detail in an April 1981 HtJ1) report to Congress; the legality
 of these and other creative financing mechanisms will eventually be ruled
 on by the Supreme Court. Also, variable rate mortgage contracts typically
 allow assumptions.

years rose relative to the issue rate) and. more likely (the reverse).

The selection of years does not, of course, hold the expost pattern of

mortgage rates precisely constant relative to the issue rates, but it is

close enough to reveal the expected pattern of slower terminations of

mortgages originated during the troughs of the interest rate cycle (upper

half of table) and faster terminations of mortgages originated during the

peaks of the interest rate cycle (lower half of table).9



            III. Uncertain Inflation and Mortgage Coupon Rates

     While the most likely terminations schedule is a useful concept,

the above discussion suggests that there is a large array of schedules

that might occur with significant probability, at least one for every

inflation-interest rate senario. Moreover, each senario implies a

different set of discount rates (y's). Assume that there are N viable

inflation-interest rate senarios that are expected to occur with
                                    N
                      ... p

                                   j=i
payment and discount rate vectors associated with the jth senario (and

its terminations schedule) by TMPAY(j) and y(j), respectively. Then,

the value of a pool of mortgages in the uncertainty case can be expressed as



9The few apparent anomalies in the table are explained
                                                       by differences in
 subsequent movements in interest rates. For
                                              example, the acceleration
 between the third and sixth years in terminations of mortgages issued in
 1957-58 is likely due to the decline in mortgage rates in
 1960s relative to the level                               the early
                             existing in 1957-58, and the slow early
 termination of l971 issues relative to 1970 issues is due to the minor
 decline in mortgage rates in 1975-76
                                      versus the sharp decline in 1971-72.

By substituting kVU from equation (3.1)      into   equation (1.6), we obtain

an expression for the efficient market price of mortgage contracts.

Conceptually, one could test for market efficiency by conaring this to

observed prices. Empirically, this requires knowledge of the market's

subjective probabilities of various interest rate scenarios (the y(j)'s)

and the relationship between ex post interest rates and cash flows

(the TMPAY(j)'s). Because we do not currently have such information,

such a test is beyond the scope of the current paper.

     With TMPAY and y based on the in (most likely) inflation-interest rate

outcome and p = 1, equation (3.1) reduces to (1.5). Comparison of these

expressions is instructive. A higher than most-likely inflation rate

lowers the present value of a given payment stream relative to

the most-likely rate by raising the discount factors, while a

lower than most-likely inflation rate raises the present value. When

the payment stream is independent of the inflation-interest rate

outcome, one would expect klftl =        for the same mortgage coupon rate.

That is, mortgage values --   like   security values generally -- would be

affected by deviations in observed inflation-interest rate outcomes from

those originally expected, but not by changes in the degree of uncertainty

  regarding   these outcomes. However, the payment stream and thus mortgage

  values are not independent of these outcomes. A higher than most-likely

  inflation rate reduces mobility by creating capital gains on existing

  mortgages and increases the assumption of existing mortgages by buyers when

 moves do occur. The lower termination rate magnifies the decline in present

 value caused by higher discount rates. A lower than most-likely inflation rate

  increases mobility by reducing existing capital gains and encourages

  refinancing of existing mortgages. Now, however, the higher termination

  rate mitigates the rise in present value caused by lower discount rates.

  for mortgage pools based on the same mortgage coupon rate.        Further,

  kv -        will   be disproportionately greater the larger is the variability

  of expectations regarding inflation and thus the greater both the

  likelihood of and resultant loss from adverse terminations.11

      The terminations option allows borrowers to repay at faster

 (refinancings) or slower (assumptions) rates, depending upon which is

 to their economic advantage (and thus to the lender's disadvantage).

 Borrowers will have to pay for this option either once in the form of a

 front-end fee when the mortgage is issued or annually in a higher

 coupon. When the front-end fee is employed, the price of the option is



10Dunn and McConnell (l981a) have calculated kv and kVU under some hypothetical
  assumptions regarding interest rates. First, a yield curve generating
  function is posited and a level of interest rate (yield curve) uncertainty
  is specified. Then (3.1) is evaluated under the assumption that the
  mortgage pool will be terminated if the new is sue mortgage rate falls
  below the coupon rate of the pool. For the certainty case, no "optimal"
  terminations are allowed (suboptixna]. terminations are assumed to follow
  100 or 200 FHA experience.)


11Conceptually, the difference in price should be the present value of the
  expected losses. In our earlier paper (1980), we provided several models
  to determine both the probability that the option will be exercised
  at a given point In time and the magnitude of the loss if it is.

  known.     When the higher coupon     method is     utilized, computation of the
  annual premium would seem to be a straight-forward application of equations

  (1.5)    and (3.1)   for the case of newly-issued mortgage pools (k =               0).
  Equation (3.1) is solved for 0V, and then equation (1.5)                   is   employed to
  determine   the coupon rate that would       equate        to         .   This    is the
  coupon   that is required in the certainty case. The difference                  between the
  actual coupon and the certainty coupon is the annual premium of the

  terminations   option.12 Unfortunately, there are no mortgages with certain

  termination rates, i.e., equation (1.5) cannot be utilized.

        Nevertheless, it is possible with one key assumption to obtain

 estimates of the terminations premium in GNMA coupon rates. The assumption

 is that the only difference in the eyes of investors between a GNMA
                                                                                        pool
 and   a comparable maturity portfolio of U.S. government bonds is the
 uncertainty regarding the timing of the cash flows (the term.iriation schedule)
 of the pool. Given that the incomes from the pool and the portfolio
 are taxed similarly and are subject to the same zero default risk, this
 assumption   would seem to be a reasonable working hypothesis. With this

assumption, the bond     portfolio    is equivalent to a mortgage           pool with   a certain
terminations    schedule, and   the   difference between the actual coupon rate
on   the pool and the    "effective" coupon        on the bond portfolio is the
terminations premium.
     A comparable maturity bond portfolio has cash flows that are equal
to those on a mortgage pool (based on the most likely terminations schedule)
after netting out the terminations option premium in              the   mortgage coupon.



The default premium in the coupon rate can be calculated similarly.
 First, equation (3.1) is solved for 0V on the assumption that all payments
 will be made on schedule. Second, the 's are altered to reflect expected
defaults; the left-side of (3.1) is set equal to the value obtained
assuming no default; and the coupon, jd, is solved for. This is the
coupon including the default premium. The premium is d

In general, mortgage payments are received at the end of the
                                                             month. Thus
 the total payments for a six-month
                                     period are received, on average, 3
 months into the period, not at the end.
                                           Because GNMA, pools pay on the

                        IV. Calculation of the Terminations Premium

             Before reporting   the results, a few words about the sources and

     measurement of the data are in order. The period investigated is the

     110 month span covering January 1978        to    April 1981. The discount rates

     are   the yields   on pure   discount   bonds calculated from the decompounded

     point   yields computed by McCulloch (1975).15 The mortgage prices and
                                                                          16
     coupons   are those on GNI4A    pools   trading closest to par.           The time

     interval employed is six months; thus N = 60 for 30 year mortgages.

     The   premia   are calculated by solving equation (3.5).

            Three different terminations schedules are tested. The first two

     are   simply 100 and   200%   experience   on FHP   mortgages   originated since

     1957   (Herzog,   1981, p. 21). The third attempts to incorporate the

     impact of differences between pooi coupon rates and new issue coupon rates

     on the most likely     terminations     schedule.

     Specifically, the schedule varies between 100           and   200%   FH over     time,

     depending on the difference between par (unity) and the price of the pool.17

     When the pool is at par, investors are assumed to expect the pool to

     terminate at 200% FHA.        When the pool is at 0.9 (the lowest price in our

     sample is 0.911), investors are assumed to expect 100%           FHA terminations.

15                                                                  t-k     1 -1/3
     Because the point yields are instantaneous decompounded, (l+y )    (1+y )                in
     equation (3.5) is replaced by e(t_c)1t_Yt/3             We thank Huston McCulloch for
     supplying us with these data.

More precisely, we determine x in equation (2.1) from


               =        - 800.

        Figure 1 contains plots of o based upon the three terminations

 schedules, denoted 100, 200 and VAR   (for   variable). Because the three

series are closely related we shall discuss the VAR series only. The

 o's are very law for the January 1978-September 1978 period, averaging

only 5 basis points. They rise to an average of 25 basis points in the

October 1978-May 1979 period, to Ls7 basis points in the June-September

1979 period, and on to 97 basis points in the October 1979-April 1980

interval. A final increase, to an average of l21 basis points, occurs

in   the July-October 1980 period, with a high of l5Ii basis points in
August. The last six observations show a decrease to 102 basis points.
        We argued above that the primary determinant of changes in the   term-
inations    premium is changes in uncertainty regarding future interest rates.

Given the well-established re1atonship between inflation rates and interest

rates since 1951, the future course of interest rates is heavily dependent

on future inflation rates, as well as monetary policy and other factors

that influence real interest rates.18 In the introduction to this paper,

two pieces of evidence were given for the belief that interest-rate

uncertainty had risen, namely the recent increase in inflation uncertainty

and the reduction in October 1979 in the importance the Federal Reserve

attaches to interest rate stability.


     (1975) and (1977) is most closely associated with the view that
movements in  nominal interest rates have largely been due to changes in the
inflation rate. Hendershott (1981) indicates that this was not the case
in the quarter century prior to 1951. For evidence that real interest
rates have varied significantly since 1951, see Wilcox (1981).

         An   available measure of inflation uncertainty is the standard deviation
   of   one-year inflation forecasts of the participants in the Livingston

   investment survey. The one-year inflation forecasts are measured in early

  June and early December of each year. The       standard   deviation of these

  forecasts (in percentage points), beginning with December 1977 and

  proceeding through December 1980, are 1.15, 1.37, 1.39, 2.09, 1.79,

  2.ui3, and 2.01. The values for June are assumed to hold until the next

  December, and the December values are assumed to be maintained until the

  next June.

         Specification of a continuous variable to reflect the emphasis

  (perceived by market participants) the monetary authorities have placed

  on interest rate stability is difficult. Our basic procedure is to

  examine the width of the target range    for   the Federal funds rate stated

  in open market directives.19 Unfortunately, the range is likely to reflect

  the authorities' perception of interest-rate uncertainty as well as the

  weight the authorities attach to interest-rate stability. For example,

  while the range of the targeted Federal funds rate varied only between

  0.25 and 0.75 percentage points during the mid 1977 to September 18, 1979

  period of relatively stable interest rates, the width of the range given

  at the March 18-19, 197I open market meeting, when short-term rates were

  rising sharply, was a full 1.5 percentage points. Thus it would be a

  mistake to attribute every small change in the width of the band to a

  change in the weight given to interest-rate stability.



19The directives are published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin about 90 clays
  after the open market committee meets.
                                               -21-




          Two   major changes in the width of the band occurred in late 1979
     arid, early 1980. On    October     6, 1979,   the band was raised from 0.5 to
     1+.O percentage points. (The largest previous width was the 1.5 percentage

     points cited above.) Simultaneously the Chairman of the Federal Reserve

     Board announced a change in the implementation of monetary policy whereby

     stability   in   the growth   of   monetary aggregates, rather than nominal interest

     rates, would be emphasized. It seems apparent that the             market's perception
     of interest rate uncertainty should have increased at this time.
                                                                                20

     The band. stayed at Lo percentage points until March 18, 1980, when it was

     increased to 7.0. At the next meeting (April 22, 1980) the band was

     lowered to 6.0, and it varied between this and 5.0 percentage points

     through the end of our estimation period. Because interest rates were

     quite volatile arowid the March 18 meeting - -         the   weekly average funds

     rate increased by 3 percentage points between the weeks ending on March 1

     arid March 29, the increase in the band to 7.0 percentage points may not

     have reflected a change in policy. To test for the impact of the monetary

     policy shift, two dummy variables are tested. The first is zero before

     October 1979 and one thereafter; the second is zero before March 1980

     and one thereafter.

          The regression equations reported in Table 2 support our conjecture

  that changes in uncertainty regarding inflation and real interest rates

  determine the terminations premia. The equations explain 90 percent of


20
 It is noteworthy that the federal funds rate was not especially volatile
 at this time. The weekly average funds rate had increased by only 3/14
 percentage points over the previous five weeks and increased by only 9
 basis points the follcwing week.

given both the crude proxies for the expected variances in inflation and

 in real interest rates and the potential errors in the measurement of

the premia (errors in the measurement of the 's and yts)• All regressors

enter with the expected positive signs and are significantly greater than

zero at the 95 percent confidence level. The 2's and the closeness of

the Durbin-Watson ratios to 2 are consistent with the view that no major

explanatory variables have been omitted.

       The three equations tell basically the same story. When the standard

deviation      of expected inflation was just below unity, the terminations
premia was roughly zero in the pre-October 1979 world. A percentage
point increase in this standard deviation raises the premium by nearly
35 to 40 basis points. The October 1979 shift In monetary policy away
from   narrow interest rate targets raised the premia by nearly 50 basis

points, and an apparent further downgrading of the importance of interest

rate stability in April 1980 increased the premia by another 15 basis

points.

and the difference between the price of the pool and par did not raise

                                   V. Conclusion

       The cost   of   financing housing has risen   relative     to the    cost of

Treasury    borrowing in    recent years. The difference between the coupon

rates on par value, government-insured GNMA        mortgage pools and        a portfolio

of   Treasury   securities   with identical expected cash flows       rose from

5   basis   points in the   first half of   1978 to 125   basis   points in the middle
of 1980, declining only slightly to 100 basis points in early 1981. To
some this might        suggest excess profits to be made; to others, a need

for the expansion of        federal secondary mortgage market      activities.       Neither
Interpretation     is necessarily correct.

       Mortgage coupon rates include terminations         premia to compensate
lenders for expected reductions in effective yields owing to borrowers
repaying faster when interest rates decline and slower when they rise.
Both the likelihood of adverse (to the lender) terminations and                the   cost
of   them   increase with uncertainty regarding future       interest      rates, and
this   uncertainty has risen in recent years. The rise reflects both

greater uncertainty about the inflation premium in Interest rates and a

reduction in the importance the monetary authorities attach to interest

rate   stability. If the relative rise in mortgage coupon rates reflects

solely an increase ii the terminations premia in response to greater interest

rate uncertainty, then there are neither extraordinary opportunities for

profits     nor substantial market imperfections for correction.
       Differences      between GNMA and Treasury coupon rates were calculated

for three alternative mortgage termination schedules. If the mortgage

market is fully integrated with bond markets, then these differences
