Is there a link between loose monetary conditions, credit growth, house price booms, and financial
instability? This paper analyzes the role of interest rates and credit in driving house price booms and
busts with data spanning 140 years of modern economic history in the advanced economies. We exploit
the implications of the macroeconomic policy trilemma to identify exogenous variation in monetary
conditions: countries with fixed exchange regimes often see fluctuations in short-term interest rates
unrelated to home economic conditions. We use novel instrumental variable local projection methods
to demonstrate that loose monetary conditions lead to booms in real estate lending and house prices
bubbles; these, in turn, materially heighten the risk of financial crises. Both effects have become stronger
in the postwar era.

How do monetary and credit conditions affect housing booms and busts? Do low interest
rates cause households to lever up on mortgages and bid up house prices, thus increasing
the risk of financial crisis? And what, if anything, should central banks do about it? Can
policy directed at housing and credit conditions, with monetary or macroprudential tools,
lead a central bank astray and dangerously deflect it from single- or dual-mandate goals?
Such questions suffuse the debate on the causes of and responses to the global financial
crisis.
    Yet while the crisis has passed, finding the answers to these questions still looms
large in the policy challenges facing policymakers and, especially, central banks. In an
effort to de-froth the housing market, the Swedish Riksbank opted for tighter monetary
policy. The Bank of England pondered when to raise rates from current record-low
levels against the backdrop of a booming housing market, especially in London and the
South East, where surges in prices and mortgage lending had in part been fueled by
the government’s Help to Buy scheme. Meanwhile the Norges Bank earned a reprieve
by using new macroprudential tools to cool off a housing boom without cratering the
economy. Canada and Australia survived the 2008 crisis largely unscathed, but so did
their housing booms.
    Central banks face difficult challenges as they try to address multiple goals with few
instruments, as shown by current and past collisions between inflation-output targets and
housing bubble concerns. This paper provides greater empirical detail from the front
lines of these policy conflicts which may guide the new monetary and macro prudential
policy regimes being designed after the recent crisis.
    In this current environment, to say that the recent crisis and its aftermath has led to
a reassessment of the importance of housing finance for the macroeconomy would be a
distinct understatement. Dissecting the sources of house price fluctuations and their effect
on household spending, residential investment, the health of financial intermediaries, and
ultimately on real economic outcomes, has become a top research priority. In addition to
Mian and Sufi’s (2014) influential book, a rapidly growing literature investigates the nexus
between monetary policy and house prices as well as the implications of house price
fluctuations for monetary policy (Del Negro and Otrok 2007; Goodhart and Hofmann
2008; Jarocinski and Smets 2008; Allen and Rogoff 2011; Glaeser, Gottlieb and Gyourko
2010; Williams 2011; Kuttner 2012; Adam and Woodford 2013). The link between monetary
conditions, mortgage borrowing, and house price appreciation has attracted considerable
attention in some quarters (e.g., Leamer 2007; J. Taylor 2007; Bernanke 2010). Many have
wondered whether the low interest rate environment that prevailed in the years before the
2008 crisis contributed to the house price booms experienced in many Western economies
before the recent crash.


                                             1
     House price data are easily available from institutions such as the OECD or the Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas for about 20 advanced economies starting in the mid-1970s, but
are much more scattered for earlier times. The same can be said of mortgage credit data.
As a result, previous research has, with few exceptions such as Bordo and Landon-Lane
(2013) or Reinhart and Reinhart (2011), focused on the decades of the so-called Great
Moderation. But such a limited sample, focused on an historically atypical era of peculiar
macroeconomic and financial tranquility, calls into question the robustness of the research
and the conclusions currently being used as a guide to policy. Housing booms and busts,
just like financial crises, are rare events. In order to gain statistical power one needs much
longer samples, but these data are very difficult to obtain. Our work fills this void.
     This paper analyzes the link between monetary conditions, credit growth, and house
prices using data spanning 140 years of modern economic history across 14 advanced
economies. Such a long and broad historical analysis has become possible by compiling
two datasets, both the result of an extensive multi-year data collection effort. The first
dataset covers disaggregated bank credit data, including real estate lending to households
and non-financial businesses for 17 countries (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2014). The
second dataset, compiled for a study by Knoll, Schularick and Steger (2014), presents
newly unearthed data covering long-run house prices for 14 out of the 17 economies in the
first dataset, from 1870 to 2012. This is the first time both datasets have been combined.
     We make three core contributions. First, we discuss long-run trends in mortgage
lending, home ownership, and house prices and show that the 20th century has indeed
been an era of increasing “bets on the house.” The strong rise in aggregate private debt
over GDP that can be observed in many Western economies in the second half of the 20th
century has been mainly driven by a sharp increase in mortgage debt. Mortgage credit
has risen dramatically as a share of banks’ balance sheets from about one third at the
beginning of the 20th century to about two thirds today. As a result, the intermediation of
savings into the mortgage market has become the primary business of banking, eclipsing
the stylized textbook view of banks financing the capital formation of businesses.
     Second, turning to the cyclical fluctuations of lending and house prices we use novel
instrumental variable local projection methods to show that throughout history loose
monetary conditions were closely associated with an upsurge in real estate lending
and house prices. House prices, interest rates, and credit aggregates may be jointly
determined in equilibrium, and this makes establishing causality difficult. Pairing local
projections with instrumental variable methods allow us to tease out this causal effect,
where we exploit the implications of the well-known policy trilemma in international
macroeconomics (Obstfeld and Taylor 2004). Broadly speaking, when countries peg to
some base currency they effectively import the base economy’s monetary policy, even if it


                                              2
is at odds with home economic conditions. Exchange rate pegs therefore provide a source
of exogenous variation in monetary conditions. By conditioning on a rich set of domestic
macroeconomic controls, we are able to isolate exogenous fluctuations in the short-term
interest rate imported via the peg and trace the effect of these fluctuations over time on
other variables.
    Third, we also expose a close link between mortgage credit and house price booms
on the one hand, and financial crises on the other. Over the past 140 years of modern
macroeconomic history, mortgage booms and house price bubbles have been closely
associated with a higher likelihood of a financial crisis. This association is more noticeable
in the post-WW2 era, which was marked by the democratization of leverage through
housing finance.
    These findings have important implications for the debate about central bank policy
in the aftermath of the crisis: how should policy makers think about the financial stability
risks that stem from extended periods of ultra-low interest rates? How should they
be weighed against the objective of restoring full employment? The long-run historical
evidence uncovered in this study clearly suggests that central banks have reasons to
worry about the side-effects of loose monetary conditions. During the 20th century, real
estate lending became the dominant business model of banks. As a result, the effects
that low interest rates have on mortgage borrowing, house prices and ultimately financial
instability risks have become considerably stronger.
    While these historical insights suggest that the potentially destabilizing byproducts
of easy money must be taken seriously, it is by no means an obvious conclusion that
tighter monetary conditions are always the right answer. From a policy perspective, the
most relevant implication of our study is that central banks must be mindful of these
side-effects and address them, possibly through the greater use of macro-prudential tools.
Macroeconomic stabilization policy has implications for financial stability, and vice versa.
The idea that these two objectives can or should be looked at in isolation is not borne out
by modern macroeconomic history.


                         1.   Old questions, new data
As discussed in the introduction, this study combines two newly assembled historical
datasets. The first dataset covers long-run disaggregated bank credit data for 17 advanced
economies since 1870. It tracks the share of mortgage lending in total bank lending for
most countries back to the 19th century (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2014). Moreover,
for a cross-section of countries, it makes possible to back out the share of bank credit to
businesses and to households. The underlying data come from a broad range of sources,

including economic and financial history studies, journal articles, yearbooks of statistical
offices and central banks, as well as sources from central and private bank archives.
For some countries, the dataset incorporates existing series from economic historians or
statistical offices.
    We combine these historical credit data with a novel dataset covering long-run house
prices for 14 advanced economies from the 19th century until today (Knoll, Schularick,
and Steger 2014). This newly assembled source represents the first major attempt to
construct long-run house price indices for the advanced economies. Relative to previous
studies of long-run trends in house prices, such as Bordo and Landon Lane (2013), it
approximately doubles the number of country-year observations. The dataset reaches
back to the 1870s in the case of Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands,


                                                 4
Norway, and Sweden. Data for the U.S. and the U.K. start in the 1890s and from the early
1900s in the case of Finland, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan. Data for Canada start in
the early 1920s. Compared to previous studies, house price series for the U.K., Japan, and
Switzerland are extended by more than 30 years and for more than 40 years in the case of
Belgium. Relying on more than 60 different sources, the data combine existing indices
with new series constructed on the basis of published and unpublished materials.
    Table 1 summarizes the coverage of the credit and house price data as well as the
principal type of the house price index used. Some caveats are worth discussing. The
construction of historical house price indices entails a number of specific challenges. The
house is a bundle of the structure and the land used in its construction. An ideal index
would capture the appreciation of the price of a standard, unchanging house which is
hard to identify. This makes the construction of house price indices complex and various
methods have been proposed. As a result, the reconstruction of historical house price data
requires a number of concessions between the ideal and the possible. The historical data
vary across countries and time, with respect to the method used for index construction,
and the within-country geographic coverage and the type of dwellings. Some series are
calculated on the basis of list or transaction prices while others rely on appraisal values.
All of these issues may pose a challenge to comparability. However, at present, these data
represent the best possible and most comprehensive basis for an analysis of house prices
in the long run.


          2.   Trends in housing finance, home ownership,
                     and house prices: 1870–2012
Over the last 140 years, the business of banking has gradually evolved from business
loans to mortgages. Figure 1 displays the path of mortgage and non-mortgage lending
(mostly unsecured lending to businesses) relative to GDP from 1870 to the present for the
sample of 17 economies for which we have data (a slightly larger sample than is available
for house prices). It is immediately evident from the graph that mortgage borrowing has
accelerated markedly in almost all advanced economies after WW2. At the beginning
of the 20th century, mortgage credit stood at about 20% of GDP on average. By 2010,
average mortgage credit approached 70% of GDP. Banks and households in the Western
world have been betting the house. This is true even in countries such as Switzerland and
Germany where there has been much less political emphasis and subsidization of home
ownership.
    Figure 2 presents the data disaggregated by country. The figure shows that for
most countries, mortgage lending now accounts for the larger part of bank lending. A

substantial share of the increase in private sector debt levels in the past decades—a process
often referred to as financialization—has been driven by the increase of real estate credit.
Unsecured lending to the business sector has remained largely stable. Non-mortgage
bank lending has hovered in the 40%–50% range as a ratio to GDP on average.
    As a result of these trends, mortgage credit now accounts for nearly three fifths of
the typical balance sheets of banks in advanced economies while only two fifths go to
businesses and consumers for purposes other than the purchase of real estate. From
an economic point of view, this is noteworthy for at least two reasons. First, textbook
models of the banking sector assume that the role of the banking sector is to intermediate
household savings into business investment. This was a useful description of the activities
of the financial sector in the first half of the 20th century, but it is no longer true today.
The banking sector chiefly intermediates savings between households for the purpose of
real estate acquisition. Second, the key economic function of banks no longer seems to
correspond to their business model. The advantage of banks relative to direct financial
intermediation is to reduce information asymmetries through screening and monitoring
of borrowers. However, this function is arguably much more important for business
financing than for standardized mortgage contracts.

    The rise in mortgage credit over the second half of 20th century has financed a
substantial expansion of home ownership in Western economies. Karl Marx noted in Das
Kapital that according to the census of 1861 there were 20 million people living in England
and Wales whereas the number of home owners was given as 36,000. Back then, far fewer
than 1% were among the fortunate who owned property. In our times, the debate about
the top 1% is back, but it is clear that home ownership is distributed much more widely
today with home ownership rates north of 60% (see, e.g., Bonnet et al. 2014).
    By the 1920s home ownership rates in England had already increased to about 20%
from the days of Marx’s writing. In the U.S. and thanks to the 1944 G.I. Bill, home
ownership rates would cross the 50% mark shortly after WW2. Explicit government
policies and generous subsidies to boost home ownership were, by and large, a widespread
phenomenon of the postwar decades. Today the view that home ownership is a key
constituent of national identity is widely shared and supported by growing government
intervention. Figure 3 illustrates this pervasive increase in home ownership.

    The growth of mortgage credit has not only led to an expansion of home ownership, it
has left its mark on house price dynamics. The data collected and analyzed by Knoll (2014)
show that the path of global house prices in the 20th century has not been continuous.
Real house prices, deflated with the consumer price index (CPI), remained stable from
1870 until the middle of the 20th century after which they gradually grew, as Figure 4
shows. Relative to income, house prices initially fell in many countries before stabilizing
or increasing over the past few decades. This is displayed in Figure 5. Over the last 140
years, house prices have risen significantly relative to the price of consumption goods, but
have lagged real income growth.
    Figure 5 also shows that there are large swings in house price to income ratios. Periods
of pronounced increases are often followed by abrupt corrections. Later in the paper we
study if such swings can be explained by changes in credit conditions. In addition, Figure
5 shows that there is considerable heterogeneity in house price trends across economies
that otherwise have similar characteristics and comparable long-run growth performance.
The international experience can be broadly synthesized into three categories. House
prices in Australia have increased more than income since 1870. In contrast, house prices
have lagged income growth by a wide margin in countries such as Belgium, Sweden,
Germany, and the U.S. Finally, for a third group of countries consisting of Canada, the
U.K., Japan and possibly France, house prices have mostly grown on a par with income.


                                3.    A Eurozone parable
What role have monetary conditions played in mortgage credit expansions and house price
booms? Later sections proceed at some length with a formal econometric investigation.
Here we motivate the analysis using a recent dramatic example based on the divergent
macroeconomic and financial outcomes of the core and periphery of the Eurozone.1
    Upon the creation of the Eurozone in 1999, member states signed up to a common
monetary policy administered by the ECB. The loss of monetary policy autonomy was an
extreme version of the trilemma: with capital mobility enforced by treaty within the EU,
and with exchange rates irrevocably fixed by the no-exit feature of the euro, each member
state had no scope to set monetary conditions to suit the outlook for their macroeconomy.
Such a choice might make economic sense under the tradeoffs embodied in the theory of
optimum currency areas (Mundell 1961; Kenen 1969), but it would still be a tradeoff, and
some cost would attach to the sacrifice of monetary autonomy. But how big a cost?
    Absent perfectly synchronized business cycles and frictionless adjustments, common
monetary policy administered by the ECB meant that for some countries monetary

conditions would be “too loose,” whereas for some others they would be “too tight.”
Booming economies would be encouraged to grow, slumping economies to decline,
resulting in greater real economic instability.2
    However, business-cycle models that include an explicit role for the financial sector
suggest that other dangers lurk. If transmission works through the credit channel of
monetary policy, then countries facing excessive monetary ease would see larger credit
booms than normal. Moreover, these effects could be magnified via cross-border capital
flows, and with the possibility that these credit booms could spill over into asset prices,
altogether elevating the risk of financial instability. Prima facie, the events in the Eurozone
in the 1999–2008 pre-crisis phase seem to conform with this narrative.
    Figure 6 shows some salient features of the Eurozone episode. The focus is on two
crisis countries, Ireland and Spain, plus Germany. Before the crisis, Ireland and Spain
had fast-growth economies, credit booms with large increases in mortgage lending, and
rapid housing price increases (in real and nominal terms, and relative to income per
person). After 2008 all of these trends went into sharp reverse, with a banking crisis in
each country, deep depressions and high unemployment, and extremely high levels of
fiscal distress. Quickly worsening fiscal positions arose, driven by lost output and by
banking sector bailout and recapitalization costs. In contrast Germany grew more slowly
in the 1999–2008 period, had no credit, mortgage, or housing booms, and had a more
moderate recession in 2008 soon followed by recovery and a return to growth. Banking
crisis effects were still present in Germany (some banks suffered losses on U.S. subprime
and euro periphery exposures) but these problems were shrugged off and bailout costs
easily absorbed by a fiscal position that started strong and did not deteriorate very much.
    Figure 6, panel (a) shows the interest rate environment of the three countries and it
accords with the standard narrative view of the key mechanisms. Based on a study by
Malkin and Nechio (2012), we show the “optimal” Taylor-rule implied policy interest rates
for the three countries against the actual ECB policy rate for the 1999–2007 period. Given
the rapid output growth and above target inflation in Ireland and Spain, the Taylor rule
policy rate for these economies would have been much tighter, perhaps 500 basis points
(bps) tighter and sometimes more. In contrast, relatively slow growth and low inflation
in Germany meant that its Taylor rule policy rate would have been slightly looser than
that chosen by the ECB, maybe by as much as 100 bps on average. Viewed as a natural
experiment, the question is whether these differences in monetary policy treatment led to
different outcomes in Ireland and Spain using Germany as control.
    Panel (b) of Figure 6 shows that outcomes in the credit markets differed by treatment.

are well known. On the empirical evidence see di Giovanni and Shambaugh (2008).

In Ireland and Spain a large expansion in private debt was driven in large part by the
growth of real estate backed mortgages. The level of mortgage debt to GDP in each
country doubled in the space of about eight years. Meanwhile, the level of mortgage debt
to GDP was stable in Germany over the entire period at about 50% of GDP.
    Panel (c) of Figure 6 shows the very different outcomes in house price trends. The
house price to income ratio was nearly stable in Germany over the entire period, declining
slightly by 20% over the decade. In contrast, house price to income ratios in Ireland and
Spain rose by 65%–75% over the same time frame.
    These data provide some support to the hypotheses, often asserted in analyses of
the Eurozone crisis, that periphery countries experienced an exogenous monetary easing
which went on to fuel credit and housing price boom and bust cycles—ending in economic
crises and output disasters for countries like Ireland and Spain. Yet can we establish a
causal link between monetary conditions on the one hand, and mortgage and house price
boom-bust cycles, as well as financial instability, on the other hand? More to the point,
can we get formal statistical evidence from a large body of empirical macroeconomic
evidence that looks systematically at many episodes over time and space rather than a
case study based on a sample of three countries? The remainder of this paper will try to
answer both of these questions in the affirmative.


     4.    Exogenous perturbations to monetary conditions:
              The trilemma as a natural experiment
Using short-term interest rates as a proxy for monetary conditions, what is the causal
link to mortgages and house prices based on our large sample of macro-financial data
covering the history of advanced economies since 1870? The key empirical hurdle in
answering this question is that home interest rates may be endogenously determined.
Averting simultaneity bias requires identifying movements of the home interest rate that
are not the result of the reaction by local policymakers to domestic economic conditions,
including output, inflation, and the evolution of credit and housing prices.
    The macroeconomic policy trilemma offers a possible solution to the identification
conundrum. This foundational proposition of international macroeconomics states that
a country cannot simultaneously pursue the three mutually incompatible policy goals
of fixed exchange rates, capital mobility, and monetary policy autonomy (Obstfeld and
Taylor 2004). It must give up one of the three goals, or equivalently choose to pursue only
two out of the three. A simple corollary of interest parity, the trilemma has been central
to open economy macroeconomics since the work of Mundell and Fleming, and in the
last decade has seen extensive empirical testing and validation (Obstfeld, Shambaugh,

                                            14
and Taylor 2004, 2005; Aizenman, Chinn, and Ito 2008; Klein and Shambaugh 2013).
    Suppose the home country i at time t has either a fixed (pegged) or flexible (floating)
exchange rate with respect to some other base country. This is denoted by the variable
PEGit = 1 and PEGit = 0, respectively. Suppose the home country i at time t is either open
or closed to international capital markets. This is denoted by the variable KOPENit = 1
and KOPENit = 0, respectively.
    Let rit denote the short-term nominal interest in the home country, and let rit∗ denote
the short-term nominal interest set by policymakers in country i’s base country. Note
that the home country index i is used since base countries differ by i. Furthermore,
changes over the period are denoted ∆rit , and ∆rit∗ , respectively. We denote with Xit a set
of domestic macroeconomic controls used in determining the home interest rate in the
absence of a peg. A simple algebraic expression of the trilemma suitable for our empirical
application sets out the observed change in the home interest rate as a function of the
change in the base country interest rate and the configuration of the exchange rate regime
and capital mobility:

                   ∆rit = a + b[ PEGit × KOPENit × ∆rit∗ ] + ΘXit + uit .                (1)

    To develop intuition, think about two polar cases. In the case of a floating regime
or capital immobility, there need be no correlation at all between home and base rates,
PEGit × KOPENit = 0 and then rit and rit∗ would be completely delinked. In the case of a
truly hard peg with capital mobility dPEGit × KOPENit = 1 and with perfect correlation
(b = 1) then changes in the observed home and base rates, rit and rit∗ would be equalized.
A possible risk premium would be captured by the intercept when a 6= 0, but the simple
theory would entail a perfect pass-through with the coefficient b = 1 in the pegged case.
Other influences on the home interest rate are captured by the controls Xit . The error
term uit is assumed to be well behaved.
    In practice, the dichotomy between fixed and flexible regimes is not as clean and
intermediate regimes muddy the simple story described above. Likewise, capital mobility
may not be properly captured in a binary variable, but rather in by a continuous measure,
as we assume below. The implications for the coefficient b then depend on the nature of
local monetary policy reaction within whatever room for maneuver the regime permits. In
a target-zone model with a home central bank that can “lean against the wind” theoretical
simulations by Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2005) show that the coefficient b may
be below one, but still above zero.
    For our analysis, the trilemma equation (1) provides a method for identifying home
interest rate perturbations that are unrelated to local economic conditions. Base countries,



                                             15
such as the U.S. in the Bretton Woods era, have monetary policy autonomy by definition.
But, as conventionally understood, their authorities would pay no attention whatsoever
to economic conditions in partner countries when making policy choices.
    The examples are legion. Famously, the U.S. decision to raise rates in 1927–28 in
reaction to local asset market conditions imposed stress on the U.K. and other countries
trying to cling to the interwar gold standard. Over a longer period so did the steady tide
of gold reserves flooding into a Banque de France which was all too eager to sterilize
them (Eichengreen 1992; Ahamed 2009; Irwin 2010). At the G-10 Rome meetings in
1971, U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally declared to the world that “the dollar is our
currency, but it’s your problem.” In June 1972 President Richard Nixon expressed the
same sentiment rather more colorfully, caught on the ever-running Watergate tapes, when
he was asked by aide H. R. Haldeman about an incipient currency crisis in Italy and
blurted out his famous response: “Well, I don’t give a shit about the lira.”
    In the final days of Bretton Woods, it was the turn of the U.S. to fall under exchange
rate pressure, but in the dead of the night the German government withdrew its support,
allowing the dollar to fall against the mark, a decision that was later justified by Chancellor
Schmidt with an appeal to the arcane legal doctrine ultra posse nemo obligatur. The same
problem of cooperation under fixed exchange rates resurfaced in the 1992 ERM crisis when,
at the September 5 meeting in Bath, the German Finance Minister Theo Waigel replied
to the repeated pleas of his British counterpart, Norman Lamont, for the Bundesbank to
loosen monetary policy: “My dear Lamont, you have asked that question four times...if
you ask again, I will get our helicopter ready to take us back.”3
    Still today the recurrent mutterings about currency wars in recent years tell the same
story: when considering not just the plight of unilateral dollarizers such as Panama,
Ecuador, or El Salvador, but even the general spillovers from U.S. monetary policy to the
quasi–“dollar bloc” of emerging economies, especially India and China, players on all
sides harbor few illusions that the Fed will shape its interest rate policies to suit conditions
in far away countries.
    In sum, to peg is to sacrifice monetary policy autonomy, at least to some degree. Given
this understanding of the key constraints in past and present international monetary
regimes it is natural for us to treat the term zit = [ PEGit × KOPENit × ∆rit∗ ] on the right-
hand side of equation (1) as an exogenous influence on local monetary conditions in the
home economy, notwithstanding other effects captured by the rest of the terms in the
equation. Thus zit will serve in what follows as the instrumental variable for changes
in home interest rates, and will permit us to identify causal relationships from rates to
mortgage credit and to house prices.

    The formal definition of the instrumental variable zit consists of multiplying the
change in relevant base country short-term interest rate ∆rit∗ by the product of PEGit and
of KOPENit . The peg indicator equals 1 when the home country is pegged to the base
country in both year t and year t − 1. For the sample of countries we study, a description
of the relevant base countries in each historical era is presented in Table 2. Prior to WW2,
peg codings are taken from Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2004; 2005). After WW2
they are gleaned from Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2008) and updates thereto. Prior to
1914 we treat the U.K. as the base for everyone, and after 1945 we treat the U.S. as the base
for everyone, with the exception of EMS/ERM/Eurozone countries for which Germany is
the base after 1973. In the interwar period, the choice of a suitable base country is more
challenging and subjective given the instability of the interwar gold standard period; we
follow Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2004) in using a hybrid “gold center” short-term
interest rate, which is an average of U.S., U.K., and French short term rates depending
on which of the three countries was pegged to gold in a particular year; our results are
not sensitive to this choice and we replicate our findings using any one of these three
countries as the sole interwar base as in Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2004). The
capital mobility indicator is based on the index (from 0 to 100) in Quinn, Schindler, and
Toyoda (2011). We use a continuous version of their index rescaled to the unit interval,
with 0 meaning fully closed and 1 fully open.

Notes: See text and Table 3, panel (a), columns (2) and (3).


    Figure 7 and Table 3 verify that if zit has the potential to be a valid instrument, for all
the reasons given above, then it is certainly not a weak instrument. The scatter plots in
Figure 7 are simple bivariate plots of the change in the home short rate ∆rit against the
putative instrument PEGit × KOPENit × ∆rit∗ , for our panel dataset, looking separately at
both the pre-WW2 and post-WW2 samples. That is, we estimated (1) and no controls Xit ,
as in Panel (a) and Columns (2) and (3) of Table 3, then plotted the data and the line of
best fit. The correlations are seen to be strong; the slope coefficients b in each case are
significant at the 1% level. The F-statistics exceed 15 in all cases, and exceed 60 in the full
sample. The coefficients b in each subsample, and in the full sample, are close to 1/2 rather
than 1, so the pass-through from base to home rates is not one-for-one, but is significant;
these results very closely match those in Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2004; 2005).
    We now move on and the apply the instrumental variable zit to the central estimation
problem in our paper. In a setting like ours, the approach of using exchange rate regimes
to identify exogenous shocks has great promise as a way of estimating policy impacts,
and it builds on several applied works which embrace a similar logic: di Giovanni and
Shambaugh (2008) use the same instrument to look at output volatility in fixed and
floating exchange rate regimes; Ilzetzki, Mendoza and Végh (2013) partition countries
by exchange rate regimes to study the impacts of a fiscal policy shock. In this paper

we use this strategy to gain a clean identification of the workings of the credit channel
and its implications for mortgage and house price booms and busts over the course of
macroeconomic history.


             5.    Instrumental variable local projections
Across different periods in history, countries with fixed exchange regimes often saw
fluctuations in short-term interest rates unrelated to home economic conditions. This
natural pseudo-experiment provides an exogenous source of variation in home short-
term interest rates. This section discusses how we exploit this feature to identify the
dynamic multipliers of mortgages and house prices in response to these pseudo-natural
experiments in the short rate.
    The empirical strategy combines the local projection approach (Jordà 2005) with instru-
mental variable (IV) methods. Recent papers that have used this particular combination
of procedures include Leduc and Wilson (2013) and Owyang, Ramey and Zubairy (2013).
Recall that the data that we will analyze are a long panel of 14 countries observed over
roughly 140 years. However, the panel is not balanced because data availability varies by
country. We explain the details of our dataset in the appendix. Note also that we exclude
the two world wars.
    Let ∆h yit−1 = yit+h − yit−1 denote the response variable of interest, for example, the
change in house prices (measured as the log of the ratio of real house prices to income
per capita) from the base year t − 1 up to year t + h with h = 0, 1, ..., H. The subindex
i denotes the country. Let ∆rit denote the change in the home short-term interest rate,
although in general it refers to any variable whose perturbations we want to trace and for


                                               19
which instruments are available. We denote zit as the instrumental variable introduced in
the previous section and based on whether countries peg their currency to a base country
and impose capital controls or not.
     Next, consider two additional vectors of variables. The vector ∆Wit includes all
the variables in the system observed at time t for country i except for ∆yit (given our
timing convention, this is the first left-hand side variable) and ∆rit , which we explicitly
instrument for. We will discuss the specific variables included in the analysis momentarily.
In addition, the vector ∆Xit−1 contains the lags of all the elements in ∆Wit as well as the
lags of ∆yit and ∆rit . The notation ∆ indicates that the variables in the system are all
expressed as first differences.
     Using these variable definitions, we are interested in estimating the dynamic multi-
pliers of ∆h yit−1 for h = 0, 1, ..., H to an exogenous perturbation in ∆rit . Identification of
this exogenous perturbation is achieved in two ways. First, by using a rich set of controls
to isolate the selection mechanism based on observables. This is done via the auxiliary
vectors ∆Wit and ∆Xit−1 . Specifically, notice that the vector ∆Wit has the same timing as
∆rit . This is intentional, so as to manage the effect of home conditions observed within
the year. The second basis for identification uses the instrumental variable zit for ∆rit to
account for selection based on unobservable factors. In practice, both sets of variables
(controls and instrument) are used in the first stage regression, of course. Below we
discuss the properties of the instrument in the context of this first stage regression.
     Using these variable definitions, the specification of the local projections is

                    ∆h yit−1 = αih + βh ∆rit + ∆Wit Γh + ∆Xit−1 Φh + uit+h ,                (2)

which can be estimated by instrumental variables regression methods using zit as the
additional instrument for ∆rit . The αih are country-fixed effects and in the estimations
below we use country-based cluster-robust standard errors. The dynamic multipliers of
interest are therefore the IV estimates of βh for h = 0, 1, ..., H. We generically designate
these as LP-IV coefficients, short for local projection instrumental variables.
    Estimates of the specification in expression (2) reported below therefore include a
rich set of controls contemporaneously and in the lag structure. The objective is to stack
the odds against our instrument as much as possible in the following sense. We want
to isolate fluctuations in the short-term interest rate that are not explained by home
economic conditions, but rather are correlated with short-term fluctuations in the base
country (in situations where the home economy pegs its currency). Including a rich set of
domestic controls soaks up variation in the base country’s short rate related to the home
economy. This is the best insurance against finding that the estimated responses reflect



                                              20
endogenous fluctuations of the response variable given the data that we have. We will
show momentarily that even with a saturated specification, the instrument remains highly
relevant in most cases.
     A truly exogenous instrument would allow us to estimate the responses without
having to account for observable controls. In this case correlation between the base and
the home economies makes including controls unavoidable. Unfortunately, we are unable
to explicitly test for the exogeneity of the instrument using a test of over-identifying
restrictions. Expression (2) is just-identified. Where appropriate, we report the results
both with and without controls (the latter are provided as a robustness check). Data
availability imposes considerable restrictions on the pre-WW2 sample. As a result, it
is useful to show the results that omit controls but use a longer sample to check the
estimates against those from the more limited sample. Moreover, we also provide (again,
as a robustness check) a comparison of the results based on OLS estimates of expression
(2) to characterize the bias in the OLS estimates.


  6.   Monetary conditions, credit growth, and house prices
Section 2 discussed secular trends in mortgage lending that suggest bank lending experi-
enced a considerable shift toward real estate financing after WW2. This section focuses
instead on short-run fluctuations. Our instrument captures movements in short-term
interest rates relative to movements that would have likely prevailed under a floating
exchange regime and full control of domestic monetary policy.
    Our analysis proceeds logically in sequential steps. First, we examine how persistently
exogenous perturbations propagate to short-term interest rates. The rational expectations
hypothesis of the term structure suggests that expectations on future short-term rates,
adjusted for risk, drive longer term-rates. Therefore, next we trace how short-term
rate fluctuations reverberate to long-term rates. Long-term rates tend to be very highly
correlated with mortgage rates and therefore provide a good proxy measure for the price
of mortgages (for which we do not have direct observations). Thus, we examine how
the quantity of mortgages (normalized by GDP) responds to our pseudo-experiment.
Ultimately, the availability of credit makes home buying more accessible. Higher demand
for houses through cheaper financing tends to put upward pressure on home prices. The
last link in the chain of events thus consists of characterizing the response of house prices
to the shock in the short-term rate.

6.1.   The instrument is relevant
As a first check, we evaluate the strength of the instrument introduced in Section 4 in the
context of expression (2). We estimate the first stage regression of ∆rit on zit and the other
regressors in expression (2) including country-fixed effects. Then we report the F-statistic
for the coefficient on zit constructed with country-based, cluster-robust standard errors.
We note that since we only have one endogenous regressor, typical tests of instrument
relevance, such as Kleibergen and Paap’s (2006) rank test, are roughly equivalent to the
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust Wald tests from OLS in the first stage. Due
to gaps in data availability, we obtain different estimates of the Kleibergen and Paap
(2006) statistic when we report our response estimates in Table 5 below (and later when
we report robustness checks). We provide here simple first stage regression results to
illustrate the instrument’s basic features.
    The four response variables of interest include: (1) the short-term interest rate; (2)
the long-term interest rate; (3) the ratio of mortgage loans to GDP; and (4) the log ratio
of house prices to per capita income. When these variables are used as a left-hand side
variable in expression (2), we take the h-difference ∆h yit−1 described earlier. When the
variables enter as controls, these variables enter as simple first differences. All of these
variables are measured in percent change to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
    Additional controls include: (i) the growth rate of real GDP per capita; (ii) the CPI
inflation rate; (iii) the investment to GDP ratio; (iv) the ratio of non-mortgage lending to
GDP; and (v) the ratio of the current account to GDP. We include up to two lags of each
variable in the vector ∆Xit−1 . In what follows we report the βh coefficients in expression
(2) but omit estimates of the fixed effects and the control set for brevity. We implement
the analysis for the full sample and later as a robustness check, we split the sample at
World War 2. In Section 2 we argued that the major developments in mortgage lending
took place starting in the second half of the twentieth century.
    Table 4 reports first-stage regression results. The short rate is regressed on our
instrument ∆zit . We report two regressions. In the first block of results (columns 1–3)
we omit the controls, in the second block (columns 4–6) we include them. The reason is
that the sample sizes can vary quite a bit. Some of the controls are not available for some
countries, specially in the first part of the sample. We consider three samples: all years,
and the pre- and the post-WW2 years. In all cases we omit the world wars.
    The results in Table 4 provide tangible intuition about the strength of the instrument.
The instrument is relevant, although a bit weaker in the pre-WW2 era (columns 2 and 5).
Even after adding a very rich set of controls and fixed effects (columns 4–6), the instrument
remains significant across samples with high F-statistics (and hence significant coefficient

estimates). The pass-through of fluctuations in the instrument onto the short-term rate
ranges as high as 0.8 (column 1) to 0.3 (column 2), which is economically sensible. Thus,
the intuition from the scatter plots in Section 4 is well supported by the more formal
analysis reported in the table.


6.2.    Estimates of the impulse responses
Table 5 reports estimates of the LP-IV coefficients in expression (2) for each of the response
variables (1)–(4) described in the previous section. The perturbation is to the short rate via
the instrument, the responses reported are of the short and long rates, mortgage loans as
a ratio to GDP and house prices over per capita income, all of them in percent. The table
is organized as follows. For each response we report coefficient estimates of the LP-IV
coefficient using all years except the two world wars. Below we check for robustness to
different subsamples. In addition, we report summary regression statistics along with the
Kleinbergen and Paap (2006) test of weak instruments.
    In addition, Figure 8 contains four panels that display each of the four impulse
responses reported in the table. The experiment depicted in these panels is a negative one
percent decline in the short rate due to exogenous fluctuations in the instrument. We
use this normalization so as to more closely characterize the recent experience of several

countries in the periphery of the Eurozone and described in Section 3. However, notice
that the table reports the coefficient estimates directly from the regression output, which
have the natural interpretation of a positive type of experiment instead. In other words,
we flip the sign of the coefficient estimates from the table to construct the figure. We
comment on the results for each variable, one at a time, starting with the response of the
short rate to exogenous perturbations captured by the instrument. The results correspond
to the first row block in Table 5 and panel (a) in Figure 8.


                                                24
    These results include country-specific cluster-robust standard errors. Clustering by
country allows for fully flexible time series dependence in the errors within country blocks.
Typical heteroscedasticy-and-autocorrelation (HAC) robust estimation procedures impose
non-parametric, monotonically declining temporal dependence. If these conditions are
met and if assumptions about the rate at which this dependence rate decays are also
correct, a HAC estimator provides a more efficient approach to correct inference. Relying
on clustering alone is more general than using a HAC estimator. However, cluster-robust
standard errors tend to be more conservative. Rather than a flaw, we view this as an
advantage. By showing that our estimates are significantly different from zero using
correct (but more conservative) standard errors, we provide the reader an extra degree of
insurance against spurious findings.
    Year zero is the year when the shock is felt and the coefficient is therefore automatically
normalized to one percent (for this reason we omit reporting standard errors and the R2 ,
which is equal to one). This will be the size of the perturbation with which to interpret
subsequent responses. The effect of this perturbation is persistent and hump shaped.
Years one thru three indicate that much of the effect on the short-term interest rate remains
intact. Only in year four do we see the effect subsiding.
    The persistence of the short rate response sets the stage for the analysis of the response
of the long rate reported in the second row block of Table 5 and panel (b) of Figure 8. The
responses dampen relative to the short rate responses in a pattern entirely consistent with
what is commonly found in the literature on term structure models (see, e.g., Evans and
Marshall 1998). Recall that the response of the short-rate is somewhat persistent and this
gets reflected in the persistent increase in the long rate, albeit with a pass through that is
initially about one-half the initial perturbation to the short rate but growing over time.
    The response of the long rate sets the stage for the analysis of the response of mortgage
loans to GDP ratio. As we argued earlier, the long rate is a reasonable proxy for the
mortgage rate and the responses reported in the third row block of Table 5 and panel (c)
of Figure 8 bear this out. An exogenous one percent decrease/increase in the short rate
results in about one-half percent decrease/increase in the long rate and on impact, on
an increase/decrease in mortgage loans to GDP of about one half percent. However, the
dynamic pattern indicates that the effect of the initial perturbation keeps building over
time, and by year four there is about a three percent increase/decrease in mortgage loans
as a ratio to GDP.
    It would be natural to expect that, as the prices of mortgages decline/increase and
hence mortgage loan activity increases/declines, house prices would correspondingly
increase/decline. The fourth row block of Table 5 and panel (d) in Figure 8 show that
this is indeed the case. The initial 1 percent perturbation to the short-rate translates to

                                                                  26
about a 0.18 percent change in the house price to income ratio in Year 0. Like in the case
of mortgage lending, the effect of the initial perturbation keeps building over time. By
year four the effect on the house price to income ratio is over 4 percent in magnitude.
    Summarizing the results so far: a long historical view across developing economies
allows us to use variation in exchange rate regimes over time and across countries to
extract home fluctuations in short rates whose origin is dictated not by domestic conditions,
but rather by conditions in the base country against whose currency the exchange rate is
pegged. It is reasonable to suspect that pegs are endogenously determined. Even if they
are not, there could still be considerable synchronicity of economic activity between the
base and home countries. To purge for these effects, we include a rich set of controls that
capture economic conditions in the home country.
    The pairing of instrumental variables with saturated regression control is the best
guarantee that the short rate perturbations we examine are exogenous given the data that
we have. The analysis reveals that an exogenous decline in the short rate will result in a
considerable increase in house prices. This decline does not appear to be spurious. The
intermediate steps linking the short rate decline with a decline in the long rate and hence
an increase in mortgage lending activity are all consistent with this result.
    A potential concern, as with any panel data study, is that our historical dataset
intertwines the experiences of countries with varied economic structures. Three responses
should assuage such concerns. First, the sampling distribution of the impulse response
estimates, itself a summary statistic of the heterogeneity in the data, indicates that our
estimates have relatively contained dispersion. Second, using our historical dataset, Gadea-
Rivas, Gómez-Loscos and Pérez-Quirós (2014) show that there is more heterogeneity across
time than there is across countries. Third, one of the robustness checks we provide is a
detailed subsample analysis that shows that our findings are very stable to using data
from different historical eras.
    Another potential concern, despite the many precautions that we adopt in the analysis,
is that our results are driven by reverse causality. That is, could it be that a surge in
the demand for housing explains the behavior of house prices mortgages and interest
rates? We think that this mechanism can be easily ruled out. A surge in demand for
housing would put simultaneous pressure on house prices and mortgages, which would
translate into higher, not lower interest rates. For this reason, we feel reasonably confident
that we have identified the correct channel linking a low interest rate environment with
higher mortgage activity and house price appreciation. Our analysis provides a precise
quantification of all these effects. In the next section we evaluate the robustness of these
initial conclusions.

                                   7.   Robustness
This section examines the reliability of the conclusions reached in the previous section
to a variety of modifications in the analysis. We begin by exploring the benefits of
the instrumental variable approach. Would the responses look much different had we
estimated expression (2) by OLS? The answer turns out to be yes and we provide a
comparison across methods to assess the extent of the attenuation bias that IV estimation
alleviates. Next, some of the variables in the dataset do not extend quite as far and
wide. This limitation results in a smaller sample available for estimation. Consequently,
we re-estimate Table 5 but omit the controls so as to evaluate whether a larger sample
could significantly change the results. As we will show, the estimates remain fairly stable
considering that we omit an important set of controls. Finally, we consider the robustness
of the analysis to different subsamples. Would the results still hold up if we focus on
the pre- versus the post-WW2 eras? What about omitting the Bretton Woods era of fixed
exchange rates? These and other alternatives are investigated below.


7.1.   OLS versus IV
How useful is our instrumental variable? Table 6 provides a direct comparison of the IV
estimates reported in Table 5 with estimates obtained using OLS in expression (2). For
brevity, we do not report estimates of the country-fixed effects or the control set. We omit
the general regression statistics and focus exclusively on the coefficient estimates and
their standard errors. The table is organized into four row blocks, one for each of the
response variables we have considered so far.
    The general patterns of the responses are similar across methods but the coefficient
estimates from OLS are greatly attenuated with respect to their IV counterparts. The
OLS response of the short and long rates is between a third and one half the response
calculated using IV. Not surprisingly, the response of mortgage lending is more muted,
although here the degree of attenuation is much more noticeable. Nevertheless, these
three responses are estimated fairly accurately and the broad contours of the analysis
from the previous section would survive largely intact.
    On the other hand, the response of house prices varies more noticeably. First, based
on OLS the coefficient of the response during years zero and one are positive. This means
that in response to a decline in the short rate (and a companion decline in the long rate
and an increase in mortgage lending) house prices actually increase (albeit not significantly
from the statistical point of view). Here the OLS bias not only attenuates the coefficient
but it switches the sign and generates a response that is economically counterintuitive.

The signs are correct for years two to four although again, the coefficient estimates are
considerably attenuated relative to their IV counterparts. Compare the −0.90%year four
response using OLS versus the −4.37% response obtained with IV. We conclude from this
analysis that our instrument is capturing movements in the short rate that are more likely
to reflect exogenous fluctuations than fluctuations we could identify using a simple OLS
regression control strategy.


7.2.    Responses when controls are excluded
The identification strategy rests on two pillars: the instrumental variable and a rich set of
controls to purge possible common base and home economic factors driving fluctuations in
the instrument. In a classical instrumental variable setting, a truly exogenous instrument

would be sufficient to address bias induced by omitted controls. As a robustness check,
we therefore reestimate the responses reported in Table 5 but omitting all controls except
the country fixed effects. Omitting the controls results in a considerably larger sample,
which also serves as an additional robustness check.
     Table 7 replicates Table 5 but excludes the controls ∆Wit and ∆Xit−1 from expression
(2). The table is organized into four row blocks, just as Table 5. The results reported in
Table 7 are broadly comparable to those in Table 5. The response of interest rates, both
short- and long-term are in fact virtually indistinguishable. The response of mortgage
lending is similar but more attenuated. Four years out the cumulative effect is −1.41 when
controls are omitted versus −2.82 when controls are included. Similarly, the response of
house prices at year four is −2.96 when controls are excluded, versus −4.37 when controls


                                                30
are included. Another way to interpret these results is in the context of the OLS versus
IV comparison of Table 6. The attenuation bias we described in the previous section is
largely resolved by using IV estimation.


7.3.   Robustness to sample choices
The final set of robustness checks explores different ways to partition the sample and to
construct the instrument. We consider five alternative scenarios. The analysis in Section 2
suggests that the share of total lending dedicated to mortgage lending began its ascent
at the end of World War 2. A natural exercise is to examine the sensitivity of our results
to partitioning the sample before and after World War 2. Call them scenarios (1) and (2).
Next, we assess the sensitivity of the results to our construction of the instrument. We
do this in two ways: by treating the Bretton Woods era as non-instrumented; and more
drastically, by excluding this period entirely from the sample. Call these scenarios (3) and
(4). Finally, the interwar period is particularly volatile (it includes the Great Depression).
As a final check, we re-estimate the responses using a sample that excludes the period
1914to 1972, that is, also excluding the Bretton Woods era. Call this scenario (5). In order
to economize space, we report only the coefficients of each response in year four along
with summary regression statistics.
     Table 8 replicates baseline results from the full sample in year 4 from Table 5. These
results are reported in column (0), which serves as a benchmark for each of the five
scenarios just described and reported in columns (1)-(5). Several results deserve comment.
Except for the pre-WW2 results reported in column (1), the stability of our findings across
experiments is quite notable. The response of the short and long rates vary over a very
narrow range of about 0.1 to 0.15 percentage points. The variation in the responses to
mortgage lending and house prices is a little wider, but so are the responses themselves.
In the case of mortgage lending, the response varies from -2.67 to -3.47 and in the case of
house prices it can vary from -4.37 to -5.88. These ranges of variation are in any case quite
a bit smaller than the 95% confidence intervals implied by estimates themselves. Pre-WW2
responses are more volatile, in part because the sample has more gaps, in part because it
contains the more volatile interwar period (which includes the Great Depression), and
in part because the role of mortgage lending (and the behavior of credit more generally)
changed around the end of World War 2. Nevertheless, even the results in column (1) do
not stray far from the results in column (0) or those in columns (2)-(5), which is reassuring.

    8.   Mortgage lending, house prices and financial crises
Section 6 showed that loose monetary conditions make credit cheaper, purchasing a home
easier, and therefore houses more expensive. One of the narratives of the recent global
financial crisis puts at its center a similar mechanism, see e.g. Mian and Sufi (2010, 2014).
     Yet alternative narratives for the global financial crisis have emerged too. Some
emphasize the role of excessive sovereign debt (e.g., Reinhart and Rogoff 2010, 2012),
and others the interplay between private and public debt (e.g., Jordà, Schularick and
Taylor 2013b). Fears that the sovereigns will be unable to absorb losses in the banking
sector can put into question the solvency of the sovereign itself. This fear quickly spreads
to banks with substantial holdings of public debt, setting in motion what some call a
“diabolical loop” (e.g., Brunnermeier et al. 2011). Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2013b)
found that crises are driven primarily by private credit rather than public debt, although
their aftermath is certainly influenced by the level of public debt existing at their inception.
     When it comes to financial crises, a growing consensus emphasizes the role of excessive
private debt (see, e.g., Borio and White 2004; Schularick and Taylor 2012; Gourinchas
and Obstfeld 2012; Jordà, Schularick and Taylor 2013a). Moreover, some recent research
has focused attention on the role played households’ mortgage debt (Mian and Sufi 2010,
2014; Büyükkarabacak and Valev 2010), and in this paper we expand on these ideas by
looking at the interaction between booms in housing debt that coincide with house price
bubbles using the new long-run data introduced earlier.
     This section explores these questions in historical perspective. Because financial crises
are rare, we reach back in history and across a wide cross section of developed economies
to examine the role that mortgage lending and house prices have exerted on the likelihood
of experiencing a financial crisis. The chronology of financial crises relies on the dates
available in Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2013a) and the sources cited therein.
     The dependent variable is binary and takes the value of 1 if for a given country-year
pair there is a financial crisis, and it is zero otherwise. The two explanatory variables
that we consider, mortgage lending as a ratio to GDP and house prices as a ratio to per
capita income, enter as five year moving averages to parsimoniously capture conditions
in the lead up to the crisis. In addition we include country fixed effects. On average,
some countries have been more prone to financial crises than others and the fixed effects
account for these differences. Our goal is not to thoroughly examine every possible factor
and specification that may determine when a financial crisis will happen. Rather we
simply want to document the link between housing finance and financial crises.
     Methodologically, we rely on classification methods rather than evaluating model
fit. We are interested in evaluating the ability to sort into crisis versus no crisis events


                                              33
rather than in evaluating whether the conditional probability of a crisis is appropriately
characterized by the model. The emphasis is on the informational content of the controls,
not on the correct specification of the model. In other words, we are interested in knowing
whether tomorrow will rain or not (a crisis will happen or not) in order to decide whether
to carry an umbrella or not (take policy action that is costly but may prevent the crisis).
We rely on a well-established literature in biostatistics and machine learning to provide
suitable answers.
    We approach the problem in two simple steps. First we fit a logit model of the crisis
dependent variable using the mortgage and house price moving average controls as well as
fixed effects. The model specification only acts as a tool to find suitable linear combinations
of the controls whose informational content we then evaluate. Using predictions from this
model, we then calculate true positive and true negative rates as follows. Consider the rule
that calls a crisis whenever the predicted conditional probability from the logit exceeds
a threshold c ∈ [0, 1]. This threshold need not be 0.5, in fact, it is allowed to vary. The
true positive rate is the proportion of correctly called crises associated with any c and the
true negative rate is the proportion of correctly called non-crises instead. Choose a c close
to 1 and the true negative rate approaches 1 but the true positive rate deteriorates. The
opposite happens when c tends to zero. Given a classification technology, one can allocate
information to predict one outcome or the other in different proportions depending on
where the emphasis is needed.
    The map of the true positive and true negative rates for each c ∈ [0, 1] is a curve that
Jordà and Taylor (2011) denote the correct classification frontier (CCF) in reference to the
classic economic concept of a production possibilities frontier. The better the classification
technology, the further is this curve from the origin. A perfect classifier is one whose CCF
is the unit square. By contrast, a classifier that is no better than random chance has a
CCF equivalent to the diagonal bisecting the unit square. The area under the CCF is a
measure of the model’s classification ability and is equivalent to the area under the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve or AUC, used frequently in biostatistics to evaluate
medical tests (see, e.g. Pepe 2003 for a survey). The AUC for an uninformative classifier
is readily seen to be equal to 0.5 (half the area of the unit square) whereas for the perfect
classifier on the unit square it is 1. The AUC turns out to have an asymptotic Gaussian
distribution, which makes this statistic convenient for hypothesis testing.
    Table 9 summarizes the main results of this exercise for the full sample, and for
robustness, the pre- and post-WW2 samples. The table is organized as follows. The top
row-block shows the coefficient estimates whereas the bottom row-block provides each
model’s AUC and a test of the null hypothesis that the AUC from the model is statistically
equivalent to a benchmark AUC. The benchmark AUC is constructed using a model with

fixed effects but no covariates. In addition Figure 9 displays the CCF curve associated
with the full sample results to provide a visual comparison of the CCF for the models
with and without covariates.
     The broad picture painted by these results is that mortgage lending and house prices
have information about the likelihood of a financial crisis but that this information is
clearly insufficient to generate a perfect prediction of financial crises. The numerical
values of the coefficient estimates reported in the top row block of Table 9 are themselves
of little interest. They are reported to illustrate the relative significance of the controls in
the full sample specification. Loadings for the pre-WW2 sample are similar as those in
the full sample although in the post-WW2 the loadings appear to be both on mortgage
lending and house prices.
     Nevertheless, there is non-negligible information in these covariates. The null bench-
mark AUC, from a model with fixed effects but no other covariates, is only 0.56. This is
not significantly different from the reference AUC of 0.5 for a completely uninformative
classifier. The interpretation is that, although there are differences in the rate of crises

experienced across countries, these differences are small. AUCs from the benchmark
model range from a low of 0.67 in the full and pre-WW2 samples, to a high of 0.71 for the
post-WW2 sample, which is statistically different from the benchmark. As a complement,

    What is the takeaway? Our historical analysis at business-cycle frequency outlines
how accommodative monetary conditions can be accompanied by more mortgage lending
and higher house prices. Both of these variables have been touted as possible factors in
a financial crisis and our historical analysis using crisis prediction models suggests that
there is some truth to this view. Moreover, we once more find evidence that these effects
have become stronger with the rapid rise of real estate lending in the second half of the
20th century.

                                   9.   Conclusion
The global financial crisis brought to the fore trends in housing markets that had been
brewing over the decades following WW2, a break from the relative stability of the pre-
WW2 era. A mixture of financial liberalization, government support, risk taking by banks,
and levering up by households brought about greater rates of home ownership across
the developed world. Disentangling the importance of these various forces, which surely
varied by time and place, is a difficult goal for future research, and is beyond the scope of
this paper. Yet the rise of leveraged real estate booms has been identified by much recent
research as being central to the understanding of financial crises. After presenting this
historical evidence, this paper makes two key contributions to the understanding of the
link between monetary conditions, mortgage credit and house prices.
    We use fluctuations in monetary conditions that have their origin in macroeconomic
conditions elsewhere as a natural experiment. Such fluctuations serve as instrumental
variables to trace dynamic responses of mortgage lending and house prices. At business
cycle frequencies, we find robust evidence in support of a direct mechanism linking short-
term rates, mortgage lending and house prices. Through the term structure, long-term
rates respond to short-term rates, thus affecting the price of mortgages. In response to
easing monetary conditions and hence a decline in the price of mortgages, mortgage
lending expands. Rising house prices improve the value of the mortgage’s collateral, and
with it a bank’s asset position and its ability to lend further. Loose monetary conditions are
causal for mortgage and house price booms, and this effect has become much more dramatic since
WW2.
    It is natural to suspect that such a feedback loop could set in motion conditions for a
housing boom and increased leverage, which in turn heightens the risk of a financial crash
down the road. The long run view from economic history suggests that such mechanisms
are a regular feature of the modern financial cycle, and we use statistical methods from
the literature on binary classifiers to explore this question. Using logit models, the correct
classification frontier, and tests based on the area under the curve, we find that over
a 5-year window run ups in mortgage lending and run ups in house prices raise the
likelihood of a subsequent financial crises. Mortgage and house price booms are predictive of
future financial crises, and this effect has also become much more dramatic since WW2.
    What are the implications of these findings for the ongoing debate about monetary
policy in the post-crisis age? How much should central banks worry about the financial
stability risks of loose monetary conditions? Our findings suggests the side-effects of
easy low interest rates should be cause for some concern. Real estate lending has grown
strongly during the 20th century and now accounts for the dominant share of bank


                                             37
lending in many countries; the sensitivity of mortgage lending and house prices to
changes in monetary conditions has also increased substantially. A key implication of
this result is that central banks cannot pursue macroeconomic stabilization policy without
being mindful of the consequences for credit markets and financial stability. However,
none of this should be taken to imply that that tighter monetary conditions are the
right answer. The findings from our study call for a nuanced approach. Central banks
should acknowledge that the trade-offs they face can potentially be managed through
greater use of macro-prudential tools. Macroeconomic history refutes the notion that the
joint objectives of macroeconomic stabilization and financial stability can be examined in
isolation.
