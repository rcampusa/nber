                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate the impact of the extensity of macroprudential policies on the correlation of the
policy interest rates between the center economies (CEs, i.e., the U.S., Japan, and the Euro area),
and the peripheral economies (PHs). We find a more extensive implementation of
macroprudential policies would lead PHs to (re)gain monetary independence from the CEs when
the CEs implement expansionary monetary policy; when PHs run current account deficit; when
they hold lower levels of international reserves; when their financial markets are relatively
closed; when they are experiencing an increase in net portfolio flows; and when they are
experiencing credit expansion.

1. Introduction

       Emerging market economies are vulnerable to changes in the financial and economic

conditions of the center economies (CEs). As Rey (2015) argues, global financial liberalization

has made economies in the peripheries (PHs) vulnerable to the “global financial cycles” in

capital flows, asset prices, and credit growth. According to this view, exchange rate regimes no

longer insulate countries from global financial cycles, so that the famous “monetary trilemma,”

or just “trilemma” – countries can only achieve the full extent of implementation in two, not all,

of the three open macro policy goals: monetary independence, exchange rate stability, and free

capital mobility – reduces to a dilemma, or an “irreconcilable duo,” of monetary independence

and capital mobility. Consequently, restricting capital mobility maybe the only way for non-

center countries to retain monetary autonomy.

       Aizenman, et al. (2016, 2017b) investigate whether Rey’s view, the end of the trilemma

hypothesis, is supported by the data, and conclude that the trilemma is not dead yet; policy

arrangements based on the trilemma do affect the extent of financial linkage between the CEs

and the PHs. Many others, such as Obstfeld (2015), Obstfeld, et al. (2005), and Shambaugh

(2004), find evidence for the validity of the trilemma.

       While the trilemma is not dead, it is true that open economies are subject to ebbs and

flows of capital that are heavily influenced by the state of economic and financial conditions of

the CEs. That means, policy makers in the PHs need to manage open macro policy to prevent

financial instability while being constrained by the trilemma. As Aizenman (2017) put it, we may

now live in a world of “quadrilemma” where financial stability have been added to the fourth

policy goal.




                                                 1
         In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, some emerging market

countries, such as Korea, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, and Thailand, implemented a series of

macroprudential policies to ensure financial stability. 4 These policies were generally aimed at

building resilience against potential capital flow reversals and other associated financial risks. 5

These recent implementations of macroprudential policies have led to a rise in the literature that

investigates the efficacy of macroprudential policies such as Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey

(2017), Buch and Goldberg (2017), Cerutti, et al., (2017a,b), Fendoglu (2017), Ghosh, et al.

(2014, 2015, 2018), Lim, et al. (2011), Ostry, et al. (2012), and many others. 6

         This paper will be an addition to this literature. This study focuses on the link between

the CEs and the PHs through policy interest rates and examine whether and to what extent this

financial link can be influenced by a set of macroprudential instruments. In other words, we

investigate whether macroprudential policies are effective for the PHs to delink themselves from

the sphere of influence of the CEs and maintain monetary autonomy. This study should provide

more clues on how to navigate the world of quadrilemma. 7

(2017).

  Macroprudential policies predate those implemented in the aftermath of the GFC. An oft-cited example is Chile’s
unremunerated Reserve Requirement (URR) on foreign borrowing. RR was also implemented by Germany and
other western European countries in the 1970s to curb capital inflows. For a historical overview of regulatory
attempts to control capital flows, refer to Gosh, et al. (2018).
6
  While the papers mentioned in the text conduct cross-country analyses, recently, there are many papers that use
detailed, microeconomic data to examine the effectiveness of specific macroprudential policies in a particular
country. This type of studies includes Acharya et al. (2018), Auer and Ongena (2016), Barroso et al. (2017), Camors
et al. (2019), Epure et al. (2018), and Jimenez et al. (2017).
7
  A possible interpretation of financial instability deals with the presence of multiple equilibria associated with
financial fragility. Such financial fragility may reflect concerns regarding the commitment and fiscal viability of
policies needed to prevent a run on the banking system in the presence of balance sheet exposure. Bocola and
Lorenzoni (2017) provide an insightful model illustrating and explaining these issues in the context of EMs
characterized by limited credibility of their fiscal backstop mechanisms. Their framework implies that the “state of
fundamentals” (like fiscal space, growth rates, etc.) determines the existence and multiplicity of equilibria. If the
fundamentals are very strong, the private sector does not have the incentive to “run on the system,” and the regime is

                                                          2
         This study differs from other studies that investigate the efficacy of capital controls.

Unlike traditional capital controls, the primary goal of macroprudential policies is to ensure

financial stability by implementing policies aimed at affecting the balance sheets of both

financial institutions and borrowers and targeted at certain sectors, typically corporate and

mortgage sectors. Macroprudential policies can smoothen out excessive procyclical movements

in financial markets (e.g., rapid growth in credit and liquidity, procyclical capital adequacy, and

excessive leverages) and thereby help prevent accumulation of systematic risk and preempt an

occurrence of financial crisis.

         Capital controls (which in our lexicon is inversely related to financial openness) are

typically meant to affect aggregate cross-border transactions irrespective of sector. Or, more

precisely, they are aimed at affecting the balance of payments. Hence, capital controls are not

usually varied in response to the business cycle. 8 How open a country wants to have financial

account transactions is often driven by the government’s industrial policy and financial

regulatory framework.

         Thus, macroprudential policies can be regarded as a set of policy tools to pursue financial

stability independent from the three policies in the trilemma while it could also help countries

retain monetary autonomy from the CEs. 9 Investigating empirically whether this is true will be



stable. If the fundamentals are very weak, the private sector attacks the system, and the regime collapses. In between
the very strong and the weak equilibria, a range of multiple equilibria exist. Under certain conditions, policies like
credible deposit insurance, large-enough accumulation of international reserves, macro prudential policies reducing
balance sheet exposure, or the provision of hard currency swap lines may prevent the exposure to multiple equilibria
by terminating the incentive to run. Earlier examples of such systems include Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and
Obstfeld (1996).
8
  However, revenues from imposing levies on cross-border capital flows can have some impacts on the fiscal
conditions. Capital controls might also enable, either intentionally or unintentionally, financial repression whereby
which the government can secure additional fiscal resources.
9
  In the world of the quadrilemma, ensuring financial stability inevitably affect the other three policy goals including
monetary autonomy. For more details, refer to Aizenman (2017).

one of the main contributions of this paper. We examine whether and to what extent

implementing a set of macroprudential policies would complement countries’ open macro policy

management that is dictated by the monetary trilemma.

         Our empirical method relies upon a two-step approach. We first investigate the extent of

sensitivity of policy interest rate while controlling for global factors. The estimation is done for

each of the sample countries and for each of the three-year panels of the period 1986 through

2015, using monthly data. Next, we examine the association of these sensitivity coefficients with

the extensity of macroprudential policy implementations while controlling for country’s

trilemma choices, the real and financial linkages with the CE, the levels of institutional

development, and the like.

         In what follows, we present the framework of our main empirical analysis in Section 2.

Each of the two steps for the estimation is explained in this section. In Section 3, we present

empirical results for the estimations while focusing on the effect of macroprudential policies. In

Section 4, we investigate the interactive effects between macroprudential policies and

macroeconomic conditions and policies. We make concluding remarks in Section 5.



2    The Framework of the Main Empirical Analysis

         We extend the same approach as followed in Aizenman et al. (2016, 2017), with special

focus on the macroprudential policies as one of the potential determinants of the financial link

between the CEs and the PHs. As the first step, we regress the policy interest rate of the PHs on

those of the CEs while controlling for global factors. 10


10
  Ideally, estimation should also control for domestic factors (as the Taylor rule estimation would suggest). In one
of our earlier papers (Aizenman, et al., 2017b), we did control for a domestic factor by including the growth rate of
industrial production. We also tested the robustness by including the rate of inflation. In neither case, were the
distribution of the estimated gammas significantly affected. Since including the growth rate of industrial production

                                                          4
         Once we get the estimated coefficients of the CEs’ policy interest rates, which we treat as

the variable for the degrees of financial sensitivity, as the second step, we regress the estimated

degree of sensitivity on potential determinants, including sample countries’ macroeconomic

conditions or policies, real or financial linkage with the CEs, the level of institutional

development of the countries, and the extensity of macroprudential policies. If macroprudential

policies can affect the extent of monetary independence in a way that they help economies of our

concern to retain monetary independence, the estimated coefficient should be significantly

negative.



2.1 The First-Step: Estimating Sensitivity Coefficients

         The main objective of this first step estimation is to estimate the correlation of the policy

interest rates between the CEs and peripheral economy i, while controlling for global factors. We

regress the policy interest rate of peripheral economy i ( Yit ) on the vector of the policy interest

rates of the three CEs, i.e., the U.S., the Euro area, and Japan, as shown in (1). If country i has its

monetary policy more susceptible to the monetary policy of one (or more) of the CEs, the

correlation of the policy interest rates between the CEs and PHs should be significantly positive,

implying a closer linkage between the CEs and PHs, and also that the PH of concern has less of

monetary autonomy.

         We focus on the estimated coefficient 𝛾𝛾�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶 (where C = US, EURO, or JP) which represents

the extent of financial sensitivity of peripheral country i to the three CEs:

                                         𝑔𝑔   𝑔𝑔
         𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + ∑𝐺𝐺𝑔𝑔=1 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖′ Γ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,                   (1)



or the rate of inflation would constrain the number of observations of the estimated gammas, we decide not to
include either industrial production growth or inflation in the first-step estimation so as to maximize the sample size.

                                                                            5

                                                                                                          𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
          𝑔𝑔                                                                                      𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽    𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸
where 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 is a vector of global factors and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖′ Γ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   = (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖      �.
                                                                                                             𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽
                                                                                                          𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

          For money market rates that represent policy short-term interest rate, using official policy

interest rates may not capture the actual state of monetary policy because all of the CEs have

implemented extremely loose monetary policy, whether conventional or unconventional one, in

the aftermath of the GFC. 11 Hence, we use the “shadow interest rates” to represent a more

realistic state of liquidity availability for the three advanced economies. For the U.S. and the

Euro area, we use the shadow interest rates estimated by Wu and Xia (2014). For Japan, we use

the shadow rates estimated by Christensen and Rudebusch (2014).
                                               𝑔𝑔
          We also have global factors (𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 ) as a group of control variables in the estimation. As the

“real” variable, we include the first principal component of oil prices and commodity prices. 12
     𝑔𝑔
𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 also comprises a vector of “financial” global factors, namely, the VIX index from the Chicago

Board Options Exchange as a proxy for the extent of investors’ risk aversion as well as the “Ted

spread,” which is the difference between the 3-month Eurodollar Deposit Rate in London

(LIBOR) and the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield. The latter measure gauges the general level

of stress in the money market for financial institutions.

          We apply the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to do the estimation for each of the

sample countries which amount to 146 developing countries (LDC). 13 The sample period is 1986

through 2015, using monthly data, with regressions implemented over non-overlapping, three-

year panels. That means that we obtain time-varying 𝛾𝛾�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶 across the three-year panels and the



11
   This is true especially after the ECB and the Bank of Japan lowered their policy rates down to zero but before they
adopted negative interest rates.
12
   The use of the first principal component of oil and commodity prices is to avoid multicollinearity or redundancy.
13
   Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of the countries included in the estimation.

countries. For all the estimations, we exclude the U.S. and Japan. As for the Euro member

countries, they are removed from the sample after the introduction of the euro in January 1999 or

they become member countries, whichever comes first. 14

         Before moving on to introduce the function to estimate the determinants of the degree of

sensitivity to the CE’s financial conditions, we note here that, despite the recent impressive rise

as an economic power, we do not consider China is one of the CE’s in this paper. In our previous

paper (Aizenman, et al., 2016), we compare the adjusted R-squared values of the two

specifications, one with China as one of the CE’s and the other without for each country and

each three-year panel, and found that China’s contribution is negligible except for the time

around the Asian financial crisis of 1998. 15 Thus, China’s contribution in the financial sector is

still negligible in a historical context. 16



2.2 The Second Step: Baseline Model




14
   Endogeneity can be an issue for this type of estimation. As a robustness check, we re-estimated the first-step
model by lagging the right-hand-side variables. However, it did not change the characteristics of the results (not
reported). Hence, we keep the estimation method as it is.
15
   Aizenman, et al. (2016) also examine the extent of financial connectivity through stock market prices, bond
spread, and real effective exchange rates, and test the significance of China’s role as one of the CE’s. In the models
(comparable to equation (1) in this paper) for stock market price changes or sovereign term spreads, China does not
appear influential in most of the sample period. Considering that China’s financial markets only became open only
recently, the lack of influence of China’s these financial variables is unsurprising. In the case of the estimation for
the connectivity through real effective exchange rates, including China as one of the CE’s contributes to increasing
the adjusted R-squared in the crisis years of 2007-2009 for emerging market countries, especially those in East Asia,
possibly reflecting the spell over of significant shrinkage of international trade immediately after the outbreak of the
global financial crisis in 2008.
16
   Considering that the Shanghai stock market crash in the summer of 2015 and the winter of 2016 significantly
affected financial markets in the U.S., Japan, and Europe, one expects that the role of China as a CE and
connectivity with it will become substantial in the near future. The same kind of argument can be made about
whether other large emerging market economies such as Brazil, Russia, and India can be the center economies that
exert global influence. While their role as major economies in the world has been rising, we would still have to wait
for future research to identify their increasing influence in the global economy.

                                                           7
           Once we estimate 𝛾𝛾�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶 , we regress 𝛾𝛾�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶 on a number of country-specific variables. To

account for potential outliers on the dependent variable, we apply the robust regression

estimation technique to the following estimation model. 17

𝛾𝛾�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶 = 𝜃𝜃0 + 𝜃𝜃1 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃2 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃3 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃4 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃5 𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃6 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (2)

           Here, the choice of explanatory variables is based on a wide variety of literature

pertaining to spillover effects and global synchronization of financial or macroeconomic

variables. Hence, we assume that the above estimation model takes a reduced form, rather than a

structural form, by which we can address various theoretical predictions at once, rather than

relying on one particular theory or model.

           There are four groups of explanatory variables. The first group of explanatory variables is

a set of open macroeconomic policy choices ( OMPi ), for which we include the indexes for

exchange rate stability (ERS) and financial openness (KAOPEN) from the trilemma indexes by

Aizenman, et al. (2013). As another variable potentially closely related to the trilemma

framework, we include the variable for IR holding (excluding gold) as a share of GDP because

we believe the level of IR holding may affect the extent of cross-country financial linkages. 18

           The group of macroeconomic conditions, or MCi includes inflation volatility, current

account balance, and gross national debt (as a share of GDP).




17
   The robust regression is a form of weighted least squares regression that estimates a model while assigning
smaller or zero weights on outliers. To obtain the estimates, the OLS estimation is first conducted to get the Cook’s
D (Cook, 1977) for each observation. Observations with the Cook’s D above a certain cut-off point (e.g., Cook’s
distance greater than 1) are dropped from the sample. Then, iterative estimations are conducted until the weights
converges. The iterations lead to creating smaller weights on larger outliers (i.e., observations with large absolute
residuals from the initial OLS estimation). For more details on the robust regression, refer to Hamilton (1991).
18
   Aizenman, et al. (2010, 2011) show the macroeconomic impact of trilemma policy configurations depends upon
the level of IR holding.

                                                                       8
         The group of the variables that reflect the extent of linkages with the center countries

(LINK) includes trade linkage, which we measure as: TR _ LINK ip = IMPipC GDPip where

IMPi C is total imports into center economy C from country i, normalized by country i’s GDP.

LINK also includes variables for financial linkage, for which we use the ratio of bank lending
                                                                                       19
from center economy C to country i as a share of country i’s GDP.

         Another variable that reflects the linkage with the major economies is the variable for the

extent of trade competition (Trade_Comp). Trade_Comp measures the importance to country i of

export competition in the third markets between country i and major country C. 20 A higher value

of this measure indicates country i and major economy C exports products in similar sectors so

that their exported products tend to be competitive to each other.

         The fourth group is composed of the variables that characterize the nature of institutional

development (INST), namely, variables for financial development and legal development. 21 For

the measure of the level of financial development, we use Svirydzenka’s (2016) “index of

financial development” which is the first principal component of two sub-indexes, one that

captures the development of financial markets (FM) and the other that reflects the development

of financial institutions (FI). Each of FM and FI is the first principal components of three

variables: “depth,” “access,” and “efficiency,” respectively. 22



19
   It is the ratio of the total stock of bank lending from country C in country i as a share of country i’s GDP (𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 ) for
which we use the BIS consolidated banking statistics data.
20
   Shocks to country C, and especially shocks to country C that affects country C’s exchange rate, could affect the
relative price of country C’s exports and therefore affect country i through trade competition in third markets. See
Appendix 1 for the variable construction.
21
   However, since the estimate of the legal development variable is found to be persistently insignificant, this
variable is dropped from the estimation.
22
   That is, there are FM-depth, FM-access, FM-efficiency, and FI-depth, FI-access, FI-efficiency. Each of the six
sub-indexes is the first principal components of the component variables. For further details, refer to Svirydzenka
(2016).

         The variables in MC and INST are included in the estimations as deviations from the

U.S., Japanese, and Euro Area’s counterparts. The variables in vectors OMP, MC, and INST are

sampled from the first year of each three year panels to mitigate the effect of potential

endogeneity or bidirectional causality. 23 Also, in order to capture global common shocks, we

also include time fixed effects for the three-year panels.

         Lastly, to control for economic or financial disruptions, we include a vector of currency

and banking crises (CRISIS). For currency crisis, we use a dummy variable based on the

exchange market pressure (EMP) index which is calculated using the exchange rate against the

currency of the base country. The banking crisis dummy is based on the papers by Laeven and

Valencia (2008, 2010, 2012).



2.3 The Macroprudential Policy Index (MPI)

         MPI is the variable of our focus. We assume it represents the extensity of the

implementation of macroprudential policies, for which we use the macroprudential policy dataset

developed by Cerutti, et al. (2017a,b). This dataset is based on a comprehensive survey

conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), called Global Macroprudential Policy

Instruments (GMPI). This survey sent IMF member countries’ central banks questionnaires

regarding the use and effectiveness of 18 macroprudential policy instruments. Cerruti, et al.

(2017a,b) focus on 12 policy instruments and compiled a panel dataset with dummy indicators

on the usage of each instrument for 119 countries during the period 2000-2013.




23
  Sampling data from the first year of each three-year panel could still entail bidirectional causality. As another way
of mitigating endogeneity or bidirectional causality, we could lag the right-hand-side variables, but by one three-
year panel. Lagging the right-hand-side variables this way could mean that we assume it takes three to five years for
the right-hand-side variables to affect the dependent variable, which we do not think is plausible.

                                                          10
         MPI is the sum of the following 12 dummies variables: Loan-to-value ratio cap

(LTV_CAP); Debt to income ratio (DTI); Dynamic Loan-loss Provision (DP); Countercyclical

capital buffer/requirement (CTC); Leverage (LEV); Capital surcharges on Systematically

Important Financial Institutions (SIFI); Limits on interbank exposures (INTER); Concentration

limits (CONC); Limits on foreign currency loans (FC); FX and/or countercyclical reserve

requirements (RR_REV); Limits on domestic currency loans (CG); and Levy/tax on financial

institutions (TAX). Each of these variables takes the value of unity when the policy instrument of

concern is implemented by the country. 24

         We treat MPI as the measure for the extensity of macroprudential policy implementation.

Cerruti, et al. (2017a,b) make it clear that each of the 12 dummies does not “capture the intensity

of the measures and any changes in intensity over time.” 25 Although each dummy does not

directly refer to the stringency of individual policy measures, MPI, as an aggregate of the 12

dummies, does reflect the extensity of the macroprudential measures.

         Countries have adopted varying institutional arrangements to avoid the accumulation of

systematic risk and the occurrence of financial crisis. Obviously, there is no “one-size-fit-all”

macroprudential policy framework. Instead, a broad range and variety of macroprudential policy

tools have been in use in many countries with different policy objectives. Some policy tools are

intended to build up buffers against accumulating systematic risks so that boom-bust cycles can

be mitigated. Other tools are meant to deal with and attenuate the influence of external factors or

of interlinkages between different domestic financial markets.




24
  For more details on the dataset, refer to Appendix 3 as well as Cerruti, et al. (2015).
25
  The authors also argue that codifying the degree of intensity of the measures would involve a certain degree of
subjective judgements.

                                                         11
        Thus, as policy authorities strengthen defenses against financial instability, the set of

policy tools would necessarily expand. In other words, an extensive use of macroprudential

policies should be warranted to make the aggregate set of policy instruments more effective.

Therefore, focusing on the extensity of macroprudential measures could capture addressing the

intensity of macroprudential policies. Hence, we examine whether the level of macroprudential

policy extensity affects interest rate financial linkages.

        Figure 1 illustrates the development of MPI over 2000 through 2013 for different income

groups (Panel (a)) and for different regional groups (Panel (b)). We can see that the use of

macroprudential instruments is consistently becoming more frequent over years. Emerging

market economies (EMG) are the most frequent user of macroprudential policies, which is

understandable given that this group of economies are vulnerable to torrents of capital as they

liberalize their financial markets while their domestic institutions are not as highly developed as

advanced, industrialized countries. 26

        According to Table 1, both the mean and the standard deviation of MPI are the highest

for the EMG group. Industrialized countries, which as an aggregate have the lowest mean and

standard deviation in the full sample period (Table 1), increased the use of macroprudential

policies around the GFC and continued to increase the usage toward the end of the sample

period. The U.S. and European industrialized countries were the epicenters of the GFC, and

other, mostly European, industrialized countries surrounding these economies took defensive

actions to shield themselves from the shocks emanating from the epicenters. That can be

observed as rapid increases in the use of macroprudential policies by western and eastern


26
   The emerging market countries (EMG) is a subgroup of the LDCs and are defined as the countries classified as
either emerging or frontier during the period of 1980-1997 by the International Financial Corporation plus Hong
Kong and Singapore. The group of “industrialized countries” is included in the figure for comparison purposes.
Industrialized countries refer to traditional OECD countries whose IMF code is less than 186.

European economies as shown in Figure 1 (b). Among different regions, economies in Latin

America are the most frequent users of macroprudential policy instruments consistently

throughout the sample period.

        Cerruti, et al. (2017a,b) also group these 12 dummy variables into the group of

macroprudential policy tools intended to affect the behavior of borrowers (BORROWER) and

that of those intended to affect the behavior of lenders (FINANCIAL). BORROWER is composed

of loan-to-value ratio caps (LTV_CAP) and debt to income ratio (DTI) while FINANCIAL is of

the remaining 10 tools: LTV_CAP, DTI, DP, CTC, LEV, SIFI, INTER, CONC, FC, RR_REV, CG,

and TAX.

        Figure 2 illustrates the development of BORROWER and FINANCIAL for the advanced

economies (IDC) and developing economies (LDC). 27 Developing economies have been more

likely to implement both BORROWER and FINANCIAL compared to IDCs. Many LDCs

increased the number of borrower-targeted macroprudential policies in 2004 and after 2010

while they steadily increased the use of lender-targeted policies over time. Interestingly, IDCs

increased the use of borrower-targeted macroprudential policies rather discretely in 2008 when

the Financial Crisis broke out, and in 2010 and 2013 in response to loose monetary policy in the

U.S. and the Euro area in the preceding years.

        As we previously discussed, the main purpose of macroprudential policies is to contain

systematic risk and increase resilience of financial system to shocks. This means that

macroprudential policy tools can vary in terms of their purposes and targets. The International

Monetary Fund (IMF), the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the Bank for International


27
  Because the maximal values differ between BORROWER (2) and FINANCIAL (10), Figure 2 is drawn to show the
                                                                              𝑥𝑥

Settles (BIS) categorize macroprudential policies into (1) (broad-based) capital tools; (2) asset-

side (sectorial capital) tools; and (3) liquidity-related tools (IMF-FSB-BIS, 2016).

           According this categorization, we can disaggregate MPI into CAPITAL, which is the sum

of DP, CTC, SIFI, and INTER; ASSET, which is the sum of LTV_CAP, DTI, LEV, and CONC;

and LIQUIDITY which is the sum of FC, RR_REV, CG, and TAX (see Appendix 3). The policy

tools included in CAPITAL aim at increasing resilience of the financial system while maintaining

the supply of credit through adverse conditions, while those in ASSET seek to break the

procyclical feedback between asset prices and credit in the mortgage lending market. Tools in

LIQUIDITY are aimed at managing the build-up of liquidity and foreign exchange risks

associated with lending booms.

           Figure 3 shows the trajectories of the three disaggregated measures of macroprudential

policies for IDCs and LDCs. 28 Among LDCs, asset-based measures are most implemented

among the three types of policies, followed by liquidity-related and broad capital-based. Among

IDCs, asset-based measures are still most used and their use has been increasing since the

Financial Crisis of 2008. For this group of countries, broad capital-based measures are second

most used while liquidity-based measures are least used, though their use has been rapidly rising

after the GFC.

           Using these MPI-related variables, we examine in the second-step estimation whether and

to what extent the implementation of macroprudential policies affects the financial linkages

between CEs and PHs. We will primarily focus on investigating the aggregate impact of

macroprudential policies using the MPI. We will also disaggregate the impact of

macroprudential policies and examine whether and to what extent different types of

disaggregated macroprudential policy variables for affect the CE-PH links. These variables are

included in the estimation as three-year averages. Because MPI-related indexes are available for

2000-2013, the sample for the second-step estimation comprises three-year panels that start in

1998-2000 and ending in 2013-14. 29



3    Empirical Results

3.1 First-Step Estimations – Connectivity with the CEs

         As the first step, we estimate the extent of correlation of the policy interest rates between

the CEs and the PHs while controlling for two kinds of global factors: “real global” and

“financial global,” using the three-year, non-overlapping panels in the 1986-2015 period.

         To gain a birds-eye view of the empirical results and the general trend of the groups of

factors that influence the financial link, we focus on the joint significance of the variables

included in the real global and financial global groups, and vector XC the latter of which includes

the policy interest rates of the three CEs.

         Figure 4 illustrates the proportion of countries for which the joint significance tests are

found to be statistically significant (with the p-value less than 5%) for the real global and

financial global groups, and vector XC of the CEs’ policy interest rates.

         According to Figure 4, the policy interest rates of the CEs affect most joint-significantly

those of the PHs. That is, the CEs’ policy interest rates have been dominant for developing and

emerging market economies in the last two decades, a consistent result with the findings reported

in Aizenman et al. (2016).




29
  Data availability makes the last three-year panel a two-year average. For the last panel, we use the MPI data as of
2013.

                                                         15
        Furthermore, the proportion of joint significance is also relatively high for the group of

“financial global” variables during the GFC and the last three year panel for developing countries

and since the GFC for developed countries and emerging market countries, suggesting global

financial factors have been playing an important role in affecting the policy interest of countries

regardless of income levels. This result is consistent with the Rey’s (2013) thesis of “global

financial cycles.” Not surprisingly, economies are more exposed to global financial shocks

during periods of financial turbulence while also following CEs’ monetary policies.

        Figure 5 presents the distribution of the estimated degrees of sensitivity (the estimated

gammas) to the policy rates of the key economies. Figure 5 (a) shows the median of the

estimated gammas with respect to the U.S., the euro area, and Japan. The figure does not show

any discernable patterns or trend, except that the estimated gammas with respect to the three key

economies tend to show wide swings at the times of financial crises (e.g., late 1990s and late

2000s). This is confirmed with Figure 5 (b) which illustrates the standard deviations of the

estimated gammas for each of the key economies. 30 These panels of figures suggest that the

estimated gammas contain many outliers, may seem to help make it hard to detect patterns or

trends in the estimated gammas.



3.2 Results of the Second-Step Estimation: Do the Macroprudential policies matter?

        We now use the estimation model based on equation (2) and investigate the determinants

of the extent of linkages through the policy interest rate, γˆFit

                                                                  , while focusing on the impact of

  Both the median and the standard deviations are calculated after removing outliers below the 5th percentile and
above the 95th percentile.

macroprudential policies. Table 2 reports the estimation results for the LDC and EMG samples

(see Appendix 2).

        Generally, compared to the results in our previous study (Aizenman, et al. 2017b), the

results are unaffected despite the inclusion of the MPI in the estimation.

        PHs with more open financial markets tend to follow the monetary policy of the CEs,

though the extent of exchange rate stability they pursue does not matter. 31 The positive

coefficient on inflation volatility means that countries with highly volatile inflation cannot

maintain monetary independence. Those peripheral countries that export competitive products to

the CEs may be more able to delink the link of the policy interest rates with the CEs, while those

with stronger trade links with the CEs tend to have a stronger connectivity through the policy

interest rates with the CEs. The more developed financial markets a PH country is equipped

with, the more connectivity through policy interest rates it has with the CEs. This result may

reflect that countries with more developed financial markets tend to be more exposed to arbitrage

opportunities so that their interest rates tend more to be equalized or synchronized with those of

the CEs. The model, however, does not fit very well for the subsample of EMGs.

        The effect of macroprudential policies on the financial link between the CEs and PHs is

not observed. Although the estimated coefficient of the MPI variable is negative for both LDCs

and EMGs, it is never statistically significant.

        As previously described, the MPI index can be disaggregated into those borrower-

targeted (BORROWER) and those targeted for financial institutions (FINANCIAL), or those

regarded as capital tools (CAPITAL), asset-side tools (ASSET), or liquidity-related tools



31
  Aizenman, et al. (2017b) find that the links through other financial variables are affected by the degree of
exchange rate stability. Hence, unlike the “global financial cycles” argument by Rey (2013), the type of exchange
rate regimes does matter.

                                                        17
(LIQUIDITY). We now replace the MPI with BORROWER or FINANCIAL individually, or both

of them together. Table 3 reports the estimation results only for the estimates of BORROWER,

FINANCIAL, or both.

       Again, we do not observe any significant effect of these variables – in Table 3, neither

BORROWER nor FINANCIAL enters the estimation as a significant determinant whether the

variables are included individually or together.

       Even when we include CAPITAL, ASSET, and LIQUIDITY individually or all together,

still, we do not observe any significant impact of these variables (results not reported).

       Do these results suggest that macroprudential policies do not affect the financial

connectivity between the CEs and the PHs? We cannot make such a conclusion too hastily.

       The effect of macroprudential policies may differ depending on the conditions of the CEs

or PHs. Macroprudential policy instruments received more attention when several important

emerging market economies such as Brazil, Korea, and Indonesia, implemented these policies

against the influx of capital caused by unconventionally lax monetary policy of the CEs. Given

that, the effectiveness of the macroprudential policies may differ whether the CEs implement a

policy that contributes to an influx of capital to the PHs or an efflux of capital from the countries.

       Figure 6 illustrates the shadow policy interest rates for the three CEs. From the figure, we

can see that different three-year panels (shown with vertical dotted lines) present different states

of monetary policies among the three CEs. That is, in the three-year panels of 2001-03, 2007-09,

2010-12, the (shadow) policy interest rates steadily fall, indicating the central banks of these

economies implemented expansionary monetary policy in these three-year panels. Such

monetary expansion usually contributes to causing an influx of capital to emerging market

economies. In the other panels, namely, the three-year panels of 1998-2000, 2004-2006, 2013-



                                                   18
2015, the state of monetary policy of the three CEs appears as either contractionary or

undiscernible.

       From the perspective of the PHs, macroprudential policy may be more important when

the CEs relax monetary policy than otherwise, because loose monetary policy by the CEs might

necessitate PHs to take some actions against an influx of capital that is departing from the low-

yielding advanced economies for higher yields.

       Now, let us estimate the variable of financial connectivity again, but this time restricting

the sample to the panels of 2001-03, 2007-09, 2010-12, i.e., the time periods when the CEs

implemented lax monetary policy consistently. The results are reported in Table 4.

       Interestingly, the estimated coefficient of the MPI becomes significantly negative for

LDC. That indicates that macroprudential policy help these economies to shield the influence of

the CEs’ policy interest rate changes. In other words, macroprudential policies may help PHs to

delink themselves from the CEs and retain monetary independence. This evidence is consistent

with the fact that many emerging market countries implemented macroprudential policies when

they experienced a rise in capital inflows in the aftermath of the GFC. The coefficient of the MPI

is also found to be negative for the EMG subsample, but it is not statistically significant.

       When we run the same regression for the other three-year panels, those with no monetary

expansion (i.e., 1998-2000, 2004-2006, 2013-2015), the coefficient of the MPI is found to be

insignificant. This result indicates that only when the center economies implement expansionary

monetary policy, does macroprudential policy taken by developing countries become effective in

allowing them to retain monetary autonomy.

       Figure 7 illustrates the contributions of the right-hand side variables to the estimated

financial sensitivity for Israel, Korea, and Turkey, using the estimates from the regression for



                                                 19
LDC reported in Table 4. As previously described, we group the right-hand side variables into a

group of open macroeconomic policy choices ( OMPi ); macroeconomic conditions (MACRO); the

variables that reflect the extent of linkages with the CEs (LINK); the variable that characterizes

the nature of institutional development (INST); and the MPI as the measure of the extensity of

macroprudential policies. We show the contributions of each of the groups along with the

estimated gamma from the first step regression as well as the gamma predicted from the second

step regression for the three-year panels of 2007-09 and 2010-12 – the time periods when the

CEs implement expansionary monetary policy. 32

          These countries represent the case where their gamma against the U.S. policy interest

rate (i.e., the estimated coefficient of the correlation between these countries’ and the U.S. policy

interest rates) fell while they increased the level of MPI. In other words, these country’s

monetary independence rose when they implemented more extensive macroprudential policies.

For example, Turkey increased the level of MPI from 2.3 in 2007-09 to 4.7 in 2010-12. The

(negative) contribution of MPI expands as the level of MPI rises while the estimated gamma

against the U.S. policy interest rate goes down from 0.40 in 2007-09 to -0.53 in 2010-12 (i.e., it

retained more monetary independence). The proportion of the MPI’s contribution, coloured in

brown, appears to be significant given the level of the gamma. Similarly, the contribution of the

MPI looks significant for both Korea and Israel, both of which experienced a fall in the estimated

gamma between the two time periods while their MPI levels went up. 33 Thus, the effect of the

MPI is not just econometrically significant, but also economically significant.


32
   For the sake of simplicity of the graph presentation, we omit showing the contributions of the time fixed effects as
well as the estimated constant.
33
   As we will see in the next section, the negative correlation between the MPI and the estimated gamma is more
applicable to countries running current account deficit and holding lower levels of IR. As of 2007-09 and 2010-12,
Turkey ran current account deficit while Korea and Israel ran current account surplus, the latter two countries of

                                                          20
         When we disaggregate the MPI into BORROWER and FINANCIAL and include them

either separately or together, the estimation results shown in Table 5 indicate that the negative

effect of the MPI variable in Table 4 comes from the macroprudential policy instruments that are

targeted for lenders, i.e., financial institutions. This finding is unique because recent studies show

borrower-based macroprudential policies tend to be more effective than lender-based policies. 34

         Generally, macroprudential policies targeting lenders seek to make the price of credit

more expensive so that borrowers’ demand for credit would fall. Authorities in charge could

slow down credit growth insofar as borrowers are interest-sensitive. The finding that

macroprudential policy instruments targeted at lenders are more effective in weakening the

financial linkage with the CEs means that monetary authorities can retain more monetary

autonomy by making the price of credit more expensive. This result might arise because it is

easier for authorities in charge of macroprudential policies to target financial institutions rather

borrowers because the number of lenders can be relatively limited while that of borrowers can be

numerous.

         What about the impacts of CAPITAL, ASSET, and LIQUIDITY?

         We include these variables instead of the previous two variables both individually and

jointly and report the results in Table 6. Among the three variables, only LIQUIDITY turns out to

be a significant and negative contributor to the correlation of policy interest rates between the

CEs and the PHs. Given that liquidity-related macroprudential measures are intended to control

liquidity growth, especially when the periphery economy is experiencing an influx of capital due


which held relatively sizeable IR. The exercise here does not distinguish between current account surplus and deficit
countries, or between high and low IR holders. Hence, we are showing the “average behavior” between these
different types of economies. Economies like Korea and Israel could also implement active and preemptive
macroprudential policies if they are “prudentially” afraid of the tail risk of rapid worsening of their domestic
financial market conditions.
34
   See Ayyagari et al. (2018), Cerutti et al. (2017a,b), Epure et al. (2018), and Fendoglu (2017).

                                                         21
to expansionary monetary policy conducted by the CEs, controls on liquidity growth should be

effective in allowing the country to retain control over its own monetary policy.

          Lastly, we include each of the 12 dummy variables individually and jointly instead of

MPI or the other disaggregated measures (results not reported). Among the dummy variables, the

policy that limits banks from exceeding a fixed minimum leverage ratio (“Leverage ratio cap”)

and the policy of countercyclical reserve requirements are found to have a significantly negative

impact on the correlation of policy interest rates between the CEs and the PHs. The

countercyclical reserve requirements policy is found to be robust even when all of the dummy

variables are included in the estimation. Among the 12 types of macroprudential policies, the cap

on the leverage ratio and countercyclical reserve requirements are effective in controlling credit

growth, which allows the monetary authorities of the PHs to retain autonomy over interest rate

policy.

          Interestingly, none of the above findings are observed when the estimation is conducted

for the remaining three-year panels. These empirical findings suggest that the effect of

macroprudential policy is discernible only when the CEs implement expansionary monetary

policy that eventually causes a rise in capital inflows among developing countries, but not when

the CEs implement contractionary monetary policy. In other words, the impact of

macroprudential policies is asymmetrical, which explains why we did not find a significant

impact of macroprudential policies in the baseline regression. 35

          As previously discussed, the purpose of macroprudential policies is to protect the

financial system from economic and financial shocks. For small, open peripheral economies, the

main purpose of macroprudential policies is to minimize systematic risk that arises from shocks


35
  We cannot differentiate between the hypothesis that the asymmetry occurs post-financial crisis vs. a period of
loose monetary policy in the CEs.

                                                         22
emanating from the CEs. When the CEs implement expansionary monetary policy, that can shift

the tide of cross-border capital flow toward higher-yielding markets in the PHs, while the PHs

could experience capital outflow when the CEs implement contractionary monetary policy.

However, the magnitude and the impact of capital outflow on the financial markets and the real

economy often depends upon the scale of capital inflow that precedes the event of capital

outflow. Monetary authorities often implement macroprudential policies as preemptive measures

to mitigate an expansion of credit thereby avoiding severe bubble and bust cycles.

       The estimation results we obtained from the above analysis bolster the premise that

macroprudential policies are important when credit and liquidity expansion is being “exported”

from the CEs.



4. Further Analyses

       We saw that macroprudential policies could affect the financial link between the CEs and

the PHs through the policy interest rates, especially when the CEs implement expansionary

monetary policy. The effect of macroprudential policies might also depend upon several other

macroeconomic or policy conditions of the PH countries that implement the policies.

       Let us now examine how the effect of macroprudential policies on the financial link

might change depending on the macroeconomic or policy environment of the PHs. We test how

third factors could affect the effectiveness of macroprudential policies on the interest rate

channel between the CEs and the PHs while continuing to restrict our sample period to the

periods of CEs’ “loose” monetary policy.

       First, we test the impact of current account balances. Although we observed that

macroprudential policies become effective only when the CEs implement expansionary monetary



                                                 23
policy, the effectiveness of macroprudential policies should differ whether the PH country of

concern is a net recipient of capital or a net lender. Historically, current account deficit countries

are more receptive to external shocks than surplus countries.

       To test that, we divide the sample of LCD, or EMG, into the country-years in which the

PH runs current account surplus and those in which they run deficit. Table 7 reports the

estimation results for the MPI variable. The negative effect of macroprudential policies on the

interest rate link between CEs and PHs is observed only for current account deficit countries for

both LDC and EMG subsamples. That means that macroprudential policies allow PHs to retain

more monetary independence from the CEs when they are net recipients of capital, while

macroprudential policies do not matter for current account surplus countries.

       The level of international reserves holding might matter for the effectiveness of

macroprudential policies. If a country holds a large volume of international reserves and

implement macroprudential policies, those policies may be more effective because holding a

large volume of IR could send a positive signal that the country is less vulnerable to external

shocks. In this case, it can be argued that IR holding plays a supplemental role to

macroprudential policies. At the same time, however, macroprudential policies and IR holding

could have a substitutive relationship to each other. In that case, even if a country does not hold a

large volume of IR, active implementations of macroprudential policies might function as an

alternative buffer to external shocks.

       Our estimation results suggest that macroprudential policies and IR holding have a

substitutive relationship with each other. Table 8 reports the results from the estimations in

which we divide the sample of LDC or EMG depending on the level of IR (as a share of GDP) is

greater or lower than the sample medium. According to the estimation results, for EMG countries



                                                  24
which do not hold high levels of IR, implementing macroprudential policies could help them

mitigate the impact of a change in the CEs’ policy interest rates on their own interest rates, i.e.,

they can retain more monetary autonomy from implementing macroprudential policies.

       The impact of macroprudential policies could also depend upon the degree of openness to

international financial markets of the country that implements the policies. We divide the sample

into two subsamples depending on whether our measure of capital account openness (the Chinn-

Ito index) is above or below the sample medium and rerun the estimations. In Table 9, we

observe that macroprudential policies could be more effective when the economy of concern is

relatively financially closed. This means that when a PH country tries to shield itself from capital

inflows diverted from the CEs, having more closed financial markets would help for the

macroprudential policies to be more effective. Conversely, for PH economies with more open

financial markets, macroprudential policies would not be sufficient to manage capital inflows.

        The purpose of implementing macroprudential policies is to shield the influence of

policy changes made by the CEs so that the country that implements the policies could retain its

own monetary autonomy. We have seen that PHs’ macroprudential policies are effective when

the CEs implement expansionary monetary policy. In such a situation, a lax monetary

environment among the CEs would cause capital to flow into emerging market economies with

higher yields, which could cause credit to expand in the latter. Monetary policy makers of the

PHs might become concerned that increased credit in their economies might become out of

controls, against which policy makers may implement macroprudential policies. Given this, the

effect of macroprudential policies may be more discernable when the PH economy of concern is

experiencing an increase in capital inflow and also an expansion of credit.




                                                 25
           Table 10 divides the sample depending on the portfolio net inflow (as a share of GDP) is

experiencing a positive or negative growth. The coefficient of the MPI is negative for the LDC

sample for the economies that are experiencing growth in net portfolio inflows. The estimated

coefficient of the MPI for the EMG group is also negative, but only marginally significant (p-

value = 16%). Macroprudential policies are discernably effective when the PHs are experiencing

an increase in portfolio net inflows.

           In Table 11, we divide the sample depending on whether the country of concern is

experiencing a growth of credit higher than its own median or not. 36 The MPI variable enters the

estimation for both the LDC and EMG subsample with a significantly negative coefficient only

for the sample of countries with higher-than-median credit growth. Taken together with the

results of Table 10, we can conclude that macroprudential policies can become effective when

the CEs implement expansionary monetary policy, that causes a rise in portfolio net inflows and

credit expansion in the PHs.



5. Concluding Remarks

            In this paper, we empirically investigated whether and to what extent the financial link

through policy interest rates between the CEs (i.e., the U.S. the euro area, and Japan) and the

PHs can be affected by a set of macroprudential policies implemented by the PHs.

           We found that macroprudential policies negatively affect the interest rate connectivity

between the CEs and the PHs when we focused on the time periods when the CEs implement

expansionary monetary policy. This asymmetrical finding makes sense considering that CEs’ lax

monetary policy causes massive capital to flow to the PHs while the latter countries try to



36
     We measure credit growth as a percentage growth of liquid liabilities as a share of GDP.

                                                           26
attenuate any negative impact on the real economy of credit expansion caused by capital influx

from the CEs. 37

        When we disaggregated the index for macroprudential policies into the group of

borrower-targeted macroprudential policy tools and that of lender-targeted tools, we found that

the above negative impact of MPI is mainly driven by lender-targeted macroprudential policies.

This finding is unique because recent studies show borrower-based macroprudential policies tend

to be more effective than lender-based policies.

        Furthermore, when we disaggregated the MPI into (broad-based) capital tools; asset-side

(sectorial capital) tools; and liquidity-related tools, only liquidity-related tools turn out to be a

significantly negative contributor to the correlation of policy interest rates between the CEs and

the PHs.

        The effectiveness of macroprudential policies can vary depending on the macroeconomic

conditions or policies of the PH economies that implement them.

        We found that PH countries’ policy interest rates could become more independent of

CEs’ when macroprudential policies are implemented by the countries with current account

deficit. In other words, macroprudential policies could work more effectively for countries that

import capital from overseas.

        When we compared high IR holding countries with low IR holding ones, the estimated

coefficient of the variable for macroprudential policies was found to be significantly negative,

i.e., weakening the policy interest rate link between the CEs and the PHs, only for low IR

holders. This suggests that countries with low levels of IR holding may use macroprudential

policies as a substitute to holding high levels of IR.


37
 Similarly, Han and Wei (2018) find asymmetrical effects of capital controls, depending on whether core country
monetary policy is tightening or loosening.

                                                       27
       We also detected the effect of macroprudential policies only among those with increasing

net portfolio inflows, not among those with declining net portfolio inflows. We also compared

the PH countries that are experiencing credit growth with those which are not and found that

only those which are experiencing credit growth have a significantly effect on their

macroprudential policies.

       Thus, we have been able to show the effect of macroprudential policies as the “fourth”

factor in the quadrilemma. It must be noted that macroprudential policies are not the same as

conventional capital controls policies. What makes macroprudential policies different from

conventional capital controls is that macroprudential policies are aimed at mitigating the balance

sheet exposure associated with short term debt flows while typical capital controls are blunt

instruments that focus more on affecting capital flows and less on mitigating the balance sheet

exposures. That may explain our findings that the effect of macroprudential policies are detected

only when the CEs implement expansionary policy and when the PHs’ domestic credit

conditions are affected.

       Clearly, it is better to use more nuanced or detailed cross-country data on

macroprudential policies, rather than relying on crude dummy variables, so that we can identify

which types of macroprudential policies are effective or ineffective under what kind of policy or

macroeconomic conditions. However, such an exercise is outside the scope of this paper. We

will tackle on this issue as one of the future research agendas.

     ExpWC ,k is exports from large-country C to every other country in the world (W) in industrial
     sector k whereas ExpWW , k is exports from every country in the world to every other country in
   the world (i.e. total global exports) in industrial sector k. ExpWi ,k is exports from country i to

   assume merchandise exports are composed of five industrial sectors (K), that is,
   manufacturing, agricultural products, metals, fuel, and food.
   This index is normalized using the maximum value of the product in parentheses for every
   country pair in the sample. Thus, it ranges between zero and one. 38 A higher value of this

   variables: “depth,” “access,” and “efficiency,” respectively. 39
Currency crisis – It is from Aizenman and Ito (2014) who use the exchange market pressure
   (EMP) index using the exchange rate against the currency of the base country. We use two
   standard deviations of the EMP as the threshold to identify a currency crisis. To construct the
   crisis dummies in three-year panels, we assign the value of one if a crisis occurs in any year
   within the three-year period.
Banking crisis – It is from Aizenman and Ito (2014) who follow the methodology of Laeven and

Share of export/import – The share of country i’s export to, or import from, a major currency
   country (e.g., Japan) in country i’s total export or import. The data are taken from the IMF’s
   Direction of Trade.
Commodity export/import as a percentage of total export/import – Data are taken from the
   World Bank’s World Development Indicators and the IMF’s International Financial
