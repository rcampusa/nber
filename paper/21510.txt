This paper examines the impact of universal, free, and easily accessible primary healthcare on
population health as measured by age-specific mortality rates, focusing on a nationwide
socialized medicine program implemented in Turkey. The Family Medicine Program (FMP),
launched in 2005, assigns each Turkish citizen to a specific state-employed family physician who
offers a wide range of primary healthcare services that are free-of-charge. Furthermore, these
services are provided at family health centers, which operate on a walk-in basis and are located
within the neighborhoods in close proximity to the patients. To identify the causal impact of the
FMP, we exploit the variation in its introduction across provinces and over time. Our estimates
indicate that the FMP caused the mortality rate to decrease by 25.6% among infants, 7.7% among
the elderly, and 22.9% among children ages 1-4. These estimates translate into 2.6, 1.29, and 0.13
fewer deaths among infants, the elderly, and children ages 1-4, respectively. Furthermore, the
effects appear to strengthen over time. We also show evidence to suggest that the FMP has
contributed to an equalization of mortality across provinces. Finally, our calculations indicate that
each family physician saves about 0.15, 0.46, and 0.005 lives among infants, the elderly, and
children ages 1- 4 per province every year.

“I regard universal health coverage as the single most powerful concept that public
health has to offer. It is inclusive. It unifies services and delivers them in a
comprehensive and integrated way, based on primary healthcare.”

1. Introduction

        One of the most daunting challenges faced by governments around the world is

the provision of basic, accessible, and affordable healthcare services to their citizens.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are about 1.3 billion people in

the world lacking effective and affordable medical care.2 The majority of these people

live in developing countries, which confront especially steep challenges due to shortages

of trained healthcare personnel, infrastructure, and financial resources necessary to

establish a universal healthcare system.3

        Despite these challenges, a growing number of low- and middle-income countries

have undertaken significant health interventions aimed at improving the delivery of basic

healthcare care services, expanding access, and reducing health disparities, and ultimately

improving public health. To this end, the most commonly adopted approaches are

primarily demand-side measures, such as expanding public health insurance to previously

uninsured individuals (typically low-income households), reducing user fees and out-of-

pocket expenditures (or means testing to enhance affordability), and conditional cash

transfers.4 Previous studies find evidence that these interventions are usually effective at

countries to reform their health-financing systems with the goal of achieving universal coverage (WHO,
2005).

extending coverage of public health insurance and increasing healthcare utilization, at

least among targeted groups.5 However, the evidence on whether these interventions

promote affordable, high-quality health services, and improve health outcomes is

relatively mixed and inconclusive.6 A potential explanation for this conclusion is that

expanding coverage—not surprisingly—would increase patient-doctor contact, but

without provisions to ensure affordability and efficacy of treatments, it is possible that

patients might be recommended services that are unaffordable, as well as medically

unnecessary or even inappropriate (Miller et al., 2013; Limwattananon al., 2015).

Consequently, demand-side reforms alone may not be effective in promoting affordable

healthcare and expanding utilization unless they are accompanied by supply-side

measures such as public provision of healthcare or incentives for providers to deliver

cost-effective care. Accordingly, several recent studies have emphasized the role of

supply-side interventions as a complement to demand-side reforms in countries like

Brazil (e.g., Rocha and Soares, 2010; Reis, 2014), Colombia (e.g., Camacho and

Conover, 2013; Miller et al., 2013), Peru (Bernal et al., 2016), and Thailand (e.g., Gruber

et al., 2014; Limwattananon et al., 2015). The emerging consensus from these studies is

  It is important to note that health insurance schemes in the classic sense (i.e., premium based and pooling
of risk) typically fail in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., Dreschsler and Jutting, 2007), and the
health insurance schemes in most of the developing countries listed here are entitlement programs (i.e., tax
financed with no or little premiums or user fees). To be fair, some include highly subsidized contributory
options for `non-poor’ target populations, but these options usually account for a very minor segment of the
program beneficiaries.

that healthcare interventions integrated with supply-side instruments typically improve

both medical care utilization and public health.7

         In this paper, we study the impact of a primarily supply-side healthcare

intervention implemented in Turkey on outcomes of age-specific mortality rates. The

Family Medicine Program – called FMP hereafter – extended basic healthcare services to

the entire Turkish population under a free-of-charge and single-payer system that is fully

financed and administered by the central government. The key operational feature of the

FMP is the assignment of each Turkish citizen to a specific family physician, who offers

a wide range of basic healthcare services in easily accessible walk-in clinics called

Family Health Centers. The program was first initiated as a pilot in 2005 in the province

of Duzce, and gradually expanded to cover the entire population in all 81 provinces by

the end of 2010.8 In 2013, there were over 21,000 family physicians – all public

employees – in 6768 and 971 family and community health centers, respectively.9

         There are a number of factors motivating our investigation. First, there is

descriptive evidence crediting the FMP with increased patient satisfaction and healthcare

utilization (Baris et al., 2011; WHO, 2008), but there has been no rigorous evaluation of

the impact of the program on measures of public health outcomes.10 This is despite the

universal scope and scale of the Turkish program that makes it arguably one of the most



7
  Note that there is a wide spectrum of health outcomes considered in the literature ranging from chronic
conditions to self-reported health, to patient satisfaction to mortality. Therefore, the findings from one
particular study may not be generalizable to other outcomes. Furthermore, given the relative paucity of
studies focusing on primarily supply-side reforms, the debate surrounding the impact of these reforms is
not yet settled.

   It could also be very informative to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the FMP on
utilization levels. Unfortunately, we cannot perform such an analysis due to a lack of data on province level
utilization levels.

ambitious and comprehensive efforts to achieve universal health coverage in a

developing country setting.

       Second, there are a number of distinct features that distinguishes the FMP from

most other interventions. Perhaps the most unique component of the program is the

assignment of every Turkish citizen, regardless of income, to a designated family

physician who works as a public employee and provides a wide range of primary care

services free-of-charge. This feature constitutes the backbone of the Turkish reform that

separates it from most supply-side measures implemented elsewhere. Our paper presents

the first evidence of the impact on mortality of entitlement to free basic healthcare

coverage granted to the entire population using a publicly funded and operated system.

       The universal and free aspect of the FMP deserve further highlighting because

there appears to be a growing conviction among leading global health organizations,

policymakers, and practitioners about the importance of achieving universal health

coverage, i.e., ensuring basic and affordable healthcare services to whole citizens

irrespective of their ability to pay (Nicholson et al., 2015; Rottingen et al., 2014; United

Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 2014; Wagstaff, 2014; WHO,

2014a). According to this view, a key step towards universal coverage is to extend an

affordable and basic package of healthcare services to all citizens—as opposed to an

approach that prioritizes specific target populations (e.g., the poorest in the society or

people in informal employment)—that includes a broad range of basic services

(Nicholson et al., 2015; Rottingen et al., 2014). However, this endorsement mainly comes

from the mixed success of insurance-based interventions in achieving universal coverage

or improving health. Therefore, the Turkish FMP presents a valuable opportunity to




                                              5
provide fresh insights into the impact of a nationwide and predominantly supply-side

intervention on population health.

       Finally, we also consider our analysis as a contribution to the broader literature on

the relationship between income and mortality. Mortality, especially among infants, has

fallen in many developing countries with the rise in income over the past several decades.

However, it is not clear the extent to which this decrease has been due to increased

income versus public provision of healthcare services from reforms similar to the one

implemented in Turkey.

       Exploiting the staggered program rollout across provinces and over time in a

difference-in-differences empirical design, we find that the FMP led to considerable

reductions in age-specific mortality rates. Our estimates indicate that on average the FMP

reduced mortality rates by 25.6% among infants, 7.7% among the elderly, and 22.9%

among children ages 1-4. The estimates appear to be small initially and to grow over

time. This is consistent with the notion that the program has become more effective over

time, possibly due to an increasing number of citizens establishing contact with their

family physician and utilizing healthcare services. Furthermore, the results are suggestive

that the program has also contributed towards reducing the disparity in mortality rates

across provinces. Finally, our calculations indicate that an additional family physician

saves about 0.15, 0.46, and 0.005 lives among infants, the elderly, and children ages 1-4

per year.

2. Literature

       There is a large literature examining various aspects of healthcare reforms

implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Although the majority of these




                                             6
reforms consist of primarily demand-side measures such as expanding public health

insurance coverage, many of them are also accompanied by supply-side ingredients

aimed at expanding coverage through public provision of services and thereby enhancing

affordability, especially among the poor, and promoting cost-efficient, high-quality care

through incentive-based payment mechanisms. In this literature review, we deliberately

limit our discussion to relatively recent studies that consider reforms with pre-dominantly

supply-side measures, as we believe these are the most relevant from the perspective of

the Turkish program.11

            One notable example is Thailand’s 30 Baht Program (or Universal Coverage

Scheme), which was launched in 2001 as one of the largest and most ambitious health

reforms ever undertaken in a developing country at the time. With the goal of reducing

geographical disparities in the provision of public healthcare, the 30 Baht Program

significantly increased payments to hospitals and decreased co-payments to improve

access to medical care for the poor. Gruber et al. (2014) examined the impact of the

program employing a difference-in-differences estimator for identification by comparing

the outcomes of the previously uninsured and underinsured populations to those who had

insurance coverage prior to the reform. The authors found that the reform led to increased

healthcare utilization with more pronounced effects among the poor, including a

significant decrease in infant mortality, leading to a reduction in disparities of mortality

across provinces. More recently, Limwattananon et al. (2015) employed a similar

empirical strategy to examine the impact of the Thai reform on out-of-pocket medical




11
     Therefore, this is not an exhaustive list of the studies in the literature.


                                                            7
expenditures and utilization, and found that the reform reduced these expenditures while

also raising utilization of both inpatient and ambulatory care.

       Another relevant example with clear supply-side components is Colombia’s

Subsidized Regime, which was introduced in 1993 in the form of publicly-financed

health insurance for the poor. The reform also introduced new payment contracts between

insurers and provider organizations with a goal of creating incentives for providers to

reallocate spending from primary to preventive care (Miller et al., 2013). In a recent

study, Camacho and Conover (2013) used program eligibility as an instrumental variable

to examine the effect of the program on access to medical care and birth outcomes, and

found that receiving subsidized health insurance increased the likelihood of medical care

utilization and reduced the incidence of low birth weight. Relatedly, using a fuzzy

regression discontinuity design, Miller et al. (2013) found that the program protected the

poor from financial risks associated with unexpected medical costs while increasing the

use of traditionally-underutilized preventive services, resulting in health gains.

       Peru’s public health insurance program (Seguro Integral de Salud) is another

large-scale reform with supply side incentives. Introduced in 2001, the program offered

free (no co-payments, coinsurance, deductibles, or other fees) access to basic services

through a network of healthcare centers and hospitals. Bernal et al. (2016) used the

program’s income eligibility thresholds in a sharp regression discontinuity design to

examine the program’s effect on utilization, healthcare expenditures, and health

outcomes. They found strong positive effects on healthcare utilization, including

receiving surgery, doctor visits, and receiving medication. However, with the exception

of pregnancy care, they obtained weak or no effects on preventive-care outcomes such as




                                              8
receiving iron supplements, ultrasounds, and lab tests. Interestingly, they also found that

the program increased healthcare expenditures, but mostly at the high end of the income

distribution, with no clear effects on self-reported health overall. Taken together, the

authors interpreted these findings as evidence that an initial contact with a provider might

lead to greater awareness about health problems, which might in turn trigger supplier-

induced demand, and thus cause an increase in out-of-pocket spending for services not

covered by the program.

       Brazil’s Programa Saùde de Familia (PSF) is another large-scale healthcare

reform that deserves our attention. As one of the earlier reforms in the developing world,

the PSF was launched in 1994 with the goal of promoting preventative and basic

healthcare through the use of professional healthcare teams directly intervening at the

family and community level. Rocha and Soares (2010) examined the impact of the PSF

on a wide range of outcomes including mortality, child labor, schooling, employment,

and fertility using both municipality and household data. Controlling for location fixed

effects to account for the endogeneity of the program implementation, the authors found

that the PSF reduced infant mortality, lowered fertility, increased the labor supply of

adults, and boosted school enrollment in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil.

       It is important to note that a key aspect of the PSF is the deployment of

professional community healthcare teams, which are responsible for the delivery of

primary healthcare (Rocha and Soares, 2010). This resembles the role of family

physicians in the FMP who are responsible for providing basic healthcare services to the

citizens assigned to them. But unlike the Turkish reform, participation in the PSF is

voluntary at the municipality level and requires the coordination among all three layers of




                                              9
government at the federal, state, and municipal levels (Rocha and Soares, 2010).

Consequently, it took over a decade, starting in 1994, for most municipalities to

implement the policy, and the policy was not uniformly adopted as jurisdictions had

discretion in its implementation. Financial constraints, technological challenges, funding

and physician shortages, and the lack of political will to help people in rural areas also

slowed down the expansion of the PSF in certain areas (Macinko and Harris, 2015;

Noronha, 2010; WHO, 2008).12 While the slow roll out of the policy may be problematic

for several reasons, one particular concern is the endogeneity of the timing of the policy

due to its voluntary nature. Moreover, there is also evidence that the initial focus of the

program was poorer-than-average municipalities, so the roll out of the program was not

random (Macinko and Harris, 2015; WHO, 2008). As a result, the expansion of the

program to upper income groups, or even the middle-class, has been relatively slow. The

FMP in Turkey, therefore, represents an ideal opportunity to overcome several of the

endogeneity concerns affecting previous studies, thereby gaining greater precision in

terms of the effects of supply-side healthcare reforms.

         Another key difference between the two reforms is that in Brazil one of the tasks

of health-care teams is to establish links between patients and other social programs such

as conditional cash transfer programs, water and sanitation services, law enforcement,



12
  One potentially satisfactory way to deal with these issues could be to adopt a more flexible functional
form within a difference-in-differences strategy, for example, by relaxing the “parallel trends” assumption
between the treated and control municipalities via time trends. Rocha and Soares (2010) state that they
could not implement this type of a sensitivity analysis due to the significant loss in the degrees of freedom,
given that their data include a large number of municipalities. Instead, they allow for state-specific year
dummies. Recently, Reis (2014) deals with these selection issues exploiting variation in the PSF’s
availability across siblings in order to account for unobserved family as well as municipality level factors
that are constant over time. Unlike Rocha and Soares (2010), they find only weak evidence that the
availability of the program at the municipality level is related to better health indicators of children in
Brazil.


                                                      10
and schools (Macinko and Harris, 2015), whereas there is no such role assigned to family

physicians in the Turkish program. Furthermore, the Brazilian program relies heavily on

home visits initiated by health agents who are responsible for proactively identifying

individuals within communities with healthcare needs and to reach out to them before

they seek out care at clinics (Macinko and Harris, 2015). This process of linking patients

with healthcare specialists in a proactive manner is likely to be endogenous, and may lead

one to overestimate any positive impact of the program. In contrast, the FMP of Turkey is

fully funded through general tax revenues, and provides primary healthcare services to all

Turkish citizens, regardless of income, in Family Health Centers located within their

local neighborhoods. Finally, the Brazilian program exhibits much wider variation in

terms of quality and capacity of services provided, and only recently introduced a pay-

for-performance scheme which has been a key component of the Turkish reform from the

beginning.

       While valuable lessons have been gained from the aforementioned reforms,

several distinguishing characteristics of the FMP set it apart as a significant supply-side

reform to study. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes the first evaluation of the

impact of the FMP on health outcomes, measured by age-specific mortality rates. In the

subsequent section, we describe the important features of the FMP in more detail.

3. The Family Medicine Program

       The FMP was launched by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey, first

as a pilot in the province of Duzce in 2005 and then gradually expanded to all 81

provinces by the end of 2010 (See Appendix Table 1 for a list of all provinces with their

respective implementation dates). The program operates by assigning each Turkish




                                             11
citizen to a specific family physician who offers a wide range of primary healthcare

services free-of-charge. This is the key operational feature of the FMP, and has been

instrumental in the initial contact and the continuity of care as well as satisfaction and

trust between the physicians and the patients (Baris et al., 2011; Worldbank, 2012; WHO,

2014b). Importantly, all family physicians are public employees. In terms of

administration, the Public Health Institution of Turkey (PHIT) is responsible for the

oversight and broad management of the FMP. Moreover, in each province, the PHIT has

a Public Healthcare Directorate responsible for operations at the local level (OECD,

2014).

         The family physicians are recruited from several sources including the existing

pool of general practitioners, specialists within both the private and public sectors, and

recent graduates from medical schools. Specialists within both the public and private

sectors are allowed to join the FMP and those in the public sector could also exercise a

leave of absence from their current position for a period of two years to work as a family

physician (Worldbank, 2013b). With respect to new graduates, almost every medical

school in Turkey established departments of family medicine that offer a three-year

specialty training program (OECD, 2014). In order to meet a certain threshold of quality

standard, existing general practitioners and recent graduates of medical schools interested

in joining the FMP are required to complete a two-phased training program, including a

ten-day orientation administered in person, followed by a one-year distance-learning

program administered while working (OECD 2008, 2014; WHO 2012a). Between 2005

and 2011, approximately 45,000 GPs joined the FMP by going through these training

programs (Akdag, 2011).




                                             12
         The compensation package established as part of the FMP was also designed to

recruit high-quality physicians. For example, a capitation plus performance-based

payment system was introduced at the beginning of the program in order to allow family

medicine physicians to raise their salary by between 150 and 800% (Akdag, 2011).13

Furthermore, family physicians are required to meet pre-determined performance targets

in maternal and child health with regards to immunization, antenatal care, and follow-up

visits of registered new born babies.14 Failure to meet these targets can result in a salary

deduction of up to 20%, and repeated failures could result in contract termination. In

addition, an internet-based platform was established for family physicians to provide data

on maternal and child health activities, such as vaccinations and antenatal care to the

health information systems directorate at the Ministry of Health, which then provides

feedback on the target thresholds. Additionally, contracts include a point-based warning

and admonition system for violations of 35 pre-defined indicators, such as abiding with

working hours, and maintenance and security of patient health records. Family physicians

with penalty points exceeding 100 within a contract period have their contracts

terminated and are not allowed to apply for a new contract. Auditors from Community

Health Centers assess compliance and quality of service of Family Health Centers at least

once every six months, and a group of family physicians are randomly selected for

performance audits every month. Finally, in order to provide ongoing training, an

internet-based open platform was established for physicians to interact with each other

   Additionally, a set of performance indicators for chronic and non-communicable diseases, such as
screening for hypertension, obesity, and cancers, and control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients
have been moderately integrated into the performance-based payment scheme over time (Worldbank,
2013b).


                                                     13
and to facilitate peer-to-peer learning, which has served to improve quality of services

(Worldbank, 2013b).

         In terms of coverage of medications, patients are responsible for a 20%

copayment for out-patient pharmaceuticals.15 The copay is 10% for retirees. However, the

cost is fully covered if the price is less than the reimbursement limit (capped at 22% over

the least expensive brand), implying that most generics are fully covered, with patients

paying the difference between the actual cost and the cap if they choose brand-name

drugs. Furthermore, in-patient pharmaceuticals and medications for patients with

(physician confirmed) chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, cancer) are fully

covered (Celik and Seiter, 2008; Tatar et al., 2011). Contraceptives, such as birth control

pills and condoms are provided free-of-charge, whereas intrauterine devices are provided

at a subsidized price (Bernar-Dilbaz, 2010; Karaguzel, 2006).

         The FMP services are delivered through two primary channels: Family Health

Centers (FHCs) and Community Health Centers (CHCs). The FHCs staff family health

teams formed by at least one family physician and an equal number of family health

personnel including nurses and midwives. Basically, the FHCs are the clinics where

patient-specific preventive care services (immunization and monitoring of pregnant

women and infants) and diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative, and counseling services at the


15
   Prescription drugs and medical supplies are primarily purchased from nearby pharmacies as in most
developed countries. Establishing a pharmacy requires licensing by the government, and officials allocate a
larger share of new licenses in areas with relatively low concentration of pharmacies on a per capita basis
(Celik and Seiter, 2008; Tekiner, 2013). On average, there is one pharmacy per 3000 people (Celik and
Seiter, 2008; Tekiner, 2013). In remote and rural areas, where it is commercially less attractive and viable
to establish a pharmacy, mobile pharmacies are set up by the government to make it easier for citizens to
access to medications (Turkish Ministry of Health, 2010). Moreover, the Turkish Pharmaceutical Track-
and-Trace System (ITS) monitors the pharmaceutical market to ensure reliable supply of drugs to patients
(Unal, 2016). Family physicians are also able to provide pharmaceuticals in their own facilities in the case
of emergencies, as well as vaccinations for infants and children, which are provided free-of-charge by
family physicians (Turkish Ministry of Health 2010).


                                                    14
primary care level are provided. These centers serve as easily accessible walk-in clinics

as they are located within the neighborhoods where assigned citizens reside. Services can

be obtained by simply presenting an identification card without having to make an

appointment or to present any form of health insurance.

         The CHCs, on the other hand, are established to provide logistical support to

family physicians for public health services such as vaccination campaigns, health

promotion and education services, and environmental and occupational health services.

Moreover, the CHCs collect statistical data on public health services, and monitor and

evaluate the effectiveness of health services provided by the FHCs. Both the FHCs and

CHCs operate under the supervision of the Provincial Health Directorates that are

responsible for planning and provision of health services at provincial level and

accountable to the PHIT.

         Prior to the FMP, the delivery of primary healthcare services had been managed

through a highly hierarchical and fragmented system, which was difficult for patients to

understand and navigate through.16 Launched in 1992, the Green Card—the “Yesil

Kart”—program was the flagship social protection mechanism that targeted the poor. The

Green Card program, a means-tested, noncontributory national health insurance scheme

for the poor, covered only inpatient treatment costs of the eligible beneficiaries in public


16
   Under the Green Card Program, Turkish citizens living within the borders of the Republic of Turkey
could be eligible if i) they were not covered by any social security schemes and ii) they have per capita
household incomes of less than one-third of the gross minimum wage (except for taxes and social security
premiums). Moreover, pensioners over 65 years old and people with chronic illnesses could be eligible,
regardless of their household incomes (Worldbank, 2013a). The benefits of the program were expanded
under the FMP: outpatient services (in 2004) and prescription drugs (as of January 2005) in public facilities
were included in the benefits package. In 2012, the Green Card program was integrated into the universal
health insurance scheme (Worldbank, 2013a). Limiting the analysis sample to 2001-2012 or 2001-2011
produces a similar pattern of results. The nationwide expansion of the benefits over time improved
utilization of healthcare services among the poor. Note that our paper controls for common trends in order
to identify the effect of the FMP.


                                                     15
facilities until 2004. Among the non-poor, health insurance was publicly provided based

on occupational type. Among these disparate insurance plans, there was significant

variation with respect to coverage and price of health services, the types of healthcare

providers that were allowed to cover, and payment programs including co-payments and

other fees (Atun, 2015; Robila, 2013). Moreover, even when individuals had nominal

health insurance, many lacked access to healthcare providers and dispensaries,

particularly in rural areas, and healthcare providers also lacked staff and operational

resources (OECD, 2008). Accordingly, there were wide disparities in access and quality

of primary healthcare services. The FMP harmonized the coverage of healthcare services

to all citizens regardless of occupation or income, which were all provided free-of-

charge, under the unified Social Security Institute (SSI). The primary healthcare benefits

package includes a wide range of primary healthcare services with a particular focus on

maternal and child health, and the elderly (WHO, 2012a; WHO, 2012b).17

         Many individuals relied on hospitals as their source of primary care prior to the

FMP, and this has been shown to overburden hospitals generating over-crowding and

long-waiting times (Baris et al, 2011; OECD, 2008; Tatar et al., 2011). While reducing

waiting times at secondary-level facilities was not a major goal of the program, the FMP

directly encouraged greater utilization of primary care facilities as a first point of contact,

thereby reducing pressure on secondary-level facilities. For example, the FMP waived

co-payments at secondary-level facilities only if patients had a referral from their primary

care family physician (OECD, 2008; Tatar et al., 2011). There is qualitative evidence to

suggest that the introduction of the FMP led to better access and shorter waiting times

                                                    16
among those seeking primary care services, while at the same time improving the quality

of care by providing a relief on overburdened hospitals (Akdag, 2008; Dagdeviren and

Akturk, 2004; OECD, 2008; Vujicic et al., 2009; WHO 2012a). Consequently, outcome

quality for hospital care as measured by patient satisfaction increased substantially

between 2003 and 2010 from 39.5% to 73.1% (Tatar et al. 2011).

         The FMP also included health services aimed at prevention, early detection, and

management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).18 Prior to the FMP, health services

related to prevention and management of NCDs were only provided at hospitals, and high

co-payments were often a barrier (OECD, 2008). Cancer and hypertension screening,

blood pressure control in hypertensive patients, and blood glucose control in diabetic

patients are provided free-of-charge by family physicians. Moreover, family physicians

are allowed to prescribe anti-hypertensive drugs (except for angiotensin receptor

blockers), anti-diabetic drugs (except for insulin), and cholesterol lowering drugs (after

specialist recommendation), which are also free-of-charge (WHO, 2014b).

         Finally, family physicians may also change health behaviors of mothers by

providing information to mothers concerning the importance of hygiene, and encourage

basic sanitation techniques to prevent infectious diseases. They can also provide parents

with information about how to treat and prevent diarrhea using simple methods, which

may help reduce mortality, especially among infants (Gürel, 2009; Hisar and Hisar, 2012;

Suluhan et al., 2014).19




18
   NCDs accounted for approximately 86% of all mortalities in Turkey in 2012, mainly due to
cardiovascular diseases (47%) and cancers (22%) (WHO, 2014c).
19
   Given the reduced-form research design of our analysis, we are not able to identify the exact channels
through which the FMP influences mortality rates.


                                                    17
4. Data

         We gathered data from several sources to examine the effect of the FMP on age-

specific mortality rates between 2001 and 2014. Information on the FMP was obtained

from the PHIT. Our treatment variable is constructed in a number of alternative ways.

First, we generate a binary indicator for the presence of the FMP in a particular province

in a given year. Next, we employ a continuous measure defined as the number of years

since the implementation of the FMP in order to explore any dynamic patterns in the

relationship between the program and the outcome measures. Finally, we consider a non-

parametric relationship between the FMP and mortality by employing separate binary

indicators for post-implementation years from 1 to 5 and beyond. In Appendix Table 1,

we present the year of implementation of the FMP as well as the number of citizens per

family physicians for year 2013. The PHIT aims to provide one family physician for

about every 3500 persons in a province, and the evidence suggests that this goal has been

achieved rather rapidly following the introduction of the program (Dogac et al., 2014;

Öcek, 2014; Tirpan, 2010; Worldbank, 2013c).20

         Data on age-specific mortality rates come from the Turkish Statistical Institute

(TurkStat). All-age mortality rate (AMR) represents the number of deaths per 1000

people. Infant mortality rate (IMR) reflects the number of deaths among infants up to 12

months of age per 1000 live births. Child mortality rate (CMR) pertains to the number of

deaths per 1000 children between the ages 1 and 4. Finally, the elderly mortality rate

(EMR) represents the number of deaths per 1000 people among those who are at least 55

years of age.

         We account for several time-varying determinants of mortality measured either at

the province or sub-regional level in the analysis. Note that Turkey is classified into 12

regions and 26 sub-regions in addition to 81 provinces by TurkStat. These control

variables represent characteristics that may affect mortality either directly or may be

correlated with other factors that may influence mortality.21 The full list includes the

number of students per teacher in primary schools, the number of motor vehicles per

1000 persons, the unemployment rate, income per capita, the percentage of population

with at least a high school degree, and the percentage of population with at least a college

degree.22 In addition, we also control for the percentage share of seats controlled by the

governing party in the parliament for each province to account for the possibility that the

FMP might have expanded across provinces in a way that is correlated with the timing of

other investments by the government.23 Information on age-specific province populations

comes from the TurkStat. Finally, we include in our analysis binary indicators




21
   Income and related indicators of socio-economic development and urbanization have been shown to be
related to population health including mortality (e.g., Cutler et al., 2006; Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006). The
underlying theory of the role of education and income in the health production process developed in the
seminal work by Grossman posits that increased educational attainment and income related characteristics
improve individual health through greater productive efficiency (Grossman, 1972). In other words,
domestic product per capita (representing income) and education variables serve to shift the total product
curve for medical care upward, so that at each level of medical care, more health (less mortality) is
achieved.
22
   Among these variables, the first two are measured at the province level and the rest are only available at
the sub-regional level. For variables that are measured at the sub-regional level, we use the same value for
every province within the same sub-region. Therefore, there can be a maximum of 364 unique values for
each year for each of these variables. These regional and sub-regional classifications are generated for
statistical purposes based on geographic proximity and socio-economic similarities within the associated
region. The TurkStat collects and processes data from different sources on a variety of topics including
demographic characteristics and health. See http://www.turkstat.gov.tr for more information.
23
   Between 2001 and 2013, Turkey had three general elections (2002, 2007, and 2011), in which the members
of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey were elected.

representing missing observations for each covariate. Our analysis sample consists of

1134 province-year observations between 2001 and 2014.24

        It is well-known that official statistics on mortality from developing countries,

especially those on infant mortality, suffer from considerable measurement error

(Anthopoulos and Becker, 2010; Cesur, Tekin, and Ulker, 2016, 2017; Gruber et al.,

2014). This measurement error is typically caused by factors such as difficulties in

obtaining an accurate count of deaths due to religious and cultural practices observed in

the burials of the dead, and the large number of births delivered at non-hospital settings.

Therefore, the official statistics on infant mortality tend to under-represent the actual

number of deaths. Recognizing the measurement error in the official data, international

organizations like the United Nations and the WHO adjust for under-reporting by

employing information from various sources such as official vital registries, census data,

and demographic surveys (Gruber et al., 2014). This usually results in a discrepancy

between the official mortality data released by national statistical agencies and

international organizations.

        In the present study, we only use data obtained from TurkStat because province

level mortality statistics are not available from other sources. As demonstrated in Cesur,

Tekin, and Ulker (2017), the trends in national infant mortality rates obtained from

TurkStat data and the data from the United Nations and the WHO follow each other very

closely. For example, the pairwise correlations in the infant mortality rate between

TurkStat data and the series from the United Nations and the WHO are both 97%. The



24
  The numbers of missing observations are 243 for unemployment rate, percentage of population with a
high school degree, and percentage of population with a college degree, 486 for income per capita, and 81
for number of students per teacher.


                                                   20
availability of FMP may cause a shift in deliveries from homes towards hospitals, which

may then result in a decrease in infant mortality. This can be interpreted as a program

effect. At the same time, such a shift from home births towards hospital deliveries may

improve the accuracy of accounting in the number of infant deaths. In this case, one may

still obtain an effect on infant mortality simply due to less under-reporting in infant

deaths even if the FMP had no real impact on infant mortality. It is important to note that

such bias would go against finding a negative impact of the FMP on mortality, especially

for infants.25

           Descriptive statistics on age-specific mortality rates and the control variables are

presented in Panel A and Panel B of Table 1, respectively. As displayed in Panel A, the

mortality rates are 10.6 and 0.6 per 1000 for infants and children between ages 1-4,

respectively. The mortality rate for those aged 55 and older is 20.1 per 1000. A

comparison between the subsample of observations with and without the FMP reveals

that mortality rates are higher in the FMP provinces for all age categories.

           As shown in Panel B of Table 1, the time-variant province characteristics also

vary considerably between province-year observations with and without the FMP. For

example, observations with the FMP appear to have a higher number of motor vehicles

per 1000 persons, higher income and education, and smaller classrooms at schools. The

pattern in these differences is consistent with the view that the pace by which the FMP

has expanded might have been positively associated with a higher level of urbanization

and economic development.




25
     Random measurement error in any of our outcome variables would lead to imprecision in our estimates.


                                                     21
5. Econometric Framework

       Our approach to obtaining the causal impact of the FMP on mortality outcomes is

to implement a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, taking advantage of the fact

that the program was rolled out in a staggered basis across provinces and over time. In

doing so, we compare the differences in the outcome variables in provinces before and

after the FMP implementation net of those provinces without the FMP in place. This

empirical strategy can be expressed by the following equation:

  Yrpt = β0 + Xrptβ1 + β2 FMP0rpt + β3 FMP+rpt + δrt + λp + φp t + φp t2 + εrpt,        (1)

where Yrpt is the logarithm of one of the age-specific mortality rates measured in

province p in region r in year t. The vector Xrpt represents time-varying province level

characteristics. The FMP implementation is represented by two separate variables in Eq.

(1). The FMP0rpt and FMP+rpt are binary indicators representing the year of

implementation and all years following the year of implementation, respectively. This

approach assumes that the impact of the FMP in the year of implementation may be

different from subsequent years. The program impact in the year of implementation is

expected to be smaller than all the subsequent years for two reasons. First, unless the

program is launched on the first day of the year in every province, the length of time the

FMP is in effect in the first year is a fraction of a full year. Accordingly, we expect the

program impact to be a fraction of a full-year effect in the first year. Second, it would

likely take some time for all program components to become fully operational, and for all

citizens to identify and register with their designated family physicians. Based on this

formulation, any program impact in the year of implementation is captured by the

coefficient on FMP0rpt and the program effect in all the subsequent years is represented




                                              22
by the coefficient on FMP+rpt.26 As discussed, we will further relax the pattern in the

relationship between the FMP and mortality by allowing for a more flexible specification.

         The variable δrt is a set of region-by-year fixed effects. This is included in the

model in an attempt to control for common trends and shocks to mortality that might be

correlated with health investments including the FMP at the regional level. The region-

by-year fixed effects would also account for time trends that are common across all

provinces. Accounting for such trends is important because there have been a number of

other health- and non-health related initiatives implemented during our analysis period,

including the introduction of mobile pharmacy and helicopter-based emergency medical

services to improve access to healthcare in rural areas. However, since these policies

became effective nationwide concurrently, their effects should be captured by region-by-

year fixed effects. The variable λp represents province fixed effects accounting for

permanent differences across provinces such as poverty as well as cultural and traditional

practices, which likely remained time-invariant during the analysis period. The terms, φp t

and φp t2, represent linear and quadratic province-specific time trends, respectively. These

trends would capture the influence of difficult-to-measure factors at the province level

that trend either linearly or quadratically over time. Finally, εrpt is the idiosyncratic error

term. The parameters of interest in Eq. (1) are β2 and β3, which, respectively, represent the

average change in the outcome of interest during and after the year of implementation of

the FMP, net of any change in the outcome variable in control provinces.


26
   An alternative approach could be to define the treatment variable as a fraction of a binary indicator in the
first year based on the month of implementation and assign a binary indicator for all other years.
Unfortunately, we do not have information on the exact date of implementation of the FMP in each
province. Our approach has been used previously to study program impacts in similar contexts. For
example, see Courtemanche and Zapata (2014), and Kolstad and Kowalski (2012) as two recent
applications in which the authors split the treatment indicator to separate its effects during implementation
and afterwards in studying the impact of the Massachusetts healthcare reform.


                                                      23
       The key identifying assumption in the difference-in-differences method is that in

the absence of the FMP implementation, any mortality differences between the treatment

and the control provinces would continue along the same trend. However, it is plausible

that the provinces that are early adopters of the FMP began investing on health

infrastructure on the years prior to the FMP implementation. In this scenario, these pre-

existing trends could cause spurious positive correlation between the treatment and

mortality. We relax the parallel trends assumption by successively including province

specific linear and quadratic trends in Eq. (1). Controlling for these trends could serve a

particularly important function by gauging these pre-existing differences in mortality

trends across provinces.

       If the set of fixed effects and province-specific trends described above do in fact

capture the unobserved characteristics that may be correlated with both the FMP and

mortality rates, then we would expect the time-varying characteristics included in

specification (1) to be inconsequential in terms of influencing the effect of the FMP. One

indirect way to test this is to consider the pairwise correlations between an indicator

representing the presence of the FMP and these characteristics, and examine how these

correlations change as we sequentially add the fixed effects and the trend terms. To do

this, we regress time-varying province characteristics on a binary indicator variable for

the presence of the FMP at the province level using various specifications. The estimates

from these regressions are presented in Table 2A. Note that each cell in this table

corresponds to an estimate from a separate regression. As shown in column (1) of Table

2A, there is considerable variation between provinces with and without the FMP as they

differ along all of the observable characteristics including unemployment rate, number of




                                             24
vehicles per 1000 persons, per capita income, percent of population with a high school

degree, and number of students per teacher. The evidence from Table 2A suggests that

having the FMP at the province level is positively associated with characteristics that

capture various dimensions associated with being more urban and socio-economically

developed.27 However, much of these differences disappear once we control for the time-

varying differences across regions in column (2). However, it is really when we control

for permanent differences across provinces through province level fixed effects, in

column (3), all of the observable differences between the two types of provinces become

unrelated to the FMP. In fact, none of the estimates in column (3) are economically or

statistically significant. This pattern remains preserved when we add province-specific

linear and quadratic time trends in columns (4) and (5), respectively.

         Next, we repeat the same exercise by replacing the binary treatment indicator with

a continuous variable representing the number of years lapsed since the FMP

implementation. Estimates from these regressions, which are displayed in Table 2B, paint

a picture similar to the one displayed in Table 2A. Specifically, province characteristics

are significantly and sizably related to the number of years that the program has been in

place in a province, suggesting a more rapid adoption of the FMP in provinces that are




27
   Although the program roll out does not appear to be random with respect to province characteristics, the
FMP was introduced by the central government with the mandate to establish universal coverage
eventually. Accordingly, the differences in the timing of implementation across provinces and over time
primarily have to do with logistical and staffing considerations. In the end, all of the 81 provinces in
Turkey had implemented the FMP during the analysis period. Therefore, there is no concern over selection
bias that could be caused by certain provinces with a particular set of characteristics never getting the
treatment. Furthermore, even if the implementation of the FMP appears to be non-random, any resulting
bias could be eliminated by controlling for province fixed effects to the extent that the pattern of the roll out
is only correlated with the pre-existing differences across provinces that are time-invariant (Rocha and
Soares, 2010).


                                                      25
more urban and economically developed than other provinces. But again, this pattern

disappears once we control for fixed effects and trends.28

         The empirical model specified in Eq. (1) constrains the impact of the FMP on

mortality to be homogenous in all years following its implementation. Accordingly, the

results from this model may mask important differences in the dynamics regarding the

evolution of the program impacts if the underlying relationships between the FMP and

outcomes in consideration are not constant over time. As mentioned above, it may take

some time for the FMP to become fully operational and effective since some citizens may

not be aware of the program in the beginning, or may be reluctant to switch from their

existing practices initially. It may also take a while before citizens identify their

designated family physicians, learn about and get familiarized with the healthcare

services available to them, and begin utilizing these services. Accordingly, the program

effects may be felt gradually over an extended period of time. Regardless, this is a

question that can ultimately be answered by modifying Eq. (1) in ways that would allow

for a more flexible relationship between the FMP and the outcome measures. We

consider two flexible specifications. First, we replace the binary treatment variable with a

continuous measure defined as the number of years since the implementation of the FMP:

         Yrpt = β0 + Xrptβ1 + β2 Years_since_FMPrpt + δrt + λp + φp t + φp t2 + εrpt.                (2)

         Second, we consider a flexible non-parametric specification, in which we include

separate dummy variables for various years since the implementation of the FMP:


28
   To gain additional insights about the pattern in which the FMP has expanded across provinces and over
time, we also estimate the binary FMP indicator and the number of years since the FMP implementation
measures on jointly specified time-varying province characteristics. This analysis indicates that province
characteristics are initially significantly related to the FMP implementation even with all these
characteristics entered into the model jointly. However, none of the estimates remain significant in both the
statistical and the practical sense once we control for province fixed effects and province-specific trends.
Full results from this analysis are available from the authors upon request.

         We estimate all of our models using weighted regressions with province

population for the relevant age category used as a weight.29 Finally, we present standard

errors that are robust to clustering at the province level, making statistical inference

robust to arbitrary forms of both heteroskedasticity and serial correlation within

provinces over time (Bertrand et al., 2004).

         We begin by presenting the estimates on the impact of the FMP indicators on the

logarithm of age-specific mortality rates in Table 3. We report the mortality estimates for

various age categories arrayed in columns (1) through (4) including all-age mortality rate,

the infant mortality rate, the mortality rate for children ages 1-4, and the mortality rate

among the elderly (age 55 and older). Focusing on Panel A of Table 3, in which we only

control for province fixed effects and region-by-year fixed effects, we observe that the

FMP is not significantly associated with any of the four measures of mortality during the

year in which the program is launched. Furthermore, the estimates are all small in

magnitude. As discussed above, this is not surprising since the FMP is in operation for

only a fraction of a full year in its first year of implementation. While the FMP does not

influence mortality in the year of adoption, it has a negative effect in all subsequent


29
  The results from unweighted regressions are very similar to those presented in this paper, though the
coefficients are somewhat less precisely estimated. This is not surprising because there are several very
low-densely populated provinces (these are provinces with fewer than 300,000 persons representing around
5% of all the country) for which the impact of the FMP is not representative of the program effect more
generally. This is because the key operational feature of the FMP entails an initial contact between a family
physician and each citizen, which presumably progresses into a continuous and long-term relationship with
regular checkups at conveniently located neighborhood clinics. This relationship is likely to be more
challenging to establish in these sparsely populated provinces. Therefore, not employing population
weights would give undue influence to these small provinces in estimating the average effect of the FMP
on the population. In fact, when we exclude these sparsely populated provinces from the analysis, the
estimates become robust to not using weights.


                                                     27
years. As shown in the first row of Panel A, all four coefficients are negative and

statistically significant. In panels B and C, we successively add province-specific linear

and quadratic trends to the specification. As we control for province-specific linear trends

in Panel B and quadratic trends in Panel C, the estimates on the FMP impact on the year

of implementation remains small and statistically insignificant, but importantly changes

sign with the exception of child mortality. Note that these trend variables would capture

the influence of difficult-to-measure time-varying differences or differences in pre-

existing trends across provinces. To the extent that these factors are correlated with the

timing of a province implementing the FMP, the change in the sign of the treatment

indicator in the year of implementation is not surprising. Regarding the program effect

on all subsequent years, the estimates continue to remain negative and highly significant

after accounting for these trends. Finally, Panel D adds time-varying characteristics

measured at the province or sub-region level as described in Section 3. As expected, our

estimates are robust to controlling for these observable characteristics. Focusing on point

estimates for the program effect in the years following the year of implementation, the

FMP is associated with an 11% (e-0.112-1) decrease in the overall mortality rate. With a

mean mortality rate of 2.95 per 1000 persons for the sub-sample without an FMP, this

estimate implies that the FMP reduced mortality by about 0.32 per 1000 persons. Turning

to age-specific mortality estimates, the impact of the FMP on infant mortality is 25.6% (e-
0.296
        -1), while the effect on the elderly mortality rate is 7.7% (e-0.080-1). With the sample

mean for infant mortality at 10.16 per 1000 infants and for the elderly at 16.70 per 1000

elderly persons, these estimates translate to reductions of mortality by 2.6 per 1000

among infants and 1.29 per 1000 among the elderly. Finally, the estimate of the impact




                                                  28
of the FMP on child mortality rate is 0.260 per 1000, which is equivalent to a marginal

effect of 22.9%. Despite the marginal effect being sizeable, the number of lives saved

among children ages 1-4 is only 0.13 per 1000 due to the small number of deaths among

this group in the baseline.

        The results in Table 3 are derived from a specification that constraints the

estimate of the impact of FMP on mortality to be the same in all years after the year of

program implementation. This is a restrictive assumption if the FMP effect becomes

more pronounced over time for the reasons described in the previous section. To explore

any dynamic relationship between the FMP and mortality rates, we next turn to results

from the estimation of the models specified in Eqs. (2) and (3). As shown in the top panel

of Table 4, the impact of the FMP on mortality rate is statistically significant, negative,

and increasing in absolute terms over time for all outcomes. In particular, each additional

year of FMP implementation reduces the mortality rate by 23.7% (e-0.271-1) among

infants, by 24.8% (e-0.286-1) among children ages 1-4, and by 7.7% (e-0.080-1) among the

elderly. Although the largest estimate is for the mortality rate among children ages 1-4,

the actual lives saved by the FMP is again the lowest for this group of children due to a

very small baseline mortality rate among them.

        The dynamic nature of the relationship between the FMP and the mortality rate is

more apparent in the bottom panel of Table 4, which shows results from a more flexible

specification. These estimates indicate a strong and negative relationship between the

FMP and mortality for all age groups. Furthermore, the effect appears to be persistent and

accumulating over time, consistent with the notion that the program saves more lives the

longer it is in effect.




                                             29
        The estimates presented in Tables 3 and 4 are based on specifications, which

control for any unobservable province-level characteristics, and investments in healthcare

that are trending linearly or quadratically over time. If these province-specific trends

sufficiently capture pre-existing differences in mortality rates, then we should see no

discernable impact of the FMP in the years prior to its implementation. One way to test

whether this condition is satisfied is to conduct an event-study analysis, which allows us

to trace out differences in mortality rates between treatment and control provinces in the

periods leading up to and following the implementation of the FMP.30 The results from

this analysis are presented graphically in Fig. 1, and numerically in Table 5. For ease of

illustration, estimates from the bottom panel of Table 4 are also presented alongside the

event-study estimates in Table 5. As shown in Fig. 1 and the even-numbered columns of

Table 5, the placebo effects – the estimates representing the periods prior to the FMP

implementation - are all statistically insignificant, suggesting no evidence of differences

in pre-existing trends in mortality rates across provinces once we account for province-

specific trends in the regressions. It is also reassuring that, following the implementation

of the FMP, the estimates of the impact of the FMP on mortality becomes stronger over

time. This pattern is consistent with the estimates shown in Table 4. In fact, a

comparison between the sets of estimates shown side-by-side in Table 5 suggests that

they are largely in line with each other, especially after the second year of

implementation of the FMP. Again, we ascribe this pattern to the notion that it takes

some time for the positive program effects to emerge.

                                                   30
       To gain further insights into the exact nature of the differences in pre-existing

trends in mortality rates across the treatment and control provinces, we performed a series

of sensitivity analyses. In particular, we obtained event-study estimates using several

specifications, each of which assumes that the pre-existing trends follow a different

structure. The results from these analyses are presented separately for each of the four

mortality outcomes in Appendix Tables 2A-2D. For the sake of consistency with Table 5,

we begin by showing estimates from a specification that imposes the treatment effect to

be zero for all the time periods prior to the FMP implementation (column 1). Next, we

present the estimates from a specification that allows for pre-existing trends to differ at

the regional level by controlling for region-by-year fixed effects (column 2), followed by

a specification that captures province-specific linear trends (column 3), and both linear

and quadratic trends (column 4). In all of these specifications, we also account for

permanent differences across provinces through province fixed effects, as well as time-

varying characteristics either measured at the province or sub-regional levels. As

indicated by the estimates in columns 2 and 3 of Appendix Table 2A, there appears to be

pre-existing trends in all-age mortality rate that are not fully captured by region-by-year

fixed effects or province-specific linear trends. It is only after we account for province-

specific quadratic trends in column 4 that these pre-treatment trends become

indistinguishable from zero. As shown in Appendix Tables 2B-2D, this pattern is similar

for infant, child, and elderly mortality rates. The evidence from this exercise suggests that

there are indeed differences in mortality rates across provinces that are time-varying and

trending quadratically. We view this as evidence that, in order to obtain credible




                                             31
estimates of the impact of FMP on mortality, it is important to account for these

differences in the analyses.

       The results discussed so far assume that the impact of the FMP on mortality rates

does not depend on initial levels of mortality. However, as the program allowed all

citizens to gain access to free public healthcare regardless of their current insurance status

or ability-to-pay for care it is possible that even small improvements in access to

healthcare could generate meaningful health benefits among provinces with poorer initial

health conditions. To test whether the effect of the FMP differs by baseline mortality

levels, we estimated the specifications shown in Tables 3 and 4 separately for provinces

with mortality rates above and then below the median. As shown in Table 6, the results

from this analysis indicate that the overall patterns in the estimate of the impact of the

FMP on age-specific mortality rates are similar between the two types of provinces.

However, the estimates are larger and more precisely estimated for provinces with

mortality rates above the median, as shown in Panel A. Not only are the program effects

more acute for high-mortality provinces, they also set in more quickly. As shown by the

estimates from the non-parametric specification in Panel A, the FMP effect becomes

statistically significant in the second year following the introduction of the FMP for all

four measures of mortality rates. Moreover, it sets in even quicker in the case of infant

and elderly mortality where the estimate on the FMP indicator is negative and statistically

significant in the first year after implementation. In contrast, the corresponding estimates

for provinces with mortality rates below the median are smaller and do not become

significant before either the third or fourth year after the introduction of the program for

the all-age mortality rate and the mortality rates among infants and the elderly, and the




                                             32
fifth year for the mortality rate among children ages 1-4. One implication of the results

presented in Table 6 is that mortality rates may be converging as a result of the FMP.

This finding is consistent with Gruber et al. (2014), who showed reduced geographical

disparities in infant mortality following the health reform in Thailand.

       As stated earlier, a key innovation of the FMP is the assignment of every Turkish

citizen to a specific family physician. We therefore estimate marginal productivity of

each additional family physician in terms of lives saved. To this end, we regress mortality

rates on the number of family physicians per province, along with other control variables

specified in Eq. (1). One potential problem with this approach is that the actual number of

physicians is likely to be endogenous to mortality and health outcomes. For example,

according to the policy rules outlined by the PHIT, the target is to assign about 3500

citizens to every family physician. As shown in Appendix Table 1, this target appears to

have been achieved in 2013. Specifically, there were 3493 citizens per family physician

on average in 2013 strikingly close to the target rate. That being said, there is still

considerable variation across provinces with the number of citizens served by a physician

higher than the target figure of 3500 in many of the urban and developed provinces (e.g.,

Ankara, Antalya, Bursa, Istanbul, and Yalova) and considerably lower in some rural

provinces (e.g., Bayburt, Bartin, Hakkari, Yozgat). This is not surprising since citizens

typically have more options (e.g., public and private hospitals, polyclinics, doctors’

offices) in urban areas compared to rural areas where options are more limited and

distantly located. Furthermore, more doctors are needed to overcome access challenges

in rural areas where many people live in sparsely populated settlement areas that are often

distant from each other. That being said, some of the provinces in the Southwestern




                                              33
region of Turkey (e.g., Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, Siirt, Hakkari) appear to have fallen

short of the target rate despite their rural locations. This is likely due, at least in part, to

security concerns related to terrorism and civil unrest in those areas. In sum, the number

of family physicians per capita is likely to be determined by a variety of factors, some of

which are potentially endogenous to mortality.

        To overcome these endogeneity concerns, we adopt a two-stage least squares

regression approach in which the target rate for family physicians per capita is used as an

instrumental variable (IV) for the actual number of doctors per capita. The advantage of

this approach is that the measure for each province is only a function of the exogenously

determined program rule. We then use the predicted number of physicians in the second-

stage mortality regressions. The results from the first stage model in which we regress

the actual number of doctors on the target number of doctors dictated FMP

(population/3500 citizens) along with other variables in Eq. (1) are shown in Table 7A.

The point estimate in Table 7A indicates that each additional 3500 citizens generates

another 0.937 additional family physician, a figure very close to the target rate of one

doctor per 3500 persons. Given the central role that family physicians play in the FMP,

and the emphasis placed on achieving the specified target rate since the beginning, it is

not surprising that the coefficient in the first stage is highly precisely estimated. The IV

estimates are displayed in Table 7B. We present estimates for the marginal impact of a

family physician on each of the three age-specific mortality rates in Panel A. All three

estimates are negative and statistically significant ranging from 0.01 to 0.03%, indicating

that an additional family physician lowers the mortality rate for each age category.




                                                34
       To put these estimates into further context, we next present results from an

instrumental variables regression, in which we replaced the rates of mortality with the

number of deaths for each age category in Panel B. The advantage of this specification is

that it approximates the marginal product of an additional family physician in terms of

number of lives saved. These estimates indicate that an additional family physician

lowers the number of deaths among infants by 0.15, among the elderly by 0.46, and

among children ages 1-4 by 0.005, respectively. Assuming a constant marginal product of

physicians, a back of the envelope calculation obtained by multiplying these effect sizes

with the total number of family physicians (21,384 in 2013) in Turkey reveals that the

lives of 3101 infants, 9922 elderly citizens, and 107 children ages 1-4 saved by family

physicians in 2013 alone.

       Finally, we perform a similar analysis to investigate the role of family health

centers in reducing mortality. Note that these centers serve as clinics for family

physicians where they offer healthcare services to citizens on a walk-in-basis. To test

whether an increase in the density of family health centers translates into reduced

mortality rates, we gathered data on the annual number of family health centers for each

province and constructed a density measure as defined by the number of centers per 100

km2 (equivalent to about 38.6 miles2). As shown in Table 8, the results from this analysis

indicate that each family health center within a 100 km2 lowers the rate of mortality by

3.7% among infants, 3.5% among children ages 1-4, and by 2.5% among the elderly.

These results are informative in illustrating the importance of easily accessible and

conveniently located services within local neighborhoods. However, similar to the

assignment of the number of family physicians, the number of family health centers in a




                                            35
province is likely to be endogenously determined. Unlike the case for the number of

family physicians, we do not have a policy rule that specifies a target level, which can

then be leveraged to construct an exogenous measure. Therefore, we caution the reader

against making causal inferences using these estimates.

6.1. Robustness Analyses

       One way to gain further confidence in our results is to identify a set of outcomes

for which the FMP should have no impact, and then conduct a placebo analysis using

these outcomes. One set of potentially good candidates for this purpose is the outcomes

related to injury and death rates associated with traffic accidents. To perform this

analysis, we gathered data on province-specific annual rates of traffic accidents, accident

deaths and injuries from TurkStat. Then we estimated our regressions for these outcome

variables using our most comprehensive specification. The results from this placebo

analysis are presented in Appendix Table 3. As shown in Panels A-C, regardless of how

we define the treatment variable, the impact of the FMP on these three outcomes appear

to be indistinguishable from zero with all estimates being statistically insignificant. The

only exception is a coefficient on the year-two indicator in Panel C for traffic accident

deaths. In Panels D and E of Appendix Table 3, we show placebo estimates for the

models of the predicted number of family physicians and family health centers. As

expected, neither family physicians nor family health centers appear to have any impact

on traffic accidents, nor do they reduce injuries or deaths associated with these accidents.

Taken together, the evidence presented in Appendix Table 3 lessens concerns over bias

from potential endogeneity, and lends further support to the hypothesis that the FMP had

a causal negative impact on age-specific mortality rates.




                                             36
         Next, we assess the sensitivity of our results to changes in reporting of the

outcome values over time. If, for example, the FMP influences internal migration

decisions, then the denominator in the outcome variables would be affected, which might

in turn cause our estimates to be biased. To assess the sensitivity of our results to

potential changes in the outcome variables due to factors correlated with the FMP, we

estimated our models using the populations at the base period denominator and

logarithms of the total number of deaths for the associated age category. The implications

of our primary results remained identical to these robustness analyses. The estimates

from the analysis using population at the baseline in the denominator are shown in

Appendix Table 4.31

         Recall that the end points in the pre- and post-implementation periods in our non-

parametric specification are ≥5+ years and ≤-5 years. Accordingly, the number of

observations for which these indicators take on the value of one varies by province since

provinces implemented the FMP at different times during the analysis period. In our final

robustness analysis, we estimate our models using a much more conservative sample

defined by imposing the condition that every province has exactly five years of data prior

to and following the FMP implementation by eliminating observations for any province

beyond five years on either end. By doing this, we get a sense of whether our estimates

are dominated by these observations at either end points of the analysis period. The

results from this exercise are presented in Appendix Table 5. Although the coefficients

are less precisely estimated due to significant reductions in sample size, the overall

evidence points to a negative effect of the FMP on all four mortality outcomes, regardless


31
   In the interest of space, we do not show results from the analysis using the numerator values. These
results are available from the authors upon request.


                                                    37
of the way the treatment measure is constructed. Furthermore, the estimates indicate that

the program effect gets stronger over time, again a pattern consistent with our earlier

results. Finally, in the bottom two panels of the table, we present estimates from the

models for the marginal effect of a family physician and a family health center using a

balanced sample. Again, despite a reduction in sample size, these estimates are still

negative and statistically significant. The only exception is the estimate of the impact of

FMP on mortality among children ages 1-4, for which the estimate is negative but

imprecisely estimated. Note that in addition to the reduced sample size, the variation in

the child mortality rate is quite low to begin with due to a very smaller number of deaths

among this group.

7. Conclusions

       Over the past decade, the Turkish healthcare system has undergone a major

transformation marked by significant investments in infrastructure, education of

healthcare personnel, modernization of patient tracking and payment systems, and most

importantly, the launching of the Family Medicine Program (FMP). With the introduction

of the FMP in 2005, Turkey has essentially established a socialized healthcare system for

primary healthcare service under which every Turkish citizen is ensured a comprehensive

package of healthcare services free-of-charge irrespective of the citizens’ income or

ability to pay. In addition to being a publicly funded program with universal coverage,

the FMP contains a few other components that make it a particularly interesting and

unique case to study. First and foremost, the key operational feature of the reform is the

assignment of every Turkish citizen to a designated family physician who offers a wide

range of healthcare services to the public in easily accessible neighborhood clinics.




                                             38
Second, the program established a capitation plus performance-based compensation

system designed to improve the quality of care.

       This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of the FMP on

the outcomes of age-specific mortality rates using province level data between 2001 and

2014. To identify the causal effect of the FMP, we exploit the variation in program

implementation across provinces and over time using a difference-in-differences

estimation strategy. Our results indicate that the FMP has a significant negative impact on

mortality rates for all age groups considered. According to our point estimates, the

program reduces mortality by 11% among the all-age category, 25.6% among infants,

22.9% among children ages 1-4 and 7.7% among the elderly. These estimates translate

into reductions in mortality by 2.6 infants per 1000, 1.29 elderly persons per 1000, and

0.13 children ages 1-4 per 1000. According to our analysis for the marginal productivity

of a family physician, each physician saves 0.15 infants, 0.46 elderly persons and 0.005

children per province. Furthermore, the effect of the FMP appears to be strongest among

provinces with a higher baseline mortality, suggesting that the program might also have

contributed to an equalization of mortality across provinces over time.

       Supply-side approaches aimed at achieving universal coverage, while ensuring

affordability through public provision, and coupled with provider incentives to improve

quality and control costs, are becoming of increasing interest to governments and

international health organizations (United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions

Network, 2014; WHO, 2014a). Evidence from several recent studies using credible

research designs highlights the importance of some of these supply-side measures in

improving public health, and reducing disparities in health outcomes in countries like




                                            39
Brazil and Thailand. The current study builds upon this growing strand of literature by

providing insights into the effectiveness of a supply-side intervention in Turkey where

the entire population became entitled to free and easily accessible basic healthcare

financed and delivered by the government. The findings in this paper serve as further

compelling evidence in favor of the view that healthcare reforms employing strong

supply-side instruments can generate significant health benefits by reducing mortality

especially among infants and the elderly.
