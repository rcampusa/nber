                   "Short-Run and   Long-Run   Prospects for
                                Female Earnings"
                                      by
                                Victor R. Fuchs*

        This   paper discusses the prospects for female earnings

relative to male earnings. The determinants of the general           level
of   earnings (female and male) are not considered. I concentrate

on hourly earnings as being the best measure of the price of labor

from both the demand and supply points of view. One can easily

extend the discussion to annual earnings by taking account of annual

hours. (In 1970 on average employed women worked about 3/4 as

many hours per year as employed men.)

        The estimates of hourly earnings to be presented are calculated

from the 1/1000 samples of the 1960 and the 1970 Censuses of Population.

(See Fuchs, 1968, for a discussion of the strengths and shortcomings

of this source.) The Census samples provide much useful data on

employed persons including such characteristics as sex, schooling, age,

race, marital status, and class of worker. I have excluded agricultural

and unpaid family workers because of well-known difficulties in

estimating     their   earnings and hours of work. All other persons who

were at work during the Census week and who        had earnings in the year
preceding      the Census are included. Total annual     earnings   in 1959

(or   1969) are   calculated for workers classified by a variety of

characteristics.       Total annual hours are estimated by multiplying
                                   —2—




the weeks   worked in 1959 (or 1969) by the hours worked in the Census

week in 1960 (or 1970) (for each worker) and summing across all the

workers in a classification. Average hourly earnings for each classi-

fication are obtained by dividing the total earnings by total hours.

This is equivalent to calculating the mean of individual average hourly

earnings weighted by annual hours.

         Because of limitations of time and space the focus of this paper

is on the sex differential in earnings for whites only. It is

noteworthy, however, that the sex differential among blacks and the

color differential between blacks and whites narrowed appreciably

from 1959 to 1969. During the decade black female earnings, adjusted

for age and schooling, rose 82 percent compared with 68 percent for

black males and 53 percent for white females. By 1969 less than

15 percent separated the earnings of black women and white women

of couparablé age and schooling. For women with more than 12 years

of schooling the adjusted differential between blacks and whites

had practically disappeared.

         What are   the prospects for female earnings? In   order to

answer   this   question one needs a clear understanding of the factors

that account for the sex differential as well as the ability to

predict how. these factors will change over time. In my view,

neither inherent physical or mental differences nor employer

discrimination can explain most of the differential.        (See Fuchs, 1971,

also, Mincer and Polachek, and Malkiel and Malkiel.) This is not to
                                  — 3-.




deny the existence of some discrimination by many employers and a

great deal by some, but those who discriminate do pay a price. (See

Becker.) For most employers the desire for profit or the fear of loss

make them unwilling or unable to absorb the 30 to 40 percent difference

in labor costs that is implied if the differential in earnings is

attributable only or principally to employer discrimination.

       The major explanation, it seems to me, is role differentiation,

which begins in childhood and eventually affects labor force attachment,

choice of occupation, location and hours of work, post-school invest-

ment and consumer and fellow employee attitudes. This role differen-

tiation was functional at a time when men worked long hours at heavy

jobs in mining, manufacturing, transportation, and construction while

women specialized in work at home including the bearing and raising

of many children. Such differentiation is less functional now, and

much of the recent tension regarding sex roles probably arises from

the lagged adjustment of the law, customs and institutions to technologic

and economic changes. These changes include sharp reductions in

infant and child mortality, dramatic improvements in birth control and

major shifts in requirements of the job market.

       The effects of these changes on female earnings for given

labor market   productivity can   be analyzed with   the   familiar tools

of demand and supply, supplemented by attention to changes in the

relative market productivity of men and women that are not captured

by adjustment for age and ichooling. In the demand-supply analysis price

is the wages of females relative to males, and quantity is employment

of females relative to males. (See Figure 1.)

           Because   the sexes are not perfect substitutes, the demand

curve is   not completely elastic; it is probably becoming more elastic

over time. The demand curve shifts over time as a result of changes

in the industrial and occupational mix of the economy. In particular,

the growth of a service economy and the decline in the importance

of heavy manual jobs tend to move the demand curve to the right.

Demand is affected also by the removal of legal and institutional

barriers to women and by the greater acceptance of women by consumers

and other employees in a variety of occupations and roles.

           The relative supply curve is dominated by changes in female

labor force   participation because the supply of male labor tends
to be fixed. Shifts in the curve are related to the decreases in
infant and child mortality, the improvements in birth control,
the   increase in the absolute level of wages, and the desire

of women to achieve greater autonomy       through maintenance and   enhance-

ment of labor market skills.
           During the 1960's there was a very large increase in female
employment, which I     interpret   as primarily a shift in    the relative

supply curve. This shift tends to depress female earnings in the

short run not only because increased quantity lowers price but also

because the new entrants tend to have less schooling and less labor

market experience. As Reuben        Gronau has shown) they   are probably

less   able (in labor market terms) than those already at work.
         In this same decade, however, there was increased demand

for female labor due to the rapid growth of industries such as

health and education that traditionally have been large employers

of women. The beginning of legal and           institutional   changes within
industries   and occupations also contributed to the increase in. demand.
         The net effects of these shifts on female earnings are

presented in Table 1. The female/male earnings ratio adjusted
for   age and   schooling   (R) is àalculated in the following way:

         R =    (F/F + M/M)/2
where F =      average hourly earnings of females,
         M = average hourly earnings of male,

         H =   total annual hours worked by females,
         K     total annual hours worked by males,             1



         subscripts a and s = age group a and schooling group s,
         F= E(M
            as as H
                  as)/Eas Has            and


         14=    E(F
                as asKas)/E
                          as Kas     .




It   is, therefore, an   average of the results obtained by standardizing
female   hours on male wage rates and male hours on female wage rates

across 49 age-schooling cells. The percentage change in the ratio

from 1959 to 1969 is (100) (R70 —
                                  R60)

        Contrary to other reports which typically do not adjust

for hours, age or schooling) the 1/1000 samples reveal that the

female/male earnings ratio increased between 1959 and 1969. For

all whites, the adjusted ratio rose from .61 to .64, a gain of 4.8

per cent. This increase, although small, was noteworthy given the un-

precedented increase in the female/male employment ratio of almost

20 percent during the same decade. The improvement in female earnings

was evident in all four regions, with all except the North Central

showing gains of over five percent.

       when the sample is disaggregated by schooling, we find that

the rise in female earnings was very large   for those with at

least some col1ege the sex earnings ratio jumped 11.4 percent.

For workers with 12 years of schooling or less the increase was only

1.5 percent. The explanation for this difference lies, I believe,

in an exceptionally rapid growth of demand for well-educated women

and a relative increase in supply of less educated women.

       The demand phenomenon is illustrated in Table 2 which lists

major industries and occupations in order of their rates of growth

from 1960 to 1970. It is evident that those industries and occupations

which were large employers of well-educated women in 1960 were precisely

the ones that experienced the largest increases in demand for labor

between 1960 and 1970. A simple projection based on 1960-70 industry

group growth rates and 1960 sex-schooling distributions by industry

group reveals an expected increase in demand between 1960 and 1970 of

47 percent for well-educated females compared with 28 percent for

well—educated males and 20 percent for less educated females.

       On the supply side two aspects must be considered. First, what

changes occurred in the relative number of females and males at the

two schooling levels regardless of employment statistics?      Second,

what changes occurred in the relative number employed? We see in Table 3

that although the female/male ratio rose more rapidly for the less

educated in both cases the       differential between schooling groups

was particularly striking for employment. Why did the relative

employment of less educated women grow faster than that of the more

educated when the latter's relative wages were increasing more rapidly?

           It is probably true that the relative supply curve of the less

educated is somewhat more elastic than that of the well-educated. The.

principal   explanation, however, is differential shifts in the female
labor supply in response to increases in the absolute level of
earnings    (and other reasons) rather than movements along relative

supply functions in response to changes in relative earnings. An

increase in the general level of wages has very little effect on

male labor force participation rates at any level of schooling. It

has some effect on well-educated females but a greater relative effect

on the less educated ones because the well—educated females are already

at a higher level of participation. Thus the female/male relative

supply function shifts more for the less-educated in response to

a rise in the general wage level.

        Disaggregation   by age reveals that the increase in female
earnings was about the same for those below 35 as those above, but
further disaggregation by marital status or class of worker reveals
that this is the result of conflicting trends. When females and males

are compared by marital status the smallest decrease in the sex
earnings    differential is found for married persons. This is not

surprising given the huge increase in the labor supply of married

women during the decade. The female/male labor force ratio increased

32 percent from 1960 to 1970 for married persons. The increases

in    the ratio for never married and "other" were 6 percent and 10
percent respectively. The increase in labor force participation of
married    women   was particularly great among those under age 35, with
a noticeable effect on the sex earnings differential as shown in
Table    1. Of the six marital status—age classes only married persons

under 35 showed a relative decrease in female earnings. Indeed,

for the never married and "other" the increase was greater for those

under 35 than for those above that age.

           When the comparisons are made by class of worker; we find that

in    government, where female earnings have been relatively highest, there
was actually a small decrease in the earnings ratio between 1959 and
1969.     Further disaggregation by age reveals that this decrease

was    concentrated in the over 35 category. One possible explanation
is    that this is the result of the strong relation   between earnings
and seniority      in government employment. Older women who entered

government' during the decade had less seniority than men of comparable

age and    therefore   lower earnings. At younger ages seniority in govern-

ment would be more comparable between the sexes, and     in   the private

sector earnings are not so rigidly determined by seniority at any       age.

          One variable that highlights the effects of role differentiation

 on female earning power is employment status 5 years prior to the

 Census. Of the white males 25 and over who were employed in 1970 and

 in 1969 only 6 percent were not at work in 1965. The comparable

 figure for white females was 24 percent, Zmong married white

 females age 25—44 more than 36 percent were not at work five

years earlier. The comparable figure for males is 8 percent.

These differences are noteworthy because there is a very large dif-

ferential in hourly earnings, about 18 percent, between employed

persons who were at work 5 years earlier and those of comparable

sex, color, age arid schooling who were not. For white females in

government this differential is almost 24 percent:

           This preliminary reading of part of the evidence on recent

changes does not constitute a rigorous test of a theory of female

wage determination, but I think one conclusion is warranted. If,

during a period of rapid increase in supply, female earnings were

more than able to hold their own and for some groups show significant

gains, the long-run prospects for women must be viewed as favorable.

           In the decades   ahead female labor force participation is
likely    to continue approaching the male rate, and at   some point the
growth    in the female/male employment ratio will taper off as shown

in Figure 2. Although in the short run the increased labor'.force

participation of   women tends to depress female earnings) in     the long run
it will   raise them. Because they will expect     to be in the   labor force
for   a significant portion of their adult lives, women will be more
                                           —15—




career-minded while attending school, choosing an occupation, and

investing in themselves after they leave school. Employer expectations

concerning continuity will also change with important implications

for job and training opportunities.

        The women who entered the labor force in large numbers in

the 1960's did not have much labor market experience by 1969.

After the transition, however, the average work experience of employed

women will increase. Moreover, when female labor force participation

rates stabilize at a high level) new entrants will consist primarily

of young women who will have been less exposed to role differentiation

at home and in school than those now in tha labor force. The in-

creasing acceptance of women in a variety of occupations, the narrowing

of sex differences in experience arid post—school investment, and

a continued shift away from heavy manual jobs all augur well for

female earnings.
