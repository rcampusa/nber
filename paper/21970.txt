                                           ABSTRACT

We explore the link between health indicators and employment rates of the population aged 55 or
more. Our focus lies on work capacity as a key determinant of employment. Using cohort mortality
information as a proxy for overall health outcomes, we establish a substantial untapped work capacity
in the population 55+. Even stronger results are obtained when relying on individual-level objective
and subjective health and socioeconomic parameters as predictors.

    1. Introduction
Previous waves of this project studied the effect of financial incentives created by formal
and de facto (early) retirement programs on an individual’s decision to retire, the fiscal
impact of such behavior and reforms’ impact thereon. Furthermore, the impact of (early)
exits on youth employment and the respective roles of health and program rules as
determinants of disability program enrolment have been studied. (Dellis et al, 2004; Desmet
et al 2007, Jousten et al 2010, 2012, 2014)

One aspect that most of these papers have essentially bypassed are work-capacity issues.
This neglect is all the more striking in a country like Belgium where the public–sphere
pension reform debate is to a large degree dominated by such aspects. For example, one
often voiced concern in the debate on prolonging working life of Belgian workers is that
numerous workers don’t have the capacity to work longer (even if they wanted or were
pushed to) because of physical or mental health and exhaustion problems, or because
psychological or material limitations render continued work impossible.

The most extreme incarnation of this concern is the so-called « arduous jobs » discussion
that has been raging with particular emphasis since the current coalition government – in
power since the middle of 2014 – has embarked on a broader pension reform project
targeting longer effective working lives. This is achieved by closing or delaying early
retirement options, and working towards a convergence between the various public pension
schemes for wage-earners, civil servants and self-employed. While the government
strategy’s main thrust mirrors recommendations of a report published by an Expert
Committee on Pension Reform 2020-2040 (Expert Committee, 2014), individual policy
measures show differences between the expert committee and the government proposals.

The broader literature provides some evidence on the link between health and work
capacity. 2 For example, relying on indicators of self-assessed health, Van Looy et al (2014)
note that subjective health levels are not any different between those who reduced their
working time and those who did not. In contrast, Desmette and Vendramin (2014) find that
“positive evaluations on ‘general health’, ‘physical health’ (backache, muscular pain in the
upper body, muscular pan in the lower body) and ‘psychological health’ (depression or
anxiety, fatigue and insomnia) are at the highest levels for those who think their current job
is sustainable.” Similarly, Jousten and Lefebvre (2013) estimate a retirement model for
Belgium including health as an explanatory variable and find that it plays a statistically
significant role in the individual retirement decision.

The literature however also cautions that work ability is only one – though very important –
step in the process of keeping individuals at work. Schreurs et al. (2011) argues that “good
health may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for retaining older workers”, and


2
  See Jousten and Salanauskaite (2015) for a survey of work determinants including motivation, finances, and
legislation, as well as domestic, workplace and work ability factors.
hence “creating and sustaining a healthy workforce by no means guarantees that older
employees will continue working until their official retirement age” as workplace, domestic
or other factors may also influence individual’s effective labor market attachment.

The present chapter focuses on the “necessary condition”: good work ability as a
precondition for higher employment. In our approach, we focus on the outcome indicator
“employment rate” (see Figures 1 and 2) and link it to general indicators of the healthiness
of the older population as measured by mortality and self-assessed health (SAH) of Figure 3.
These Figures demonstrate that as we move up across age cohorts at any given point in
time, employment rates fall substantially for both sexes - and this despite a generalized
upward trend since the mid-1990’s. While this decline is part age, part cohort effect, the
question remains as to what the impact of health on these trends is.

Section 2 proposes an analysis using the Milligan and Wise (2015) methodology, essentially
linking mortality and employment across time for those aged 55+. Section 3 replaces
mortality by a series of health conditions and explores the link between these factors and
employment rate at younger ages (50-54) in a first step. In a second step, it proposes a
simulation of employment potential at higher ages based on these first-step parameters.
Section 4 concludes.


          2. Milligan-Wise method
Figure 4 is a good starting point both for exploring the facts about mortality across time in
Belgium, as well as the methodology of Milligan and Wise (2015). The figure plots the
instantaneous mortality rate of the Belgian male population as extracted from the Human
Mortality Database against the male employment rate in the country as extracted from the
EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). We focus on the male population, as Belgian females have
experienced a seminal trend towards higher levels of employment and labor force
participation over the last decades, hence rendering an isolation of the health from the
structural effects hard to implement. The plot of Figure 4 is done for two years: the recent
year 2012 and a latest possible reference year in the past 1983. 3 The two outstanding –
though unsurprising – facts are: (i) a strong negative relation between mortality and
employment rate as age increases, and (ii) a seminal trend in mortality rates at equal ages as
represented by a leftward shift of the curve across time.

    No LFS data available before that date.
For the purpose of the present section, the focus lies on exploring work capacity for the
older population aged 55-74, i.e., those that are either below the normal retirement age just
a few years above. Leaving from the plot of Figure 4 corresponding to the year 2012, we
draw two vertical dotted lines at two bounds of the age interval of interest: one corresponds
to the mortality rate observed at age 55 in the year 2012 of approx. 0.6%; the other one to
the mortality rate of 3.2% at age 74 in 2012.

Milligan and Wise (2015) approach is then to explore employment rates at equal mortality
rates across time, rather than at equal ages. For example, the mortality rate of 0.6% as
observed for 55 year-old in 2012 corresponds to an employment level of 71%, while in 1983
the same mortality rate was observed for 50 year-old with a corresponding employment rate
of 89%. Thus if men had the same employment rate as their equal-mortality peers in 1983,
this would lead to an 18 percentage points larger employment rate in 2012. Expressed
differently, 18 percent of men aged 55 could have worked one more year, corresponding to
an average gap of 0.18 years of work for that specific age group. 4

Similar calculations were done for all ages in the relevant range 55-74 in 2012 and results are
reported in Table 1. They indicate that if employment rates at equal mortality would have
stayed constant, then the sum of the age-specific average gains of working years would add
up to an additional employment capacity for the male population under study of 4.3 “years
of work”. This number is derived as the simple arithmetic sum of average year-of-work gains
for each age cohort.

To understand the meaning and significance of this result of an extra 4.8 potential “years of
work”, three important elements need to be considered. First of all, the equivalence
between extra employment potential (e.g. the 18 percentage points for 55 year-old in 2012)
and “years of work” implicitly assumes that these extra workers would work the same
hours/days/months than those that actually work. If this were to be different – either
because those that currently work or those that could join work significantly less or more
than the others – the equivalence would no longer hold.

Second, the total gain in “years of work” is a theoretical construct and has to be understood
as such. For example, as the above number of 4.8 is the simple sum of potential “year of
work” gains by age in the relevant range from 55 to 74 – it ignores any size and
compositional differences between the various age cohorts. Also, and more substantially,
the number is hard to interpret in a meaningful way unless one compares it to the
theoretical maximum and/or currently observed “years of work”. As the maximum work
potential by age is 100 percent (corresponding to an average year of work for that age group
of 1) – the total maximum “years of work” for the entire 55-74 cohort is 20 years. Expressed
differently, the extra potential work capacity represents approximately 25 percent of total

4
  Notice that results would be substantially different when merely comparing employment rates for the same
age group across time but ignoring mortality improvements: for 55 year-olds, the employment rate actually
increased from 1983 to 2012 from 69% to 71%, with mortality however strongly decreasing from 1.1% to 0.6%.
employment capacity, and is slightly less than the currently observed “years of work” of 5.1
that one can derive from the age-specific employment rates using the same methodology.
In sum, or results controlling for mortality improvements indicate that there is unused work
capacity that could be activated to achieve almost a doubling of current levels of
employment.

Third, the structure of employment and mortality rates the chosen reference year has a
strong impact on the outcome of the simulation. For example, no fundamental mechanism
ensures a systematic leftward shift of the employment-mortality relation when moving
across time. Furthermore, even a lack of a visible leftward shift does not mean that there
was no change… In fact, situations may arise where negative extra employment capacity is
derived, i.e. where workers work more in 2012 than in the reference year considered be it
for a specific age or for the whole 55-74 cohort.

Mortality rates from Human Mortality Database; employment rate from EU-LFS. Employment rates correspond to linear
interpolation as data are only available for 5-year age groups.

Figure 5 illustrates this point. It provides the same information as Figure 4, but this time for
the different baseline year 1997 – chosen because it corresponds to the year where the
employment rate for the age cohort considered was historically at a low point before
increasing again since then. Even though the curve barely moved in the employment-
mortality rate space, there is a shift of the corresponding points for any given age up “along
the curve” towards the north-west. Expressed differently, at any given age the mortality rate
in 2012 is lower than in 1997, and the corresponding employment rate higher.

Figure 6 summarizes the findings in terms of extra years of work for the entire 55-74 age
cohort for all possible reference years from 1983 to 2011. The graph shows that the
additional employment capacity is close to 0 when referencing across the last 10 years, given
increases in employment and decreases in mortality essentially cancelling each other out.
The sharpest changes could be derived if we take as reference the years furthest in the past,
where both factors compound.

              3. Cutler, Meara and Richards-Shubik method
The second method we employ for exploring the potential for additional employment of the
older population 55-74 is the method pioneered by Cutler et al (2012). The basic idea of this
approach is to estimate a labor force participation model at a lower age (e.g., those aged 50-
54) that includes demographic, health and other socio-economic variables as explanatory
variables. The coefficients thus obtained are then applied to the realizations of these very
same variables for the older cohort 55-74 to “predict” their labor force participation, this
way controlling for the effect of health or other controlled-for differences between older
and younger cohorts.

Our technical approach slightly deviates from Cutler et al (2012) in that we focus on
employment as the key dependent variable instead of labor force participation. The slightly
different angle can be rationalized by the fact that the in countries like Belgium, where early
retirement by means of unemployment benefits is prevalent (be it technically as an early
retiree or an unemployed) employment likely is the better outcome indicator.

We use (and pool) data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe
(SHARE), waves 1, 2, 4 and 5 collected between 2004 and 2013. The survey is a cross-
national panel database of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family
networks of European individuals aged 50 and over conducted since 2004-05. It covers a
broad range of variables of special interest for this study such as objective information of
health, self-assessed health and occupational status.

Our empirical approach is to estimate (OLS regression) the employment model for the
“young” age group 50-54 of men and women separately, and then apply its predictions to
the older cohorts 55-74. We have a sample of 1226 male and 1558 female observation aged
between 50-54 that we rely upon for the regressions, and apply the simulations to almost
9000 observations at older ages. Summary statistics of the survey population are provided in
Tables 2 and 3 for the various 5-year age cohorts and by sex.

In the regressions reported in Table 4, we use a single health measure: the PVW health
index, as introduced and defined in Poterba et al (2013). The idea behind the PVW is simple:
apply the principal components technique to the 24 objective and subjective health
measures reported in Tables 2 and 3. These include self-assessed health, various health
conditions, as well as the prevalence of physical limitations, etc. In a second step, use the
first principal component to predict a health score of the individual. Finally, the individual’s
score is positioned in a given percentile of the overall population used in the estimation. The
score of an individual thus generally varies for across survey waves because the health
outcomes and perceptions likely vary across time. Poterba et al (2013) show that the
indicator traces mortality trends rather well at the individual level.

Results of Table 4 suggest that the PVW index plays a substantial and positive role, i.e. a
better health score leads to more employment. Marital status plays substantially for men
and women, though in opposite direction – likely the result of the primary versus secondary
earner status. Higher educated, as well as civil servants are more likely to be employed for
both sexes, while the required skill level for a job only seems to play significantly differently
for men and women in high qualifying jobs, whereas a significant difference can only be
observed for their male low educated counterparts. 5

Table 5 uses the estimates of Table 4 and applies them to the older cohorts to predict work
capacity based on the exogenous variables of the regressions. The table indicates that when
controlling for health, work capacity clearly decreases with age, but in a rather unspectacular
manner. Predicted work capacity at age 70-74 is simulated to be around 77 percent for men
and 58 percent for women. These numbers are orders of magnitude larger than the ones
corresponding to the actual observed employment rate in the country. 6 Figures 7a and 7b
display the same information in a more visual manner, essentially showing the large
potential for extra employment that one would predict using this method. To compare these
results to the ones from Table 1, we again apply a simple “synthetic” indicator of gains in
“years of work” derived by adding up the additional work capacity across the entire age
range 55-74. We obtain indicators of 11.6 and 9.3 years of extra work for men and women
respectively, hinting at a much stronger projected potential for this forward-looking method
rather than the “backward-looking” Milligan-Wise methodology.

  The appendix Table A.1 provides the regression results where we replace the synthetic PVW index by the
explicit battery of subjective and objective health (and physical limitation) indicators. The results are overall
broadly similar, though individual parameter estimates for some of the health conditions may be influenced by
underlying issues of co-variation. Robustness checks excluding the scheme dummies further confirmed the
results and are available upon request from the authors.

  Appendix Table A.2 provides simulation results when the initial estimation is obtained for the full set of health
and limitation variables. The results are similar.

                   Given the generally large differences in employment outcomes observed in Belgium, we also
                   applied the same approach by splitting the population along the education dimension. 7
                   Results of the regressions are reported in Table 6. They reveal some interesting differences,
                   with those presented in Table 5. First, the positive and significant (surprising) coefficient for
                   male civil servants disappears. While Table 5 might have been interpreted that civil servants
                   behavior actually differs, be it because of the completely different social protection
                   environment than their salaried counterparts or for some other reason, the Table 6 indicates
                   that this specific finding was more likely the result of interactions between the different
                   explanatory variables education, scheme and skill. 8

                   Health, by means of the PVW index, has no significant effect for low educated people, a
                   distinguishing feature as compared to their better educated counterparts. Different
                   interpretations are again possible, two of which are the following: (i) low educated might
                   have less flexibility in determining their retirement from the labor force, (ii) the health
                   indicators contained in the PVW index (or the full set of health indicators of Appendix Tables


                   7

                    The similarly surprising lack of a distinctly positive effect of self-employment subsists when running
                   regressions by education. Given that self-employed are excluded from many early exit routes and given that
                   they have a substantially higher effective retirement age, one would expect the contrary. However, one has to
                   keep in mind that the regression is done on a relatively young cohort aged 50-54 and that it is well before the
                   main early retirement options of wage-earners open up during the survey period.
A.1 and A2) do not necessarily contain employment-determining conditions, particularly for
workers with lower education who are already less likely to work to start with.

Table 7 as well as the accompanying Figures 8a and 8b show the results of simulations based
on the OLS coefficients by education of Table 6. It reveals a picture broadly consistent with
the pooled simulation results of Table 5 – namely one of substantial additional work capacity
in the population. It however also allows extra insights beyond the pooled approach. First, it
shows that the share of the population currently working at the age of 55-59 has a strong
education gradient – with an employment rate close to 75 percent higher for men with
tertiary education than those with primary education, and a whopping 200 percent higher
for women of the same age group. These findings are in line with those of Aliaj et al (2015)
who show that it is less-educated Belgian females that stand out as having an unusually low
employment rate both when comparing within the country and with the neighboring
countries of France, Germany and the Netherlands. Second, as of age 60-64 these
employment rates drop dramatically for all education groups for both sexes. Almost
insignificant levels are attained as of age 65, where employment is more anecdotal than
systematic – if only because of the strong focus of numerous social protection programs on
65 as a pivotal age. 9

Though the results indicate that predicted work capacity is substantially lower for those with
primary education only at all ages considered, their additional work capacity is actually the
highest of all education levels at age 55-59, indicating large employment potential when
considering the health, education, scheme and skill characteristics as in our analysis.

 While retirement at a maximum age 65 is by and large history, workers continue to face discontinuities at 65.
For example, they loose their layoff protection and also continue to be rolled over from other social protection
programs into the pension system at this very age.
Similar exercises can be performed by splitting the population along the “scheme”
dimension, rather than education. 10 Tables 8 and 9 summarize the results of these
regressions, as well as the corresponding simulated effects. They show substantial
differences between the 3 main schemes. Table 9 indicates that self-employed have a much
higher actual employment level than both wage-earners and civil servants, for women and
men alike. Also, the simulations reveal that the age gradient of extra employment capacity is
steepest for self-employed women and men. In terms of the prediction of people working,
civil servants stand out as the most able to work when controlling for the health and socio-
demographic variables of Table 8. Expressed differently, while their level of actual
employment is the lowest of all three schemes, their additional employment potential is by
far the largest, and this for all but one of the age-sex groups considered.

  We deterministically allocate people to the three schemes based on a decision tree reflecting the Belgian
social security environment. For those in employment in SHARE waves 1, 2 4 and 5 we directly observe the
scheme they belong to. For those who have worked in the past, the survey provides the same information. For
example, a retired civil servant would thus be classified as belonging to the civil servant scheme. All individuals
where no such employment information is available are classified into the wage-earner scheme –which
corresponds to the effective default option in the real world. We validate our classification using SHARELIFE.
The data show that 75 percent of individuals declare a pure career in one of the three systems, with the
residual is dominated by people with partial wage-earner careers – a group with little end-of-working-life
incentives and/or options for changing scheme.

                 All these results have to be read with a sufficient caution, keeping in mind the fact that this
                 is only a partial analysis of health and socioeconomic determinants on an individual’s ability
                 to work. Clearly, it would be highly premature to claim that such higher employment ability
                 should immediately lead to more employment as a policy strategy. As already indicated in
                 the introduction, this analysis ignores many factors: household characteristics beyond
                 marital status; workplace or system characteristics beyond the simple dummies for scheme
                 and skill.

                 In sum, the analysis should be seen as a first step into the direction of a better
                 understanding of what employment potential there is, in light of an ever-increasing need for
                 financial resources to sustain our pension systems, and social protection more generally.

                4. Conclusion
       The paper explores a dimension that has often been bypassed in the Belgian retirement literature,
       namely the one of an individuals’ work ability. Work ability is however increasingly recognized as a
       key determinant of retirement, as discussed in Jousten and Salanauskaite (2015). We employ two
       methodologies to explore the link between changes in the health characteristics of the population
       and their work ability. To be more specific, the paper uses employment as a proxy for work ability,
       hence focusing exclusively on the extensive margin of the link between improved health and work
       capacity.

       Using the Milligan and Wise methodology (2015) linking mortality improvements to employment, we
       establish a significant employment potential in the Belgian population – corresponding to potential
       doubling of employment rates. Similarly, using a richer set of health indicators instead of mortality,
       the Cutler et al (2012) methodology identifies even more substantial employment potential. When
       separating the analysis by education level and employment scheme, we derive substantial
differences in the population, highlighting the importance of institutional and workplace
characteristics.

Clearly, both results should be seen as indicative rather than conclusive, in the sense that they show
that improvements in health across time have left the country with a healthier population, hence
harboring some degree of unused employment potential. We expressly warrant against a shortcut-
logic which would claim that the results are evidence of a need of massive activation. Our reading is
more prudent: while substantial employment potential seems to exist, other factors such as system,
workplace and household factors are equally important determinants of the ultimate desirability of
increased employment. Furthermore, our study of employment as a proxy for work ability can only
be seen as a useful first step into a richer investigation of the topic – including the intensive margin
of the impact on hours of work – leading us to conclude in the need for further scientific
investigation of the subject.
