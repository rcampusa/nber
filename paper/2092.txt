                 Firm Size and Foreign Direct Investment




                                 ABSTRACT




    This paper examines the importance of firm size in explaining foreign direct
investment with data from American and Swedish firms. The results suggest that
firm size only has a threshold effect on foreign investment, an effect on the
decision to invest abroad. Once, however, a firm has jumped the initial barriers
to foreign production, size has no effect on the fraction of the firm's resources
devoted to foreign activity. Among firms that invest in foreign production large
firms do not appear to have any particular advantage over small investing firms.

Introduction

   The standard literature on multinationals emphasizes the importance of

firm size in explaining foreign direct investment. A typical statement is

that of Caves, that "the relation between direct investment and firm size

with other factors held constant, has been established statistically"

(1974, p. 280). Some authors take the conclusion a step further to suggest

that large firm size produces not only large foreign operations but also

faster growth abroad. For example, Lall and Streeten write that "success

breeds success in big business" and that Gibrat's Law is not applicable to

the growth of multinationals (1977, p. 28). In other words, large size,

which incorporates the firm's ownership-specific advantages, produces a

cumulative and dynamic effect on the expansion of MNCs (see also Hood and

Young, 1979, Chapter 2).

    These descriptions of the role of firm size are often ambiguous. As

Hufbauer (1975) and Swedenborg (1979) have pointed out, they do not make a

 clear distinction between the probability or likelihood that a firm would

 be a foreign investor and the extent of such investment or, as Swedenborg

 describes it, its propensity to operate abroad, the share of its production

 that it carries on outside its home
                                       country. The study by Horst (1972),
 the basis for most of the statements about the importance of firm size,

 dealt only with the probability that a firm would be a foreign investor, or

 more specifically, the probability that it would meet the criteria for

 being a multinational firm by the definition used in the Harvard Studies

 (Vernon, 1971), including that of having a certain number of overseas

operations.

    In this paper we examine the relationship between parent size and the

propensity to invest abroad with data for American multinationals that have

become available in the last few years. We compare our results with the

relationship for Swedish multinationals and with earlier analyses of

smaller samples of U.S. firms.


Who invests abroad?

    The accepted notion of what characteristics distinguish multinational

parent firms from others is that they are a mixture of
                                                         technological—rent
and industrial—organization factors, not completely independent of each

other. Multinational firms have been found to be set apart from others by,

among other characteristics, their large size, high profitability, and

heavy expenditures on R&D and advertising. Horst (1972) concluded that

among U.S.—based firms only size distinguished multinational firms from

others in their industries. The implication is that all the other charac-
                                     —3—

teristics are industry attributes.

    Several later studies have confirmed Horst's results for both U.S. and

European multinationals. For instance, Lipsey, Kravis and O'connor (1983),

comparing U.S. firms that invest abroad with those that did not have any

such operations, found that firm size was the most important determinant

of the probability that a firm would invest abroad. Aside from industry

effects and that of size of firm within industries, they also found, in

contrast to earlier studies, two variables that influenced the selection of

foreign investors within industries. One was the extent of input to R & 0,

and the other was profitability. The latter might reflect the output from

investment in technology or in other assets such as advertising that are

not capitalized.

    In her study of Swedish multinationals, Swedenborg (1979) also con-

firmed Horst's finding as to relation of firm size to the probability of

being a foreign investor. She showed, however, that Swedish firms on the

average were smaller than U.S. firms when they ventured abroad for the

first time, and suggested that it was the firm's size relative to its home

market rather than its absolute size that determined when it went abroad.

    Thus, the evidence of the influence of size on the likelihood or proba-

bility of foreign investment is quite strong. The size effect may differ

between industries, as well as between countries, but there is little doubt

that it exists. However, that evidence tells us nothing about what deter-

mines the extent of foreign production among firms that do produce abroad.

That is, it does not tell us whether, among such firms, larger ones produce

a higher proportion of their output abroad.

 Size of firms and the propensity to produce abroad

     The only publicly available data separating the domestic and foreign

 operations of individual U.S. firms are those reported to the Securities

 and Exchange Commission since the late 1970s. We have taken from Standard

 and Poor's Compustat tapes a sample consisting of 183 U.S. manufacturing

 firms that reported foreign operation in 1982, and sufficient additional

 information to construct the other variables required by our equations.

    There are several nays to test for the influence of size on the propen-

sity to operate abroad. Equation 1 relates the log of foreign sales to the

log of domestic sales and Equation 2 adds several reputed determinants of

foreign investment to the size variable (standard errors in parentheses):


(1) Log ES =     .97 log OS - .86                    A2   = .70   No. Obs. = 183
               (.05)           (.33)

(2) Log FS =     .99 log DS + .20 log KL + 8.65 RD + 3.23 AD — 2.04
               (.04)           (.10)        (1.72)   (1.42)       (.43)

                                                     A2 =         No. Obs. = 183

    where FS =   Foreign Sales ($million)
          Os =   Domestic Sales ($million)
          KL =   Capital/labor ratio ($thousand)
                 measured by the assets per employee for
                 the consolidated firm

          RD = R&D expenditures as per cent of sales for
               the consolidated firm

          AD =   Advertising expenditures as per cent of sales
                 for the consolidated firm.

    Equations 3 and 4 are the corresponding equations using domestic and

foreign assets (DA, FA) as measures of size and foreign activity:
                                        —5—


(3) Log FA =   1.01 log   DA -1.23                      = .73     No. Obs. = 183
               (.05)            (.31)

(4) Log FA = 1.02      log DA + .O3log KL +   6.11 RD + 3.72 AD — 1.67
               (.05)           (.10)          (1.70)   (1.39)      (.40)

                                                        =   .75   No. Obs. = 183

    A coefficient of one for domestic sales or domestic assets implies

that, across firms, a doubling of domestic size is associated with a

doubling of foreign operations, but no more or less than that. In all

these cases the coefficient of domestic size does not differ significantly

from one. Although these are cross-section rather than time series data,

the coefficients could be interpreted as implying that among these firms,

growth in the domestic market would typically be associated with growth at

the same rate in foreign markets.

    the addition of the firm's capital intensity, R&O intensity and adver-

tising intensity to the equations did not affect the size coefficient

significantly. The directions of their influences on foreign investment pro-

pensities are as expected, but there is no indication that size acted as a

proxy for any of them. Results for three industry groups, reported in

Appendix Tables I and 2, were essentially the same as regards the size

effect, although there were some differences in the influence of the other

variables.

    A more direct test of the relation of firm size to the propensity to

operate abroad is to relate the propensity itself, as measured by the ratio

of foreign to domestic sales (denoted RATIO), to the domestic size of the

firm. Equations 5.and 6 give these relationships in log of size with and

without additional variables.
                                           -6-


 (5) RATIO =   -.043    log Os +    .47                   R2 = .01     No. Obs. = 183
               (.023)              (.03)

(6) RATIO =    —.041 log OS + .10 log KL +       3.26 RD + 1.18 AU + .25
               (.023)              (.05)         (.88)       (.73)      (.22)

                                                             =   .09   No. Obs. = 183

In no case is there a positive significant coefficient for domestic firm

size.   In fact, these equations show more evidence for a decline rather

than for a rise in the propensity to invest abroad as size of firm increases.

We also related the ratio of foreign to domestic sales to size itself, in

arithmetic form, and, to test for nonlinearity, a squared size term. Both

coefficients turned out to be zero (Appendix Table 3). All in all, the

data indicate clearly that the size of the firm has no positive influence

on the propensity to operate abroad, once a firm has jumped the initial

barriers to foreign production.

    We also ran a set of parallel equations for 109 Swedish multinationals

(virtually all there were) using data from the rUT 1978 survey of Swedish

investment abroad (Swedenborg, 1982). As can be seen from equations 7 and 8,

and others parallel to the U.S. equations (Appendix Table 4), the

regressions provided results similar to those for U.S. firms (even the test

for nonlinearity).


(7) RATIO = .04 log DS —      .08                            =   .02 No. Obs. = 109
           (.03)            (.34)

(8) RATIO = .02    log DS +    .00 log KL + 2.82 RD + .03        R2 = .06 No. Obs. = 109
           (.03)              (.06)         (1.31)       (.34)

    This confirms the findings for Swedish firms in 1974 (Swedenborg,

1979). However, in that study the coefficient for domestic sales size,
                                   —7—

close to unity when no other variables were included in the equation, was

reduced below one in an equation relating foreign affiliate sales not only

to domestic sales, but also to R & D intensity, physical-capital intensity,

labor skill (or human capital intensity), and age of the oldest foreign

operation, the last two of which were variables we could not match in the

U.S. data.


Conclusion

    We conclude that while size of firm is the major determinant of the

probability of foreign direct investment, it is important only as a

threshold effect. Once the firm has jumped the initial barriers to foreign

production, size has no effect on the fraction of the firm's resources

devoted to foreign activity. Therefore, among firms that invest in foreign

production, large firms do not appear to have any particular advantage over

small firms. Nothing in our results supports the fears sometimes expressed

that the advantages of large firm size must lead to increasing con-

centration within the foreign production of multinationals or their world-

wide operations. Outside of a fringe of small firms, concentration in

foreign production must be little different from that in domestic produc-

tion.
