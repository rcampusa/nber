          The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek             model of factor service trade is a central construct         in

international    economics,      Empirically,   though, it is a flop. This warrants a new approach.     Using

Japanese    regional data we are able to test the HOV model by independently                    examining   its

component       production     and consumption       elements.      The strict HOV model performs      poorly

because    it cannot explain         the international   location   of production,   However,    relaxing   the

assumption of universal factor price equalization yields a dramatic improvement.                We also solve

most of what Trefler (1995) calls the “mystery of the missing trade. ” In sum, the HOV model

performs remarkably          well.

                           WHY DOES IT FAIL? WHEN DOES IT WORK?




 1.0 Introduction

         Starting with the clmsic         “paradox”     of Leontief (1953),        and continuing         through   the

influential work of Bowen, Learner and Sveikauskas                  (1987),   the Hwkscher-Ohlin           model has

consistently performed poorly in empirical tests. This led Trefler (1993) to aver that “its predictions

are always rejected empirically.” k spite of these empirical failures, the Heckscher-Ohlin                      model

remains ubiquitous in theory, empirics and policy analysis. In part, this reflects an                 a   priori belief

that the model embodies fundamental              general equilibrium     links betw~n       primary       factors and

production structure that we believe will be part of any ftdly ardctiated               and empirically relevant

theory.l Moreover, we will argue that when applied to regions within a country, the theory may do

qtite well as a simple description of the data.

        “An important departure in our analysis is to focus separately on the Heckscher-Ohlin

predictions concerning the location of production             and the pattern of consumption,             rather than

directly considering the pattern of trade. We argue that it is the location of production                  that is the

heart of the Heckscher-Ohlin          framework,      and show       that the model performs          admirably in

describing Japanese regional patterns of production.              Moreover,     when certain specifications         of

Heckscher-Ohlin      fail, we are able to directly identify the reasons for the failure rather than, as in

previous work, rely on indirect inferences.

         A seeond important departure in our study is that we show how to derive eut                       predictions

for the net factor content of trade in a world in which only a subset of regions share factor price



1 The commitment of the profession to the Heck.scher-Ohtin framework in the fm of contrary evidenee was
highlighted in this paper’s originrd title “In@egional and InternationalTrade: Woody Atlen was Right!” This
referred to an anecdote Allen tells at the close of his movie, Annie Hall, regarding a man whose brother thinks he’s a
chicken. Asked by his psychiatrist why he doesn’ t inform his brother that he is no fowl, Allen repties that he would,
but the family needs the eggs. Just so, the profession has needed a general equilibrium framework as in Heckscher-
Ohtin, linking endowments, technology, and made, mntrary evidence notwithstanding.
                                                                                                                      2


 equalization. This allows us to forego the heroic assumption of universal factor price equalization,

 continue to embed this in a full world general equilibrium, yet derive exact predictions to compare

 with the data.z

           The resdts of this study shodd be heartening for international trade economists.               The study

does not provide evidence that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek                 framework can be blithely and blindly

applied to international       data. However,        it does validate the use of the underlying              general

equilibrium structure as an excellent description of national data. Insofu              m an important concern

of trade economists         is to trace through the impact on national             economies      of international

disturbances,     this should be helpful. For example, augmentation of national factor supplies via

international factor movements can be expected to have conventional impacts on output supplies, as

per the Rybczynski theorem. One shotid even be able to trace the impact of this disturbance to the

regional     level. While     our study        does not contemplate       any comparative       statics   involving

international prices, the validation of tie underlying general equilibrium production structure gives

some support to the link between the international terms of trade and national factor returns posited

in the Stolper-Samuelson           theorem. While we develop these results in a regional setting, our

approach can be extended to a cross-country              study even if only a subset of countries share the

assumptions underlying factor price equalization.

         We also solve most of what Trefler (1995) refers to as the “myste~               of the missing trade.”

Using      international   data,     Trefler   graphed   the residuals     from   the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek

predictions against predicted net factor trade. Rather than being centered around zero, the residuals

instead closely follow a line reflecting zero net factor trade, hence the mystery. Seeking to account

for this anomaly, he then implemented a hypothesis t~ting approach earlier employed by Bowen,

Learner and Sveikauskas            (1987). Using maximum likelihood estimates of key parameters,                  he

selects a model with neutral technological differences and a home bias in consumption                        as the

2 Bowen, Learner, and Sveikauskas (1987) effectively impose universal factor pri~ quatization. Horiba (1992) d
Chimes and Ptie (1993) fail to consider the fuU world generat equilibrium. The work of B-r             and Choudhri
(1988) is closest to our approach. They derive exact predictions for the factor content of consumption per unit of
expenditure. The fult world equilibrium, though, enters their model only indirectly through its impact on relative
spending shares for the counties considered. By contrast our approach also incorporates information on the fufl world
production structure.
                                                                                                            3


prefened account from a variety of n~ted hypotheses. We replicate his “missing trade” restits for

the Japanme regions under the maintained assumption            of universal factor price equalization.

However, under our preferred specification, the mystery of the trade that didn’t embark largely

disappears. Our approach hm two advantages. First, the solution that we propose uses data and

theory only. Because W theoretical parameters can be calculated directly from the data based on the

theory, we are not obliged to estimute productivity dtiferences or taste differences that allow the

data to fit the model. Second, because we use separate and direct measur~            of production and

absorption, we need not rely on econometric spectilcations        to identify which is responsible     for

failures of the theory and hence what revisions are required to obtain a good fit with the data. As

we will see, this leads to a substantively different resdt than that suggested by Trefler.

        Our results also throw a revealing light on the recent literature on economic geography

[Krugman (1991)]. This literature, born of the “new” trade theory of the 1980s, interacts scale

economies with transport costs. Externalities, both pecuniary and non-pecuniary,         have played a

central role in this literature, helping to explain regional concentration.   One consequence of these

extemalitim is the appearance of signKlcant differences across regions in average input coefficient

matricw [cf. Krugman (1991)]. By contrast, in the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin               model, both

average and marginal input coefficients will be common across regions. In fact, our work on the

Heckscher-Ohlin   theory of the location of regional production can be looked at as a rough test of

the equality of average input coefficien~ across the regions. As we will see, the Heckscher-O~in

model provides an excellent fit for the data. This suggests that, at least for Japan,          geography

models that emphasize regional differences in average input coefficients will add little to our

understanding of regional net factor trade, a traditional concern of Heckscher-Ohlin.        By contrast,

the inability of the simple model to account for the cross-national pattern of production leaves open

the possibility that these concerns may have more salience for international production patterns.

       Finally, our study provides the first evidence regarding the Courant-Deardorff              (1992)

conjecture that lumpinms – highly uneven regional distribution of national endowments – may be

an important determinant of international trade patterns. The evidence showing an excellent fit of
                                                                                                                  4


 the basic Heckscher-Ohlirt model for our regional data suggests that, at least for Japan, lumpiness

 is not an important determinant of the structure of national production, hence trade.



 1.1 The Importance          of Heckscher-Ohlin          to International       Economics

         It would be diffict,dt to exaggemte the importance               of the Heckscher-Ohlin         model to

international economics.3 The basic model appears quite restrictive, requiring a long list of special

assumptions. Yet the framework h~ proven remarkably flexible, particularly in the versions due to

Vanek (1968), Helpman (1981), and Helpman and Krugman (1985), which emphasize implicit

trade in factor services. It is consistent with trade in final goods and intermediates, as well as with

the existence of nontraded goods. It is robust to a shift from constant returns to scale to some

patterns of increasing returns. It can incorporate technical differences when the number of goods

exceeds the number of factors, perhaps m the result of local or international spillovers of learning

by doing [see, for example, Davis (1995)]. It is consistent with market structures as diverse as

perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and contestable markets. It hm also been

a fundamenti      input into much of the new inkmational              growth theory,      as in Grossman       and

Helpman (1992). In addition to its importance to theorists,              Heckscher-Ohlin       hfi provided the

framework for countless empirical studies, as for example in the recent controversy                      over the

influence of trade on US wages [Lawrence and Slaughter (1993)].

         In short, the Heckscher-Ohlin        framework      continues   to command       interest among those

concerned with international        exchange from a wide variety of methodological               and theoretical

viewpoinw. Moreover, this continued interest is no atavistic affectation. It reflects the enduring

power of the model as an intellectual organizing framework,              providing access to such powerful

results as Factor Price Equalization, Stolper-Samuelson,           Rybczynski,      as well as the Heckscher-


3Strictly, one sholdd distinguish between the Heckscher-Ohlin theory and the specific version known as Heckscher-
Ohlin-Vanek (HOV). The former encompasses a -d            class of ampetitive general equilibrium models which view
cross-munm; Mferences in endowments as central to accoundng for trade patterns. It is best known in the two good,
two factor version artictiated by Samuelson. The lamr is a specific version developed in a many good, many factor
framework that focuses on implicit trade in factor services. Often the poor empirid ruutts of the latter have been
taken as a repudiation of the entire framework. Our approach witl bridge the narrow and broad theories by examining
cases in which the more specific requirement of HOV are satisfied only by a subset of countries. In the text we will
distinguish the versions explicitly only as required for clarity.

 Ohlin theorem itself. The continued interest also reflects the absence of a clear and simple

 alternative that does better. Recent work, notably Trefler (1993, 1995), has sought to remedy this

 by examining simple alterations that improve the explanatory power of the model, and identifying

 regular features in the data inconsistent with the model.

          A troubling fact concerning much of the evidence against Heckscher-OWn                     is that it does

not identify why the model’s predictions fail or how deeply the critique cuts. Are deviations from

the model’s predictions        largely the restit     of a failure of factor price equalization,            differing

technologies, non-identical preferences, or other elements that may differ across courttries? Or does

the critique penetrate even more deeply, so that the Rybczynski and Stolper-Samuelson                      theorems

are unreliable even on the national level? Our study starts us on the road to delimiting the nature of

the empirical failures artd successes of the model.



2,0 Theory       and Tests



         Here we lay out the theoretical foundation of our work on Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek.                        We do

so with three aims in mind. The fust is to articulate the tharetical          case for using the HOV theory to

examine the totalq trade of regions within a country. The second aim is to make clear how the

component theories of the structure of production and absorption mesh in the derivation of the

standard HOV equation. We do this because an important advance in our work is to disentangle

these elements in considering the failure of HOV in some of the trade tests. The third aim is to

ardctdate the implications of the framework as we relax some of the strictures of the standard

model. As we will see, the stric~t          version of our model will perform poorly, so it is natural to

consider what relaxations of assumptions matter most in getting the model to work well.

         One important feature of our work is that we will examine the HOV framework in terms of

its implications for the trade of regions of Japan. Here we will discuss the theoretical justilcation

for such an approach (while the exact equations will be derived below). The standard HOV model


4 By to~ trade we mean a region’s trade with the rest of the world not just trade with other Japanese regions.
                                                                                                         6


is developed in a setting in which there is factor price qualization    (FPE) for the world as a whole.

As argued by Dixit and Norman (1980), the very essence of FPE is that under certain conditions

trade in goods alone replicates what is known as an “integrated equilibrium.” This is a hypothetical

world economy        in which both goods     and factors are perfectly mobile.      When the relevant

conditions Me satisfied, the division into countries has no consequence for the red equilibrium that

the world attains. It follows that the fundamental HOV relations hold at any level of aggregation or

disaggregation of the world endowments that one may want to consider, whether by countries or

by regions.

        The HOV theory does not predict the pattern of goods trade, but rather the net factor

content of trade. As net goods trade is simply the difference between output and absorption,        net

factor trade will equal the difference in their factor content. While our overall objective will be to

examine the net factor content of trade, a major advance in our work is that the data we employ will

allow us to examine separately the accuracy of the theory of production structure from that of

absorption.

        We begin by establishing some notation. Let c     ●   W be an index of countries in the world,

and r c J be an index of regions in Japan. Then we can begin by describing the technology. The

matrix of direct factor inputs is given by Bk, for k = r or c. The input-output matrix is given by A ~,

for k = r or c. In the standard HOV case of identical technologies and factor price equalization for

the world, both Bk and Ak are common for the entire world. In fact, previous empirical work on

HOV has held as a maintained assumption the equality of Bk and Ak across all countries in the

world. Data limitations oblige us to continue to treat Ak as common across all countries in some of

our tests (SW Section 3.0 for more discussion of this point). However, allowing for the possibility

that Bk may vary across countrim will bean important element in our story.


Assumptions on Technology:


       Maintained:             Ah = A]                  fork=    rorc

       World FPE:              Bk = BJ                  fork=    rorc                   (FPE-W)
        FPE for Japan:             B’ = B’                 forrc   J                    (FPE-J)




        The first condition merely asserts that it is a maintained assumption of this study that the

Japanese input-output    matrix is common to all countries in the world. The second and third

represent alternative resumptions that will be considered in the course of our work.


Production Theory:

        Let ~ be the gross output vector, and ~ be the factor endowment vector for k = r G J, c

E W. Then the constraint          that HOV places on the relation between output, technology,       and

endowments is very simple. It is summarized by two types of production tests, corresponding           to

two assumptions on the geographical extent to which FPE holds. When FPE holds throughout the

world, all countries throughout the world (including Japan) use the same techniques.

P-I:    g’~    = ~       CEW                     (FPE-W)

Even if factor price equalization fails to hold for the world as a whole, if it holds for the regions of

Japan, then we can still write:

P-II:   BJ~    = V       r~J                     (FPE-J)


Consumption Theory:

        The HOV theory of absorption holds that preferences are identical and homothetic across

the whole world (IHP-W). Assuming that trade is universally free and that transport costs are zero

insures that all locales face the same vector of goods prices. Let Dk be absorption,         Yk be net

output, and fl be the share in world spending for k = r G J, c E W. Then for any region r G J, we

can state the standard HOV prediction of the goods content of absorption as:

c-I:    Dr =   ~ryw      r~J                     (IHP-w)

Several authors, such as Hunter and Markusen (1989), Hun~r (1991), and Trefler (1995), have

argued that it is failures in equation C-I that may account for much of the differences between HOV

predictions and reality. Therefore, an important question that we will address in this paper is the
                                                                                                                   8



 role of failures of IHP-W in accounting for failures in our trade tests. Thus we will consider a

 hypothesis which makes much weaker claims. In effect, it abandons trying to explain the pattern of

 Japanese     aggregate absorption,       and instead   examines      whether     the assumption        of identical

homothetic preferences is plausible for the regions of Japan alone. This maybe expressed as:

C-II:      m = (s’ /s’)   DJ        rEJ                        (IHP-J)


Trade Theory:

           The theory of absorption directly concerns goods, while the HOV theory concerns net trade

in factors. So, in order to incorporate the consumption theory into the the HOV trade theory, the

consumption        theory must be converted from a theory about consumption                     of goods to one of

factors.     The    conversion   to the direct    and      indirect   factor    content    is     accomplished   via

premultiplication     by the term B](Z –A’)-l. We can also note that under our maintained assumption

that the input-output matrices are common to the world, (1 –A’)-lYW = Xw. Then one can always

premultiply the C-I equation by BJ(l – A’)-l, to yield:

           B’(1 – A~)-l D’ = S’BJXW                  r~J                         (IHP-W)

H, in atiition,    the condition FPE-W is satisfied, it will also be true that B’XW = Vw. In thti case,

this gives tie implicit factor content of absorption as:

           B’(1 – A’)-t D = s’ Vw                    r~J                         (IHP-W, FPE-W)

If we believe neither in identical homothetic preferences nor FPE for the world, but instead, just

identical homothetic preferences within Japan, then the implied factor content of absorption is:

           B’(1 – A~)-l Dr = (s’/ S’ ) B~(l – A~)-l D~                   r~J              (IHP-J)

           Given these tiee      forms of the factor content of absorption,           we can pair these with

production tat II above to derive three tests of the factor content of made of the regions of Japan.

Recall that gross and net output are related by X’ = (1 –A’)-l ~,              and that net trade is given as ~

= Y – U. Taking the relevant differences, we find:

T-I:       B’(1 – A~)-l [~ – ~]       = ~   – ~rvW                                        (IHP-W, FPE-W)
                                                                                                                   9



 If FPE fails to hold for the world as a whole, then we cannot work with the above equation. If we

 believe that FPE still holds for the regions of Japan, the appropriate test is:

 T-II:   B’(Z – A’)-l     [~ – D] = V – srB’Xw                          ?-EJ             (IHP-W, FPE-J)

 If, as well, we assume that identical homothetic preferences hold for Japan but not for the world

as a whole, then the relevant test k:

T-III:   B’(Z – AJ)-l [~ – U] = V – (s’/ s~) B’(I – A’)-l D’                     rEJ     (IHP-J, FPE-J)

         The equations above are the basis for all tests in this paper. The theory establishes, for each

country or region, a vator         equality between what we term the mmured                (left hand side) and

predicted (right hand side) net factor content of trades It is convenient to group these equations for

the K regions (counties)       into matrices for our tests. Thus gather the equations for measured and

predicted factor content of production, which will be denoted:

                                           Mn = Pn        (Dimension F x K)



                                      [Bf’xkl
                                            =[Vfil
where there are F factors md B’J corresponds to thefi             row of the BJ matrix. Similarly, we gather

the equations for consumption of the K regions (countries) and N goods:

                                        M. = P.       (Dimension N x K)



                                      [D*I=[’k~wl
Finally, we gather the equations for the net factor content of trade of the K regions:

                                   MT = Pr        (Dimension F x K)



                              =[vfiskBfJ(~ –A)-l Yw1
                    [BfJ(z-A)-lTk]

                                                                               Under FPE


5 Caution in interpreting the distinction between measured and predicted is warranted. Both are rooted in data. We
thti of the distinction largely m the orientation of our interest. For example, we think of endowments as predicting
the net factor content of Me, ~us, data on endowments establishes the pr~lction, and data on bade and technology
yields the measured factor mnknt.
                                                                                                        10


         Having set out the theory for the variety of hypotheses that we will consider, we turn now

to sketch the tests that we employ. In this, we follow the lead of the seminal work of M~kus

(1985) and Bowen, Learner and Sveikauskas          (1987). & the nature of the tests for the various

cases is very similar, we will outiine the tests for the fun trade theory, and then note amendments

relevant to the cases of production and absorption.       The theoretical trade equations (T-I to T-III

above) establish an exact link between technology,          output, absorption,    and endowments.      Of

course, three exact relations are too much to hope for with real data. So we consider less exacting

tests.

         First, we will consider rank tests. If corresponding cells of the matrices are supposed to be

identical, then one should expect that when comparing corresponding            rows or columns,      there

should be high raw and rank correlations. For example, when examining the fu~ theory of the net

factor content of trade, one test comparw corresponding          rows, i.e. considering   a single factor

across regions:

                                      A4~ = Pi     (Dimension 1x K)

The other compares corresponding columns, i.e. considering a single region across factors:

                                      M: = P;     (Dimension F x 1)

         A complement to the rank test, relevant only for testing the full trade theory, is the sign test.

The idea is that if corresponding     entri~ are supposed to be identical, one would hope that they

would at least have the same sign. For a typical element:


                            sign{Bf’(l   – A)-l T~] = sign{Vfi – s~VW}

A sign match impliw that the country in fact is a net exporter or importer of the factors that theory

so predicm. One can calctiate the proportion of correct sign matches by factor (across countries),

by country (across factors), or for the matrix as a whole. One can then test whether the theoretical

model does better than a coin flip.

         Since these tes~ do not specify a clear null hypothesis, they merely give us an indication of

how consistent the data is with the theory. Even if the two se~ of rank orderings                matched

perfectly, it still would be possible for the assumptions      of the model to be violated in the real
                                                                                                               11


 world. In this case, our test wotdd simply tell us that the real world deviations are not sufficient in

magnitude to change the basic predictions of the theory reg~ding             which regions are net exporters

of which factors. It is in this spirit that we “test” the Heckscher-Ohlin        model. When the model fits

the data well, we conclude that relaxing the basic assumptions                 will not greatly enhance our

understanding     of the factor content of trade; when the model fits poorly, we conclude that there

may be substantial gains from considering alternative specflcations.



2.1 Previous      Work:       A String    of Empirical      Rejections

         The seminal empirical critique of Heckscher-Ohlin is due to Leontief (1953 ).6 He used data

on input requirements and US trade to measure capital to labor ratios in US impo~                   and exports

separately. To universal surprise, widespread dismay, and scattered consternation,              he showed that

US imports were more capital intensive than US exports. This suggested that the US is relatively

labor abundant – a restit ever after known as the “Leontief Paradox.”                Learner (1980) showed,

however,      that Leontief     applied   a conceptually     inappropriate    test   of the Heckscher-Ohlin

hypothesis.    When he re-examined         the same data in a conceptually correct way, the paradox

vanished. Nonetheless,        this paradox refused to perish. Brecher and Choudhri (1982) pointed out

that one (counterfactual) implication of Lemer’s           approach is that US expenditure          per worker

wotid have to be lower than for the world m a whole. Stern and Mmkus (1981) applied Learner’s

(1980) approach to US data for both 1958 and 1972, finding the Leontief paradox held in the

former but not in the latter yew. Extensive surveys of previous work on Heckscher-Ohlin                   can be

found in Deardorff (1984) and Learner and Levinsohn (1995).

        The theory of trade reflected in equations           (1) through (3) above has previously           been

examined by Maskus (1985) and BLS (1987). Their resul~ have severely undermined cotildence

in the robustness of the Heckscher-Ohlin         framework.     Maskus ( 1985) carried out both sign and

rank tests on data for two time periods (1958 and 1972), and for three high quality factors

6 It is worth noting that Leontief did not view his own work as contradicting the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Rather he
saw it as evidence against the notion that the US was capitat abundant. Later authors, however, came view his work
as providing “the single biggest piece of evidence against the factor proportions theory.” [Krugm.an and Obstfeld
(1994), p. 77]
                                                                                                     12


(professional, unskilled labor, and capital). He reports resulm only for the United States, perhaps

because the Leontief paradox had focused on it. The sign testis correct for only one factor in 1958,

but for all three in 1972. This might be seen to suggest that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek       relations

f~e well, at least in the latter period. However,    the test lacks power. A Mmkus notes, if we

consider the alternative that the signs were determined randomly, we will have two or fewer sign

failures out of six tries 34.4 percent of tie time. Moreover, even if we limit ourselves to the 1972

data, under the same alternative, there will be no sign violations (as in hfi data) one in eight times.

The results were, if anything, worse in the rank test. The direct measures of US factor abmdance

relative to the rest of the world were stable, with physical capiti    most abundant, professionals

second,    and unskilled labor least abundant.   However,    the trade-imputed    measures   of factor

abundance in 1958 suggested the US was most abundant in unskilled labor, and least abundant in

physical capital! The 1972 trade-imputed measure of factor abundance showed unskilled labor

shifting dramatically to be least abundant, and reverses the relative abundance of physical capital

and professionals.   A repeat of the tests, restricted to OWD data, yielded no improvement.         As

Maskus notes, “paradoxical outcom~ may be the rule rather than the exception.”

          BLS likewise report results widely viewed as undercutting Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek.          An

important contribution was extending the test to a much broader set of countries (27) and factors

(12). Thus, whereas the M~kus        test was based on a matrix of only three cells for each time

period, the BLS matrix had 324 entries. Became of the greater dimensionality         of the matrix, it

became possible to conduct sign and rank tests not only for a single coun~       across factors (m in

Mtikus    (1985)), but also for a single factor across countries. The sign test was correct more than

half of the tie   for eleven of the twelve factors, but was correct over 70 percent of the time for

only four in twelve. The sign matches were correct more than half the time for 18 of 27 countries,

but over 70 percent of the time for only 8 of the 27. Only 61 percent of the total sign matches were

correct. They note that independence between the signs of corresponding      entries can be rejected at

the 95 percent level for only one factor in twelve, and for only four of the 27 countries. In effect,
                                                                                                       13


in determining which factors’ services would on net be exported or imported, Heckscher-Ohlin          did

little better than a coin-flip.

           The rank proposition fares no better. BLS report both rank correlations and the proportion

of corrwt rankings when entries are compared two at a time. A zero correlation is rejected for only

four of the 12 factors and eight of the 27 countries. Moreover, one factor and five countries have

the wrong sign on the correlation. While the pairwise comparisons           get over 50 percent correct

rankings for 22 of the 27 countries,       the same is true for only three of the 12 factors (all land

variables). In sum, BLS note that the sign and rank propositions yield the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek

model “relatively little support.”

           The pessimism regarding Heckscher-Ohlin       was partly relieved by Trefler (1993), ordy to

be revived by Trefler (1995). They represent alternative approaches to resolving            the problems

identified by BLS. The former follows       Up on   Leontief’s suggestion that the failure of Heckscher-

Ohlin maybe due to factor-based differenc~ in efficiency. Trefler chooses the efficiency factors so

that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek       equations fit exactly. He then shows that the implied productivity

differentials correlate nicely with evidence on cross country differences        in wages and rentals,

suggesting a version of adjusted factor price equalization.

           Trefler (1995) returned to the simple Hwkscher-Ohlin-Vanek       framework using the US B

matrix, BUS.In one exercise, he graphed the net factor trade residuals, &l. = BUS(I – AJ)-l T – (V

- SCVW),against the predicted net factor trade, V – SCVW.Theory would predict that these should

be centered around the line&~ = O. Instead they closely followed the line      ET   = –(V   -   scVw), or

equivalently,    BUS(Z– A’)-lT = O. This says that memured net factor trade is approximately zero,

to which he applied the colorful moniker “the case of the missing trade.” Thti is certainly a serious

difficulty for an endowmenu-based       model of trade. After considering a variety of alternatives, he

identilw     neutral technological differences and a home bias in consumption        as the most likely

culprits for the missing trade. However, by working with trade data – rather than production and

absorption data – he can only test this indirectly. The technical differences are estimated rather than
                                                                                                               14


observed. Thus, while these papers provide some glimmerings of hope for Heckscher-Ohlin,                    they

also serve to underscore the serious empirical shortcomings of the simple model.

         Recently, a few authors have studied Heckscher-Ohlin           using United States regional data, as

in Horiba (1992), and Grimes and Prime (1993 ).7 The rationale for such studies is that the

conventional assumptions of identical technologies and preferences, factor price equalimtion,                and

free trade are more likely to hold for regions of a single country than across different countries.

However,     an important flaw underlim both studies – the United States is treated as a closed

economy,     which is inherently anti-Heckscher-Ohlin.          They assume that the factor content of

regional consumption is proportional to the US – rather than the world – endowment.                If this were

so, then there would be no reason for the US to trade with the rest of the world. More importantly,

if one ignores the rest of the world, the model does not have determinate predictions about the

factor content of trade. The general model yields predictions for any region vis d vis the rest of the

world, but not relative to any subset of regions or countri~           in the world. In addition, there are

problems in interpreting the data. As Grimes and Prime note, their data treats US regional exports

to the rest of the world as though they are consumed at the port of exit, wherever they may come

from, and wherever they are destined.           They also adopt a curious measure of some of their

endowments,      one closer to a measure of output than input. For example,                   the measure of

“agncdhual     endowment”      is the “value of agrictitural      products sold by farms in millions of

dollars.” This comes close to reducing the production side of the Heckscher-Ohlin                  model to a

tautology, and so twting only homothetic preferences. The authors deserve credit for attempting to

implement a regional H~kscher-Ohk           model. However, data problems and methodological flaws

make interpretation of their results difficult.



2.2 Our Approach

        Trade is simply the difference between production and consumption              (absorption).   Hence a

theory of international trade must join two theories: a theory of the location of production and a

7 An earlier set of papers sought to examine Heckscher-Ohtin with regional dam as in Horiba (1973). However,
these primarily relied on the method of Leontief (1953), which is vulnerable to the criticisms of Learner (1980).
                                                                                                            15


theory of consumption. The theory of consumption in the conventional version is supplied by the

assumption that preferences across countriw are identical and homothetic.               The real intellectual

capital of the theory, however, is staked on the theory of the location of production                 (and i~

underlying assumptions). Three of the principal theorems – Rybczynski, Factor Price Equalization,

and Stolper-Sarnuelson       – make no use of the consumption      theory. The fourth – the Heckscher-

Ohlin theorem – is essentially a coroll~         to the Rybczynski     theorem once we have added the

assumption on preferences.                        .

         This    suggests,   paradoxically,    that the most     penetrating    approach     to investigating

Heckscher-Ohlin      maybe to ignore bade data per se, and to focus instead on the two components of

trade, particularly the location of production. We investigate this using Japanese regional data. This

is justiled    m the underlying assumptions     of the model are more likely to hold for regions of a

country than for the full set of countri~     in the world. Moreover, in contrast to previous efforts at

examining Heckscher-Ohlin in a regional framework, we embed this in a theoretically appropriate

model of the ftil world general equilibrium.



3.0 Implementation

         Learner hm frequently emphasimd         that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek         theory relates three

elements: endowments, technology, and trade. We suggest that it is useful to extend this to four,

by breaking the last element into its components: production and absorption.            Ideally, a test of the

theory would incorporate direct, appropriate and independent observations           of the four elements.

This is not an easy task.

        Consider, first, the problem of technology.         A maintained resumption        of BLS is that all

countries have access to the same technology.         Thus one could, in principle,         use the whnical

coefficients    taken from any country.       In practim,    their assumption     was    that US technical

coefficients were employed by all countries.          We will consider     three hypotheses.       The first,

following the standard model, holds that all countries use Japanese input coefficients. The second

requires only that this be true for the regions of Japan that we include in our tests. The final
                                                                                                                   16


hypothesis that we consider, in our implementation of the consumption theory, is that even if not

all countries share the same matrix of direct factor inputs, BJ, they may yet share a common input-

output matrix, A ‘. This is a necessary assumption to implement one of our consumption                         tests.

Moreover, it may have some plausibility.            For example, a car may be produced with v~ing

degrees of substitution      of capital for labor across countries. Yet the same car may sdll need a

certain amount of steel, plastic, rubber and glass.

         Consider, next, the problem of measuring endowments.                One option is to choose a coarse

partition of endowments       into so-called “good” factors – like college-educated labor, non-college-

educated labor, and capital – that are good in the sense that the factors have clear definitions and are

conmptually close to the notion of endowment. Or one can choose a much finer partition into “bad”

factors, for example, distinguishing labor categories such as professional/technical,               clerical, sales,

and service. The freer partition is appealing in that it provides additional data points against which

to test the theory, However, the occupational categories msociated with the bad factors may fail to

be independent of the output measure. In addition, there is some danger of arbitrary disaggregation

causing the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek           theorem to fail. The former introduces a bias in favor of the

theorem, the latter against. Ex mte it is diffictit to know wtich will dominate. Maskus worked

with the coarse partition into good factors, while BLS used the fme partition into bad factors. We

prefer the coarse partition but also consider the alternate c~e.8

         There are two other concerns regtiding our me~ure of endowments. The first relates to the

work of Trefler (1993). He showed that introductig              neu~al factor-breed productivity dfiferences

in the model allowed a dramatic improvement               in the model’s ability to predict cross-national

differences in factor returns. This means that efficiency units differ from memured units of factors,

either due to difference      in productivity or classification. This sugges~,         then, that a model using

unadjusted measures of world endowments may fare poorly, for the same reasons.                        The second

concerns the predictions of the theory when we discard the resumption that the rest of the world


g Lack of data on factors, unlike goods, is not a serious problem for the tests. One ean imagine that we have all the

disturb the relations for the other factors.

 has the same technology and factor price equalization with the Japanese regions. In this case, as

 noted above, one wants to work with direct measures of endowments for the Japanese regions, but

imputed factors for the rest of the world, The latter correspond to the factors that would have been

necessary to produce the world output vector if production had taken place with the Japanese

technical coefficients.

4.1.1 International        Production     Evidence:     Bad Results      from Good Factors

         We frost test the Heckscher-Ohlin     theory by examining its consistency with the location of

world production (Equation P-I). We assume that all countries use the Japanese direct input

requirements, B ‘. This implies that we meet the assumptions             of identical CRS technology and

factor price qualization    or that these coefficients are technologically fixed. In effect, the testis to

see whether B ‘Xc = VC for the various countries c. Our Xc vector for each country contained

thirty sectors comprising total output, and the elements of B’ are the factor usages per unit output.

For countnm that only reported value added by sector, we used the Japanese ratio of total output to

value added for the sector to estimate total output. This enabled us to resemble a sample of 35

countries, but limitations on the availability of education data forced us to reduce our sample to

        Figure 1 plots the imputed number of people in each country that have not gone to college

in a country (~~~)     against the actual number of people (@). As the graph reveals, there is not a

very close relationship between the levels of non-college graduates that each country should have,

given its structure of production and the actual levels. In fact, the correlation coefficient between

the two series is only 0.290. Figures 2 and 3 repeat this experiment for college graduates and for

capital stocks. Over the full sample, the correlation coefficient for both of these factors is quite

high: 0.962 for college graduates and 0.922 for capital. At f~st glance, it might appear that the

theory seems to work quite well for these factors, However, much of the variance for both of these

factors comes from the United States which has by far the largest number of college graduates and

 the largest capital stock. Dropping the US from the sample (Figure 2b and Figure 3b) reveals that

for college educated workers the Heckscher-Ohlin       model of production does not predict factor

contents very well for most of the world (p = 0.271).        Interestingly,   the model seems to work

much better for capital. Even after leaving the US out of the sample, the correlation coefficient

between actual and imputed levels of capital ordy falls to 0.628.

        Undoubtedly, one of the major reasons for the high correlations in the data is the fact that

as long as the marginal product of each factor is positive there is likely to be a positive correlation

between country output and factor abundance. Indeed, considering the enormous size differentials

across our sample, one would need to have tremendous production distortions in order to have a

negative correlation between factor abundance and production. These size eff~ts can mask fairly

lmge predictive errors. For example, despite the fact that inclusion of the US in the sample greatly

increases the fit of the capital relationship, the point estimate for the US capital stock is off by a

factor of two. One way to redum        the influence of extreme observations       is to calctiate rank

correlations between the actual and predicted values. This method moves big outliers towards the

mean but also causes poin~ that are very close together to be further apart. Recalculating the

correlation coefficients using country ranks reveals that, on average, the rank correlation between

actual country endowments and imputed levels tends to be around 0.6 [see Table 1]. Whether this

number seems high or low depends on one’s priors.           Setting a nufl that there should be no

correlation between output and factor supply could be rejected in most cases, but little comfort can

be obtained by rejecting such an absurd proposition.    Indeed, considering that it would require a

tremendous error to erroneously rank Singapore or Holland ahead of, say, India, we fwl that the

existence of modest correlations between the two matrices across countries lends little support for

the Heck.scher-Ohlin theory of production.

       A better way to examine how well the model fits international data without having to worry

about country size is to compare actual and imputed levels of factors within countries.        Since it

would be meaningless to compare the amount of capital in one country with the number of non-
                                                                                                              19


college educated workers,        we noms.lized   each country’s factor endowment by dividing by the

world endowment of that factor (i.e. compare whether (M1c/P1’,...,             MFC/fl)      = (P1c/P1’,...,

@/fl)).        Hence we compared the imputed share of each factor with the actual physical share.

Table 2 presenm the results from this exercise. Overall, in almost one half of the sample, the

correlation between predicted and actual factor shares had the wrong sign. The average correlation

was only 0.268, indicadng that the Heckscher-Ohlin          model, on average, only explained a small

part of the varianm. The rank correlations were slightly bemr but still hovered around 0.4 on

average. It is interesting to note, however, that although the Japanese B’ matrix did not work well

for every wealthy country,       the set of countries with correlations above 0.7 (Canada, Finland,

Germany, Ireland, Netherlands,         New Zealand, Norway,     and the US) are all countries with per

capita incomes that are close to Japan. This suggests that these countries may produce within the

same cone or that the quality of endowmen~ does not vary signtiicantly among these countries.

           These results are entirely consistent with those presented in BLS, but provide us with

different information. Since BLS were using trade data, they could not directly separate failures in

the model due to implausible assumptions about production or consumption.               Regression analysis

let them infer that difference    in tmhnology likely played an important part in the explanation of the

poor performance of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, but reliance on trade data made it dtificdt            to test

this directly. The fact that there are very low correlations between actual and predicted factor

contents    of production   suggests    that predictions   regarding   trade patterns    breed on a strict

interpretation of the Heckscher-Ohlin      model are likely to be at odds with the data for a broad

sample of countries.



4.1.2 Regional      Production      Evidence:    Good Results      from Good       and Bad Factors

          The simple Heckscher-Ohlin      theory, we have seen, does a poor job of describing the

international location of production. However, as we saw in Section 2.0, even if FPE fails for the

world, it is possible that it works within countries. In other words, equation P-II may hold even if

P-I fails. In this section, we use regional Japanese data to demonstrate that in a case in which there
                                                                                                                       20


 are minimal barriers to trade and factor mobility,                the Heckscher-Ohlin         model of production

 performs exceedingly well. 10

          It is important to realize that our tests which failed on international data could likewise fail

 on regional data. Such a failure could arise from a variety of influences. For example, it could arise

 from regional differences in employment or utilization rates. As well, anything that gave rise to

 different input coefficient matrica        would lead to failure. This cotid include a ftiure           of factor price

 equalization, technological differences, imperfwt mobility of goods and factors, distortions                           in

 goods or factor markets, economies of scale, local external effects, etc. So the success of the

regional test is far from a foregone conclusion.

          Japanese regional data is well suited for this type of analysis because it is collected by the

central government and therefore all categorim are consistent across regions. Theoretically,                          we

could have used data from all 48 Japanese prefectures, but in practice we were forced to aggregate

many of these prefectures into 10 larger regions.           This   aggregation was necessary because some of

the labor data was only reported for aggregated regions and also because it is very common for

people who work in, say, Tokyo to live in art adjacent prefecture.                      These regions differ quite

substantially in size. For example, Okinawa, the smallest region, has only one seventieth the

number of college graduates and one fortieth the amount of capital as the largest region, Kanto.

         We now re-examine the Heckscher-Ohlin theory of the location of production by restricting

our sample to ten Japanese regions. That is, we check whether B’X’ = V’. Even if the pattern of

production in the rest of the world fails to satisfy these relations, they should continue to hold for

the various Japanese regions. Figure’s 4 through 6 relate actual and imputed levels of our three

factors. In every case, imputed ranks match the actuaJ ranks and the correlation coefficients exceed

0.99. In Table 3, we examine the relationship                across prefectures and find that the theoretical



10 There is one notable difference between the conventional international Heckscher-Ohlin model and the regional
version. The conventional model assumes no cross-national factor mobility, while obvi~usly there is at least some
mobility across the regions of JaparI.we believe this poses no fundamental problem for the regional model. It will
remain true that the Hakscher-Ohlin relations must hold ex posr. Alternatively, given that the Heckscher-Ohlin
relations do hold the actual regionat distribution of factors belong to a factor price equalization set associated with an
integrated equilibrium. Thus if immobility were now imposd, it Wodd have no impact on the raulting equilibrium
[cf. Helpman and figman (1985)].
                                                                                                                 21


predictions are close to the data. Furthermore,          as Table 4 shows,      the average correlation within

regions and across factors between theoretical factor contents of production and actual endowments

(as a percentage of national endowment levels) was 0.8890, The results are strikingly better with

regional than international data.

         Previous tests of the Heckscher-Ohlin         theory have often used more than three factors of

production despite the problems that arise from having factors that are closely related to industry

categories. Despite the risk of tautologically true relationships between, for example, the number of

agrictdtural workers and agricultural output, using more factors reduces the probability that our

results are due to chance. While we would have liked to have broken                         capital into various

components      and used various types of land as factors, disaggregated                 capital stocks are not

available at the regional level and land usage rates are not available for tie service sectors. Detailed

labor data were employed that broke up employment                  into nine categories – professional         and

technical workers, managers, office workers, sales workers,               service workers,     miners, transport

and communication       workers, production workers, security employees, and agricdture,                forest and

fishery workers. In practice the restits for mining and miners were unreliable due to the treatment

of oil inventories so this category was dropped from our sample.l 1

         We repeat our test at the regional level, again checking that B’X’ = V’, but now using the

expanded set of ten factors. Tables 5 artd 6 present the results from repeating our experiment using

ten factors. Once again we found that the both the raw correlations and the rank correlations across

regions always exceeded 0.95. The correlation across factors, however, was somewhat lower: the

raw correlation averaged 0.77 for the whole sample. Interestingly, the average rank correlation was

ordy 0.48. The difference between these two numbers is especiaUy striking for Tohoku which had

a raw correlation of 0.9 and a rank correlation of only 0,03. The reason why the rank correlation

tended to be lower than the raw correlation is that the rankings tended to pull apart points that were


11The problem is that while oil imports are not counted as regional production, changes in inventories are counti
as production. Since Japanese mining output is extremely small, changes in crude oil inventories tended to dominate
regional mining output resulting in implausibly large or small output levels for certain regions. While this shotid
technically affect all of our resdts, the fact that mining is such a smatl sector in all Japanese regions meant that
errors in mining inventories had little effect on our overall results.

qtikclose    together. Forexmple,       in Tohokudl     oftieactud     factors except agfictimre,     forest, and

 fishery workers were within 20% of each other. While the raw correlation was high because the

model correctly predicted an abundance of these workers,              the rank correlation was low because

relatively minor differences in factor supplies led to qtite different rank orders. In general, the

model seemed to be able to rank factors correctly when their relative abundance differed by more

than 15%, but was not accurate for smaller differences.

         Three results compare quite favorably to those of BLS. In contrast to our rank correlation

of 0.97, BLS found that the rank correlations             across countries averaged only 0.21 and only

exmded      0.5 for one factor: arable land. Even our lower rank correlation of 0.49 across factors

looks relatively good in comparison to BLS          ‘S rmult   of 0.27. Indeed, in the BLS study only one

quarter of the countries in their sample had a rank correlation across factors that exceeded 0.49 and

five out of their 27 countries had negative rank correlations while none of ours did. To some

degree, our restdts are not directly comparable to BLS’s because those authors were examining

trade rather than production data. Furthermore,         our regional data are richer than BLS’s in labor

categories but do not include the various land categories available for countries as a whole.12 The

omission of land categories, however, probably understate              the strength of our results. In fact, if

BLS had not used land in tieti sample, their average rank correlation would have fallen from 0.21

to 0.12. The magnitudes of their correlations seem very much in line with our cross-country results

and imply that the underlying         assumption     of identical twhniques       across   a broad sample of

countries is likely to be a major problem in applying the Heckscher-Ohlin model across countries.13

         On the whole, we take our results to be an importartt validation of the Heckscher-Ohlin

theory of the location of production across regions.




12We were umble to use land categories because we did not have information on land usage in the services sector for
Japan.

                                                                                                              23


 4.2    Consumption

          The assumption of homothetic preferences also plays a crucial role in the Heckscher-Ohlin-

Vanek theory of trade, and it seems reasonable to ask how accurate this is. Hunter and Markusen

 (1989) and Hunter (1990) have shown, on international data, that there is good reason to believe

that the consumption of goods is not homothetic. It stands to reason that poor countries are likely

to spend greater shares of their income on food products than rich countries, In fact, Hunter (1990)

has suggested that three non-homotheticitie,s in consumption             may explain as much as 25% of

world trade. While the homotheticity assumption is Wely to cause problems in international data

because of tremendous income disparities across countries, in regional data one should expect

these disparities to be less severe.

          To test the assumption of homotheticity in Japanese regions, we used the Fm”ly Income

ti     Eqenditure   Survey to collect data on regional consumption            expenditures    for 42 different

product categories.     Our first @t of homotheticity         was whether Japanese        regional household

consumption was proportional to national household consumption or whether equation C-H held

(i.e. D’ = (sr/s~)@). In structuring our test this way, we implicitly allow two possible reasons

why the theory might differ from the data. First, it may be the case that consumers                 in different

regions    have different    preference      for dtiferent    commodities,    and second,      there may      be

interregional differences in the prices of goods. In this sense, we are not t~ting homotheticity per

se, but rather we are examining the joint assumption that prices do not significantly differ across

regions and preferenc~      are identical and homothetic.ld

          Table,s 7 and 8 present         the results   from comparing       predicted   and actual regional

consumption. Looking at the cross regional and cross factor results, the data seem to be consistent

with the assumption of homotheticity. Only consumption of liquefied fuels seems to be an outlier.

This is because Hokkaido,       the northernmost region, consumes proportiontiy            more fuel than the

rest of the country.     All of the remaining rank and raw correlation              coefficients   exceed 0.9,



14Alternatively, preferenms may be non-homothetic if there is litde to no variation in the distribution of income
within regions.
                                                                                                                24


indicating that one may reasonably assume that Japanese regions consume m if their constituent

households had identical and homothetic preferences.15

         In order for the international version of the Heckscher-Ohh            model to hold, it must be the

case that Japanwe final goods absorption should be proportional to world final goods absorption

(i.e. equation C-I must hold).lb Huter        and Markusen’s (1989) work on international data suggests

important deviations from this theory. me               we do not pretend to replicate their work, it is

interesting   to examine how closely Japanese             consumption      follows   world     production.   It is

inappropriate to compare Japanwe consumption with the sum of world production because a large

share of output       is used    up as intermediate       products      in the production      of other goods.

Unfortunately, we do not have good input-output data for most countries in our sample and so it is

impossible to know how much of each country’s gross output is used as intermediates in other

industries.   In order to adjust world consumption          by intermediate input demand,          we mdtiplied

world production by (1–A~) (where A‘ is the Japanese input-output matrix) to generate world net

production. We then compared this number to Japanese household,                  investment,    and government

consumption.     This is therefore a joint test of two assumptions:         the assumption      of homotheticity

and the resumption that intermediate input usage (not including primary factors) is identical across

the world.

        Figure 7 plots Japanese final goods absorption against the imputed level derived from

world production and the Japanese input-output matrix. The raw correlation between these two

vectors is 0.80 and the rank correlation is 0.82. Looking at the graph reveals that one of the largest

outliers is “other services” which is heavily consumed in Japan but not very heavily consumed in

the world.    Most probably,      this represents    a classtilcation    error resulting from a discrepancy

between Japanme and international categories. In fact, if “other services” is dropped,                   the raw

correlation jumps to 0.89. Interestingly,       the homotheticity resumption tends to work even better


15Most likely these resdts arise from the closeness of per capita income within Japan. Indeed, Japan has one of the
lowest Gini coefficients in the world.
16In all subsequent tests and tables we used absorption data rather than household consumption data. The absorption
data also includes government consumption, investment, and business consumption. See the data appendix for
details. Final goods absorption is total absorption less intermediate input absorption.
                                                                                                          25


for tradables than for non-tradables. Figure 8 presents the resdts for just the tradable goods sectors

and here the correlation between the two series is 0.90.

         These resdts suggest that the assumption that consumption of tradables is homothetic is not

likely   to cause    big problems    reconciling   Japanese    consumption       and   world    production.

Furthermore,    it suggests that while there are very large problems associated with assuming that

primary factors enter into international production      functions identically across countries,       these

problems are not particululy    severe for intermediate products, possibly because the latter are often

tradable, relatively homogeneous in quality, and less substitutable.



4.3 Putting     Production     and Consumption       Together:     Trade

4.3.1 Regional      Trade    Under   Strict   HOV Assumptions

         We now turn to examine the fu~ Hwkscher-Ohlin-Vanek            theory of the net factor content of

trade. We do not apply this test to the full complement of countries. Given our negative resulfi on

the theory’s ability to account for the location of production, any positive results would have to be

spurious. We do, though, begin with a test predicated on the assumption that all countries use the

Japanese input coefficient matrices, A’ and B’. This corresponds to testing the strict form of HOV

as expressed by equation T-I. me reason for implementing this is to demonstrate that gains in

explanatory power are not tied solely to a shift from international to regional comparisons,       but rely

also on our resumptions concerning cross-counhy comparability of technology.

         Our test, then, is strict in assuming     that all countries    use the Japanese      input-output

matrices, A‘    and B’.     Our tes~ focus on the ten regions       of Japan,     examining    the relation

B’ (Z - AJ)-l      [Y’ - D’] = V’ - S’vw. Ultimately, we want to see how well the theories of

production and consumption can be integrated into a coherent theory of trade. Our first test was to

examine how the strictest version of the Heckscher-Ohlin         model fit the data using actual world

endowment data. The top panel of Table 9 and the first column of Table 10 present the results of

this comparison.    As one might have guessed from our previous results trying to map production

into factor endowments, the overall fit of the regional data into the strict version of the Heckscher-
                                                                                                               26


 Ohlin model is poor. Overall, out of 30 possible sign matches, we were only able to correctly

 predict factor flows for 19. This cannot be statistically distinguished even at the 10% level from the

 expwted number of sign matches that one could have gotten by simply flipping a coin to determine

relative factor abundances. 17 In terms of rank correlations, while the strict version of the model did

work well for college educated workers,              it performed     considerably    worse    for non-college

graduates and capital. Looking at the results across factors yielded similar results. The rank

correlations averaged only 0.26 across all prefectures and only 0.35 across factors. These results

are comparable to those of BLS, who also found very low rank correlations in their trade tests.

While BLS found that cross-national factor flows cotdd not be predicted by a strict version of the

Heckscher-Ohlin      model, we demonstrate        that this problem extends to regional total net trade

patterns as well.

         We can also investigate whether the problem that Trefler (1995) identtiled on international

data as the “case of the missing trade” also appears in the Japanese data. We begin with summary

measures for Japan as a whole. If we add across regions, V’ – SJVW is the predicted net factor

content of trade for Japan as a whole. Scaling this by national endowments                    of the respective

factors, we predict that Japan’s net imports of non-college factor services will ~ual               31% of the

national endowment.       Predicted    net exports    of the services      of Japan’s     college   and capital

endowments     equal 37% and 4090 of the national endowment rmpectively.                  In short, the model

predicts that a huge proportion of national endowments              will on net be imported or exported.

However, when we turn to the measured net factor content of trade, B’(1 – AJ)-l T’, the picture

looks very different. Again scaling by the national endowment, Japan is a net exporter of 3.6% of

the non-college endowment,         7.4% of the college endowment,            and 2.3%      of the non-college

endowment. That is, the measured factor content of trade is an order of magnitude smaller than that

predicted. At the aggregate level, the problem of missing net factor trade is very much in evidence.



17 me signflcanee levels were based on a binomial distribution that was conditioned on the assumption that the
expected number of negative signs ~ualed the proportion of negatives in each vator, This conditioning was

          We can also look at this in the regional context. Following Trefler, we graph the net factor

trade residuals, ET = BJ(l – A~)-l~          - (~   – s’Vw), against the predicted net factor trade, V -

STVW.Theory tells us that this shodd be a horizontal line at zero. Instead, as we see in Figure 9,

this is very close to having a slope of minus one, indicating that measured net factor trade, BJ(I -

A’)-l T’, is small relative to predicted net factor trade, W - S’VW. Thus, we also encounter the

“missing trade” in the regional data. However,            the fact that we are working            separately with

production and absorption allows us to probe more deeply into the causes of the missing trade. It is

convenient to define separate residuals for production,          &n = B’(1 – A’)-l Y               – V’, and for

absorption,    &D= – [B’(1 – A ~)‘lD’ – s’Vw].         Since ~~ =   Em   +    &D,   a graph of the three sets of

residu~      against W - s’V w vertically decomposes the net factor trade errors into the component

parts. This is depicted in Figure 10. As is evident from the plot, the production residuals Emvery

closely follow the theoretical prediction of a horizontal line at zero. We take this as an important

conflation      of the Heckscher-Ohlin      model of the location of production.

          The plot in Figure 10 further reveals that essentially fie entire problem of missing trade

arises from the absorption errors,    ED.   Does this evidence some ftiure          in the consumption      theory?

Although the failure turns up in the factor content of absorption,           the answer is no. Rwall that the

Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek       theory of consumption       requires two stages. The first assumes identical

homothetic preferences,     and equal goods prices everywhere. This yields an equation in terms of

goods absorption that we saw in Figures 7 and 8 works quite nicely. The second step requir~ that

the goods demands be translated to the implicit demand for factors. This requires universal factor

price equalization to insure Vw can be substituted for BJXW,             so that the implicit absorption of

factors will be SVW. Yet we have seen in Tables 1 and 2 that this simple model of international

production does not work at all well,

          Signtilcandy,   the errors in the factor content of absorption,           ED, are   systematic.   ~   ten

errors for non-college      endowment    are negative; nine of ten errors on absorption                 of college

endowment are positive; and all ten errors on absorption of capital endowment are positive. One

might expect this pattern to arise if Vw systematically overestima~                 effective world supplies of
                                                                                                     28


 non-college endowment,     and underwtimates     the world’s   college and capital endowment       (all

 measured in terms of Japanese productivity). In fact, this is what a direct comparison of Vw and

BX w reveals. The former is 40% larger for non-college endowment,          and 37% and 41% smaller

 for college and capiti endowment respectively. This suggests the value of pursuing a version of

our model which does not require universal factor price equalization, a task to which we now turn.



4.3.2 Regional      Trade   Without   Universal    Factor   Price Equalization

        The failure of the strict version of the Heckscher-Ohlin    model leads us to consider what

types of relaxations would make the model fit better. Clearly, simply using regional data is not

enough of a departure from earlier studies to generate an improvement         in the fit of the HOV

equations. Fortunately, the previous analysis pinpointed the locus of a major failure of the model:

B’XW # Vw. Theory tells us that if the condition of world factor price equalization has been

violated, then the appropriate trade test is T-II, not T-I. In other words, we will continue to require

that the BJ and A~ matrices are identical for the various regions of Japan, but no longer require that

the BJ matrix is identical in other countries of the world. J.n constructing the theoretical Japanese

factor content of consumption,     this requires that we drop information       on the actual world

endowmenw, Vw, and instead use the imputed endowments,           BJX w. We continue to assume that

Japanese absorption is proportional to world production. Thus for each of the Japanese regions,

we ask whether B’(Z - A’)-l [Y’ – D] = ~ - S’B’XW. The second panel of Table 9 and the

second column of Table 10 display the resulfi from this exercise. Once the assumption of identical

techniqum is relaxed, our results improve dramatically, with the average rank correlation across

factors and regions jumping to 0.75 or higher. Here, the sign test reveals that the Heckscher-Ohlin

model is correct in 23 out of 30 cases, which is significant at tie          170 level. Relaxing    the

resumption about identical techniques makes the Heckscher-Ohlin      model a very good predictor of

net factor trade flows.

        We return now to Trefler’s (1995) problem of “missing trade.” We continue to assume that

factor price equalization holds for the Japanese regions, but not necmsarily for other countries.
                                                                                                    29


 Again we begin witi summary measures for Japan as a whole. Recall that the measured factor

content of trade as a share of Japanme national endowment is 3.6%, 7.470 and 2.390 for non-

college, college, and capita factors respectively. This was an order of magnitude smaller than our

e~lier predictions. Now we repeat the experiment, using Vr - srB’X w as the Japanese predicted

factor content of trade, and again scaling each factor by the national endowment.           The new

predictions for Japan as a whole are 5.4%, -0.2%, and -1 .5% for non-college, college, and capital

respectively. That is, the predictions are of the right order of magnitude to fit measured net factor

trade. Moreover, the change in the model has shifted us from a prediction of huge net factor trade

flows (an absolute average of 36% of the national endowment of the three factors) to much more

modest flows (an absolute average under 2.4~0 of national endowments). In such a case, a finding

that measured net factor trade is very small is no longer a puzzle.

        The regional data confirms this basic result. RecaU that the only alteration that we have

made is in the factor content of absorption, which shifts from ~rVw to srB ~XW. As a result, the

production residuals discussed above,    Em,   have not changed. The errors in net factor trade, ET,

change ordy due to changes in the absorption residual, which is now &D= – [BJ(l – A’)- lD’ –

srB’Xw]. The magnitude of the errors is sharply reduced. The median error declines by more than

two-thirds. Fully two-thirds of the errors are cut by more than half. An example is the case of

Kanto (which includm Tokyo). The error on non-college endowment            is only 15% as l~ge; on

college endowment, ordy 12% as large; and on capital endowment,       only 370 m large. In sum, the

fit is greatly improved.

        A similar story emerges when we look at the corresponding      errors in the factor content of

trade, &~. As Figure 11 reveals, there continues to be a negative relation between the errors in net

factor trade and predicted levels. However,      this relation is greatly diminished   under the new

hypothesis. However, the big story is the dramatic decline in the magnitude of the errors. Of thirty

errors, twen~ are cut by half or more, while only three rise by a factor of two or more. Again, we

can consider the case of Kanto. The trade error for non-college labor is only 15% as large; for
                                                                                                     30


college endowment, ordy 26% as large; and for capital, ordy 107o m large. Again, the fit for the net

factor content of trade is greatly improved.

        One question that naturtiy    arises at this point is whether our positive results are just the

product of using regional rather than national dam. Recall from s~tion            4.3.1    that the HOV

hypothesis failed just as miserably with regional data as it had in earlier studies with national data.

In fact, the pattern of failure was very similar, likewise exhibiting Trefler’s “missing trade.” This

shows that a shift to regional data does not insure success. A related question k whether the results

on the regions shotid    be looked on as distinct observations,      rather than really m one national

observation iterated ten times. This concern would be partictiarly     apt if the regions were in effect

scaled down versions of the national economy. However, these concerns are misplaced. First, the

regional restits are based on a rich data base (see Appendix) that reflects genuine regional variation

in production patterns, endowments,     and absorption.   Second, the regions do not just look like

scaled down versions of the national economy. One window on this problem is to ask whether

there is typically a strong correlation between the factors which are on net exported by the regions

and by the nation. Since the nation is the aggregate of the regions, one may expect some positive

correlation. But if the regional observations are to count as distinct observations,      one would not

want this correlation to be too strong. How strong is it? Recall that we can make these comparisons

for either measured or predicted factor contents of trade, and that we can do this for ten regions and

three factors. For measured net factor content of trade, the sign at the regional level was the same

as the national level in only 15 out of 30 cells. For predicted net factor content, the sign at the

regional level matched that at the national level ordy 20 of 30 times. Given that the nation is the

aggregate of the regions, and thus that we might expect a positive correlation, the surprising fact is

how independent the signs at the regional level are from the national aggregate. That time regional

variations reflect more than just noise is cotilrmed   in our sign tests on regional net factor trade,

which reject at the 9990 level the independence of the signs of measured and predicted net factor

made. In sum, we believe that these observations validate the use of the regional approach to testing

the HOV theory.
4.3.3 Regional      Trade     With Japan-Specific    Demand

         In the final test, we continue to focus on Japanese regions, but drop the assumption that

Japanese regional absorption is proportional to world production,       adopting instead the stronger

assumption that it is proportional    to Japanwe national absorption.   This corresponds    to testing

equation T-III, In the last panel of Table 9 and the last column of Table 10, we present results from

estimating the model for the case in which B’(Z - A’)-l [ Yr - Cr] = V’ - (xr/s’)B’(l - A ‘)-1

U. What is striking about this adjustment is that there is little or no improvement in the overall fit

of the model. Just as in the cme where the identical technology assumption had been relaxed, we

get 23 sign matches and the rank correlations are, if anything, a bit lower. In fact every element of

the net factor content matrix calcdated    with world production     data has the same sign as the

corresponding element in the matrix calculated with consumption data. This sugges~ that most of

the failure of the Heckscher-Ohlin   model stems from its assumption     about identical technologies

while its resumption about homothetic consumption, at lemt as f~ m Japanese data are concerned,

seems to be reasonably valid.

         The failure to find an improvement in prediction with the Japan-spaific    demand contains

important information regarding a result of Trefler (1995). His preferred specification for a revised

HOV model includes a home bias in demand. This can be written as D’ = (s’/sJ)[(l – I)sJYW +

IYJ ]. The standard HOV model has 2 = O, while a pure home bim model sets A = 1. As the

degree of home bim is unobsemable,      it must be estimated. Suppose, then, that we have selected A

by whatever criterion we find appropriate. Within the context of this model, the most favorable

result possible is that the term in brackets, [(1 – l)#Yw + AYJ ] will exactly equal ~,    so that our

predicted consumption becomes D’=        (s’/sJ)@. However, this is the model that we have just seen

yields no improvement       over the standard HOV consumption     model. If under the best possible

circumstances we find no improvement,       then we can conclude that allowing for home bias in

demand does not contribute to an explanation of net factor trade patterns, at least for the regions of

Japan.
                                                                                                        32


         We befieve this is an important advance. The mystery of “missing trade” is resolved here

by use of data and theory alone, without a need to estimate technological or demand diffences that

allow the theory to fit the data. We are able to directly examine the source of the problem, as we

use separate data for the theories of production and absorption. And we arrive at a substantively

distinct restit from that of Trefler. In addition to international technology differences, he suggested

that a home bias in consumption may be required to eliminate the missing trade. We have shown

that it is not necessary to make any changes to the demand model to greatly improve the fit.



5.0   Conclusion

        The Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek        model has been central to the analysis of international trade. It

provides the intellectual framework for a remarkable array of literature – theoretical, applied and

policy. As a result, the emptica.1 failure of the HOV model in prominent               studies has been

profoundly disappointing.     Despair, though, is unwarranted. Very likely the empirical failure owes

importantly to examining the theory in its most general – and least realistic – form.

        Recent work, notably by Trefler (1993), has sought to identify simple modifications        of this

general model that fit the data well. Our work is in the same spirit. We make two important

modifications.   The first is to abandon the notion that the technology implemented           is identical

everywhere. This leads us to focus on the implications of the model for regions of Japan for which

the assumption of identical technologies is more plausible. In contrast to other regional models of

Hmkscher-Ohlin      trade, we do this while continuing       to embed our model in a theoretically

appropriate way within the full world equilibrium. The second modification is to ignore trade data

as such, and instead focus on the components – production and absorption. Thk allows us to test

separately the Heekscher-Ohh       theories of the location of production and pattern of consumption.

By examining them separately, we know the source of any deviations that arise when we assemble

the pair to a fdl test of the trade theory.

        We first consider the Heckscher-Ohlin        theory of the pattern of production       under the

assumption that all countries in the world utilize the same input coefficients. Our results find little
                                                                                                             33


support for this version of Heckscher-Ohlin,          cotilrming     earlier studies.     The results improve

dramatically, though, under the more modest assumption that all Japanese regions share a common

set of input coefficients. In this formulation, Heckscher-Ohlin       is quite successful in accounting for

the location of production according to the standard tests, We also show that this result is robust to

altering the degrm of aggregation in the definition of factors.

        We then turn to the Heckscher-Ohlin      theory of the pattern of consumption.           We examine

this first by considering    Japanese regional absorption,         which the theory suggests       should be

proportional to world net output. To implement this test requires an ability to move from gross to

net output figures, hence an resumption that the Japanme input-output             matrix is common to the

world. The Heckscher-Ohlin       model of proportional absorption does surprisingly           well under this

assumption.    We next consider the milder hypothesis            that Japanese       regional consumption    is

proportional   to national consumption,    a restit   strongly     supported   in our model.      In all, the

Heckscher-Ohlin theory of consumption stands up remarkably well as a simple description of the

data, at least for the regions of Japan.

        We then assemble this information for a fti       test of the Heckscher-Ohlin        theory of the net

factor content of trade. Our earlier results showed        that the theory codd           not account for the

international pattern of production. Hence no point is served by looking at the implied net factor

content of trade of the various countries, as positive results would have to be spurious. Instead, we

focus on accounting for the net factor trade of the Japanese              regions.      Three approaches    are

developed. The first establish      a benchmark. It uses data on actual world factor endowments,

implicitly assuming again that all countries use the same input coefficients. We show that the model

performs poorly and replicate Trefler’s (1995) “mystery of the the missing trade.” In the next two

cases, we examine this using the endowments imputed to the world, given their measured output,

as if they had used the Japanese input coefficients. In the first of these, we wsume that Japanese

regional absorption is proportional to world net output. This model is a marked improvement over

that based on measured world endowments,        and largely eliminates the missing trade. In the last

case, we consider this under the assumption that Japanese regional consumption              is proportional to
                                                                                                          34


national consumption.     This yields no further improvement,       demonstrating     that changing      the

consumption model is not necessary to better the model’s fit.

        An important question is whether the results we have obtained using regional data have

important implications for the relevance of Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek        to the international economy.

We believe that they do. First, note that, although we have principally been concerned with the

predictions for regional data, we have consistently applied models that encompass the fti             world

general equilibrium.    Second,   we have replicated in the regional framework            the most serious

problems that have afflicted the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek     model when applied in its simple form to

international data. Third, once we have made alterations in our specification that are both sensible

and consistent with the spirit of the model, we have had excellent results. We believe that the

approach   that we have developed       in the regional    framework      holds   great    promise    when

appropriately applied to cross-country data.

        In sum, we find that the Heckscher-Ohlin          model under the conventional           restrictive

assumptions is a poor predictor of the international pattern of production, hence of net factor trade.

However, this changw markedly when applied to predictions for regions of Japan. Given the long

string of empirical failures of Heckscher-Ohlin,    it is surprisingly   successful   as a theory of the

location of production and the pattern of consumption – hence the net factor content of trade – of

these regions.

Data Appendix

REGIONAL ENDOWMENTS
The numbers of college%ducated workers and non-college-educated workers (“good factors”)
were entered by prefecture directly from the Employment Sta~ Sumey of 1987 (Shugyo Kozo
Kihon Chosa Hokoku) and then summed to get regional totals. The numbers of 10 kinds of
workers (“bad factors”) were also entered by prefecture directly from the Employment Status
Sumey of 1987 and then summed to get regional totals. me capiti stocks by region were imputed
from prefectud investment data. Japan’s yearly Pre~ecturd Accounts (Kerzmin Keizai Keisan
Nempo) give investment flows for each prefecture from 1975 to 1985. These flows were used to
impute capital stock levels for each prefecture in 1985, using capital goods price deflators from the
National Accounts and a rate of depreciation of 0.133 (This was the same rate of depreciation used
by BLS). Each year’s flow was deflated using a capital deflator from the National Accounts. The
1985 imputed levels were then aggregated to get regional capital stocks for 1985.

WORLD ENDOWMENTS
World endowmens of capital stocks were calculated using ten years of investment data from the
Summers and Heston (1988) data set. World endowments of labor force by educational level were
taken from the UNESCO Statistical Yearbook. Once again we had a scaling problem arising from
the fact that the Summers and Heston numbers and the UNESCO numbers did not match the
Japanese numbers exactly. We therefore scaled each country’s capital stock by the ratio of our
calcdated Japanese capital stock to the Summers and Heston value for the Japanese capital stock.
The imputed international labor endowments were similarly scaled by the proportional difference
between the UNESCO numbers and the actual Japanese endowments,

REGIONAL PRODUCTION
The gross output of 20 manufacturing sectors in each prefecture was taken from the Japanese
Censu$ of Manufactures for 1985. The gross output of 10 non-manufacturing sectors in each
prefecture was taken from the Prefectural Accounts for 1985. These numbers for all 30 sectors
were then aggregated to get regional production totals. Finally, these totals were scaled so that the
10-region total for each sector exactly matched the total Japanese output as reported in the 1985
Input-Ouput Table of Japan. Thus, in effect, the data from the Census of Manufactures and from
the Prefectural Accounts was used in order to distribute total Japanese output for each sector across
the 10 regions as accurately as possible.

WORLD PRODUCTION
Data on international levek of production came from the United Nation’s National Accounts
Statistics: Main Aggregates and Dew-led Tables, 1985. These numbers differed slightly from the
numbers reported in the Japane,se IO table, so the output of each sector in every country’s output
was scaled by the factor necessary to make the international data on Japan match the IO data. The
35 countries used to calculate total world production were Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switmrla.nd, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, USA,
and West Germany. Output was converted into Yen using exchange rate data from the ZMF’s
Intentional Fimcial Statistics.

ABSORPTION AND NET TRADE
Since the production data is gross output rather than value added, we had to subtract off five
categories of absorption in order to calctiate the net trade mairix: intermediate use by producers,
business consumption (in Japanese data this category is largely entertainment expenses),
household (final) consumption, investment, and government purchmes.
Intermecliate input use in each region was calculated using the Japan 30x30 IO matrix for 1985.
Thus, ZNPUTC = A Xc, where ZNPUT’is intermediate consumption in region c, A’ is the IO
matrix, and Xc is gross output in region c, Both INPUT’ and Xc, therefore, are 30x 1 vectors,
The 10 ZNPUT’ vectors together form a 3OX1O intermediate consumption matrix. The bmic
source for the fmd consumption data was the Househoti Expetiimre Survey for 1987. This
survey lists household expenditures by region for 56 spending categories. This data was then
aggregated up to 42 categories, producing a 42x 10 matrix of final consumption by region. This
matrix was then premultiplied by a 30x42 bridging matrix from the Economic Planning Agency
(there is no 30x56 bridging matrix) which mapped the 42 commoditim into the 30 core sectors
which we used in our analysis. The survey data was based, of course, on consumer prices, so the
bridge matrix ww specially constructed to translate the consumption expenditure into producer
prices. Most of the difference between consumer and producer prices results from wholesale and
retail markups and from transportation costs, so the mapping shifted portions of spending on each
final good into the wholesale/retail trade and transportation sectors, reflecting the fact that to
consume anything bought retail is to consume the wholesaling, retailing, and transportation
services which brought the product to the store. Without this adjustment, the data would have
greatly underestimated final consumption of wholesale/retail and transportation services and would
have shown each region exporting far more of these services than is plausible.

There are no invmtrnent figures broken down for 30 sectors and 10 regions, so these numbers
were imputed using IO Table investment data. The IO Table breaks down investment into the 30
sectors for Japan as a whole. This vector was then distributed across regions, using as weights
each re ion’s share in total investment for Japan as a whole.                 Thus,   ZNVC =
(7’Zc/TIIf#pan)lNVJa~a”, where INVC is a 30x1 investment vector for region c, TF is the total
investment for that region in 1985 (taken from the pref~tural accoun~), TIJqa is Japan’s total
investment for 1985, and INVJ~m is the 30x1 investment vector taken from the IO Table. These
10 ZNV’S therefore formed a 3OX1Oinvestment matrix. The government consumption matrix was
constructed in a similar fashion, using the 30x 1 IO government vector, except that the weights
used were not each region’s share in Japan’s total inv~tment but each region’s share in Japan’s
total GDP. Business consumption was added to the data in a similar fashion.

Net trade for each region was then calculated by subtracting the following from gross output:
intermediate consumption, household consumption, investment, and government consumption.
Thus, T = X – AX – BC – INV – G, where T is net exports, X is gross output, B C is business
and household consumption, and each of three symbols represents a 30x 10 matrix. It is worth
noting that by construction, the sum of net trade across regions will equal Japan’s net trade vector.

TECHNOLOGY
Each element of the 3x30 “good facto~’ technology matrix B’ was calcdated by dividing Japanese
total output for the 30 sectors into the number of each factor present in each sector. Most of the
data on college and non-college workers in each sector came from the 1988 Wage Census. There
were some gaps in this data as follows: 1) There was no data for college and non-college workers
for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries or for government. Thwe numbers were taken from the
1987 E~loyment       Status Suwey. 2) There WM also no data for the petroleum/coal and leather
industries. Total employment for each of these sectors was taken from the 1985 Census of
Manufactures. The number of college workers per unit output for each was then imputed by
wuming that petroleum/coal has the same fraction of college workers m the chemicals sector and
that leather has the same fraction as manufacturing overall. The data on the “bad” 9 categories of
labor came from the IO Table, which reports the numbers of each of 9 kinds of workers in the 30
sectors. The capital stocks in each of the 30 sectors were imputed from investment numbers, using
the Annuul Report of the Corporation Survey for non-manufacturing              and the Census of
Manufactures for manufactting.
