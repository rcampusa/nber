Potential for Inward Foreign Direct Investment in Japan

                                         ABSTRACT

Promotion of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) into Japan has been an important policy in
the Abenomics growth strategy. This paper examines if we observe positive impacts of the
policy in the data. We first estimate a gravity model of bilateral FDIs using data for 35 OECD
countries as destination countries. In estimating the model, we handle zero values for FDI stock
explicitly. We take the model prediction as a reasonable counterfactual and compare that to the
actual inward FDI stock for Japan. Although the actual inward FDI stock has been growing and
is likely to achieve the goal of 35 trillion yen by 2020, the growth under the Abe administration
has been comparable to or slightly lower than the counterfactual suggested by the estimated
model. We also estimate the model without Japan as a destination country and use the estimated
model to calculate the counterfactual level of Japan’s inward FDI. Although we expect the gap
between the counterfactual and the actual become narrower if Abenomics policy has been
successful, we fail to find that. These results cast a doubt on the effectiveness of the Abenomics
policies to encourage inward FDI at least as of 2015.

1.   Introduction

An important motivation for corporations to expand into foreign countries is to use their
advantage over the competitors in the host countries. Thus, foreign companies often have higher
productivities than domestic companies. 1 From host country’s point of view, allowing more
foreign direct investment (FDI) may lead to higher economic growth through productivity
spillovers from foreign companies, which would ultimately increase social welfare. 2

        The benefit of increasing inward FDI for Japan may be especially large because Japan
has been known for its very low level of inward FDI compared with other advanced economies.
Table 1 presents the inward FDI stock to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio for 35 Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1985 to 2015. 3 The table
indicates that the inward FDI stock to GDP ratio for Japan is 4.2 percent in 2015, far below the
OECD average of 50.4 percent and the smallest among all the OECD countries.

                                                === Table 1 ===

         Recently Japan has tried to promote inward FDI to enhance its potential growth.
Promotion of inward FDI has been an important goal of the growth strategy under Abenomics.
Since 2013, the Abe administration pursued the goal of increasing its inward FDI stock to 35
trillion yen (up from 19.2 trillion yen at the end of 2012) by 2020. Figure 1 plots the inward FDI
stock for Japan from 1996 to 2017. By the end of 2017, Japan’s inward FDI stock rose to 28.6
trillion yen. At this rate, the goal of 35 trillion yen will be easily reached by 2020. As Hoshi
(2018) argues, however, Abenomics does not seem to have changed the long-run trend of Japan’s
inward FDI. The increase of inward FDI under Abenomics is almost exactly what the past trend
would have predicted. Thus, Hoshi (2018) concludes that there is no evidence that the
Abenomics policy to promote inward FDI has been effective.

                                                === Figure 1 ===

        This paper also examines Japan’s inward FDI under Abenomics, but goes beyond Hoshi
(2018) by using more carefully constructed counterfactual than a simple extrapolation of the past
trend. We estimate gravity models of FDI stock and use those to infer how Japan’s inward FDI
stock would have evolved in the absence of Abenomics policies. We implement two slightly
different approaches.

1
  Several studies found that the productivity of foreign companies is, on average, higher than that of domestic
companies. See, for example, Doms and Jensen (1998) for the case of the United States and Kimura and Kiyota
(2007) for the case of Japan.
2
  A number of studies found that knowledge brought by multinational firms spills over to domestic industries and
increase their productivity. See, for example, Javorcik (2004) for the case of Lithuania and Todo (2006) for the case
of Japan. Similarly, Fukao, Ito, Kwon, and Takizawa (2008) found that the acquisition by foreign firms improved
target firms’ productivity and profitability significantly more and quicker than the acquisitions by domestic firms in
Japan.
3
  The list of countries and their abbreviations are presented in Table 3. For Japan, year 1995 data are missing in the
OECD International Direct Investment Statistics database. Tables A1 and A2 presents the inward FDI stocks and
GDP to compute Table 1. Table A3 presents the inward FDI flows. Section 2 presents a more detailed description of
the data.

                                                                                                                    1
        In the first approach, we estimate a model that assumes country fixed effects. We start by
estimating the gravity model of inward FDI stocks for OECD countries from 1985 to 2012,
noting that Abenomics was started in December 2012. 4 Then, we use the estimated model to
predict inward FDI stock for Japan after 2013. We interpret the predicted values to be the
inward FDI stocks that would have been observed if the Abenomics had not started its promotion
of inward FDI. If the Abenomics policy of promoting inward FDI was effective overall, we
would expect to find that the total inward FDI in Abenomics years exceeds the predicted values.

       In the second approach, we exclude Japan as a destination country in estimating a gravity
model. We then use the estimated model to calculate what Japan’s inward FDI stock would be.
We examine the gap between the counterfactual calculated in this way and the actual inward FDI
to Japan. If Abenomics policy has been successful, we should find the gap has narrowed under
the Abe administration.

        Both of these analyses look for the changes in Japan’s inward FDI after 2013 that cannot
be explained by GDPs and other observables in the gravity model. These unexplained changes
would certainly include the impacts of the Abenomics policy to promote inward FDI, but they
may reflect many other factors that are not related to Abenomics. Thus, it is possible that we
overestimate or underestimate the impacts of Abenomics policy, depending on what kind of
factors that we are missing. This is a weakness of our approach.

        Our paper adds to the growing literature on inward FDI into Japan. Several studies
examined the determinants of inward FDI to Japan. 5 Kimino, Saal, and Driffield (2007) looked
at FDI flows from 17 countries to Japan between 1989 and 2002. They found that source
country characteristics such as political and economic stability were important determinants of
inward FDI to Japan while exchange rates and labor costs were not.

        Sato and Oki (2012) studied the distribution of US outward FDI from 1990 to 2009.
They estimated a log-linear version of gravity model and found that the US FDI to Japan was
low compared with other destination countries even after controlling for gravity variables such as
the market sizes of the destination countries. They concluded that Japan was less attractive for
the US investors than other countries, although they did not explore what made Japan less
attractive.

         Head and Ries (2005) also estimate the gravity model for Japan’s FDI, but they put that
on a solid theoretical ground. Based on the framework developed by Head and Ries (2008), they
estimate a gravity model of FDI using the data for 181 countries from 1980 to 2002. Their
results indicate that both inward and outward FDI shares of Japan is lower than the prediction of
the model.



4
  The gravity model is used not only to explain the patters of bilateral trade but also those of bilateral FDI. See,
Anderson (2011) and Head and Mayer (2015), for a literature review. Román, Bengoa, and Sánchez-Roble (2016) is
a recent example of estimating the gravity model of FDI.
5
  For the earlier literature on inward FDI in Japan, see Yoshitomi and Graham (1996).

                                                                                                                  2
       Our paper builds on these previous studies and asks if the low level of inward FDI stock
in Japan has changed under Abenomics. The paper also introduces a methodological
improvement on the previous studies, many of which estimated a log linear form of the gravity
model. A problem is that many country pairs have no FDI between them. The previous studies
usually dealt with this problem by dropping the country pairs with zero FDI. Throwing away the
observations with zero FDI, however, leads to inconsistent parameter estimates. To solve this
problem, we employ Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood model proposed by Santos Silva and
Tenreyro (2006). In addition to the explicit treatment of zero FDI, our study covers a longer and
more recent period than the previous studies.

        The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of the
policies to promote inward FDI to Japan under Abenomics. We argue that success of any of
those policies is likely to show up as a structural shift of the relation between Japan’s inward FDI
and its standard determinants in a gravity model such as distances and sizes of the origin
countries. Section 3 introduces gravity models of FDI and the estimation method that we use in
this paper. The section also goes over the two approaches we use to examine the effectiveness of
the FDI promotion under Abenomics. Section 4 describes the dataset we use and reports
summary statistics. Section 5 reports the estimation results and discusses if the Abenomics FDI
promotion policy has been successful. Section 6 concludes.


2.     Inward FDI Promotion under Abenomics

Promotion of inward FDI has been a prominent part of the growth strategy of the Abe
administration (aka the third arrow of Abenomics) from the start. The original growth strategy
published in June 2013 stated:

       The government will develop an environment where all companies and human resources
       enjoy the benefits of global economy and facilitate full-fledged globalization in Japan in
       order to attract outstanding overseas manpower and technologies to Japan and to create
       employment and innovation. It will also aim to double inward FDI stocks to 35 trillion yen
       in 2020 (17.8 trillion yen at the end of 2012). (Headquarters for Japan’s Economic
       Revitalization 2013, p.137)

         The growth strategy has been revised every year since then, but the latest one that was
published in June 2018 still includes promotion of inward FDI as one of the important policies.
The Japanese government website dedicated for Abenomics
(https://www.japan.go.jp/abenomics/, accessed July 3, 2018) features “Improve business
environment to drive inward FDI” as one of the four main goals of Abenomics. 6

        From the late 2013 to date, the Abe administration has been trying several policies that
are explicitly geared toward boosting inward FDI into Japan. In early 2014, Expert Group on
Foreign Direct Investment in Japan was created and completed a report that recommends several
policies to remove the impediments to inward FDI to Japan (Expert Group on Foreign Direct
Investment in Japan, 2014). First, the report identified three important policy areas to promote

6
    The other three are “Boost productivity”, “Pursue regulatory reforms”, and “Build on international opportunities”.

                                                                                                                         3
inward FDI. The first is a set of economic reforms to reduce the substantial differences between
the Japanese system and the global system in several areas including (i) corporate tax system, (ii)
employment system, (iii) corporate governance, (iv) system for corporate mergers, and (v)
various regulations and administrative procedures. The second is establishing inter-
governmental agreements including economic partnership agreements (EPAs), social security
treaties, and tax treaties. The third is a set of policies to improve living conditions for foreigners
in Japan. In addition to these three policy areas, the report also recommends expanding direct
support for foreign firms entering Japan by government entities and expanding government
efforts to promote the appealing aspects of Japan that are “not sufficiently understood.”

       The report is very helpful in describing and understanding the FDI promotion policies in
Abenomics, because it identifies almost all the issues that are taken up in the policy discussion
and implementation that followed. In particular, we can compare a particular policy intervention
implemented to the three policy areas identified by the report and see in which area the efforts
progressed most rapidly and effectively.

        The first comprehensive policy document for inward FDI promotion was “Five Promises
for Attracting Foreign Businesses to Japan” published in March 2015. The Japanese government
promised (1) to make it easier to live in Japan without Japanese language skills, (2) free public
Wi-Fi access points everywhere in Japan, (3) business jet access to any regional airport in Japan
with a short advance notice, (4) to enrich educational environment for children from overseas
and ensure Japanese students can communicate in English, and (5) to establish “Investment
Advisor Assignment System” that provides foreign business direct access to state ministers of
Japan.

        The Five Promises are mostly on the third policy area identified in the expert group
report, which is improving living conditions for the foreigners. The Promises are silent on the
other two policy areas, which are reforms to achieve harmonization to the global standard and
promotion of inter-governmental agreements.

        In May 2016, the government announced “Policy Package for Promoting Foreign Direct
Investment into Japan to Make Japan a Global Hub,” which now included policies to improve
“regulations and administrative procedures.” Thus, the Package addresses the first policy area
that the expert group report emphasized, but that was only a small part of the package. The other
measures continued to focus on improving the living environment for foreign nationals and
government promotion and PR to attract foreign companies.

        The regulatory reform aspect of the inward FDI promotion policy finally started to
receive emphasis by creation of the Working Group for Revising Regulations and Administrative
Procedures in late 2016. The working group completed the final report in April 2017 and
identified the regulatory and administrative issues that foreign companies face in Japan and
proposed policies to mitigate those. 7 The issues include (1) difficulty of incorporating and
registering companies, (2) problems for foreign nationals to set up legal residency, (3) lack of

foreign languages, and (5) administrative burdens in following necessary procedures for imports.


3.   Gravity Model of Foreign Direct Investment

Our approach uses a gravity model of FDI that is developed by Head and Ries (2008). They
model FDI as a consequence of managers of one country bidding to acquire production units in
another country. 8 In their model, managers in home country monitor managers at overseas
subsidiaries by incurring monitoring cost. The monitoring cost is assumed to be proportional to
the distance between the home country and the country where subsidiaries are located. Thus, the
probability of winning bid falls as the distance between the manager’s country and the target
country increases. With additional assumptions (e.g., the numbers of managers and production
units are both proportional to the economy’s GDP), they derive a gravity model of FDI stock. 9

       Letting 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗 denote the origin and the destination of FDI respectively, the gravity
equation for FDI stock is:

                               𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = exp�𝐎𝐎′𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼 + 𝐃𝐃𝑗𝑗′ 𝛽𝛽 + 𝐰𝐰𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                                                         ′
                                                                             𝛾𝛾� × 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,                     (1)

Here exp(•) denotes exponential function, 𝐎𝐎𝑖𝑖 and 𝐃𝐃𝑗𝑗 are the vectors of the origin- and
destination-country dummies to capture the fixed effects. 10 𝐰𝐰𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the vector of characteristics of
the origin-destination pair (such as distance) and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the disturbance term.

         Note that the disturbance term is assumed to multiply the exponential function.
Traditionally, researchers specified the gravity model by including the disturbance as an extra
additive term in the argument for the exponential function. This allowed them to take the log of
both sides of the equation and estimate a linear regression model. The problem of this approach
is that country pairs with zero FDI stocks are dropped from the estimation because the log of
zero is not defined. By specifying the disturbance multiplicatively and assuming the expected
value is equal to one, we can estimate the gravity model directly by employing Pseudo-Poisson
Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation proposed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006).
Although the estimation can be done by non-linear least square, the PPML estimator is known to
be more efficient than non-linear least square estimator (Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2006). 11

         Since our dataset is a panel data, we introducing time dimension to get:



8
  De Sousa and Lochard (2011) showed that the model can be applied also to greenfield investment by considering
firms selecting the best investment projects across all potential host countries.
9
  Note that their gravity model explains the bilateral FDI stocks rather than FDI flows because the model is based on
the ownership of assets.
10
   The origin and destination country fixed effects are analogous to the "multilateral resistance term" in the gravity
model of trade (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003).
11
   Another option is to use the negative binomial estimation, but the estimates are known to be sensitive to the units
of the measurement for the dependent variable. For more details, see Bosquet and Boulhol (2013).

                                                                                                                      5

where 𝐱𝐱 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the vector of time-variant country-pair specific factors; 𝐲𝐲𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝐳𝐳𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 are the vectors
of origin- and destination-country-year specific variables respectively. The origin- and
destination-country-year specific variables that we consider are population (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )
and per-capita GDP (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ). In this paper, we estimate the equation (2) using the
PPML estimation.

        Although our dataset has time dimension, we do not examine dynamics of FDI. This is
consistent with the approach of Head and Ries (2008), who uses a static model to motivate the
gravity model of FDI. Thus, our regression analysis ignores some factors such as exchange rate
fluctuations that mostly influence the timings of FDI. We do not concern the lag-lead
relationship between FDI and its determinants, either. One may argue that FDI responds to the
future (expected) levels of population and GDP, but examining this is beyond the scope of this
paper.

       We choose to use FDI stocks rather than FDI flows as dependent variables for the same
reason: we do not attempt to explain the dynamics. By using FDI stocks, we also avoid the
problem that FDI flows often have negative values. Nonetheless, we estimate the models using
FDI flows (and dropping the observations with negative values) or lagged explanatory variables
as robustness check.

        As we saw above, Japan’s inward FDI relative to GDP has been very low compared with
other OECD countries. This is partly expected because Japan has high labor costs, does not
share a common language with any other country, and is located far away from other advanced
countries such as the United States and the Western European countries. All of these are
important factors that would lower the inward FDI according to the gravity model. The previous
studies using the gravity model, however, found that Japan’s inward FDI is abnormally low even
controlling for these standard gravity variables. If this is also the case for our data, we expect to
see the destination specific effect of Japan to be lower than many other countries. Thus, we
expect to find the coefficient 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 for Japan to be low.

        If Abenomics has been effective in increasing inward FDI to Japan drastically, that would
show up as an increase in the destination specific effect for Japan in the gravity model. To check
this, we consider two similar but different approaches.

        The first approach starts by estimating the equation (2) using the data up to 2012. Then,
we use the estimated model to predict Japan’s inward FDI stock for 2013 and after. If
Abenomics successfully increased the destination specific effect for Japan, the estimated model
that has low Japan specific destination effect would under-predict the growth of inward FDI for
2013 and after. If this under-prediction is substantial, we can infer that Abenomics was effective
in promoting inward FDI.

         The second approach also starts by estimating the equation (2) but the estimation drops
all the observations that involve Japan as the destination. We use the entire sample period to
estimate the model. Then, we use the estimated model to predict the FDI stocks from each
                                                                                                                                6
country to Japan in each year. Since we do not have an estimate for the destination specific
effect for Japan, we use zero. This means that we calculate what the Japan’s FDI stocks would
have been if Japan’s destination specific effect was the same as the reference country in the
regression (the U.S. in the estimation below). We can compare that to actual FDI stocks of
Japan. If the Abenomics policy to promote inward FDI had been successful, we would find the
growth of actual value was larger than that of predicted value after 2012. The choice of the
destination-country specific effect is arbitrary but does not influence our inference on the effects
of Abenomics policy, because we examine if the growth after 2012 exceeded the counterfactual.

        As we report below, our best fit gravity model includes the destination-country-specific
trend. Thus, we need to decide the destination-country-specific trend to use in predicting FDI
stocks for Japan in the second approach. The choice of destination-country-specific effect is
important because it matters for the growth of predicted FDI after 2012, which is our focus.
Assuming too high trend would obviously overestimate the FDI growth under the counterfactual
scenario and would underestimate the contribution of the Abenomics FDI promotion policy.
Assuming too low trend would underestimate the FDI growth and overestimate the contribution
of Abenomics. Below we use a couple of different values for the Japan specific trend in
producing the counterfactual values in the second approach and examine how the choice
influences our inference on the effectiveness of the Abenomics.


4.   Data

The data for inward FDI stock ( 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) from 1985 to 2015 are obtained from the OECD
International Direct Investment Statistics database. In the database, the inward FDI stock is
defined as the nominal value of foreign investors' equity and net loans to enterprises resident in
the economy. In 2015, the dataset covers inward FDI from about 200 origin countries to 27 OECD
destination countries.

        In the OECD database, zeros and missing values are distinguished, so we follow the
distinction of the database. For a small number of countries, inward FDI stocks are negative.
This can happen if the total amount of foreign parent companies’ borrowings from their
subsidiaries in the country exceeds the total amount of foreign companies’ investments and loans
to the subsidiaries. For the analyses of this paper, we replace them with missing values.

       There are two types of origin countries reported in the OECD database: immediate
counterpart and ultimate counterpart. Although only immediate counterpart is available in many
countries, we use ultimate counterpart as an origin country when available. If ultimate
counterpart is not available, we use immediate counterpart as origin country.

        The OECD database changed the benchmark definition from the 3rd to the 4th edition in
2013. In the 4th edition, more detailed classifications of the type of entity is available. The
database distinguishes the difference between special purpose entities (SPEs) and non-SPEs.
SPEs are used by multi-national enterprises to channel investments through several countries
before reaching their final destinations. We exclude investments by foreign SPEs from inward
FDI stock when the data allow.

                                                                                                   7
        For time invariant country-pair specific variables (𝐰𝐰𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), we use a standard set of gravity
variables such as distance, common language dummy, common religion dummy, and colonial
relationship dummy. These variables are obtained from the CEPII (Centre d’Etudes Prospectives
et d’Informations Internationales) gravity data.

        The time variant country-pair variables (𝐱𝐱 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) are the RTA (Regional Trade Agreement)
dummy, the WTO membership, and the common currency dummy. We use the Mario Larch's
Regional Trade Agreements Database (Egger and Larch, 2008) to judge if a country pair belongs
to common RTA. The RTA in this database includes customs union (e.g., European Union), free
trade agreement and economic integration agreement (e.g., North America Free Trade
Agreement and Japan-Singapore economic partnership agreement), and partial scope agreement
(e.g., South Asian Preferential Trade Arrangement). The WTO and common currency dummies
take 1 if both countries are members of the GATT/WTO and a common currency union
respectively. Both come from the CEPII gravity data.

        We also include a dummy variable that takes 1 if the two countries have bilateral
investment treaties (BIT) (Egger and Pfaffermayr, 2004; Neumayer and Spess, 2005; Busse,
Königer, and Nunnenkamp, 2010). The BIT data are obtained from the World Bank Database of
Bilateral Investment Treaties. The database reports the signature date and entry into force date.
We use the entry into force date to construct the BIT dummy. 12

        Population (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) and per-capita GDP (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) are the
destination and origin country-specific characteristics (𝐲𝐲𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝐳𝐳𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ). GDP is measured in current
thousand US dollars and the population is measured in thousand. These variables are also
obtained from the CEPII gravity data.

       Data on FDI often include outliers, which are presumably caused by the lumpiness of
FDI. For example, Table 1 indicates that the inward FDI stock to Ireland increased by 88
percent from 2014 to 2015. To prevent estimation results to be driven by outliers, we drop the
observations with the changes in inward FDI stock from the previous year falling in the top 1
percent or the bottom 1 percent of all observations in the estimations below.

                                                === Table 2 ===

       Table 2 provides summary statistics for the data used for this paper. Note that the median
of inward FDI stock is zero. This suggests how to treat these observations with zero values can
influence the estimation results.

12
   The World Bank Database of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BIT) sometimes report the signature and entry into
force dates more than once because the database lists treaties concluded on a multilateral basis or as chapters in a
free trade agreement separately. We define the first entry into force date as the beginning of the BIT. Thus, the BIT
dummy takes one after the first entry into force date and zero otherwise.

                                                                                                                    8
         Table 3 shows the estimation results of the gravity model (equation (2)) for the period
from 1985 to 2012. We consider three types of the gravity model that differ in consideration for
country-fixed effects and country specific time trends. The model in column 1 does not include
origin- and destination-country fixed effects, but the model in column 2 does include those fixed
effects. For country fixed effects, we set the United States as a reference country. The model in
column 3 includes the destination-country specific time trends in addition to the country fixed
effects.

                                         === Table 3 ===

         We first examine whether the estimate models are adequate or not. Following Santos
Silva and Tenreyro (2006), we perform a heteroskedasticity-robust RESET test. This is a test for
the correct specification of the conditional expectation, which is performed by investigating the
significance of an additional regressor constructed as the square of the fitted value. Table 3
reports the corresponding p-values. The test does not reject the hypothesis that the coefficient on
the test variable is zero for all specifications. Thus, the RESET test provides no evidence of
misspecification of the gravity equations estimated using PPML.

        To select the best model out of these three to use for our inference, we perform the HPC
test proposed by Santos Silva, Tenreyro, and Windmeijer (2015) for selection between
alternative models for non-negative observations with many zeros such as the dataset that we
examine. The HPC test is built on the tests of non-nested hypotheses developed by Davidson
and MacKinnon (1981). The HPC test in essence examines whether the prediction of the
dependent variable generated by a model can be improved by using the predictions from an
alternative model. If that is found to be the case, it is considered to be an evidence against the
original model. We test each model taking each of the other models as the alternative. The p-
value for the null hypothesis (the null model is better than the alternative model) for each
alternative is presented at the bottom of each column. The HPC tests clearly reject model (1)
against model (2), model (1) against model (3), and model (2) against model (3) at 1 percent
level. This suggests that the model (3) is the most preferred model. Including both country fixed
effects and destination-country specific time trend seem important.

        We also use HPC tests to confirm that including observations with zero values is
important. When we test the log-linear specification that drops all observations with zero values
against the model (3) as the alternative, the p-value for the test is 0.000, suggesting the model (3)
is better. When we test the reverse (taking the log-linear as the alternative), the p-value is 0.058,
suggesting that the log-linear specification is not better. These results suggest that handling zero
values explicitly is important.

        The model (3) is also attractive in that most of the estimated coefficients take the values
that are considered a priori plausible. Having RTA, common currency, common language,
common religion, and colonial relationship have significantly positive effects on inward FDI
whereas distance has significantly negative effects. The per-capita GDP of both origin and
destination countries has significantly positive effects on inward FDI. This implies that inward
FDI is more likely to be observed between high-income countries. The size of the origin and
destination countries, measured by population, also matters as the coefficient of population is


                                                                                                      9
significantly positive. Somewhat surprisingly, the coefficients of BIT and GATT-WTO
membership dummies are statistically insignificant. This may be due to the fact that destination
countries in our sample are all OECD countries, which do not have much variations.

        Compared with the model (3), some of the results in columns (1) and (2) are difficult to
explain. For example, model (1) has significantly negative coefficient on the BIT dummy. In
model (2), destination country’s population enters the model insignificantly. Because model (3)
is preferred in terms of the coefficients as well as the specification test, we use this model as our
baseline model to generate the counterfactual.

        Japan’s inward FDI relative to GDP has been very low compared with other OECD
countries. Our estimation result confirms that the standard gravity factors alone cannot explain
the low inward FDI into Japan. We can see this by comparing the estimated coefficients on
destination-country dummies (𝛽𝛽̂𝑗𝑗 in equation (2)). Table 4 provides such comparison. 13 A
negative coefficient on a destination-country dummy shows that some factor specific to the host
country tends to reduce its inward FDI compared with the reference country (the U.S. in this
case). The table shows that the coefficient estimate for Japan is significantly negative and the
magnitude is one of the largest in the sample. The estimated value -2.573 means that Japan’s
inward FDI stock would be about 7.6% (𝑒𝑒 −2.573 = 0.0763) of the US inward FDI stock holding
other factors (such as distances to host countries) equal. This is roughly the same order of the
ratio of the average FDI stocks for the two countries for the sample period (6.5%).

                                              === Table 4 ===

        Now we are ready to ask the central question of the paper. Has Abenomics been
successful in promoting inward FDI in Japan? In the first approach, we answer this by looking at
the growth of inward FDI for Japan after 2012, noting Abenomics was started in December
2012. When we use our model estimated using the sample before Abenomics to predict the FDI
into Japan after 2012, we would under-predict the growth if Abenomics policy for FDI
promotion has been effective.

        Figure 2 presents the result of our first approach. The solid line indicates the actual
inward FDI in Japan while the dotted line is the prediction from the estimated model. To remove
unwanted effects of exchange rate fluctuations on US dollar value of the FDI stock, we plot the
level of inward FDI stock divided by GDP in current prices. Figure 2 clearly shows that,
although inward FDI stock increased under the Abe administration, the actual growth was lower
than what the model predicts. The model predicts the inward FDI stock to GDP ratio would have
increased by 1.42 percentage points from 2012 to 2015, while the actual increase was 0.88
percentage points.

                                              === Figure 2 ===




13
  Latvia is not included in this estimation because Latvia has been a member of the OECD since 2013 and its FDI
stocks before 2012 are not included in the database.

                                                                                                              10
        One may be concerned that the global financial crisis in 2008 distorts the estimation of
the gravity model. Table 1 indicates that the inward FDI stock relative to GDP declined
significantly in many European countries. Because majority of OECD countries are European
countries, our results may be sensitive to whether or not the estimation period includes the
financial crisis. To address this concern, we estimate the gravity model using only the data
before the financial crisis (1985-2007) and use the estimated model for prediction.

        The results are presented as the dashed line in Figure 2. The dashed line indicates that
the levels predicted by the model for the period after 2012 using 1985-2007 data only are lower
than those predicted by the model that is estimated for 1985-2012. Nonetheless, the growth from
2012 to 2015 was not much lower (0.77 percentage points). These results suggest that the
growth of the inward FDI in Japan under Abenomics has been driven mainly by explanatory
variables other than the destination specific effects for Japan. Given the increases in GDPs and
populations for many countries and the past trend, the model predicts that growth of inward FDI
stock for Japan after 2013 would have been higher than or at least comparable to the actual
growth. Thus, there is no clear evidence that the Abenomics policies to promote inward FDI
were effective.

         The second approach estimates the gravity model without observations that involve Japan
as the destination country and use the estimated coefficients to calculate what Japan’s inward
FDI would be if Japan had the same destination country specific effect as the reference country
(the U.S. in this case). Because our preferred specification of the gravity model includes
destination country specific trend, we need to decide what trend we use in calculating
counterfactual level of Japan’s inward FDI. We have tried both (1) the trend for Japan estimated
in the first approach and (2) the trend for the reference country (U.S.) estimated in the second
approach. 14 Too large value for trend would overestimate the counterfactual FDI growth and
hence underestimate the contribution of the Abenomics policies, while too small value for trend
would underestimate the counterfactual FDI growth and overestimate the contribution of
Abenomics.

        Figure 3 shows the counterfactual predictions of Japan’s inward FDI stock calculated in
this way as well as the actual values. The dotted line shows the counterfactual prediction using
the trend estimated for Japan in the first approach, and the broken line shows the counterfactual
prediction using the trend estimated for the reference country in the second approach. The solid
line shows the actual level of inward FDI stock.

        If we use the trend for the U.S. in calculating the counterfactual prediction (broken line),
the predicted FDI increases by 1.40 percentage points, clearly larger the actual growth (0.88%).
When we use the trend for Japan estimated in the first approach (dotted line), the predicted
increase is much larger (8.38 percentage points). Thus, our second approach also fails to find an
evidence that Abenomics policy to promote inward FDI was successful.

                                              === Figure 3 ===

  We also calculated predicted values imposing zero trend. Under this extreme assumption, the predicted value for
Japan’s inward FDI stock becomes lower than the actual value every year since 2007, implying Japan’s inward FDI
would have been even lower if Japan had been like other OECD countries.

                                                                                                               11
       Note that the inward FDI in Japan was dominated by some OECD countries. Figure 4
presents the share of Japan’s inward FDI Stock in 2016 by origin country. The largest origin
country of inward FDI to Japan is the United States (25.2 percent), followed by the Netherlands
(13.6 percent), France (12.0 percent), the United Kingdom (8.1 percent), Singapore (7.9 percent),
and Switzerland (4.6 percent). These six countries together account for more than 70 percent of
inward FDI stock in Japan. How do actual and predicted growth calculated in our second
approach differ for inward FDI from each of the six origin countries?

                                       === Figure 4 ===

        Table 5 presents the actual and predicted growth of inward FDI stocks to Japan from the
six countries from 2012 to 2015. For the predicted values, we use the ones generated assuming
the U.S. trend. The numbers are represented as a percentage of Japan’s GDP. The table also
reports the difference between the actual and predicted values, which we call “gap,” for each
country each year. Table 5 shows that the gaps were almost zero in both 2012 and 2015 for the
Netherlands, Singapore, and Switzerland. Thus, Japan’s inward FDI from those countries were
not necessarily low. The gap was zero for France in 2012 but it dropped below zero in 2015.
This may have resulted from the FDI promotion in Abenomics, though we need to examine this
further to be confident. For the U.S. and the UK, the gaps were positive and did not shrink
between 2012 and 2015. Especially for the U.S., the gap was big, suggesting that there is still
unrealized potential for inward FDI from the U.S.

                                        === Table 5 ===

        We use FDI stocks in our analysis for several reasons. FDI stocks are widely used in
estimating gravity equation in the literature. The goal of Abenomics FDI promotion policy is
also stated in stock. Our interest is mainly in the steady state level of FDI rather than the
dynamics. For these reasons, we believe the stock measure is the right measure to use, but we
have also conducted robustness check using FDI flow variables instead.

       One problem of using flows instead of stocks is that the FDI variable can become
negative. For the estimation for robustness check, we dropped all the observations with negative
FDI flows.

        Table 6 replicates the gravity equation estimation in Table 2 by replacing FDI stocks with
FDI flows. The most preferred model is again the one with origin and destination fixed effects
and destination country specific time trend. The distance tends to reduce inward FDI flow, while
having colonial relationship, common religion and regional trade agreement tend to increase FDI
flow. These results are qualitatively the same as those in Table 2, but there are some differences
as well. Population of the origin country and per-capita GDP of the destination country have
positive influences on FDI flow, but we do not find the impacts of per-capital GDP of the origin
country and population of the destination country. We also fail to find that common official
language increases FDI, while we find bilateral investment treaty tends to increase FDI.

                                            === Table 6 ===


                                                                                                12
        We have also applied our two approaches to see if the Abenomics FDI promotion policies
increased inward FDI using flow data instead of stock data. Figure 5 shows the result of the first
approach (out of sample prediction) and Figure 6 shows the result of the second approach
(prediction from estimation without Japan). In Figure 5, the increases for the predicted values
(0.16 percentage points for the dotted line and 0.28 percentage points for the broken line) are
larger than the actual increase of FDI flow from 2012 to 2015 (0.11 percentage points). In
Figure 6, the increases for the predicted values (1.31 percentage points when the trend estimated
for Japan is used and 9.86 percentage points when the trend estimated for the U.S. is used) are
again larger than the actual growth of FDI flow. Thus, the analysis using FDI flows instead of
stocks suggests the same conclusion: the increase of inward FDI from 2012 to 2015 can be
explained by the factors captured in the gravity model other than an increase in Japan’s
destination country specific effect. In this sense, we fail to find the impact of Abenomics FDI
promotion policies.

                                            === Figure 5 ===
                                            === Figure 6 ===

        Another robustness check that we conducted concerns the timing of the explanatory
variables in the gravity equation. We use contemporaneous variables rather than lagged values
mainly because we are not concerned with the dynamics. Table 7 replicates the gravity equation
estimation in Table 2 by using one-year lag for the explanatory variables that change over time.
The results in Table 7 are very similar to those in Table 2. The preferred model is again the one
with origin and destination fixed effects and country specific time trends. The only qualitative
difference is that we do not find the impact of per-capita GDP of the destination country when
we use lagged explanatory variables. The result is puzzling because the estimated coefficient on
per-capital GDP is positive and statistically significant in the specifications without destination
country specific time trend. It is possible that per-capita GDP may look too much like time
trend, but if that is the case we would expect a similar problem to arise when we use
contemporaneous explanatory variables.

                                            === Table 7 ===

        We also applied our two approaches to examine the effectiveness of Abenomics FDI
promotion policies using lagged explanatory variables. Figure 7 shows the results of the first
approach and Figure 8 shows the results of the second approach. In Figure 7, the increases for
the predicted values (2.15 percentage points for the dotted line and 1.26 percentage points for the
broken line) are much larger than the actual increase (0.88 percentage points as we saw earlier).
In Figure 8, the increases for the predicted values (3.14 percentage points when the U.S. trend is
used and 7.64 percentage points when the Japan trend is used) are again much larger than the
actual growth. Thus, the use of lagged explanatory variables leads us to the same conclusion: we
do not find obvious impacts of the FDI promotion policies of the Abe administration.

                                            === Figure 7 ===
                                            === Figure 8 ===



                                                                                                 13
       Increasing inward FDI to Japan has been touted as one of the most important policy goals
of Abenomics, and the amount of inward FDI stock has been rising toward the goal of 35 trillion
yen by 2020. Yet, our analysis using the gravity model of inward FDI suggests that the increase
in Japan’s inward FDI from 2012 to 2015 was not larger than the predictions of the model.

         Why did Abenomics FDI promotion fail to deliver obvious results? One possibility is
that it takes a long time before the policy leads to visible impacts. Two or three years may not be
long enough. We cannot exclude this possibility. If the policy lag is the only reason that we did
not observe obvious impacts of Abenomics in our sample period, all we have to do is to just
wait: Japan’s inward FDI stock will start growing above the trend eventually.

        It is also possible, however, that the lack of acceleration in Japan’s inward FDI is indeed
a result of ineffective or incomplete policies. For example, as we discussed in Section 2, the
implementation of FDI promotion has been skewed to the measures to make it easier for
foreigners to live or stay in Japan. The deregulation measures to make it easier to foreign (and
domestic) businesses to do business in Japan has been slow. This may have limited the
effectiveness of the Abenomics policy so far.

        Improving Japan's rank in the World Bank Doing Business Ranking to one of the top
three among OECD has been another goal of Abenomics growth strategy, but there has been no
progress as Haider and Hoshi (2015) point out. The lack of progress in improving the condition
for doing business may be related to no visible impacts of Abenomics on Japan’s inward FDI
stock. This can be checked by examining if the World Bank's doing business indices (measured
as distance to frontier) matters for inward FDI after controlling for the gravity and other
variables. The distance to frontier measure of the World Bank doing business index is higher if
the country has better business condition (e.g., 90% to the frontier is better than 60% to the
frontier). Thus, we would expect the doing business index enter the regression with a positive
coefficient.

                                         === Table 8 ===

        Table 8 reports the estimation results of the equation (2) augmented by the doing business
indices. Since the doing business indices are available only after 2005 for many categories (e.g.,
paying taxes) and only after 2009 for overall index, the sample size here is smaller. The results
indicate none of the coefficients on doing business indices are significantly positive, either when
the indices are put in the gravity model one by one or all at the same time. Thus, we cannot
argue that Japan’s low ranking in the World Bank doing business condition is an important factor
to discourage inward FDI.


6.   Conclusion

Promotion of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) into Japan has been an important policy in
the Abenomics growth strategy. This paper examined if we can observe positive effects of the
inward FDI promotion policy in the data for inward FDI stocks in Japan. We have tried two
approaches applying a gravity model of bilateral FDIs to data from 35 OECD countries by


                                                                                                  14
origins of inward FDIs. In the first approach, we estimated the model assuming origin-country
and destination-country fixed effects as well as destination-country specific time trends for 1985-
2012. The destination-country fixed effect for Japan was estimated to be the third lowest of the
35 countries in our sample, reflecting unusually low level of Japan’s inward FDI, which is well
known in the literature. We then compared the predicted levels of Japan’s inward FDI stocks for
2013-2015 to the actual levels. Although the actual inward FDI stock has been growing and is
likely to achieve the goal of 35 trillion yen by 2020, we find that the growth was lower than the
estimated model suggests.

        The second approach started by estimating the gravity model excluding all the
observations that involve Japan as the destination country. Then we constructed prediction from
the estimated model for Japan’s inward FDI. The actual inward FDI into Japan was found to be
less than the counterfactual. The gap between the actual and the counterfactual were actually
widened under the Abe administration.

        Thus, our results suggest that Abenomics policies to encourage inward FDI did not have
visible impacts. One shortcoming of our paper is that we do not test the impacts of Abenomics
policies. Instead we try to look for indirect evidence of the impacts of Abenomics policies by
examining any changes in Japan’s inward FDI after 2012. Thus, we would fail to find the
positive impacts of Abenomics policies if those were offset by any other changes that reduced
Japan’s inward FDI. But, we have difficulty coming up with some changes after 2012 that
should have decreased Japan’s FDI. Instead many changes that we can identify easily would
have increased FDI flows into Japan. For example, the yen depreciated against other major
currencies during our sample period. This must have contributed to raising Japan’s inward FDI.
Similarly, well known increase of foreign visitors should have led to increasing FDI if anything.

        Another shortcoming of our paper is the fact that our dataset ends in 2015. Since
Abenomics promotion of inward FDI seemed to have stepped up after 2016 especially in
regulatory and administrative reforms, it is possible that those efforts may show up in future
data. In fact, there is an optimistic interpretation of the results. Japan’s inward FDI stock rose
recently despite the unusually low destination-country effect for Japan is. This means that
Japan’s potential for inward FDI is much higher than what Abenomics targeted. If Japan can
remove the impediments that make the inward FDI unusually low, Japan will be able to achieve
the potential.
