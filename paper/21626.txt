                                              ABSTRACT

We develop a new model of the mortgage market where both borrowers and lenders can default. Risk
tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. The government
plays a crucial role by providing both mortgage guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government
mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier mortgage originations as well as to high financial sector
leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into financial crises and government bailouts due to the
fragility of the intermediaries' balance sheets. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee "crowds
in" the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house
prices, and raises mortgage and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector, consumption
smoothing improves and aggregate welfare increases. While borrowers are nearly indifferent to a world
with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate welfare increases,
so does wealth inequality.

1       Introduction

Government and quasi-government entities dominate mortgage finance in the U.S. Over the past
five years, the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the Federal
Housing Administration have stood behind 80% of the newly originated mortgages.1 Ever since
the collapse of the GSEs in September of 2008 and the conservatorship which socialized housing
finance, there have been many proposals to bring back private capital.2 The main idea of these
policy proposals is to dramatically reduce the size and scope of the government guarantee on
standard (conforming) mortgages. Because the proposed reform would turn a largely public
into a largely private housing finance market, there is both uncertainty and concern about
its impact on house prices, the availability of mortgage finance, financial sector stability, and
ultimately welfare.3

    Understanding the economic impact of wholesale mortgage finance reform requires a general
equilibrium model. Such a model must recognize the important role that residential real estate
and mortgage markets have come to play in the financial system and the macro-economy of
rich countries (Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2014)). It must also recognize the large footprint
of the government. This paper proposes a new general equilibrium model of the housing and
mortgage markets where the interaction of the financial sector and the government plays a
central role.

    In our benchmark model, the government provides mortgage default insurance at low cost.
The financial sector issues mortgages to borrowers and decides for how many of those mort-
gages to buy the government guarantee. The model ascribes the dominance of the guaranteed
    1
      Currently, of the $9.85 trillion stock of residential mortgages, 57% are Agency Mortgage-backed Securities
guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Private-label mortgage backed securities make up
less than 8% of the stock. The rest is unsecuritized first liens held by the GSEs and the banking sector (28%) and
second liens (7%). Acharya, Richardson, Van Nieuwerburgh, and White (2011) provide an in-depth discussion
of the history of the GSEs, their growth, and collapse.
    2
      The Obama Administration released a first report along these lines in February 2011. The bills proposed
-but not passed- by Corker-Warner in 2013 and Johnson-Crapo in 2014 provide the most recent attempts at
legislative reform.
    3
      The financial and real estate industries, the Mortgage Bankers Association, and consumer advocate groups
have all vehemently argued to keep a form of government guarantee in place. They favor a solution with a
public mortgage guarantor that would succeed Fannie and Freddie, and fear that there may “not be enough
private capital” in the mortgage market in a fully private system. They argue a private market solution would
jeopardize the stable provision of mortgage credit for a broad cross-section of households. In contrast, the
Congressional Budget Office recently argued that a privatization of housing finance would have minimal impact
(CBO 2014).

mortgage market to the low insurance premium (guarantee fee or g-fee) that the government
charges banks for that insurance, as well as to the small amount of regulatory capital that banks
must hold against guaranteed mortgage bonds. As in the real world, mortgages are long-term,
prepayable, and defaultable. A novel model ingredient is that the financial sector enjoys a
government bailout guarantee, which is equivalent to deposit insurance in our setting. Deposit
insurance is an important feature of any financial system that the literature on mortgage finance
has not considered hitherto.4

   An interesting feature of the model is the interaction between mortgage guarantees, which
reduce the risk of banks’ assets, and deposit insurance, which reduces the risk of their liabilities.
As relatively risk tolerant agents, bankers in the model desire a high return-high risk balance
sheet. But taking advantage of the underpriced mortgage guarantee lowers the risk of banks’
assets. This prompts banks to increase leverage. The favorable regulatory capital treatment
of guaranteed mortgage bonds enables such high leverage. Deposit insurance further propels
leverage, since it makes banks’ lenders, the depositors, less sensitive to the risk of a banking
collapse. A second way in which banks increase risk is through their mortgage origination
decisions. They grow the size of the mortgage portfolio and increase its riskiness, by raising
mortgage debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. Because of the dual guarantees, equilibrium
mortgage rates are low, making borrowers willing to take on higher mortgage debt. In sum,
the government’s underpriced mortgage guarantee distorts financial sector leverage and leads
to a larger financial sector and lower underwriting standards as banks pursue their desired risk-
reward ratio. Deposit insurance amplifies these effects because it immunizes depositors from
banks’ elevated risk-taking and removes their incentives to discipline the bankers.

   Ex-post, a riskier mortgage portfolio produces higher mortgage default rates and losses.
These losses produce deadweight costs of foreclosures, a first source of welfare losses. Given
banks’ low net worth and high leverage, housing crises occasionally turn into financial crises, de-
fined as bank insolvencies. Thus, the economy with underpriced mortgage guarantees generates
financial sector fragility. It also displays high house price volatility. The government absorbs
most of the default-induced losses as part of the mortgage default insurance contract and bails
   4
    Deposit insurance can be thought of more broadly as encompassing implicit government guarantees for
short-term financial sector liabilities such as money market funds, asset-backed commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, etc. Indeed, the government stepped in to bail out these markets in the Fall of 2008 and in the
Spring of 2009.


                                                     2
out the banks if they are insolvent. The government issues debt to absorb the costs of the
guarantee payouts. Government debt is both high and volatile as a result. The government’s
dual intervention brings two important advantages. First, the government’s ability to issue
debt in bad times allows society to spread out the fiscal costs of mortgage defaults over time.
Second, the mortgage guarantees (partially) protect banks’ balance sheets from mortgage losses
and enable banks to continue their intermediation function. However, depositors must hold the
additional government debt in equilibrium. Since they are risk averse, they dislike volatility in
government debt since it gives rise to volatility in their consumption. The net effect of these
opposing forces is that equilibrium consumption smoothing is poor in the economy with GSEs.
This is the second and main source of welfare loss.

  Capturing the spirit of the proposed mortgage finance reforms, our main policy experiment
is to start from the low g-fees observed until recently and increase the cost of government
mortgage insurance. Naturally, we find that higher guarantee fees “crowd in” the private
sector in that they induce a shift of banks’ assets from guaranteed to private mortgage bonds.
This portfolio shift increases the riskiness of bank assets, making it unnecessary for banks to
max out their allowed leverage capacity or to increase the size and riskiness of their mortgage
portfolio. Intermediary net worth is higher on average so that banks have more “skin in the
game.” Ex-post, mortgage default and loss rates are lower in the private sector economy. Fewer
mortgage crises turn into financial crises because of the sturdier bank balance sheets. Because
of sufficient intermediary capital, banks are able to continue lending even during housing crises.
If anything, the provision of mortgage credit becomes more stable in the model with than the
one without government guarantees. This result dispels the notion that the GSEs are needed
to guarantee stable access to mortgage finance. The key insight is that abolition of mortgage
guarantees leads banks to take less risk, moving them farther from their leverage constraints.
That improves the economy’s ability to allocate resources to the highest marginal utility user,
improving consumption smoothing and welfare.

  At g-fees that are high enough to crowd out the mortgage guarantee completely, we find
that house prices are lower by 6.3%, the mortgage market is smaller by 8.7%, and intermediary
leverage is lower by 7.3 percentage points. Mortgages are safer: debt-to-income ratios are 6.2%
lower. The upshot in the “private market solution” is that the financial system is less fragile:


                                                3
the incidence of mortgage defaults and realized mortgage losses are only half as large and
bank defaults (financial sector bailouts) are almost completely eliminated. The overall effect
of phasing out the GSEs is an increase of social welfare of 0.63% in consumption equivalence
units. Borrowers welfare is unchanged while both types of saver households gain substantially.
Borrowers benefit from the improved risk sharing in the economy without guarantees, but
they lose their mortgage subsidy, face higher mortgage rates, and tighter lending standards.
Depositors benefit from higher interest rates and gain 1.3%. Risk-takers (bankers) also gain
substantially (1.7%). Thus, while abolishing the GSEs is essentially a Pareto improvement, it
increases wealth inequality.

  At intermediate levels for the g-fee, we observe that the government guarantee is only taken
up in bad times. This dovetails with the “mortgage insurer of last resort” option in the Obama
Administration proposal which envisions calling on the government only in crises.

  We study the effect of raising the regulatory capital requirement on guaranteed bonds to the
same level as that on non-guaranteed bonds. This exercise help us understand how much of
the financial sector fragility can be undone with higher capital requirements (macroprudential
policy) alone. We find that higher capital requirements eliminate the excessive risk taking by
banks. However, the continued presence of underpriced mortgage guarantees continues to lead
to large and volatile government debt, and poor risk sharing. The welfare benefits are small
suggesting that macro-prudential policy cannot replace GSE reform.

  The last part of the paper uses the model to quantitatively evaluate the idea of replacing
a full government guarantee by a catastrophic government guarantee (Scharfstein and Sun-
deram (2011)). The 2014 Johnson-Crapo bill proposes to put 10% private capital in front of a
catastrophic government guarantee. The first 10% of losses in the event of a mortgage default
would be born by the private sector; the government would step in only when losses exceed
that threshold. In our model, this policy amounts to redefining the payoff of the guaranteed
mortgage bond. We find that the catastrophic government insurance generates a slightly larger
welfare gain than a full phase-out of the guarantee. Since the underpricing of the guarantee is
corrected, borrower leverage is lower and the mortgage market is comparable to the economy
without guarantees. However, intermediaries still enjoy the insurance against severe mortgage
crisis. This improves risk sharing compared to the no-guarantee economy. It demonstrates that


                                              4
a correctly designed government-provided insurance policy can improve welfare.


Related Literature Our paper contributes to several strands of the literature on housing,
finance, and macro-economics. Unlike recent quantitative work that explores the causes and
consequences of the housing boom,5 this paper focuses on the current and future state of
the housing finance system and the role the government plays in this system. It shares with
these models a focus on quantitative implications and on general equilibrium considerations. In
particular, house prices and interest rates are determined in equilibrium rather than exogenously
specified. We simplify by working in an endowment economy with a constant housing stock.6

   Like another strand of the literature, our model features borrowers defaulting optimally on
their mortgages.7 Unlike most of that literature, our lenders are not risk-neutral but risk averse.
A default risk premium is priced into the mortgage contract. It is time-varying and depends on
the covariance of the risk taker’s intertemporal marginal rate of substitution with the payoff on
the mortgage loan. We assume that lenders impose maximum LTV ratios on borrowers, chosen
to match observed mortgage debt/income ratios and default rates in normal and mortgage crisis
times. Unlike most of the literature, our mortgage contract is a long-term contract. This is
important because of the centrality of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the debate on U.S.
housing finance reform. We calibrate our mortgage contract to exhibit the same amount of
interest rate risk as the outstanding pool of agency mortgage-backed securities. Our setting
is ideally suited to study the interaction of default and prepayment risk. Government policy
affects both of these risks.

   The main difference between our housing finance model and the literature is our focus on the
interplay between the financial sector and the government. A recent literature in asset pricing
has emphasized the central role of financial intermediaries in the crisis.8 Usually, intermediaries

have access to a different technology from other agents. In our model, as in Drechsler, Savov,
and Schnabl (2014), intermediaries arise from differences in risk aversion instead. The least
risk averse savers choose to issue short-term debt (“deposits”) to the more risk averse savers.
Like in the part of the literature that emphasizes debt constraints, our intermediaries face
borrowing (margin) constraints which link the amount of short-term liabilities to the collateral
value of their assets. In this class of models, the net worth of the financial sector is the key
state variable which governs risk sharing and asset prices. In our model, intermediary wealth is
also an important state variable, but it is not the only one. The wealth of the depositors, the
wealth of the borrowers, and the outstanding amount of government debt all have important
effects on equilibrium allocations and prices.

   Unlike most of the intermediary asset pricing literature, we explicitly model the intermedi-
ary’s decision to default. When intermediary net worth threatens to go negative, intermediaries
can choose to offload all assets and liabilities onto the government. The government bailout
option is equivalent to deposit insurance in the model. As emphasized above, the interaction
of the mortgage guarantee and this bailout guarantee is one of the most interesting and novel
aspects of our analysis. By studying the role of the financial sector in the provision of mortgages
we capture the stylized fact, pointed out by Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2014), that “over a
5-year window run ups in mortgage lending and run ups in house prices raise the likelihood of a
subsequent financial crises. Mortgage and house price booms are predictive of future financial
crises, and this effect has also become much more dramatic since WW2.” We ask how govern-
ment intervention in the form of asset (mortgage) guarantees or liability (deposit) guarantees
affects this nexus.

   Our result that the economy without the government guarantee for mortgages features a
better capitalized financial sector, a more stable financial system, and higher welfare echoes
the arguments made in the literature on capital regulation of financial institutions.9 Our work
contributes a quantitative general equilibrium model to that discussion, with an emphasis on
the role of mortgages and mortgage guarantees. The framework should be useful to investigate
the quantitative implications of deposit insurance and higher capital requirements as well. See
(2013) provides a review of this literature.

Begenau (2015) for a similar approach in this literature.

   Finally, our paper contributes to the literature that quantifies the effect of government
policies in the housing market. Most work focuses on studying the effect of abolishing the
mortgage interest rate tax deductibility and the tax exemption of imputed rental income of
owner-occupied housing.10 When house and rental prices are determined endogenously, such
policy changes tend to lower house prices and price-rent ratios and cause an increase in home
ownership rates. They usually redistribute consumption from the rich to the poor and increase
welfare. Studying the GSE subsidies, Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013) reach a similar
conclusion regarding welfare. Our work differs from Jeske et al. (2013) in its emphasis on the
role of the financial sector and the interaction between the mortgage guarantee and the bailout
guarantee. We emphasize heterogeneity between borrowers, banks, and savers. In our model,
inequality increases after the abolition of the GSE subsidy. They emphasize heterogeneity
among borrowers and obtain a reduction in inequality from the abolition.11 In terms of model
setup, there are several more differences. Jeske et al. model mortgage guarantees as a tax-
financed mortgage interest rate subsidy. In our model, the government sells mortgage insurance
to the private sector. Second, our mortgages are long-term in nature while theirs are one-period
contracts. Third, our lenders are risk-averse, while theirs are risk-neutral. Fourth, our model
features aggregate but no idiosyncratic income risk, while their model has no aggregate risk and
emphasizes idiosyncratic risk. Fifth, their model has a simple construction sector and constant
house prices, while our model has a fixed housing supply and endogenous house prices. Sixth,
their model has home ownership choice while ours does not. Seventh, our government can issue
debt while theirs has to balance the budget every period. The two papers complement each
other nicely.

  11
     In a recent model similar to Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013), Gete and Zecchetto (2015) argue that
the poor, high-credit risk households suffer a disproportionate increase in the cost of mortgage credit from an
abolition of GSEs, offsetting the reduction in inequality emphasized by Jeske et al.

2     The Model

2.1     Endowments, Preferences, Technology, Timing

Endowments The model is a two-good endowment economy with a non-housing and a hous-
ing Lucas tree. The fruit of the non-housing tree, output Yt , grows and its growth rate is subject
to aggregate shocks. The different households are endowed with a fixed and non-tradeable share
of this tree. This endowment can be interpreted as labor income. The size of the housing tree
(housing stock) grows at the same stochastic trend as output. The total quantity of hous-
ing shares is fixed and normalized to K̄. The housing stock yields fruit (housing services)
proportional to the stock.


Preferences The model features a government and three groups of households. Impatient
households will play the role of borrowers in equilibrium (denoted by superscript B), while
patient households will turn out to be savers. There are two type of savers, differentiated by
their risk aversion coefficient; we refer to the less risk averse savers as “risk takers” (denoted
by superscript R) and the more risk averse as “depositors” (denoted by D). Thus, for the rate
of impatience we assume that βR = βD > βB , and for the coefficient of relative risk aversion we
assume that σR < σB ≤ σD . All agents have Epstein-Zin preferences over the joint consump-
tion bundle which is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of housing and non-housing consumption with
aggregation parameter θ.

Technology In addition to housing, there are three assets in the economy. The first is a
one-period short-term bond. The second is a mortgage bond, which aggregates the mortgage
loans made to all borrower households. The third is mortgage insurance which the government
sells to the private market. The guarantee turns a defaultable long-term mortgage bond into
a default-free government-guaranteed mortgage bond. The government exogenously sets the
price of the guarantee.

  Borrowers experience housing depreciation shocks and may choose to default on their mort-
gage. There is no recourse; savers and possibly the government (ultimately the tax payers) bear
the loss depending on whether mortgage loans are held in the form of private or government-
guaranteed mortgage bonds, respectively. A novel model ingredient is that risk takers may also
choose to default and declare bankruptcy. Default wipes clean their negative wealth position
with no further consequences; the losses are absorbed by the government in a “financial sector
bailout.”


Timing The timing of agents’ decisions at the beginning of period t is as follows:

                                                        9
   1. Income shocks for all types of agents and housing depreciation shocks for borrower house-
       holds are realized.

   2. Risk takers (financial intermediaries) decide on a bankruptcy policy. In case of a bankruptcy,
       their financial wealth is set to zero and they incur a utility penalty. At the time of the
       decision, the magnitude of the penalty is unknown.12 Risk takers know its probability
       distribution and maximize expected utility by specifying a binding decision rule for each
       possible realization of the penalty.13

   3. Borrowers decide on mortgage default.

   4. Risk takers’ utility penalty shock is realized and they follow their bankruptcy decision rule
       from step 2. In case of bankruptcy, the government picks up the shortfall in repayments
       to debt holders (depositors).

   5. Borrowers choose how much of the remaining mortgage balance to prepay (refinance). All
       agents solve their consumption and portfolio choice problems. Markets clear. All agents
       consume.

   Each agent’s problem depends on the wealth of others; the entire wealth distribution is
a state variable. Each agent must forecast how that state variable evolves and predict the
bankruptcy decisions of borrowers and risk takers. We now describe each of the three types of
household problems and the government problem in detail.


2.2     Borrower’s Problem

Mortgages As in reality, mortgage contracts are long-term, defaultable, and prepayable. The
mortgage is a long-term contract, modeled as a perpetuity. Bond coupon (mortgage) payments
decline geometrically, {1, δ, δ 2 , . . .}, where δ captures the duration of the mortgage. A mortgage
can default, in which case the lenders have recourse to the housing collateral. We introduce a
  12
     Introducing a random utility penalty is a technical assumption we make for tractability. It makes the value
function differentiable and allows us to use our numerical methods which rely on this differentiability. This
randomization assumption is common in labor market models (Hansen (1985)). Additionally, uncertainty about
the consequences of a systematic banking crisis and insolvency may seem quite reasonable.
  13
     The assumption of making a binding default decision is necessitated in the presence of Epstein-Zin prefer-
ences.


                                                      10
                    α
“face value” F =   1−δ
                       ,   a fixed fraction α of the mortgage payments (per unit of mortgage bond),
at which the mortgage can be prepaid. Prepayment incurs a cost detailed below. Mortgage
payments can be deducted from income for tax purposes at a rate τtm = (1 − α)τt , where τt
is the income tax rate and the fraction (1 − α) reflects the interest component of mortgage
payments .


Borrower Default There is a representative family of borrowers, consisting of a measure
one of members. Each member receives the same stochastic labor income YtB ∝ Yt , chooses
                              B
                                       R1 B         B
the same quantity of housing kt−1 s.t. 0 kt−1 di = Kt−1 , and the same quantity of outstanding
                         1 B
mortgage bonds aB                   B
                       R
                 t s.t. 0 at di = At .

  After having received income and having chosen house and mortgage size, each family mem-
ber draws an idiosyncratic housing depreciation shock ωi,t ∼ Fω (·) which proportionally lowers
                                         B
the value of the house by (1 − ωi,t )pt kt−1 . The value of the house after stochastic depreciation
            B
is ωi,t pt kt−1 . We denote the cross-sectional mean and standard deviation by µω = Ei [ωi,t ] and
σt,ω = (Vari [ωi,t ])0.5 , where the latter varies over time. The variable σt,ω governs the mortgage
credit risk in the economy; it is the second exogenous aggregate state variable (in addition to
aggregate income growth).

  Each borrower household member then optimally decides whether or not to default on the
mortgages. The houses that the borrower family defaults on are turned over to (foreclosed by)
the lender. Let the function ι(ω) : [0, ∞) → {0, 1} indicate the borrower’s decision to default
on a house of quality ω. We conjecture and later verify that the optimal default decision is
characterized by a threshold level ωt∗ , such that borrowers default on all houses with ωi,t ≤ ωt∗
and repay the debt for all other houses. Using the threshold level ωt∗ , we define ZA (ωt∗ ) to be
                                                        B
the fraction of debt repaid to lenders and ZK (ωt∗ )pt Kt−1 to be the value to the borrowers of the
residual (non-defaulted) housing stock after default decisions have been made. We have:
                               Z   ∞
              ZA (ωt∗ )    =           (1 − ι(ω)) fω (ω)dω = Pr[ωi,t ≥ ωt∗ ],                         (3)
                               0
                               Z   ∞
              ZK (ωt∗ )    =           (1 − ι(ω))ω fω (ω)dω = Pr[ωi,t ≥ ωt∗ ] E[ωi,t | ωi,t ≥ ωt∗ ]   (4)
                               0


After making a coupon payment of 1 per unit of remaining outstanding mortgage, the amount


                                                           11
of outstanding mortgages declines to δZA (ωt∗ ) AB
                                                 t .



Prepayment Next, the households can choose to prepay a quantity of the outstanding mort-
gages RtB by paying the face value F per unit to the lender. We denote by ZtR ≡ RtB /AB
                                                                                      t the

ratio of prepaid mortgages to beginning-of-period mortgages. Prepayment incurs a monetary
cost Ψ. We use an adjustment cost function Ψ(RtB , AB
                                                    t ) that is convex in the fraction prepaid

ZtR , capturing bottlenecks in the mortgage refinance infrastructure when too large a share of
mortgages are prepaid at once.


Borrower Problem Statement The borrower family’s problem is to choose consumption
CtB , housing KtB , default threshold ωt∗ , prepayment quantity RtB , and new mortgage debt BtB
to maximize life-time utility UtB in (1), subject to the budget constraint:

                                                                 T,B

                                                                     +ZK (ωt∗ )pt Kt−1 +qtm BtB ,
                                                                                             (5)

                                  t+1 = δZA (ωt ) At + Bt − Rt ,                             (6)

                                        F AB          B
                                           t+1 ≤ φpt Kt .                                    (7)


and a double constraint on the amount of mortgages that can be refinanced:


                                     0 ≤ RtB ≤ δZA (ωt∗ ) AB
                                                           t .                               (8)


  Outstanding mortgage debt at the end of the period (equation 6) is the sum of the remaining
mortgage debt after default and new borrowing BtB minus prepayments. The borrower house-
hold uses after-tax labor income, net transfer income from the government (GT,B
                                                                            t   ), residual
housing wealth, and new mortgage debt raised to pay for consumption, mortgage debt service
net of mortgage interest deductibility, new home purchases, prepayments F RtB and associated

                          t ) . New mortgage debt raised is qt Bt , where qt is the price of

one unit of mortgage bonds in terms of the numeraire good.

   The borrowing constraint in (7) caps the face value of mortgage debt at the end of the
period, F AB                                                                      B
           t+1 , to a fraction of the market value of the underlying housing, pt Kt , where φ is

the maximum loan-to-value ratio. With such a constraint, declines in house prices (in bad times)
tighten borrowing constraints. It is the first of two occasionally binding borrowing constraints
in the model.

   The refinancing constraints in equation (8) ensure that the amount prepaid is between 0 and
the outstanding balance after the default decision was made. Equivalently, the share prepaid,
ZtR , must be between 0 and δZA (ωt∗).


2.3     Risk Takers

Next we study the problem of the risk taker households, who lend to borrower households and
borrow from depositor households. Hence, we refer to this household type as intermediaries.14


Risk-taker Default After shocks to income and housing depreciation have been realized,
the risk taker (financial intermediary) chooses whether or not to declare bankruptcy. Risk
takers who declare bankruptcy have all their assets and liabilities liquidated.15 They also incur
a stochastic utility penalty ρt , with ρt ∼ Fρ , i.i.d. over time and independent of all other
shocks. At the time of the bankruptcy decision, risk takers do not yet know the realization of
the bankruptcy penalty. Rather, they have to commit to a bankruptcy decision rule D(ρ) :
R → {0, 1}, that specifies the optimal decision for every possible realization of ρt . Risk takers
choose D(ρ) to maximize expected utility at the beginning of the period. We conjecture and
later verify that the optimal default decision is characterized by a threshold level ρ∗t , such that
risk takers default for all realizations for which the utility cost exceeds the threshold. As we
explain below, risk taker default leads to a government bailout.
  14
     Note that we could separately model risk taker households as the shareholders of the banks and the banks
they own. For simplicity we combine the two balance sheets.
  15
     The mortgages are bonds that trade in a competitive market. They are sold during the liquidation and
bought by the banks that start off the following period with zero financial wealth and the exogenous income
stream.



                                                     13
   After the realization of the penalty, risk takers execute their bankruptcy choice according
to the decision rule. They then face a consumption and portfolio choice problem, where they
allocate their wealth between a short-term risk-free bond, a private mortgage bond, and a
government-guaranteed mortgage bond.


Private Mortgage Bond A private mortgage bond is a simple pass-through vehicle, ag-
gregating the mortgages of the borrowers. The coupon payment on performing mortgages in
the current period is AB
                       t ZA (ωt ), which is the number of mortgage bonds times the fraction
                              ∗


that is performing times the coupon payment of 1 per unit of performing bond. For mort-
gages that go in foreclosure, the risk taker repossesses the homes. These homes are worth
                             B
(1 − ζ) (µω − ZK (ωt∗ )) pt Kt−1 , where ζ is the fraction of home value destroyed in a foreclosure.
It represents a deadweight loss to the economy. Thus, the total payoff per unit of private
mortgage bond is:
                                                                            B
                                                  (1 − ζ)(µω − ZK (ωt∗))pt Kt−1
                            Mt,P = ZA (ωt∗ ) +                                  .
                                                              ABt

The price of the bond is qtm per unit.


Government-guaranteed Mortgage Bond A government-guaranteed bond is a security
with the same duration (maturity and cash-flow structure) as a private mortgage bond. The
only difference is that it carries no mortgage default risk because of the government guarantee.
To prevent having to keep track of an additional state variable, we model guarantees as one-
period default insurance.16 Combining one unit of a private mortgage bond with one unit of
default insurance creates a mortgage bond that is government-guaranteed for one period. One
unit of a government-guaranteed mortgage bond has the following payoff:


                                        Mt,G = 1 + (1 − ZA (ωt∗ ))δF


The first term is the coupon of 1 on all loans in the pool, performing and non-performing. The
second term is compensation for the loss in principal of defaulted loans. Owners of guaranteed
loans receive a principal repayment F . The price of the bond is qtm +γt per unit. The government
  16
    Rolling over default insurance every period for the life of the loan is the equivalent to the real-world long-
term guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Having the choice of renewal each period makes
our guarantees more flexible, and hence more valuable, than those in the real world.

                                                       14
sets the price of insurance γt per unit of bond to the government. The choice between guaranteed
and private mortgage bonds is the main choice of interest in the paper.


Risk-taker wealth Denote risk-taker financial wealth at the start of period t by WtR . This
financial intermediary net worth is a key state variable.


                   WtR = (Mt,P + δZA (ωt∗ )qtm − ZtR [qtm − F ])AR
                                                                 t,P

                           + (Mt,G + δZA (ωt∗)qtm − ZtR [qtm − F ])AR      R
                                                                    t,G + Bt−1 .



It consists of the market value of the portfolio of private and guaranteed bonds bought last
period, as well as the short-term bonds from last period which mature this period. When the
holdings of short-term bonds are negative, the last term is short-term debt which must be
repaid this period. Since the mortgage guarantee is valid for only one period, both private and
government-guaranteed bonds bought last period trade for the same price qtm . Voluntary (i.e.,
rate-induced rather than default-induced) mortgage prepayments “come in at par” F . Since
such prepayments only happen when qtm > F , they represent a loss to the intermediary. If the
portfolio consists entirely of guaranteed bonds, prepayments constitute an important source of
risk driving fluctuations in risk taker net worth.


Consumption-Portfolio Choice Problem While intertemporal preferences are still speci-
fied by equation (1), intraperiod utility ujt depends on the bankruptcy decision and penalty:

                                              1−θ          θ

                                    t   =                      .
                                            exp (D(ρt )ρt )

Entering with wealth WtR , the risk taker’s problem is to choose consumption CtR , holdings of
private mortgage bonds AR                                                         R
                        t+1,P , holdings of government-guaranteed mortgage bonds At+1,G , and

short-term bonds BtR to maximize life-time utility UtR in (1), subject to the budget constraint:

                                          f R                                      T,R

                                                 15
and the following constraints:


                                AR

                                 t+1,G ≥ 0,                                                             (11)

   The budget constraint (9) shows that the risk-taker uses after-tax labor income, net trans-
fer income, and beginning-of-period wealth to pay for consumption, purchases of private and
government-guaranteed mortgage bonds and short-term bonds, and for housing repairs which
undo the effects of depreciation. We do not allow for negative positions in either long-term
mortgage bond (equations 10 and 11). A key constraint in the model is (12). A negative posi-
tion in the short-term bond is akin to the risk taker issuing short-term bonds, or equivalently
deposits. The negative position in the short-term bond must be collateralized by the market
value of the risk taker’s holdings of long-term mortgage bonds. The parameters ξP and ξG
together with κ determine how useful private and government-guaranteed mortgage bonds are
as collateral. In the calibration, we will assume that guaranteed mortgages are better collat-
eral: ξG > ξP . The constraint captures the reality of Basel II/III-type risk weights that restrict
intermediary leverage.17


2.4     Depositors

The second type of savers, depositors, receive labor income, YtD ∝ Yt , own a fixed share of the
housing stock KtD , and solve a standard consumption-savings problem. Entering with wealth
WtD = Bt−1
       D
           , the depositor’s problem is to choose consumption CtD and holdings of short-term
bonds BtD to maximize life-time utility UtD in (1), subject to the budget constraint:

    The short-term borrowing is akin to a repo contract. It allows the intermediary to buy a mortgage bond
by borrowing a fraction ξ of the purchase price while only using a fraction 1 − ξ of the purchase price, the
margin requirement, of her own capital. One can think of the guaranteed bond as a private mortgage bond
plus a government guarantee (a credit default swap or mortgage insurance). Implicit in constraint (12) is the
assumption that the government guarantee itself is an off-balance sheet item that cannot be collateralized.

and short-sales constraints on bond holdings:


                                              BtD ≥ 0, .                                              (14)


The budget constraint (13) is similar to that of the risk taker. We also do not allow depositor’s
to take a negative position in the short-term bond (14), consistent with our assumption that
the depositor must not declare bankruptcy.


2.5     Government

We model the government as set of exogenously specified tax, spending, bailout, and debt
issuance policies.18 Government tax revenues, Tt , are labor income tax receipts minus mortgage
interest deduction tax expenditures plus mortgage guarantee fee income:


                             Tt = τt Yt − τtm ZA (ωt∗)AB        R      D
                                                       t + γt (At,G + At,G )



Government expenditures, Gt are the sum of payoffs on mortgage guarantees, financial sector
bailouts, other exogenous government spending, Got , and government transfer spending GTt :


                          Gt = (Mt,G − Mt,P )AR             R   o    T
                                              t,G − D(ρt )Wt + Gt + Gt



The mortgage guarantee pays to the risk takers the difference in cash-flow between a guaranteed
and a private mortgage bond, for each unit of guaranteed bond they purchase. The bailout
to the financial sector equals the negative of the financial wealth of the risk taker, WtR , in the
event of a bankruptcy (D(ρt ) = 1). By bailing out the intermediaries, the government renders
intermediaries’ liabilities, deposits, risk-free. In the model, risk taker bankruptcies, limited
liability for risk takers, and deposit insurance are equivalent.

   The government issues one-period risk-free debt. Debt repayments and government expen-

    We consolidate the role of the GSEs and that of the Treasury department into one government, reflecting
the reality as of September 2008.

ditures are financed by new debt issuance and tax revenues, resulting in the budget constraint:

                                             G
                                            Bt−1 + Gt ≤ qtf BtG + Tt                                   (15)


We impose a transversality condition on government debt:

                                                  h           i
                                            lim Et M̃D      G

                                                          B
                                           u→∞



where M̃D is the SDF of the depositor.19 Because of its unique ability to tax and repay its debt,
the government can spread out the cost of mortgage default waves and financial sector rescue
operations over time. We are interested in understanding whether the government’s ability to
tax and issue debt leads to an increased stability of mortgage credit provision in the world with
government guarantees.

   Government policy parameters are Θt = (τt , γt , Got , φ, ξG , ξP , µρ). The parameters φ in equa-
tion (7) and (ξG , ξP ) in equation (12) can be thought of as macro-prudential policy tools which
govern household and intermediary leverage. We added the parameter µρ that governs the mean
utility cost of bankruptcy to risk takers to the set of policy levers, since the government may
have some ability to control the fortunes of the financial sector in the event of a bankruptcy.
This cost directly affects the strength of deposit insurance but could also include reputational
costs of bank defaults.


2.6        Equilibrium

Given a sequence of aggregate income and house valuation shocks {Yt , σω,t } and utility costs
of default shocks {ρt }, and given a government policy {Θt }, a competitive equilibrium is an
allocation {CtB , KtB , BtB , RtB } for borrowers, {CtR , AR      R      R                      D    D
                                                           t,P , At,G , Bt } for risk takers, {Ct , Bt } for

depositors, default policies ι(ωit ) and D(ρt ), and a price vector {pt , qtm , qtf }, such that given
the prices, borrowers, depositors, and risk-takers maximize life-time utility subject to their
constraints, the government satisfies its budget constraint, and markets clear.

       We show below that the risk averse saver is the marginal agent for short-term risk-free debt.

The last equation states that total non-housing resources equal the sum of non-housing con-
sumption expenditures and home renovations by the households, discretionary spending by
the government, and lost resources due to the deadweight costs of foreclosure and mortgage
refinancing.


2.7     Welfare

In order to compare economies that differ in the policy parameter vector Θt , we must take a
stance on how to weigh the different agents. We propose a utilitarian social welfare function
summing value functions of the agents according to their population weights ℓ:


                               Wt (·; Θt ) = ℓB VtB + ℓD VtD + ℓR VtR ,


where the V i (·) functions are the value functions defined in the appendix. A nice feature of
value functions under Epstein-Zin preferences is that they are homogeneous of degree one in
consumption. Thus, a λ% increase in the value function from a policy change is also a λ%
change in consumption units.



3     Model Solution and Calibration

Appendix A presents the Bellman equations for each of the three household types and derives
first-order conditions for optimality. We highlight some key features of the solution here by
inspecting these FOC. We then turn to the calibration.

                                                 19
3.1    First Order Conditions

Borrower FOCs First, since borrowers are the only households freely choosing their housing
position, their choice pins down the price of housing in the economy. Let M̃it,t+1 be the intertem-
poral marginal rate of substitution (or stochastic discount factor) for agent i ∈ {B, D, R}, with
expressions provided in the Appendix. At the optimum, house prices satisfy the recursion:

                                                                             B
                                                                           θCt+1
                  h         i                                                      
                         B          B      gt+1
                pt 1 − λ̃t φ = Et M̃t,t+1 e                 ∗
                                                  pt+1 ZK (ωt+1 )+                             (19)
                                                                        (1 − θ)KtB

The marginal cost of housing on the left-hand side consists of the house price pt minus a term
which reflects the collateral benefit of housing; an extra unit of housing relaxes the maximum
LTV constraint (7). The right hand side captures the expected discounted future marginal
benefits which depends on the resale value of the non-defaulted housing stock as well as on
the dividend from housing, which is the intratemporal marginal rate of substitution between
housing and non-housing goods.

  Second, we analyze the borrower’s optimal foreclosure decision. In the appendix, we show
that the optimal default threshold is given by:

                                        (1 − τtm + δqtm − δ λ̃RB  B
                                                              t )At
                                ωt∗ =                  B
                                                                    .
                                                  pt Kt−1

At the threshold level ωt∗ , the cost from foreclosure (and mortgage debt relief), which is the loss
                             B
of a house valued at ωt∗ pt Kt−1 , exactly equals the expected cost from continuing the service the
mortgage (including the option to default in the future which is encoded in qtm ) and keeping the
house. The cutoff has an intuitive interpretation. It is the aggregate loan-to-value ratio of the
borrowers, with both mortgage debt and housing valued at market prices. When the market
leverage of the borrower increases, the house value threshold ωt∗ rises and default becomes more
likely. Note that when the borrower exercises her prepayment option to its maximum extent,
λ̃RB
  t  > 0 and default becomes less likely. Hence the default option and the prepayment option
interact. A valuable refinancing option gives the borrower incentives to postpone a default
decision as in Deng, Quigley, and Van Order (2000).

  Third, the optimal share of outstanding mortgages that the borrower chooses to prepay,


                                                  20
ZtR = RtB /AB
            t is given by:



                                     ψZtR = qtm − F + µ̃RB
                                                        t  − λ̃RB
                                                               t                                 (20)


This balances the marginal cost of refinancing on the left-hand side with the marginal benefit
on the right-hand side. For an internal prepayment choice, the marginal benefit is to increase
the value of mortgage debt raised by qtm −F . Intuitively, when current mortgage rates are lower
than when the mortgage was originated, the mortgage is a premium bond and trades at a price
q m above par value F . By refinancing a marginal unit of debt, the borrower gains q m − F . If
q m −F is large enough, the borrower will want to refinance all outstanding debt (ZtR = δZA (ω ∗ )).
The multiplier on the refinancing upper bound activates (λ̃RB
                                                           t  > 0). Conversely, when qtm < F ,
refinancing is not useful and the multiplier on the lower refinancing bound, µ̃RB
                                                                               t  > 0, turns
positive to keep ZtR = 0.

      Fourth, from the borrower’s first order condition for AB , we can read off the demand for
mortgage debt.

                                                            2ZA (ωt+1
                                                                   ∗

A unit of mortgage debt obtained generates an amount qtm today but uses up some borrowing
capacity, which is costly when the borrower’s loan-to-value constraint binds (λ̃B
                                                                                t > 0). The

non-defaulted part of the debt must be serviced in future periods, modulo a mortgage interest
tax deduction, as long as it is not prepaid.


Depositor FOC The risk averse saver buys short-term debt issued by the risk taker. This
debt is equivalent to government debt by virtue of the deposit insurance. The depositor’s first-
order condition for the short-term bond, assuming the short-sales constraint is not binding,
is:

                                                    h        i
                                          qtf          D
                                                = Et M̃t,t+1




                                                    21
The depositor’s precautionary savings incentives are a crucial force determining equilibrium
risk-free interest rates.


Risk Taker FOCs Next, we turn to the risk taker’s default decision. The risk taker will
optimally default whenever the utility costs of doing so is sufficiently small: ρt < ρ∗t . The
threshold depends on her wealth WtR and the state variables StR that are exogenous to the risk
taker, including the wealth of the borrower and of the depositor, and the outstanding amount
of government debt. At the threshold, she is indifferent between defaulting and offloading her
(negative) wealth onto the government or carrying on:


                                 V R (0, ρ∗t , StR ) = V R (WtS , 0, StR ),


where the value function is defined in Appendix A.

   Second, the risk taker can invest in both government guaranteed and private MBS. The
respective first-order conditions are:

                    h                                                    i

Absent binding risk taker borrowing constraints (λ̃R
                                                   t = 0), the marginal cost of a guaranteed

mortgage bond is the price qtm plus the guarantee fee γt (expressed as a price) while the benefit
is the expected discounted value of the bond tomorrow, which consists of the coupon payment
and the repayment of principal in case of default (both are in MG ) plus the resale value of
the non-defaulted portion of the mortgage bond. When there are prepayments, the market
value of the bond is adjusted for the difference between the market value and the face value,
on the share of mortgages that gets prepaid. If the collateral constraint is binding, the benefit
is increased by the relaxation of the borrowing constraint, and depends on the haircut ξG for
guaranteed mortgages. The first-order condition for private mortgages is similar, without the
guarantee fee term, with a different collateral requirement term (ξP ), and a different mortgage
payoff MP .

   An equivalent way of restating the risk taker’s choice is in terms of how many units of

                                                    22
mortgages to originate to borrowers, and for how much of these holdings to buy default insurance
from the government. The optimal amount of default insurance to buy solves:

                         h                           i
                  γt = Et M̃R
                            t,t+1 (MG,t+1 − MP,t+1 )   + λ̃R   m
                                                           t κqt (ξG − ξP )



Risk takers will buy insurance until the marginal cost of insurance on the left equals the
marginal benefit. An extra unit of default insurance increases the payoff of the mortgage and it
increases the collateralizability of a mortgage, a benefit which only matters when the borrowing
constraint binds. A binding risk taker leverage constraint increases demand for mortgage bonds,
and especially for guaranteed bonds given their low risk weight (high ξG ).


3.2    Calibration

The parameters of the model and their targets are summarized in Table 1.


Aggregate Income The model is calibrated at annual frequency. Aggregate endowment or
labor income Yt follows:


                       Yt = Yt−1 exp(gt )

                       gt = ρg gt−1 + (1 − ρg )ḡ + ǫt ,   ǫt ∼ iid N (0, σg )


We scale all variables by permanent income in order render the problem stationary. Given
the persistence of income growth, gt becomes a state variable. We discretize the gt process
into a 5-state Markov chain using the method of Rouwenhorst (1995). The procedure matches
the mean, volatility, and persistence of GDP growth by choosing both the grid points and the
transition probabilities between them. We use annual data on real per capita GDP growth from
the BEA NIPA tables from 1929-2014 excluding the war years 1940-1945. The resulting mean
is 1.9%, the standard deviation is 3.9%, and the persistence is 0.42. The states, the transition
probability matrix, and the stationary distribution are listed in Appendix B.1.


Foreclosure crises The stochastic depreciation shocks or idiosyncratic house value shocks,
ωi,t , are drawn from a Gamma distribution characterized by shape and a scale parameters

(χt,0 , χt,1 ). Fω (·; χt,0 , χt,1 ) is the corresponding CDF. We choose {χt,0 , χt,1 } to keep the mean
µω constant at 0.975, implying annual depreciation of housing of 2.5%, a standard value, and
to let the cross-sectional standard deviation σt,ω follow a 2-state Markov chain. Fluctuations
in σt,ω govern the aggregate mortgage credit risk and represent the second source of exogenous
aggregate risk. We refer to states with the high value for σt,ω as mortgage crises or foreclosure
crises.

   We set the two values (σH,ω , σL,ω ) = (0.10, 0.14) and the deadweight losses of foreclosure
(ζH , ζL ) = (0.25, 0.425) in order to match the mortgage default rates and severities (losses given
default) in normal times and in mortgage crises. In the benchmark model with low guarantee
fees, and given all other parameter choices, these parameters imply equilibrium mortgage default
rates of 1.6% in normal times and 12.7% in mortgage crises. The unconditional default rate is
2.7%. They imply equilibrium severities of 28.2% in normal times and 47.0% in crises. Mortgage
default and severity rates combine to produce unconditional mortgage loss rates of 1.0% per
year; 0.46% in normal times and 6.1% in crises. Appendix B.2 discusses the empirical evidence
and argues that these numbers are a good match for the data. We note that the values for
σω are in line with standard values for individual house price shocks (Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and
Schneider (2015)). Our unconditional severities are 30%, in line with typical values in the
literature (Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak (2011)).

   To pin down the transition probabilities of the 2-state Markov chain for σt,ω , we assume that
when the aggregate income growth rate in the current period is high (g is in one of the top three
income states), there is a zero chance of transitioning from the σL,ω to the σH,ω state and a 100%
chance of transitioning from the σH,ω to the σL,ω state. Conditional on low growth (g is in one
of the bottom two income states) we calibrate the two transition probability parameters (rows
have to sum to 1), pωLL and pωHH , to match the frequency and length of mortgage crises. Based
on the argument by Jorda et al. (2014) that most financial crises after WW-II are related to the
mortgage market and the historical frequency of financial crises in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009),
we target a 10% probability of mortgage crises. Conditional on a crisis, we set the expected
length to 2 years, based on evidence in Jorda et al. and Reinhart and Rogoff. Thus, the model
implies that not all recessions are mortgage crises, but all mortgage crises are recessions.20
  20
    In a long simulation, 33% of recessions are mortgage crises. This compares to a fraction of 6/22 (≈27%)
in Jorda et al. (2014). The correlation between σt,ω and gt is -0.42. The model generates persistence in the


                                                    25
Population and wealth shares To pin down the labor income and housing shares for bor-
rowers, depositors, and risk takers, we calculate a net fixed-income position for each household
in the Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF).21 Net fixed income equals total bond and bond-
equivalent holdings minus total debt. If this position is positive, we consider a household to be
a saver, otherwise it is a borrower. For savers, we calculate the amount of risky assets, defined
as their holdings of stocks, business wealth, and real estate wealth, as well as the share of these
risky assets in total wealth. We define risk takes as households that are within the top 5% of
risky asset holdings and have a risky asset share of at least 75%. This delivers population shares
of ℓB = 47%, ℓD = 51%, and ℓR = 2%. Based on this classification and the same SCF data,
borrowers receive 38% of aggregate income and own 39% of residential real estate. Depositors
receive 52% of income and 49% of housing wealth. Finally, risk takers receive 10% of income
and 12% of housing wealth. By virtue of the calibration, the model thus matches basic aspects
of the observed income and wealth inequality.


Mortgages In our model, a government-guaranteed MBS is a geometric bond. The issuer
of one bond at time t promises to pay the holder 1 at time t + 1, δ at time t + 2, δ 2 at
time t + 3, and so on. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, the government guarantee
                                                                       α
entitles the holder to receive a “principal repayment” F =            1−δ
                                                                          ,   a constant parameter that
does not depend on the value of the collateral or any state variable of the economy. The same
is true if the borrower refinances the mortgage. We estimate values for δ and F such that
the duration of the geometric mortgage in the model matches the duration of the portfolio
of outstanding mortgage-backed securities, as measured by the Barclays MBS Index, across a
range of historically observed mortgage rates. This novel procedure, detailed in Appendix B.3,
recognizes that the mortgage in the model represents the pool of all outstanding mortgages of
all vintages. We find that values of δ = 0.95 and α = 0.52 imply a relationship between price
and mortgage rate for the geometric mortgage that closely matches the price-rate relationship
for a real-life MBS pool consisting of fixed-rate mortgages issues across a range of vintages.
The average duration in model and data of the mortgage (pool) is about 4 years. Like the
real-life MBS pool, the geometric mortgage price is convex in rates when rates are high (the
mortgage default rate of 0.02 in the low g-fee economy and 0.08 in the high g-fee economy. The persistence
depends on, among other things, the persistence of σt,ω which is 0.478.
  21
     We use all survey waves from 1995 until 2013 and average across them.

                                                   26
prepayment option is out-of-the-money) and concave when rates are low (“negative convexity”
when the prepayment option is in-the-money). Thus, the geometric mortgage has the same
interest rate risk (duration) of real-life mortgages for different interest rate scenarios. Despite
its simplicity, the perpetual mortgage with prepayment captures the key features of real-life
guaranteed MBS pools.

   Borrowers can obtain a mortgage with face value up to a fraction φ of the market value of
their house. We set the LTV ratio parameter φ = 0.65 to match the average mortgage debt-
to-income ratio for borrowers in the SCF of 130%. The calibration produces an unconditional
mortgage debt-to-income ratio among borrowers of 148% in the benchmark model, somewhat
overshooting the target. In the benchmark model, borrowers’ mean loan-to-value ratios are
63.8% in book value and 76.2% in market value terms.

   We set the marginal prepayment cost parameter ψ so that the benchmark model generates
reasonable conditional prepayment speeds. We target an average speed in the range of 15-20%
annually.22


Government parameters Government fiscal policy consists of mortgage guarantee policy,
a financial sector bailout policy, and general taxation and spending policies. In our desire to
have a quantitatively meaningful model, we believe it is important to also capture non-housing
realted fiscal policy. After the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September
2008, the merger of the GSEs and the Treasury Department became a reality.

   Starting with the guarantee policy, our parameter γ specifies the cost of a guarantee, ex-
pressed in the same units as the price of the mortgage. Real-world guarantee fees are expressed
as a surcharge to the interest rate. We consider several values for γ with implied g-fees ranging
from 20 to 300 basis points. Freddie Mac’s management and g-fee rate was stable at around
20bps from 2000 to 2012. Similarly, Fannie Mae’s single-family effective g-fee was also right
around 20bps between 2000 and 2009. Thus, our benchmark model is the 20 basis point g-fee
economy. The main policy experiment in the paper is to raise γ and investigate the effects from
higher guarantee fees. Interestingly, Freddie Mac has increased its g-fee gradually from 20bps
  22
   CPR rates depend strongly on the interest rate and mortgage vintage, even among conventional 30-year
mortgages. For example, in December 2009, CPRs ranged from 6% to 34%. In October 2013, they ranged from
14% to 24% (SIFMA prepayment tables, benchmark scenario). In 2003, CPRs were as high as 80%.


                                                  27
at the start of 2012 to 32 bps at the end of 2014, while Fannie Mae has increased its g-fee from
20bps at the start of 2009 to 41 bps at the end of 2014 (Urban Institute Housing Finance Pol-
icy Center, December 2014 update). Fannie’s g-fees on new single-family originations currently
average 63bps.

   We set the proportional income tax rate equal to τ = 20.4% in order to match average
discretionary tax revenue to trend GDP in U.S. data. The discretionary tax revenue in the
1946-2013 data of 19.97% is after mortgage interest deductions, which is about 0.43% of trend
GDP. Hence, we set a tax rate before MID of 20.4%.23 As explained before, the model features
mortgage interest rate deductibility at the income tax rate. Because our geometric mortgages
do not distinguish between interest and principal payments, we assume that the entire mortgage
payment is deductible but at a lower rate, τ m = (1 − α) × τ .24 Tax revenues are pro-cyclical,
as in the data. Every dollar of income is taxed at the same tax rate. Risk takers are only 2%
of the population but pay 10% of the income taxes since they earn 10% of the income.

   We set exogenous government spending equal to Go = 0.163 (times trend GDP of 1) in
order to match average exogenous government spending to trend GDP in the 1946-2013 U.S.
data of 16.3%.25 This exogenous spending is wasted. We also allow for transfer spending of
3.18% of GDP, which equals the net transfer spending in the 1946-2013 data. This spending
is distributed lump-sum to the agents in proportion to their population share. As a fraction of
realized GDP, expenditures fluctuate, mimicking their counter-cyclicality in the data.

   We can interpret the risk-taker borrowing constraint parameters, κ, ξG and ξP as regulatory
capital constraints set by the government. Under Basel II and III, “first liens on a single-family
home that are prudently underwritten and performing” enjoy a 50% risk weight and all others
  23
     In our numerical work, we keep the ratio of government debt to GDP stationary by decreasing tax rates
τt when debt-to-GDP threatens falls below bG = 0 and by increasing tax rates when debt-to-GDP exceedd
bG = 1.2. Specifically, taxes are gradually and smoothly lowered with a convex function until they hit zero at
debt to GDP of -30%. Tax rates are gradually and convexly increased until they hit 50% ay a debt-to-GDP ratio
of 160%. Our simulations never reach the -30% and +160% debt/GDP states. These profligacy and austerity
tax policies do not affect the amount of resources that are available for private consumption in the economy.
  24
     As discussed in Appendix B.3, the sum of all mortgage payments is 1/(1 − δ) and F = α/(1 − δ) is the
payment of “principal.” Hence, the fraction of “interest payments” is the fraction (1 − α). In the equilibrium
with low g-fees, the mortgage interest deductibility expense is 0.46% of trend GDP, very close to the target.
  25
     The data are from Table 3.1 from the BEA. Exogenous government spending is defined as consumption
expenditures (line 18) plus subsidies (line 27) minus the surplus of government enterprises (line 16). It excludes
interest service on the debt and net spending on social security and other entitlement programs. Government
revenues are defined as current receipts (line 1), which excludes social security tax receipts. Trend GDP is
calculated with the Hodrick Prescott Filter.


                                                       28
a 100% risk weight. Agency MBS receive a 20% risk weight. Given that we think of the non-
guaranteed mortgage market as the subprime and Alt-A market, a capital charge of 8% (100%
risk weight) seems most appropriate for ξP . Given that the government guaranteed mortgages
are the counterpart to agency MBS, we set a capital charge of 1.6% (20% risk weight) for
ξG . We set the additional margin κ to match average leverage ratios of the financial sector,
given all other parameters. Since mortgage assets are predominantly held by leveraged financial
institutions, we calculate leverage for those kinds of institutions. The average ratio of total debt
to total assets for 1985-2014 is 95.6%.26 Since the non-mortgage portfolio of these institutions
have higher risk weights than their mortgage portfolio, we find that κ < 1.


Utility cost of risk-taker bankruptcy The model features a random utility penalty that
risk takers suffer when they default. Because random default is mostly a technical assumption,
it is sufficient to have a small penalty. We assume ρt is normally distributed with a mean of
µρ =1, i.e., a zero utility penalty on average, and a small standard deviation of σρ = 0.05.
The mean size of the penalty affects the frequency of financial sector defaults (and government
bailouts). The lower µρ , the lower the resistance to declare bankruptcy, and the higher the
frequency of bank defaults. The standard deviation affects the correlation between negative
financial intermediary wealth and bank defaults. Given those parameters, the frequency of
financial crises (government bailouts of the risk-taker) depends on the frequency of foreclosure
crises, and the endogenous choices (asset composition and liability choice) of the risk taker.


Preference parameters Preference parameters are harder to pin down directly by data since
they affect many equilibrium quantities and prices simultaneously. However, the discussion of
the first-order conditions above helps us connect the various parameters to specific equilibrium
  26
    Specifically, we include U.S. Chartered Commercial Banks and Savings Institutions, Foreign Banking offices
in U.S., Bank Holding Companies, Banks in U.S. Affiliated Areas, Credit Unions, Finance Companies, Security
Brokers and Dealers, Funding Corporations (Fed Bailout entities e.g. Maiden Lanes), GSEs, Agency- and
GSE-backed Mortgage pools (before consolidation), Issuers of ABS, REITs, and Life and Property-Casualty
Insurance Companies. Krisnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) identify a group of financial institutions as
net suppliers of safe, liquid assets. This group is the same as ours except that we add insurance companies
and take out money market mutual funds, since we are interested in leveraged financial firms. For comparison,
leverage for the Krisnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen institutions is 90.7% for the 1985-2014 sample. The group
of excluded, non-levered financial institutions are Money Market Mutual Funds, other Mutual Funds, Closed-
end funds and ETFs, and State, Local, Federal, and Private Pension Funds. Total financial sector leverage,
including these non-levered institutions, is 60.6%.



                                                     29
objects they have a disproportionate effect on.

   The coefficients of risk aversion are σR = 1, σB = 8, and σD = 20. The annual subjective
time discount factors are βR = βD = 0.98 and βB = 0.88. Risk aversion and the time discount
factor of the depositor disproportionately affect the short-term interest rate and its volatility.
The benchmark model generates a mean one-year real risk-free interest rate of 1.1% with a
standard deviation of 3.0%. In the data, the mean real interest rate is 1.20% with a volatility of
1.97% over the period 1985-2014.27 The borrower’s discount factor governs mortgage debt and
ultimately house prices. In the model, housing wealth to trend GDP is 2.24, while in the Flow
of Funds data (1985-2014) it is 2.41.28 Borrower risk aversion is set to target the volatility of the
annual change in household mortgage debt to GDP (Flow of Funds and NIPA), which is 4.2%
in the 1985-2014 data. Our low g-fee economy produces a volatility of 1.8%. The risk takers
have log period utility and their subjective discount factor is set equal to that of the depositors.
We set the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution equal to 1 for all agents, a common value
in the asset pricing literature.


3.3     Computation

This is a complicated model to solve given the presence of occasionally binding constraints for
both borrowers and risk takers. We provide a non-linear global solution method, policy time
iteration, which is a variant of the parameterized expectations approach. As explained in more
detail in computational Appendix C, policy functions, prices, and Lagrange multipliers are
approximated as piecewise linear functions of the exogenous and endogenous state variables.
The algorithm solves for a set of non-linear equations including the Euler equations and the
Kuhn-Tucker conditions expressed as equalities. Kubler and Schmedders (2003) show that
there exist stationary equilibria in this class of models when all exogenous state variables follow
Markov chains, as is the case here. Our solution method is a variant of theirs.
  27
     To calculate the real rate, we take the nominal one year constant maturity Treasury yield (FRED) and
subtract expected inflation over the next 12 months from the Survey of professional Forecasters. The mean
interest rate is sensitive to the sample period. Over the period 1990-2014, the mean is 0.72% and over the
period 1998-2014, it is only 0.21%.
  28
     The number in the data includes the real estate owned by the corporate sector since our model is a model
of the entire economy but does not include real estate-owning firms. Real estate owned by the household and
non-corporate sector is 1.51 times GDP on average over this period.

4      Main Results: Phasing out the GSEs

The main experiment in the paper is to compare an economy with and without government-
guaranteed mortgages. More precisely, we compute a sequence of economies that differ by the
guarantee fee γt that the government charges for providing the default insurance. All economies
feature a government bailout guarantee to the financial sector (risk takers), or equivalently,
deposit insurance. We evaluate how equilibrium prices and quantities, and ultimately welfare
are affected by an increase in g-fees. We do so based on a 10,000-period simulation of each
model. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results, reporting unconditional means and standard
deviations across the 10,000 simulations.

    Our benchmark model is one where the government provides the mortgage guarantee rela-
tively cheaply. We set γt to a value that implies an annual rate spread of 20bps.29 We think
of this “low g-fee” case as representing actual g-fees observed between the late 1990s and the
late 2000s. We refer to this calibration as the “low g-fee” or “20bps g-fee” economy. We also
compute several intermediate g-fee economies with g-fees around 55, 75, 100, and 150 basis
points. In the interest of space, we only report detailed results for the 55bps and 100bps g-fee
economies. The former is of particular interest since it reflects the level of g-fees observed to-
day. In the latter, guaranteed mortgages are dominant in mortgage crises while private bonds
are dominant in normal times. This outcome is reminiscent of Option B in the Obama Ad-
ministration’s policy document of February 2010 which envisions setting the g-fee high enough
so that it is only taken up in crises. Finally, we report on a high g-fee economy, the 275bps
g-fee economy, where guarantees are expensive enough that they are never bought. In this last
economy, the GSEs are “phased out.”


4.1     Prices

The first panel of Table 2 shows that interest rates are low and house prices high in the
benchmark low g-fee economy. The cheap mortgage guarantees lead to mortgage interest rates
                                                                              
  29
     The interest rate on private bonds can be calculated as rP,t = log q1m + δ , and the rate on guaranteed
                                                                        t

bonds is rG,t = log qm1+γt + δ . The effective g-fee, quoted as a difference in rates, is therefore given by
rP,t − rG,t .

of 3.5%, 22 basis points lower than in the high g-fee economy. This magnitude of subsidy to
mortgage rates is similar to what the empirical research has inferred form the spread between
conforming and jumbo mortgage loans.

  Short-term interest rates vary more substantially across economies, with the low g-fee econ-
omy displaying real short-term interest rates that are 1.1% per year, 70 basis points lower than
the 1.8% in the high g-fee economy. The model is successful in generating low real short-term
interest rates. We argue below that a key reason for low real interest rates is that the low g-fee
economy is risky. Depositors, who often are the marginal agents in the risk-free bond market
and who are the most risk averse of all agents, have strong precautionary savings motives which
push down interest rates.

  Faced with low mortgage rates, borrowers who are the marginal agents in the housing sector
demand more housing. Given a fixed housing supply (relative to trend growth), increased
housing demand results in higher house prices. The low g-fee economy’s house prices are 6.3%
higher than in the high g-fee economy. Phasing out the GSEs would lead to a non-trivial decline
in house prices. House prices are also substantially more volatile in the low g-fee economy: 14%
annual standard deviation compared to 12% in the high g-fee economy. This is a consequence
of the higher volatility in the demand for mortgage debt in the low g-fee economy, as discussed
further below.


4.2    Borrowers

Low G-fees Faced with high house prices and low mortgage rates, borrowers demand a lot of
mortgage debt in the low g-fee equilibrium. The steady state stock of mortgages outstanding
is high (63.4% of GDP in market value terms or 0.053 units AB ). Mortgage debt is also more
volatile in the low g-fee, with the economy experiencing large drops during mortgage crises.
The average borrower LTV ratio is 63.8% and borrowers’ mortgage debt-to-income is 1.49 on
average, both are close to the averages in the recent SCF data. We recall that the optimal
mortgage default policy for the borrower family depends on the mark-to-market LTV ratio.
The higher that ratio, the higher the mortgage default rate. That ratio is the highest and thus
the mortgages are the riskiest in the low g-fee economy. The average mortgage default rate is

2.7%, and the loss rate from mortgage default is 1.0%, both match the data. Loss rates from
mortgage defaults are 6.1% in housing crises but less than 0.5% in normal times. Borrowers
prepay 15.8% of non-defaulted mortgages on average. Prepayments are higher in crises (18.7%),
when interest rates are lower.

   In the low g-fee economy, losses due to mortgage default are largely born by the government,
not by the intermediaries. Defaults act as prepayments to the lenders who hold guaranteed
bonds. Both default-induced and rate-induced prepayments come in at par and cause a loss to
the intermediaries. The average mark-to-market loss rate given a prepayment is 10.8% (12.6%
in crises). The intermediaries’ portfolio loss rate is 0.4% on average (0.23% in normal times
and 1.68% in crises) in the low g-fee economy. These portfolio losses are nearly entirely due to
prepayment-related (both default- and rate-induced) losses rather than credit losses/mortgage
arrears.


High G-fees How does the borrower problem change for higher g-fees? The next six columns
of Table 2 consider economies with increasing g-fees.

   When g-fees and mortgage rates rise, the size of the mortgage market shrinks. The mortgage
market also becomes safer. The smaller mortgage market leads to a lower borrower debt-to-
income ratio of 1.40 in the high g-fee economy. The lower mark-to-market LTV ratio, due to
lower mortgage prices q m , implies a lower mortgage default rate. In the high g-fee economy, the
mortgage default rate is 1.8%, a reduction by almost 40% compared to the low g-fee economy.
This translates in a loss rate of 0.7% unconditionally. The loss rate during crises is higher
in the high g-fee economy (4.2% in crises) than in the low g-fee economy (1.7%) because
intermediaries now bear all the credit risk themselves. Prepayment rates also fall as the g-fee
increases, from 15.8% CPR in the low g-fee to 11.9% CPR in the high g-fee economy. This is
because equilibrium mortgage rates are higher in the high g-fee economy, reducing the benefit
from refinancing. Conditional on prepayment, the mark-to-market losses to intermediaries from
prepayment also shrink because of the smaller gap between qtm and F . In sum, because banks
no longer buy mortgage guarantees when the latter are expensive, default-related losses must
be fully absorbed by the banks. By choosing lower leverage and higher equity capital, banks
are able to withstand such credit losses as well as the losses due to prepayment.


                                               34
   An oft-invoked rationale for government guarantees is to provide stability of mortgage finance
at all times. Indeed, Fannie Mae was founded in the Great Depression when a massive default
wave of banks threatened the supply of mortgage credit. Our measure of the stability of the
provision of mortgage credit is the standard deviation of mortgage debt to income growth.
This volatility is 2.9% in the low g-fee economy when the mortgage guarantees are in full force.
Surprisingly, the volatility of changes in mortgage debt/income initially decreases to 2.7% as
the g-fee increases to 55bp. The volatility inches back up to end up unchanged in the high g-fee
economy compared to the low g-fee economy. Even in crisis periods, the decline in mortgage
credit relative to income is smaller in absolute value in the high g-fee economy than in the low
g-fee economy. The financial sector in the private market solution is well-enough capitalized
and has low enough leverage that it can better guarantee the stable provision of mortgage credit
over time than a system with a government backstop, where banks are poorly capitalized and
prone to occasional collapses. The popular fear that a private mortgage system would lead to
large swings in the availability of mortgage credit, especially in bad times, is unwarranted in
our model.


4.3    Risk Takers

The third panel of Table 2 reports on the risk takers. As financial intermediaries, they make
long-term mortgage loans to impatient borrower households and borrow short-term from patient
depositor households. They play the traditional role of maturity transformation. Given their
low risk aversion, they are relatively willing to bear fluctuations in their net worth in the process
of intermediation.


Low G-fees In the low g-fee economy, risk takers hold nearly all of their assets in the form
of government-guaranteed bonds. They buy mortgage guarantees both in normal times and in
mortgage crises (high σω ) states, taking advantage of the cheap mortgage guarantees provided
by the government. As a result, the asset side of their balance sheet is largely shielded from
mortgage default risk.

   Bearing little default risk on their assets and facing a low interest rate on safe deposits,
banks use substantial leverage in order to achieve their desired risk-return combination. The

                                                 35
intermediary leverage constraint allows banks who exclusively hold guaranteed mortgage bonds
to have a maximum leverage ratio of 96.4%. Banks hit that constraint in 32.7% of the periods;
the average bank leverage (market value of debt to market value of assets) ratio is 95.6%
(matching the data). Average risk taker wealth is modest, at 2.9% of trend GDP. Banks have
little “skin in the game.” The constraint binds more frequently in normal times (34.8%) than
in crises (14.7%) because of precautionary deleveraging in crises.

  In addition to taking risk through leverage, banks in the low g-fee economy have a larger
balance sheet of mortgages. Due to the combination of low risk taker wealth, high leverage,
and a large and risky mortgage portfolio, the banking system is fragile. When adverse income
shocks or mortgage credit shocks hit, risk taker net worth may fall below zero. The reason
this can happen despite the prevalence of guaranteed mortgages on intermediaries’ balance
sheets is because of mark-to-market losses on guaranteed bonds. Mortgage defaults act as
prepayments for holders of guaranteed bonds. Since agency bonds usually trade above par
prior to the prepayment, and prepayments come in at par, the prepayment constitutes a loss
for the holder or agency MBS. Put differently, prepayments happen when interest rates are low
and reinvestment opportunities are poor. We find that the low g-fee economy has the highest
amount of prepayment risk. It has the highest prepayment rate and the largest mark-to-market
loss conditional on a prepayment. By curbing banks’ default risk exposure, the GSE subsidies
are inadvertently increasing the exposure of banks to prepayment risk.

  When intermediary net worth turns negative, the government steps in to bail out the financial
sector. Such financial crises happen in 0.27% of the simulation periods. The table reports the
return on risk-taker wealth. It is 3.6% excluding the bankruptcy events, but 3.3% including such
events (unreported). This difference illustrates the option value introduced by the possibility
to go bankrupt.


Higher G-fees As g-fees rise, the composition of the risk taker portfolio shifts towards private
bonds. In the 55bp economy, guaranteed bonds still make up almost the complete portfolio
(98.4%). This is consistent with the situation today, where g-fees have risen to about 55bp and
yet guaranteed bonds continue to dominate. But when g-fees go up to 100 basis points, banks
guarantee only 11% of their portfolio. This dramatic reversal occurs because risk takers buy


                                              36
the guarantee only in crises, when guaranteed bonds constitute 93% of their portfolio. In good
times they prefer an all-private portfolio. The state uncontingent g-fee is too cheap to forego in
bad times but too expensive in normal times. This 100 basis point g-fee economy is reminiscent
of Option B of the Obama Administration housing reform plan, which envisions a g-fee level
that is high enough so that it would only be attractive in bad times. In the high g-fee economy
in the last two columns, risk takers shift exclusively towards holding private MBS. They do
not buy default insurance from the government, neither in good nor in bad times. The 275
basis point g-fee is high enough to “crowd-in” the private sector at all times. The 275bp g-fee
economy implements Option A in the Obama plan which envisions an entirely private mortgage
market.

  Our main result is that increasing the g-fee lowers the riskiness of the financial sector. Risk
taker leverage falls from 95.6% in the 20bp and 95.2% in the 55bp economy to 89.0% in the
100bp economy, and 88.3% in the high g-fee economy. As the portfolio shifts towards private
mortgages, the risk taker’s collateral constraint becomes tighter because private mortgages carry
higher regulatory capital requirements (ξP > ξG ). But this is not the main driver of the lower
leverage. Rather, banks choose to stay away from their leverage constraint in most periods;
their leverage constraint binds in less than 20% of periods compared to 33% in the low g-fee
economy.

  Table 2 also shows that intermediaries have much higher average net worth of 7% of GDP
in the high g-fee economy, more than double the 2.9% in the low g-fee economy. The higher
equity capital buffer is large enough to prevent most bank insolvencies and concomitant bank
bailouts, with the intermediary g-fee cases showing the lowest bankruptcy frequencies.

  Why do banks choose to reduce leverage and increase equity capital buffers? The shift
towards private mortgages increases the overall riskiness of banks’ portfolios. Thus, there is
less need to lever up in order to achieve the desired risk-return relationship for intermediary
wealth. Furthermore, banks also reduce the overall size of their mortgage portfolio. The market
value of their assets falls by 8.7% between the low and high g-fee economies. And the mortgages
they make are safer with lower market-based LTV ratios and lower borrower debt-to-income
ratios. The higher cost of leverage (higher short-term interest rate) and the smaller spread
between mortgage rates and deposit rates (192 basis points in the high g-fee versus 239 in the


                                               37
low g-fee economy) also help explain the banks’ choices.


4.4       Depositors and Government

Low G-fees Depositors have high risk aversion and thus loathe large fluctuations in con-
sumption across states of the world. Their strong precautionary savings demand makes them
willing to lend to intermediaries and the government at low interest rates. Of course, deposit
insurance is important because it makes depositors’ claims on the banks risk free, independent
on the riskiness of the bank’s balance sheet.

   In the low g-fee economy, the high mortgage default rate leads to large mortgage losses which
are mostly absorbed by the government, as explained above. Furthermore, there are occasional
bank insolvencies and bailouts. Both lead to a surge in government expenditures, financed with
government debt. Government debt to trend GDP is 15.0% on average with a high standard
deviation of 21.8%. Tax revenues only slightly exceed government discretionary and transfer
spending, and in the aftermath of a severe mortgage crisis it takes many years of small surpluses
as well as the absence of a new mortgage crisis to reduce government debt back to steady state
levels.

   Depositors must hold not only the debt issued by the banks (deposits) but also the debt
issued by the government. High risk taker leverage and high government debt in the low g-fee
economy lead to high equilibrium holdings of short-term debt by depositors. All else equal,
the large supply should result in a low price of short-term debt, or equivalently, a high interest
rate to induce the depositor to hold all that debt. Indeed, the interest rate during income
contractions that coincide with mortgage crises (-1.7%) is more than a percentage point higher
than the interest rate during contractions that do not coincide with crises (-2.8%). Yet on
average the low g-fee economy exhibits a low average equilibrium interest rate. The reason is
that the precautionary savings demand more than offsets the supply effect.

   During mortgage crises government debt shoots up as the government pays out on mortgage
guarantees and occasionally on bank bailouts. This increase in the supply of short-term debt by
the government is only somewhat offset by lower risk taker leverage, so that on net the supply
of bonds grows during crises. The ultra low real interest rates in crises make debt issuance


                                                38
attractive for the risk taker and government alike. The depositor absorbs this debt increase in
equilibrium by increasing savings and reducing consumption.

   In sum, by protecting the financial sector from mortgage defaults, the government shifts more
of the consumption fluctuations across states of the world onto the depositor. By virtue of the
depositor’s high risk aversion, she is more unwilling to bear such consumption fluctuations than
the risk taker. The depositor responds by saving a lot more at all times to absorb at least some
of the fluctuations in government debt with existing savings. The result is a low equilibrium
interest rate and low average financial income for the depositor.


High G-fees In the high g-fee economy, we have the same fraction of mortgage crises. But
these crises result in much lower mortgage loss rates. Bank insolvencies become rarer because
of smaller and safer mortgage portfolios, lower bank leverage and higher bank equity. Further-
more, the mortgage losses are no longer borne by the government but rather absorbed by the
intermediaries’ balance sheet. Average government debt falls as does its volatility. Average
government debt even becomes slightly negative.

   The lower equilibrium supply of both government debt and risk taker debt (deposits) would
result in a lower interest rate if savers were risk neutral.30 But overall interest rates are higher
in the high g-fee economy because the precautionary savings effect again dominates (given the
high risk aversion of the depositors). A safe economy without financial fragility and therefore
with low and predictable government debt induces depositors to scale back their precautionary
saving demand. The fall in demand for safe assets exceeds the decline in the supply, explaining
higher equilibrium real interest rates.

   In summary, when the g-fee is high enough, risk takers are well enough capitalized and
their intermediation capacity is rarely impaired. They bear and hence internalize all mortgage
default risk. In contrast, in the low g-fee economy, mortgage crisis episodes frequently disrupt
risk takers’ intermediation function. During these crises, the risk free rate drops sharply and
government debt increases sharply, effectively making depositors bear a greater part of the
mortgage default risk.
  30
     Indeed, the large difference between crisis and non-crisis interest rates attributable to additional supply of
risk-free debt, holding aggregate income constant, entirely disappears.

4.5    Actuarially Fair G-fees

It is possible to compute actuarially fair guarantee fees in the equilibrium of our model. It is
the fee that a hypothetical risk-neutral agent with the same degree of patience as the savers
would charge for the mortgage guarantee payment upon a default (MG − MP ). The actuarially
fair g-fee depends on the model in which it is computed. In the 20bp g-fee economy, whose
equilibrium displays financial fragility, the actuarially fair g-fee is 77 basis points (last row
of Table 2), proving that the 20bp g-fee is massively underpriced. The underpricing makes
guarantees attractive to risk takers as we showed above.

  Figure 2 shows the actuarially fair g-fee for the low and high g-fee economies as well as
several intermediate economies. The solid line shows the unconditional average, the dashed
line the actuarially fair g-fee in crises, and the dotted line the fair g-fee in normal times. The
figure also draws in the 45-degree line along which actual and actuarially fair g-fees are equal.
First, we note that the actuarially fair g-fee is decreasing in the exogenous g-fee (solid line with
circles). The higher the g-fee, the safer the mortgages are, and the more stable the financial
sector. Hence, to break even, a risk neutral insurer could charge a lower average rate. The
actuarially fair g-fee declines from 77 basis points in the 20bp economy to 54 basis points in
the 275bp economy. The fixed point where the actual and fair g-fees equate is between the
55bp and 100bp economies, somewhere around 60 basis points. Relative to the risk-neutral
benchmark, mortgage guarantees are overpriced on average in the economies with a g-fee above
60 basis points and unconditionally underpriced in economies with g-fees below 60bp.

  The figure also makes clear that the actuarially fair g-fee is state contingent. During mortgage
crises (high σω states), the mortgage loss rate is a lot higher and a much higher g-fee must be
charged to break even (dashed line with squares). For g-fees below 150bp, risk takers would
always want to buy guarantees in crisis times. But risk takers are not risk neutral but risk
averse. It turns out, we must go out to 275 basis points to make guarantees expensive enough
so that they are almost never bought in any of the states of the world. The 100bp economy is
an interesting one. Risk takers overwhelmingly buy the mortgage guarantee in crisis periods
but overwhelmingly hold private mortgage bonds in normal times. The actuarially fair g-fee
in that economy is 158bp in crisis times while it is 47bp in normal times. Thus, the 100bp
non-state contingent guarantee fee is attractively priced only in crises.

g-fee (x-axis). The solid line with circles denotes the average g-fee across all periods in a long simulation. The
dotted line with triangles denotes the average g-fee during normal times whereas the dotted line with squares
denotes the average g-fee during mortgage crises (high σω ) times.


Private Mortgage Insurance An interesting question is whether there is there scope for
welfare-enhancing private mortgage insurance. In the low g-fee equilibrium, private mortgage
insurance could not compete with the government’s underpriced guarantees. In the high g-fee
equilibrium, risk takers would buy a mortgage guarantee in crisis periods if it were available
at all times for a state-uncontingent 54bps. This logic is incomplete, however. The presence
of the guarantee would change the equilibrium of the economy, reintroducing moral hazard,
and leading to larger and riskier intermediary balance sheets. The increase in risk would
increase the actuarially fair g-fee. Second, the provider of private mortgage insurance would
go bankrupt since she would need to charge the much higher crisis-only guarantee fee of 131
basis points if banks only bought the guarantee in crisis times. We would have to take a
stance on the particulars of the private mortgage insurance sector. Should it not have the same
preferences as the risk takers (being also part of the leveraged financial sector)? Should it not
enjoy the same bailout guarantees as the banks (cfr. AIG)? Clearly a thorough analysis of this
question would require adding a fifth balance sheet for the PMI sector. Such an extension adds
substantial numerical complexity and is beyond the scope of this paper. Suffice to say that if

      g-fee). The model in columns 3 and 4 has an average g-fee of 100 basis points, and the model in the

the PMI sector has the same preferences as the intermediaries and enjoys the same treatment
by the government, we can simply think of the current intermediary sector as the consolidated
balance sheet of both banks and mortgage insurers. Since the quantity of mortgage insurance
would both be an asset and a liability of the consolidated sector, its equilibrium size would
be indeterminate. The equilibrium allocations and prices (including the actuarially fair g-fee)
would be the same as the economy we currently compute.


4.6    Welfare

Aggregate welfare, measured as the population-weighted average of the value functions of the
three types of agents, increases in the g-fee. The first row of Table 3 shows that it is 0.63%
higher in the high g-fee economy than in the benchmark low-g-fee economy. In unreported
results for a series of intermediate g-fee economies, we confirm that aggregate welfare increases
monotonically in the g-fee. With unit EIS, the value functions are in units of composite con-
sumption C 1−ρ K ρ . Therefore, increases in aggregate welfare can be directly interpreted as


                                                    42
consumption-equivalence gains. We consider the 0.63 percent improvement in consumption
equivalence terms from GSE reform to be a substantial effect.

   There are two effects that help understand the aggregate welfare gain: an improvement in
risk sharing and a reduction in deadweight losses. First, risk sharing between the different types
of agents generally improves as g-fees increase. To measure the extent of the improvement, we
compute the ratios of (log) marginal utilities between the different types. If markets were
complete, agents would be able to achieve perfect risk sharing by forming portfolios that keep
these ratios constant. Hence, larger volatilities of these marginal utility (MU) ratios indicate
worse risk sharing between the different types of agents. Table 3 lists the average MU ratios
and their volatilities for borrowers/risk takers, and risk takers/depositors, as these are the
pairs of agents that directly trade with each other. The volatilities of both ratios is lower
in the high g-fee economy than in the low g-fee economy. The MU ratio volatility between
borrower and risk taker falls by 22.6%. The decline in the MU ratio volatility between risk
taker and depositor is 7.7%. We see similarly large improvements in risk sharing if we look
at consumption volatility for the three types of agents: -9.3% for the borrower, -20.7% for
the depositor, and -8.9% for the risk taker. While the risk sharing between borrower and risk
taker improves monotonically as g-fees rise, the risk sharing between the risk taker and the
depositor is highest at an intermediate g-fee closest to the actuarially fair g-fee (around 65bp).
Similarly, the volatility of consumption for the risk taker is the lowest at that g-fee. At low g-fee
levels, the high leverage and risk-taking of intermediaries makes their consumption volatile. As
the g-fee rises from 20bps to about 65bps, leverage falls sharply but the risk taker’s portfolio
is still largely protected by government guarantees. However, as g-fees further above 65bps,
the risk taker portfolio tilts towards private bonds, and this makes consumption volatility rise
again (despite further reductions in leverage). Intermediary wealth is a crucial driver of the
overall degree of risk sharing between the agents in the economy. In the private economy, banks
are better able to provide consumption smoothing services to both borrowers and depositors
because they are better capitalized and less fragile. Improved risk sharing also increases the
risk-free rate and therefore mean consumption for savers.

   The second source of the welfare gain is a reduction in deadweight losses. The first deadweight
loss is the one associated with mortgage foreclosures. Lower deadweight costs leave more


                                                 43
resources for private consumption each period. This deadweight loss is 0.59% of GDP in the
20bps economy and 0.36% of GDP in the 275bp economy. While the deadweight loss falls
by 39%, it remains modest. The economy also benefits from lower deadweight losses from
prepayment costs in high g-fee economies since prepayment rates are lower. These losses are
of the same magnitude as those from foreclosures and fall by about the same percentage. The
final deadweight loss is associated with house maintenance. Because maintenance expenses are
proportional to the value of the house, they fall with g-fees because house prices fall with g-fees.
The decline is 6% in percentage terms and accounts for about half of the overall decline in all
three DWL sources combined. A reduction in housing consumption leaves more resources for
non-housing consumption. As we see in the table, the increases in resources goes to the depositor
and risk taker, both of which increase mean consumption. The borrower’s consumption declines
because she faces higher mortgage interest rates in the high g-fee economy.

   What are the distributional consequences of a mortgage market privatization? Close in-
spection of the value function of each of the three household types shows that the borrower’s
welfare stays almost constant between the low and the high g-fee economies (+0.04%), while
depositor welfare (+1.32%) and risk taker welfare (+1.69%) both increase substantially.31 The
near-absence of a welfare loss for borrowers is surprising since taking away underpriced mort-
gage guarantees increases mortgage rates and lowers property values. The important offset to
a decline in her consumption comes from the improvement in risk sharing. In conclusion, while
GSE reform is a Pareto improvement, it redistributes wealth from borrowers to savers thereby
raising inequality.


4.7     Inspecting the Mechanism: Crises Periods

To gain further intuition for the workings of the model, we study transitions from normal times
to mortgage crises. Specifically, we select all simulation periods in which the economy is in
normal times at time t = −1 (σt,ω = σL,ω ) and in a mortgage crisis in period t = 0 (σt,ω = σH,ω ).
We plot the economy from period -1 to period +8. We recall that the average mortgage crisis
lasts 2 periods (period 1 and 2); some are longer and some shorter. Also recall that all mortgage
  31
     Given the homogeneity properties of the value function, log changes in value functions are directly inter-
pretable as consumption equivalence changes and hence directly comparable across agents.

crises coincide with low aggregate output growth. The graphs show the median path over all
such episodes and compare the benchmark low g-fee economy to the intermediate 100bp g-fee
economy for the exact same sequence of shocks.

   There is a gradual but substantial increase in government debt during the crisis and for
several periods following it. The increase is close to 8% points of trend GDP. The payouts on
mortgage insurance and possibly bank bailouts increase the deficit. So do the pro-cyclical tax
revenues and the counter-cyclical exogenous government expenditures. The increase in interest
rates during the recovery raises the interest expense to the government and further increases
the debt. The middle panel in the bottom row shows the risk-free debt held by the depositor.
By market clearing, it is the sum of the deposits issued by the banks and the debt issued by
the government. During and in the aftermath of a crisis, the depositor must increase total

marginal utility states for the (highly risk averse) depositor, her welfare suffers.

   Figure 4 shows that mortgage default and loss rates spike during the crisis, but are mostly
back to pre-crisis levels by period 1 (the second year of crisis). The increase in default rates
arises because the mark-to-market LTV ratio of the mortgage portfolio spikes. This occurs both
because the market value of debt increases (mortgage interest rates fall) and the market value
of houses falls, as we saw in Figure 3. Later on, in period +1, the price of mortgage debt falls
while house prices partially recover. The resulting drop in the LTV ratio lowers default rates.
The last panel shows that the mortgage debt-to-income ratio falls precipitously in the crisis
as lenders reduce mortgage originations. The reduction is smaller in the high g-fee economy
(-2.7%) than in the low g-fee economy (-3%), contrary to the argument that GSEs are necessary
to prevent a collapse in provision of mortgage credit during a crisis.

   Figure 5 shows that risk taker wealth is much lower in the low g-fee economy and falls even
further from period -1 to period +1. As a result, their ability to intermediate funds between

depositors and borrowers is impaired. As the crisis eases in period +1, risk takers in the low
g-fee economy have very low wealth but want to start lending again to meet borrower demand.
Risk takers are close to their borrowing constraint (Rlev) throughout in the low g-fee economy.
Financial leverage dynamics are more pronounced in the 100bp g-fee economy, where risk takers
choose to stay away from binding constraints after the crisis dissipates. Leverage increases in the
first period of a crisis (time 0) as risk takers have to absorb losses on their mortgage portfolios.
Their net worth is sufficient to absorb the negative shock due to mortgage defaults. As pointed
out before, banks’ portfolios shift towards guaranteed bonds (mdebtG) during the crisis in the
100bp economy. Once the crisis wanes, they shift back to holding private bonds as they slowly
restore their net worth.

5     Alternative Policy Experiments

Our main policy experiment consisted of raising the g-fees. We now study two alternative
policies and compare their welfare consequences to those in the main policy experiment. The
first experiment explores the effect of macro-prudential policy. The second experiment studies
a recent legislative proposal to “put private capital in front of a government guarantee.” These
exercises help to further illuminate the interaction of government guarantees, deposit insurance,
and risk taker leverage.


5.1     Higher Regulatory Capital Charges

The first policy raises the regulatory capital weight on guaranteed mortgage bonds. Specifically,
we lower ξG from its benchmark value of 0.984 (1.6% capital charge) to ξG = ξP = 0.92 (8%
capital charge). We only change this one parameter and keep the low 20bp g-fees in place. The
question is whether eliminating the favorable regulatory treatment of government-guaranteed
bonds can be a (partial) substitute for higher g-fees. Since this reform tightens the borrowing
constraint on financial intermediaries, it is a macro-prudential policy that reduces bank leverage.
The first two columns of Table 4 report the results.

    Because the macro-prudential policy does not change the low cost of the mortgage guarantees,
which continue to be severely underpriced at 20bps, guaranteed bonds retain their dominant
position in banks’ portfolio. Private bonds constitute 3% of total assets. The overall size of
bank assets is only modestly smaller than in the benchmark economy (by 1%). With a tighter
regulatory capital constraint, banks have more “skin in the game.” The bankruptcy option now
becomes less valuable (compared to the benchmark case with ξG = .984) because it involves a
greater loss of own capital upon bankruptcy. Risk takers become more cautious and choose to
stay away from the constraint more often. Risk taker leverage is substantially lower at 88.8%
(compared to 95.6% in the benchmark economy and close to the high g-fee economy leverage of
88.3%) and the constraint binds in 23.8% of periods. Risk taker wealth is 7.2% of GDP, more
than twice the level in the low g-fee economy and even somewhat higher than in the high g-fee
economy. Bankruptcies are nearly eliminated because higher risk taker net worth can absorb
the shocks.


                                                48
   When risk takers are forced to have a bigger equity cushion, they self-insure better against
very bad states. This reduces the likelihood of low consumption. While risk taker consumption
volatility goes up, the increase in volatility comes to a large degree from upside volatility.
They can grant the same amount of mortgages with less debt by having greater own wealth.
Their consumption is higher on average since they earn a higher spread between mortgages
and deposit rates (262 vs 239 bps). In sum, risk takers enjoy substantial welfare gains from
this reform increasing consumption-equivalent welfare by 1.74%. This welfare increase for risk
takers is essentially the same as the one we saw in our main policy experiment where we raised
the g-fee (+1.69%). In sum, tighter macroprudential policy is as successful in reducing financial
fragility as high g-fees. Interestingly, reducing the ability of financial firms to lever up benefits
them.

   On the borrower side, the economy with tighter capital requirements looks similar to the
low g-fee economy. Mortgage rates, house prices, default rates, and mortgage losses are almost
unchanged. Borrowers see almost no change in welfare (+0.03%), similar to the transition from
a low g-fee to a high g-fee economy (+0.04%).

   The reason overall welfare only goes up by 0.07% in aggregate is because the depositors only
benefit modestly (0.10%) and constitute a large share of the population. In the main policy
experiment, they gained +1.32%. The low welfare gains for depositors can be understood from
the low interest rates they earn in this experiment (20 basis points lower than in the low g-fee
economy and 90 basis points lower than in the high g-fee economy). These low rates make
depositor mean consumption much lower than in the high g-fee economy. The reason for the
low interest rates is the same as in the benchmark economy: depositors must absorb high and
variable government debt. Because they loathe fluctuations in consumption across states of
the world, they display strong precautionary savings resulting in low rates. Macro-prudential
policy does not affect the overall size and riskiness of the mortgage market since banks who
continue to enjoy the guarantee hold essentially the same mortgage portfolio as in the low g-fee
economy. The fiscal implications are the same and lead to poor consumption insurance for
depositors.

5.2     Catastrophic Insurance

The last policy experiment we study is inspired by recent legislative proposals in the U.S. Senate
Banking Committee. We refer to these experiments as the Johnson-Crapo or JC experiment.32
The spirit of the proposed reform is to force mortgage lenders to hold a substantial buffer
of private capital in order to better protect the tax payer. The idea is that by having more
private capital at risk, mortgage underwriting would be more prudent; moral hazard would be
diminished. The government guarantee would be a catastrophic guarantee, kicking in only after
the private capital is wiped out. Johnson-Crapo proposed that the first 10% of losses due to
mortgage default would be absorbed by the private sector. The industry has argued that 10%
is too large, and has proposed to replace it by a 5% private loss. We evaluate both proposals in
our framework. We are the first to provide a detailed quantitative analysis of Johnson-Crapo,
including all the general equilibrium effects on risk taking, interest rates, house prices, and the
distributional effects for the various types of tax payers.

   To analyze Johnson-Crapo, we change our definition of the government guarantee. When
risk takers buy a mortgage guarantee, the guarantee pays out only if the loss rate on the
mortgage pool exceeds 10%. If the loss is less than 10%, the guarantee is worthless and the
guaranteed bond has the same payoff as a private mortgage bond. If the loss is higher than the
threshold, the guaranteed bond pays out an amount equal to the losses above the threshold.
For ease of comparison, we keep the regulatory capital advantages of guaranteed bonds from
the benchmark economy. Also for ease of comparison, we assume that the government offers
the catastrophic insurance at 20 basis points.33 We compute the actuarially fair cost, at the
new equilibrium. The last two columns of Table 4 present the results.

   The JC economy is similar to the high g-fee economy in several aspects. It has lower house
prices, higher mortgage rates, and a smaller mortgage market. In market value terms, risk
taker mortgage assets are 8.7% lower in the JC 10% economy than in the benchmark low g-fee
  32
     The “Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2014” introduced by senators Corker and
Warner preceded the draft bill introduced by Senators Johnson and Crapo and voted in the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on May 15, 2014. The 13-9 vote was not strong enough to force a full
senate floor vote.
  33
     This assumption does not significantly affect results. In the appendix, we report results from two additional
experiments. In the first one, the catastrophic insurance is priced at 5bp. The second one keeps the g-fee at 20
bp but provides insurance for losses in excess of 5%, rather than 10% percent. Results are qualitatively similar.



                                                       51
economy. House prices fall by 6.2%. There is a substantial reduction in mortgage default rates,
just like in the high g-fee economy.

  In the JC economy, the guarantee’s actuarially fair cost is 2 basis points. Insurance is quite
over priced at 20bp. As a result, risk takers hold fewer guaranteed bonds (29% of their portfolio).
While the guarantee is less generous, the insured mortgages are also endogenously less risky, so
that the loss rate on guaranteed bonds is lower than in the low g-fee case. Risk takers’ portfolio
loss rate is 0.56%, which is 47% higher than in the benchmark economy but 17% lower than in
the high g-fee economy when only private mortgages are held, as the guaranteed bonds are still
substantially safer than uninsured bonds. Absent the severely underpriced guarantee, borrower
leverage is lower, and lower default and loss rates on mortgages require smaller and less frequent
guarantee payouts. As a result, government debt is much lower in the JC economies.

  Risk taker leverage is lower at 91.6%, suggesting that the increased losses they must bear
reduce their appetite for high leverage. The protection offered by the catastrophic guarantee
increases their appetite to resume lending after a mortgage crisis and they run more often into
binding constraints (77% on average, 88% in crises). The return on risk takers’ wealth is now
lower (2.9% excluding bankruptcy periods) but also less volatile, with volatility dropping by
26%.

  Interestingly, aggregate welfare in the JC 10% case is slightly higher than in the high g-fee
economy (+0.67% versus +0.63%). Borrowers’ welfare changes in the almost identical way as
from a phase-out of the guarantee (+0.05%). Depositors gain more than in the main experiment
(+1.38% vs. +1.32%), while risk takers gain slightly less (+1.23% versus +1.69%). The gain
for depositors comes from the much lower and less volatile government debt, just as in the main
experiment. In addition, risk takers are better able to help depositors smooth consumption.
This ability is higher in the JC economy than in the high g-fee economy because the catastrophic
guarantee protects the banks in very adverse states of the world. Equilibrium interest rates
reflect the safe environment for depositors and are 6bp higher than in the high g-fee economy.

  By the same token, risk takers benefit form the catastrophic insurance. While in the high
g-fee economy the 0.1-percentile of risk taker consumption is 0.045 (relative to trend GDP), the
same percentile is much higher at 0.051 in the JC 10% economy (mean risk taker consumption
is approximately 0.075 in both economies). The volatility of risk taker consumption falls sub-


                                                52
stantially, besting the change in the main experiment. The mean consumption gain for the risk
taker is not as high as in the main experiment, in contrast, because the return on bank equity
and the mortgage spread are not as high in the JC 10% economy as in the high g-fee economy.
This in turn is due to the higher risk-free rate in the JC economy.



6     Conclusion

Our main findings are that underpriced, government-provided mortgage default insurance dis-
torts the incentives of the financial sector in a way that leads it to take more risk in the
mortgages it originates and in the leverage it takes on. While the policy leads to higher house
prices, lower mortgage rates, and lower interest rates, it also leads to more frequent mortgage
defaults, and financial crises when banks become insolvent. Even though the government can
mitigate the fallout from such crises by spreading out the costs over time, the allocation of
risk remains suboptimal. We document a substantial welfare gain from moving to a private
mortgage system, a transition which can be effectuated by raising the cost of the government
mortgage guarantees. The private market provides a safer financial sector with fewer mortgage
foreclosures and better intermediation between borrowers and savers. While the policy change
is a Pareto improvement, it benefits depositors and bankers more and raises wealth inequality.
We find that recent policy proposals in which the government only provides catastrophic loss
insurance behind private loss-bearing capacity realize as high a welfare gain as a complete phase
out phase-out.

    The paper brings together the literatures of financial intermediary-based asset pricing and
housing finance. It introduces in the role of the government into the former and the importance
of the financial sector into the latter. New is the possibility of default for both borrowers and
banks and the government’s provision of bailout guarantees to the creditors’ of the banking
sector. An important ingredient is the interaction of such guarantees on banks’ liabilities with
the mortgage guarantee on banks’ assets.

    The model is a natural laboratory to explore the effects of government purchases of mort-
gages. The GSEs were a large buyer of guaranteed and non-guaranteed mortgages, accumulat-
ing a combined portfolio of $1.7 trillion dollars by 2007. Since then, they have reduced their


                                               53
holdings by 50%. The Federal Reserve was a large buyer of guaranteed mortgage bonds, ac-
cumulating $1.8 trillion as part of its QE1 and QE3 programs during and in the aftermath of
the financial crisis. It is merely a matter of time before the Fed will start to shrink the size
of these holdings. Thus, over the next several years, the U.S. is likely to see a major change
from governmental to private ownership of at least 25% of the secondary mortgage market, one
of the largest fixed income markets in the world. A complete understanding of such dramatic
shift on the mortgage market, house prices, bond yields, the macro-economy, and the financial
sector remains an important challenge for future research.

  There are several other promising avenues for further exploration. The model currently
abstracts from the choice between owning and renting. Abolishing the mortgage guarantees
may well affect the home ownership rate. If house price-to-rent ratios fall in the aftermath of
the policy reform, as they do in recent models that study the abolition of mortgage interest
rate deductibility, phasing out the GSEs may well boost the home ownership rate. A second
ingredient our work abstracts from is the feedback effect from the mortgage lending complex to
the rest of the financial sector and to the real economy. In a world with subsidized mortgage
lending, lending to capital-constrained entrepreneurs with productive investment opportunities
may get crowded out, adding to the welfare cost of government mortgage and financial sector
bailout guarantees.

A       Model Appendix
We reformulate the problem of risk taker, depositor, and borrower to ensure stationarity of the problem. We
do so by scaling all variables by permanent income.


A.1      Borrower problem
A.1.1     Preliminaries
We start by defining some preliminaries.

                                  ZA (ωt∗ ) = [1 − Fω (ωt∗ ; χ)]
                                 ZK (ωt∗ ) = [1 − Fω (ωt∗ ; χ)]E [wi,t | ωi,t ≥ ωt∗ ; χ]

and Fω (·; χ) is the CDF of ωi,t with parameters χ. Assume ωi,t are drawn from a Gamma distribution with
shape and scale parameters χ = (χ0 , χ1 ) such that

                                              µω = Ei [ωi,t ; χ0 , χ1 ] = χ0 χ1
                                           2
                                          σt,ω   = Vari [ωi,t ; χ0 , χ1 ] = χ0 χ21

From Landsman and Valdez (2004, equation 22), we know that

                                                            1 − Fω (ω̄; χ0 + 1, χ1 )
                                      E[ω|ω ≥ ω̄] = µω
                                                              1 − Fω (ω̄; χ0 , χ1 )

so the closed form expression for ZK is

                                      ZK (ωt∗ ) = µω [1 − Fω (ωt∗ ; χ0 + 1, χ1 )]

It is useful to compute the derivatives of ZK (·) and ZA (·):
                                                   Z ∞
                                 ∂ZK (ωt∗ )     ∂
                                            =          ωfω (ω)dω = −ωt∗ fω (ωt∗ ),
                                    ∂ωt∗      ∂ωt∗ ωt∗
                                                   Z ∞
                                 ∂ZA (ωt∗ )     ∂
                                            =          fω (ω)dω = −fω (ωt∗ ),
                                    ∂ωt∗      ∂ωt∗ ωt∗

where fω (·) is the p.d.f. of a Gamma distribution with parameters (χ0 , χ1 ).

A.2.2        First-order conditions
Optimal Default Decision The optimization consists of choosing a function D(ρ) : R → {0, 1} that
specifies for each possible realization of the penalty ρ whether or not to default.
    Since the value function V R (W, ρ, StR ) defined in (40) is increasing in wealth W and decreasing in the penalty
ρ, there will generally exist an optimal threshold penalty ρ∗ such that for a given WtR , risk-takers optimally
default for all realizations ρ < ρ∗ . Hence we can equivalently write the optimization problem in (47) as

              Ṽ R (WtR , StR ) =max Eρ 1[ρ < ρ∗ ] V R (0, ρ, StR ) + (1 − 1[ρ < ρ∗ ]) V R (WtR , 0, StR )
                                                                                                         
                                  ρ∗

                                     Fρ (ρ∗ ) Eρ V R (0, ρ, StR ) | ρ < ρ∗ + (1 − Fρ (ρ∗ )) V R (WtR , 0, StR ).
                                                                         
                                =max
                                   ∗ ρ


   The solution ρ∗t is characterized by the first-order condition:

                                               V R (0, ρ∗t , StR ) = V R (WtS , 0, StR ).

By defining the partial inverse F : (0, ∞) → (−∞, ∞) of V S (·) in its second argument as

                                        (x, y) : y = F (x) ⇔ x = V R (0, y) ,
                                      


we get that
                                                   ρ∗t = F (V R (WtR , 0, StR )),                                  (49)
and by substituting the solution into (47), we obtain

               Ṽ R (WtR , StR ) = Fρ (ρ∗t )Eρ V R (0, ρ, StR ) | ρ < ρ∗t + (1 − Fρ (ρ∗t )) V R (WtR , 0, StR ).
                                                                        

Equations (40), (49), and (50) completely characterize the optimization problem of risk-takers.

A.3      Depositor
We state here a slightly more general problem than in the main text whereby we allow the depositor to also
invest in government-guaranteed mortgage bonds in addition to short-term government bonds. The problem
in the main text then arises as a special case where we impose the additional constraint that the guaranteed
mortgage bond holdings must be non-positive. The Lagrange multiplier on this constraint tells us whether
the depositor in the restricted problem would want to hold guaranteed bonds, evaluated at the equilibrium
allocation of the restricted model.


A.3.1     Statement of stationary problem

Scaling by permanent income, the stationary problem of the depositor -after the risk taker has made default
her decision and the utility cost of default is realized- is:

  As before, we will drop the arguments of the value function and denote marginal values of wealth and
mortgages as:

                                                        VtD ≡ VtD (WtD , StD ),
                                                        D       ∂VtD (WtD , StD )
                                                       VW,t ≡                     ,
                                                                    ∂WtD

Denote the certainty equivalent of future utility as:
                                                                  1−σD 
                                   CEtD = Et egt+1 Ṽ D (WtD , StD )        ,

and the composite within-period utility as:

                                                      uD     D 1−θ
                                                       t = (Ct )
                                                                        D θ

    Like the borrower, the depositor must take into account the risk-taker’s default decisions and the realization
of the utility penalty of default. Therefore the marginal value of wealth is:

                      D                 ∂V D (WtD , StD (ρt < ρ∗t ))                   ∂V D (WtD , StD (ρt > ρ∗t )

Marginal value of wealth is:

   Defining the SDF in the same fashion as we did for the borrower, we get:

A.3.4     Euler Equations
Combining the first-order condition for short-term bonds (62) with the marginal value of wealth, and the SDF,
we get the Euler equation for the short-term bond:
                                                          h        i

where λ̃D                             D
        t is the original multiplier λt divided by the marginal value of wealth.
   Similarly, from (63) we get the Euler Equation for guaranteed mortgages:
                                       h                                                    i

A.4      Equilibrium
The optimality conditions describing the problem are (24), (33), (35), (38) and (39) for borrowers, (41), (54),
(55), and (56) for risk takers, and (57), (65), and (66) for depositors. We add complementary slackness conditions
for the constraints (26) and (27) for borrowers, (43), (44), and (45) for risk-takers, and (59) and (60) for
depositors. Together with the market clearing conditions (16), (17), and (18), these equations fully characterize
the economy.

B.1       States and Transition Probabilities
After discretizing the aggregate real per capita income growth process as a Markov chain using the Rouwenhorst
method, we obtain the following five states for g:

                                           [0.943, 0.980, 1.018, 1.058, 1.101]

    with 5 × 5 transition probability matrix:

   We discretize the process for σω2 into a two-state Markov chain that is correlated with income growth g. The
two states are:

                                                          [.078, .203]

    The transition probability matrix, conditional on being in one of the bottom two g states is:
                                                                        

    The transition probability matrix, conditional on being in one of the top three g states is:
                                                                      
                                                           1.0   0.0
                                                           1.0   0.0

    The stationary distribution for the joint Markov chain of g and σω2 is
     State       1        2       3           4       5         6            7

    From a long simulation, we obtain the following mean, standard deviation, and persistence for g: 1.019, .039,
and .42, respectively. We obtain the following mean, standard deviation, and persistence for σω2 : .092, .039, and
.46, respectively. We obtain a correlation between g and σω of -0.42.


B.2       Evidence on default rates and mortgage severities
Since not all mortgage delinquencies result in foreclosures (loans can cure or get modified), we use the fraction of
loans that 90-day or more delinquent or in foreclosure as the real world counterpart to our model’s default rate.
Some loans that were 90-day delinquent or more received a loan modification, but many of these modifications
resulted in a redefault 12 to24 months later. Given that our model abstracts from modifications, using a
somewhat broader criterion of delinquency than foreclosures-only seems warranted.
   The observed 90-day plus (including foreclosures) default rate rose from 2% at the start of 2007 to just under
10% in 2010.Q1. Since then, the default rate has been gradually falling back, to 4.7% by 2014.Q3 (Mortgage
Bankers Association and Urban Institute). The slow decline in foreclosure rates in the data is partly due to
legal delays in the foreclosure process, especially in judicial states like New York and Florida where the average


                                                              68
foreclosure process takes up to 1000 days. In other part it is due to re-defaults on modified loans. Since, neither
is a feature of the model, it seems reasonable to interpret the abnormally high default rates of the post-2013
period as due to such delays, and to reassign them to the 2010-2012 period. If we assume that the foreclosure
rate will return to its normal 2% level by the end of 2016, then such reassignment delivers an average foreclosure
rate of 8.5% during the 2007-2012 foreclosure crisis. Absent reassignment, the average default rate would be
5.9% over the 2007-2016 period. Jeske et al. (2014) target only a 0.5% foreclosure rate, but their calibration is
to the pre-2006 sample. The evidence from the post-2006 period dramatically raises the long-term mean default
rate.
    Fannie Mae’s 10K filings for 2007 to 2013 show that severities, or losses-given-default, on conventional single-
family loans were 4% in 2006, 11% in 2007, 26% in 2008, 37% in 2009, 34% in 2010, 35% in 2011, 31% in 2012,
and 24% in 2013. Severities on Fannie’s non-conforming (mostly Alt-A and subprime) portfolio holdings exceed
60% in all these years. If anything, the severity rate on Fannie’s non-conforming holdings is lower than that
of the overall non-conforming market due to advantageous selection (Adelino et al 2014). Given that the non-
conforming market accounted for half of all mortgage originations in 2004-2007, the severities on conventional
loans are too low to accurately reflect the market-wide severities. To take account of this composition effect,
we target a market-wide severity rate of 40% in the crisis (2007-2012). We target a severity rate of 15% in
non-crisis years (pre-2007 and post-2012), based on Fannie’s experience in that period and the much smaller
size of the non-conforming mortgage market in those years.
   Combining a default rate of 2% in normal times with a severity of 15%, we obtain a loss rate of 0.3% in
normal times. Combining the default rate of 8.5% during a foreclosure crisis with the severity of 40% in crises,
we obtain a 3.4% loss rate.
    To obtain mortgage debt to GDP in normal times and in crisis times, we calculate a time series of household
mortgage debt (including debt on multi-family real estate owned by the household sector) and divide by GDP.
Since mortgage debt-GDP saw a gradual decrease for reasons related to new technology, such as automated
underwriting and securitization, we focus attention on the post-1985 period. Mortgage debt-GDP averages to
54% in the 1985-1999 period. We target this for our normal times value. Mortgage debt-GDP averages to 78%
in the 2000-2014 period. We target that number for our crisis number.


B.3      Long-term mortgages
Our model’s mortgages are geometrically declining perpetuities, and as such have no principal. The issuer of
one unit of the bond at time t promises to pay the holder 1 at time t + 1, δ at time t + 2, δ 2 at time t + 3,
and so on. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, the government guarantee entitles the holder to receive a
                              α
“principal repayment” F = 1−δ   , a constant parameter that does not depend on the value of the collateral or
any state variable of the economy. Real life mortgages have a finite maturity (usually 30 years) and a principal
payment. They also have a vintage (year of origination), whereas our mortgages combine all vintages in one
variable. This appendix explains how to map the geometric mortgages in our model into real-world mortgages.
   Our model’s mortgage refers to the entire pool of all outstanding mortgages. In reality, this pool not only
consists of newly issued 30-year fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs), but also of newly issued 15-year mortgages,
other mortgage types such as hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as well as all prior vintages of all
mortgage types. This includes, for example, 30 year FRMs issued 29 years ago. The Barclays U.S. Mortgage
Backed Securities (MBS) Index is the best available measure of the overall pool of outstanding government-
guaranteed mortgages. It tracks agency mortgage backed pass-through securities (both fixed-rate and hybrid
ARM) guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC). The index is
constructed by grouping individual TBA-deliverable MBS pools into aggregates or generics based on program,
coupon and vintage. For this MBS index we obtain a time series of monthly price, duration (the sensitivity of
prices to interest rates), weighted-average life (WAL), and weighted-average coupon (WAC) for January 1989
until December 2014.
    Our calibration strategy is to choose values for δ and F so that the relationship between price and interest
rate (duration) is the same for the observed Barclays MBS Index and for the model’s geometric bond. We
proceed in two steps. In the first step, we construct a simple model to price a pool of MBS bonds and calibrate
it to match the observed time series of MBS durations. With this auxiliary model in hand, we then choose the



                                                        69
two parameters to match the price-rate curve in the auxiliary model and the geometric mortgage model.


B.3.1     Step 1: A simple MBS pricing model
Changes in duration of the Barclays MBS index are often driven by changes in the index composition. As
mortgages are prepaid and new ones are issued with different coupons, both the weighted-average-life and
weighted-average-coupon of the Index change significantly. Any model that wants to have a chance at matching
the observed durations must account of these compositional changes.
   For simplicity, we assume that all mortgages are 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. We construct a portfolio of
MBS with remaining maturities ranging from 1 to 360 months. Each month, a fraction of each MBS prepays.
We assume that the prepayment rate is given by a function CP R(c − r) which depends on the “prepayment
incentive” of that particular MBS, defined as the difference between the original coupon rate of that mortgage
and the current mortgage rate. We assume that every prepayment is a refinancing: a dollar of mortgage balance
prepaid result in a dollar of new mortgage balance originated at the new mortgage rate. In addition, each period
an exogenously given amount of new mortgages are originated with a coupon equal to that month’s mortgage
rate to reflect purchase originations (as opposed to refinancing originations).
    In a given month t, each mortgage i has starting balance balti , pays a monthly mortgage pmtit of which intit is
interest and prinit is scheduled principal, where i is the remaining maturity of the mortgage, i.e., the mortgage
was originated at time t − (360 − i) − 1. Denote the unscheduled principal payments, or prepayments, by prpit .
Let SM Mti be the prepayment rate in month t on that mortgage. The evolution equations for actual mortgage
cash flows are:
                                                   ct−(360−i)−1
                                           intit =              × balti
                                                        12
                                         prinit = pmtit − intit
                                         prpit = SM Mti (balti − prinit )
                                          i−1
                                       balt+1 = (1 − SM Mti )(balti − prinit )
                                      pmti−1            i     i
                                         t+1 = (1 − SM Mt )pmtt



The initial payment is given by the standard annuity formula, normalizing the amount borrowed to 1.

The last equation says that the initial balance of new 30-year FRMs is comprised on 1 unit of purchase orig-
inations, an exogenously given flow of originations each period, plus refinancing originations which equal all
prepayments from the previous period.
   Furthermore, at every month t we compute projected cash flows on each mortgage assuming mortgage rates
stay constant from t until maturity i. These projected cash flows follow the same evolution equations as
presented above. Denote these projected cash flows with a tilde over the variable.
   We can then compute the price Pt , (modified) duration Durt , and weighted-average-life W ALt of the MBS

    What remains to be specified is our prepayment model delivering the single-month mortality SM Mti used
above. Following practice, we assume an annual constant prepayment rate (CPR) which is a S-shaped function
of the rate incentive: CP Rti = CP R(rt − ct−(360−i)−1 ):
                                                          
                                                                  exp(ψ(x − x̄)
                                                                                  
                         CP R(x) = CP R + (CP R − CP R) 1 −
                                                               1 + exp(ψ(x − x̄))

The annual CPR implies a monthly SMM SM Mti = f actori × (1 − (1 − (CP Rti )1/12 ). The multiplicative f actori
allows us to deal with slow prepayments early in the life of the mortgage (the “ramp-up” phase) and late in
the life of the mortgage (the “burn-out” phase). For simplicity, we make f actori linearly increasing from 0 in
month 1 (when i = 360) to 1 in month 30, flat at 1 between month 30 and month 180 and     linearly decreasing
back to 0 between months 180 and month 360. We choose the CPR curve parameters CP R, CP R, ψ, x̄ to
minimize the sum of squared errors between the time series of model-implied duration {Durt } and observed
duration on the Barclays index.
    To produce the time-series of model-implied duration {Durt }, we feed in the observed 30-year conventional
fixed rate mortgage rate (MORTGAGE30US in FRED), {rt }. We initialize the portfolio many years before the
start of our time series data to ensure that the model is in steady state by the time our time series for the
Barclays index starts. Specifically, we start the computation in April 1903 by issuing 1 MBS. By March 1933,
we have a complete portfolio of 360 fixed-rate amortizing mortgages, maturing any month from April 1933 to
March 1963.
   The left panel of Figure 6 shows the observed time series of duration on the Barclays MBS index plotted
against the model-implied duration on the MBS pool. The two time series track each other quite closely despite
several strong modeling assumptions. The resulting CPR curve looks close to historical average prepayment
behavior on agency MBS, as prepayment data from SIFMA indicate. CPR is slightly above 40% when the rate
incentive is 200 basis points or more, about 15% when the rate incentive is zero, and slightly above 5% when
the rate incentive is below -200 basis points.


B.3.2     Step 2: Matching MBS pool to perpetual mortgage in our model
With a well-calibrated auxiliary model for a MBS pool, we now proceed to match key features of that auxiliary
model’s MBS pool to the mortgage in our model, which is a geometrically declining perpetuity.
   We start by computing the price P (r) of a fixed-rate MBS with maturity T and coupon c as a function of
the current real MBS rate r, using the constant prepayment rate function CPˆ R(r) = CP R(r − c) obtained from
step 1. For T and c we use the time-series average of the weighted-average maturity and weighted-average real
coupon, respectively, from the model-implied MBS pool obtained in step 1.34
   We can write the steady-state price of a guaranteed geometric mortgage with parameters (δ, F ) and a per-
  34
    To get real mortgage rates from nominal mortgage rates, we subtract realized inflation over the following
year. To get real coupons and MBS rates from real mortgage rates, we subtract 50 bps to account for servicing
and guarantee fees.

   Note that the fee γ in equation 67 is quoted in units of the guaranteed bond’s price. However, in the data
MBS pool we observe a guarantee and servicing fee of approximately 50 bp on average that is charged as a
spread on top of a bond’s yield. During the calibration, we thus need to use the net-of-fees rate for the MBS
pool and the gross-of-fees rate for the geometric bond.
   The stage 2 calibration determines how many units X of the geometric mortgage with parameters (δ, F ) one
needs to sell to hedge one unit of the MBS against parallel shifts in interest rates, across the range of historical

The equality constraint 68 determines the price-fee γ that corresponds to the 50 bps rate-fee. The LHS is
the gross-of-fees mortgage rate and the RHS is the equivalent net-of-fees mortgage rate plus the 50 bps fee35 .
Generally the equivalent price-fee will depend on the level of the price, which is endogenous to the minimization
problem. Thus the constraint determines γ as the equivalent price-fee when the MBS trades at par (with price
1) so that Q = 1/X.
                                                                                              

     The yield of a geometric bond with price Q and duration parameter δ is r = log Q       +δ .

    We estimate values of δ = 0.948, F = 9.910, which implies α = 0.520, and X = 0.1080. For the model
calibration, we only need δ and α. The right panel of Figure 6 shows that the fit is excellent. The average error
is only 0.34% of the MBS pool price.
   In conclusion, despite its simplicity, the perpetual mortgage in the model captures all important features of
real life mortgages (or MBS pools). The relationship between price and interest rate is convex when rates are
high and concave (“negative convexity”) when rates are low, which is when the prepayment option is in the
money. It matches the interest rate risk (duration) of real-life mortgages, for different interest rate scenarios.



C       Computational Solution
The computational solution of the model is implemented using what Judd (1998) calls “time iteration” on the
system of equations that characterizes the equilibrium of the economy defined in appendix section A.4. The
general solution approach for heterogeneous agent models with incomplete markets and portfolio constraints
that we employ in this paper is well described by Kubler and Schmedders (2003).
    The procedure consists of the following steps

    1. Define approximating basis for the unknown functions. The unknown functions of the state
       variables that need to be computed are the set of endogenous objects specified in the equilibrium def-
       inition. These are the prices, agents’ choice variables, and the Lagrange multipliers on the portfolio
       constraints. There is an equal number of unknown functions and nonlinear functional equations. To
       approximate the unknown functions in the space of the two exogenous state variables [Yt , σωt ] and four
       endogenous state variables [AB      R    S
                                      t , Wt , Wt , Gt ], we discretize the state space and use multivariate linear
       interpolation (splines or polynomials of various orders achieved inferior results due to their lack of global
       shape preservation). One endogenous state variable can be eliminated for computational purposes since
       its value is implied by the agents’ budget constraints, conditional on any three other state variables.
       As pointed out by several previous studies such as Kubler and Schmedders (2003), portfolio constraints
       lead to additional computational challenges since portfolio policies may not be smooth functions of state
       variables due to occasionally binding constraints. Hence we cluster grid points in areas of the state space
       where constraints transition from slack to binding, and we test the accuracy of the approximation by
       computing relative Euler equation errors.
    2. Iteratively solve for the unknown functions. Given an initial guess C 0 (S) to compute tomorrow’s
       optimal policies as functions of tomorrow’s states, solve the system of nonlinear equations for the current
       optimal policies at each point in the discretized state space. Expectations are computed using quadrature
       methods. Using the solution vector for current policies, compute the next iterate of the approximation
       C 1 (S) and repeat until convergence. The system of nonlinear equations at each point in the state space
       is solved using a standard nonlinear equation solver. Judd, Kubler, and Schmedders (2002) show how
       Kuhn-Tucker conditions can be rewritten as equality constraints for this purpose.
    3. Simulate the model for many periods using approximated policy functions. To obtain the
       quantitative results, we simulate the model for 10,000 periods after a “burn-in” phase of 500 periods.
       We verify that the simulated time path stays within the bounds of the state space for which the policy
       functions were computed.

   In a long simulation, errors in the nonlinear equations are low. Table 5 reports the median error, the 95th
percentile of the error distribution, the 99th , and 99.5th percentiles.

 The table reports median, 75th percentile, 95th percentile,
 99th percentile, and maximum absolute value errors, eval-
 uated at state space points from a 10,000 period simula-
 tion of the 20 bps g-fee model. The first 13 equations de-
 fine policy functions. They are a subset of the 22 equations
 that define the equilibrium. The last two equations define
 evolutions of risk-taker wealth and government debt, re-
 spectively.

D       Additional Experiments
Our main policy experiment consisted of raising the g-fees. In the main body of the paper, we also reviewed
two alternative experiments. The first changed capital requirements on guaranteed mortgages. The second
considered a legislative proposal to to “put private capital in front of a government guarantee” by limiting
guarantees to losses in excess of 10%. We now study three more policy experiments and compare their welfare
consequences to those in the main policy experiment. The first experiment explores the effect of limited liability.
The next two experiments study alternate ways to make guarantees operative only when losses are catastrophic.
These exercises help to further illuminate the interaction of government guarantees, deposit insurance, and risk
taker leverage.


D.1      Limited Liability
The second alternative policy we consider is one that weakens deposit insurance. The knowledge that they (and
their depositors) will be bailed out by the government if their net worth turns negative leads banks to take
on more risk. We weaken deposit insurance, or equivalently weaken limited liability for banks, by increasing
the mean (µρ ) of the utility penalty that banks incur for insolvency. The third and fourth columns of Table 6
labeled “high µρ ” report the results.
    Many of the effects are similar as for the tighter leverage constraint. Guarantees remain very valuable and
dominate the portfolio, even more so than in the previous experiment. Portfolio delinquency and loss rates are
close to the benchmark low g-fee economy. One big difference to the main experiment is that weaker limited
liability does not lead banks to reduce leverage. Risk taker net worth only increases marginally. Still, this
small increase in net worth, combined with the higher utility cost of bankruptcy is enough to eliminate all
bankruptcies. As a result of the high leverage and government debt, depositors must hold substantial amounts
of safe assets and interest rates are a bit higher than the benchmark model as a result. The real short rate
increases by 2 basis points to 1.15%.
   We find no significant effect on aggregate welfare from this policy. It has an aggregate welfare loss of 0.02%.
Borrowers’ welfare is unaffected and both risk takers and depositors lose slightly. In sum, while increasing
the costs of bank bankruptcy is successful at eliminating bank bankruptcies, it has a small negative aggregate
welfare effect. This demonstrates that intermediary bankruptcies are not the driving force behind our welfare
results. The key issue rather is the underpricing of the guarantee, which is as paramount in this economy as in
the low g-fee benchmark.


D.2      Catastrophic Insurance
Columns 6 and 7 of Table 6 report results for a catastrophic insurance policy which “kicks in” at losses of
5%. Welfare increases are smaller than when the private sector loss is capped at 10% (+0.56% vs +0.67%).
This increase in welfare is smaller than that from a complete phase-out. Thus the largest welfare gains are
obtained when the private sector bears enough losses to reduce its risk taking, but not so much as to debilitate
its intermediation function which is important to achieve the best distribution of aggregate risk in the economy.
    The last two columns of Table 6 report results for a catastrophic insurance experiment in which losses
are capped at 10% but where the insurance is offered at a much lower price of 5 bp instead of the 20bp
discussed in the main text. This policy has higher welfare gains of +0.69%, compared to +0.67% for the
20bp catastrophic guarantee and +0.63% for the full phase-out. The main difference with the more expensive
catastrophic guarantee is that because the guarantee is cheaper (and closer to the actuarially fair cost of 2bp),
risk takers are much more likely to purchase it. This protects them better to unexpected catastrophic shocks
than in the 20bp JC economy. It further improves risk sharing and raises interest rates.

  The table reports unconditional means and standard deviations of the main outcome variables from a 10,000 period
  simulation of four different models. The first two columns are the benchmark model from Table 2. The next two
  columns have a higher mean utility cost of default µρ . The model in columns 6 and 7 report results for an economy
  where the government offers catastrophic insurance i.e. guarantees only losses in excess of 5%. The last 2 columns
  report results for a catastrophic insurance economy where the attachment point is 10%, like in Table 4, but at a
  lower price of 5 bp.
  a
    : Return on wealth is the return on the risk takers total portfolio i.e. their positive position in mortgages and
  negative position in deposits. Return on wealth is computed by excluding simulation periods when risk takers
  declare bankruptcy.
